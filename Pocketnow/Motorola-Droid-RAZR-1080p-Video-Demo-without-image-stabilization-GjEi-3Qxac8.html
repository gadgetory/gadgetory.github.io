this is another 1080p HD video sample
from the motorola droid razr it is 1080p
that is bumped up from the default the
stock which is 720p still very good but
when we recorded it before a lot of
feedback came from you guys saying why
is it shaking wise its swimming why is
it doing all this weird stuff and it was
doing weird stuff I admit so that's why
we're doing this video again I suspect
the weird stuff was because we had video
stabilization or image stabilization on
and we were doing some close-ups
close-ups of this about 8 inches away
there so we're testing to see if that
wavy or swimming this was because of the
image stabilization in which case i
think the image stabilization is more
for distant shots like this to try and
take the wobbles there are some
intentional wobbles I take the wobbles
out of distance shots and if so then pay
it should be great but close up you need
to keep that in mind so that'll be an
interesting thing to find out the camera
on this is really good you guys have
said that you really like the audio on
it the video other than the wobbliness
seemed okay except the autofocus at
close up so I'm kind of doing some
distance shots here so you can see how
it looks go ahead and look up here at
the sky or we can get a little bit of
contrast between the cloudy sky and the
trees up there
and this is right next to a road we've
got a neighbor next door Mona lon so you
can see how it how it sounds have audio
sounds in a real-world scenario in a
situation where you're going to have
some ambient noise the phone is being
held about 10-12 inches away from my
face just kind of a half arm's length so
I can have a little bit more stability
but overall so far still looking really
good a little bit lighter excuse me it's
a little bit darker lighting today then
the last video that we shot so we'll see
how that plays into things as well a
little bit of haze up on top of the
mountains up there but yeah let's go
ahead and compare this if you haven't
watched that previous video make sure
you watch that so you can see what we're
talking about with the swimming us and
see if it's gone away with this one do
another close-up here so we can see if
it's still swimming in close-ups or not
but watch that video see what we're
talking about come back and watch this
one and see if this is any better and
then let us all know your opinions in
the comments down below if you would
that would be fantastic even still with
the swimming this and what not it's
still a fabulous phone little bit of
snow there how about that welcome to
utah a wonderful foam wonderful camera i
think all you guys will agree if not let
us know and let us know why in the
comments again showing off the 1080p
video recording capabilities of the
motorola droid razr for pocket now I'm
