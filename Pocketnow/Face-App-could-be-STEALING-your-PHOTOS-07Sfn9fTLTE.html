engaged but there's a possibility that
it's stealing your photos and not for a
good cause
it looks like the asou sorrow gee phone
- we'll have monster specifications in a
very impressive display and the stories
of how Apple components get leaked sound
clearly like something out of a
Hollywood movie I'm high metal Iveta and
the happy emoji day which speaks to what
2019 is like more than anything this is
parking out daily the official news
today began with deals after prime they
and this is a really irresistible one if
you're in the market for a samsung
galaxy right now Best Buy has the galaxy
s 10a which is probably my favorite one
$400 off and I am not joking it's a $350
price tag for the phone but there's a
catch it has to be on either AT&amp;amp;T or
Sprint
obviously there are activation fees that
around 40 bucks but still my god that
deal is crazy and there's such a good
phone you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about
Instagram is another thing that speaks
to 2019 is the fact that a lot of people
are on it and well there's obviously
some hints of depression for people that
don't get the amount of likes that
others do and stuff like that and the
company wants to try something new
Instagram started testing how the market
would behave when removing the option to
see the amount of likes that a post gets
and the Crees social pressure it started
back in Canada in May and now it's
expanding to Australia Brazil Ireland
Italy Japan and New Zealand they're also
rolling out a warning when a comment may
be harmful and ask you if you want it
deleted you know what I actually like
this approach because truly my god some
commenters are crazy but yeah we'll see
if that ends up extending or not because
obviously there's the catch that a lot
of people want to know how many likes
have photo has in order to see if it's
important or not now let's talk about
Apple and leaks obviously we get leaks
all the time we cover them and Apple is
famous ever since the iPhone 4 things
have gone crazy particularly because of
the how the company handled them and
with the iPhone 5c they only got more
calm
as a result Apple got a new product
security team to supervise their most
sensitive supplies in China the security
team which are from the US military have
found many hiding places for components
over the years including dirty mop water
belt buckles tissue boxes bras and the
most notorious one they started digging
a tunnel under heavy machinery and had
components there yeah for those of you
wondering how all these components get
leaked and how information emerges and
where the information comes from yeah
this looks like the Shawshank Redemption
and for those of you that don't know
what that movie is you should totally
watch it and you know what even if we
covered yesterday how certain
specifications for the Samsung Galaxy
Note 10 might be disappointing it seems
that that won't all be the case see the
company has started mass production of
their new 10 nanometer lpddr4 12
gigabyte mobile DRAM chips ahead of the
no tens launch they're aimed for premium
black ships and built optimized for 5g
and AI applications it is approximately
1.3 times faster than the previous
lpddr4 X the rate of 50 500 megabits per
second obviously we can't guarantee that
it's coming to the node 10 but usually
samsung announces things and then they
come in their next product and we know
what their next product is now let's
talk about the Asaro G phone - you know
the first one didn't really impress me
but the second one I mean we've been
covering leaks for the past few days now
it's being stratified by Tina and we get
more information first of all the 120
Hertz display will be a six point five
nine inch AMOLED panel yes I said Emel
it and it packs a 5800 milliamp hour
battery obviously to power the solet all
with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 plus
and yes July 23rd is just around the
corner which has me wondering are we
really getting that no.10 without that
processor and the ROG phone with it
that's so weird
and finally the hottest dish do they
have to do with the face app yes right
now it's gone completely viral everybody
is doing it you see photos of people
turning old which is funny because you
usually see more men doing it than women
which says a lot but you might want to
think twice before using it see a senate
leader has already asked the FTC and the
FBI to investigate the russian app
yes because it is a Russian app as
you're giving them a picture of you and
you're also giving them access to your
camera roll concerns include the fact
that the application may steal your
camera roll or the images you upload and
sell them as stock photos or be used for
ads in Russia so far several researchers
have looked into the matter but no
evidence has been found on the company
practicing this but it's very easy to do
so sadly so beware the company actually
claims that they keep your photo for 48
hours and then delete it but there's
obviously no way to confirm this
so in today's question let us do I mean
obviously the virality of this is cool
and everything but what do you think
about these services cuz obviously we
use the service for this thumbnail just
to make it funny but the thing about it
is I was reluctant to give it a try
because it's not the first time that
I've seen companies use these filters
and we're not exactly sure what they do
with the photos and then we just spent
like the last couple of hours talking
about cases and everything and then they
appear in my Amazon search feed because
I have an echo right there so I got it's
creepy times let us know what you do or
how you see this in the comments down
below
obviously I will admit I'm skeptical and
guys I do this for a living
