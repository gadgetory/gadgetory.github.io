for a quick hands on samsung quarter
results reveal that the company is doing
somewhat better and remember that
Nintendo game that we teased yesterday
yeah forget about it I'm high Meadow
iveta and it seems that the next time
we'll be happy about a mobile game it'll
be another angry bird sequel this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Samsung as the company
has just the provided its quarter
results so far well six percent in
growth when it comes to revenue up to 45
billion dollars in its equivalent in
Korean currency and in addition to that
well the company has also grown almost
twenty percent when it comes to profit
which is crazy up to 6.5 billion these
are all great news but the most
interesting part is that Samsung
handsets haven't really shipped more
they've actually shipped less so this
says a lot about the company let's see
how the company performs going forward
with its feature launches and sadly
there is nothing newsworthy about
Nintendo's first mobile game but doing
so because I have to follow up on
yesterday's news the game is called me
tomo and it's an avatar game the whole
purpose here is for you to sort of like
share the information you want to share
with friends and a sort of like interest
social network but no it's not super
mario kart or a new version of Zelda
it's nothing that people will go crazy
about and you'll have to wait for it
until March 2016 which is even worse and
for those of you that like Huawei's a
smartphone designs this year which we do
but hate its user experience and
interface which we do too well we kind
of notice that up to the point where the
company is just hired Abigail Brody
which is famous for being one of apple's
major design gurus for a lot of things
particularly the first generation iphone
OS 10 apples high end applications like
aperture and final cut pro this is
really great news this brings a lot of
highlight to Huawei's future when it
comes to a TX we really can't wait to
see what they come up with and it seems
that apple doesn't really want
developers tinkering with the whole 3d
touch technology on the iPhone you
remember that plum ohmmeter application
where you can measure
on an iPhone well Apple has just
rejected a gravity application on the
grounds that well it doesn't have a
category for weighing applications
because it seems that it wasn't
considering you know the iphone success
and three need touch to be used for this
even though it can be used for this so
rather ought to see that Apple is doing
this they're just removing usefulness
from the iphone but then again whenever
people want to weigh a suitcase it kind
of makes sense for them not to want to
do this and finally the hot news today
have to do with the much-anticipated 1
plus X which is the budget-minded
operating from one plus if you measure
the two hundred fifty dollar price tag
and the Snapdragon 801 but that's just
about it we're talking about gorilla
glass in the front and the back in a
very neat design in addition to a 5-inch
1080p oled display we've got three gigs
of ram 16 gigs of expandable storage and
just got everything else about this
phone is rather cool starting with its
design yeah this is really not a
budget-minded phone when you look at it
but then it leads me to the question of
the day now they've got the oneplus X
and the one plus two which one would you
pick out of the two in my case I would
just steer to the 1+2 mainly because of
the fingerprint scanner but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends as always you know
the drill if you want to get the news
