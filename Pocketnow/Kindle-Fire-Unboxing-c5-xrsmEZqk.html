pocketnow.com and today we're doing an
unboxing the kindle fire which just
showed up I apologize for the audio
quality but I'm not in my normal studio
to record this so sit back relax and
enjoy the show so the kindle fire is the
new tablet from amazon and it is a 7
inch device running a dual core
processor 512 megs of ram in the box
we've got a charger it's attached to the
walmart is not removable and then other
than that inside the box here there's a
whole lot of nothing this really worry
free packaging there are some getting to
know your kindle instructions here which
we will try they get out and now here
you go it just tells you how to turn it
on how unlock it not really anything to
speak of product information so let's go
ahead and get this plastic peeled off
and take another look at the device a
little closer so it's a big thick black
slab of a tablet here down at the bottom
we've got the headphone jack the micro
USB port and the power button which was
glowing green when i first popped it out
it's booted itself up as you can see
here on the top we've got two speakers
and then on the sides and there's
nothing else it's just very very
minimalistic in the view you've got the
screen here there's no touch buttons
across the bottom two capacitive buttons
that's all done by software is it more
just as a holding point there is a
sensor up here we'll make sure to
determine what that that sensor is so if
we just swipe across then it unlocks
device and we can see it's got asking is
for a Wi-Fi which we will enter in just
a minute I'm just going to just pick a
random one here and then it's going to
want to step us through the
configuration so we'll do this real
quick and then we'll come right back so
here are at the welcome screen and it's
showing us what we're going to do it is
good of a kin to what the original
kindle looked like when you first pull
down the box is just gonna head a button
to press
had some really neat instructions on
here this is a really nice layout I
really appreciate the fact that most the
people that are going to get this device
or probably not going to understand
Android or iPad or anything like that
and this will really help them get
started with working with the system so
it's talking about the carousel here and
we're just going to go ahead and tap
through this and so here's our carousel
there's not very much content on here
yet because we haven't looked at
anything but we'll come back to that
later in the software of you and then
we've got our kind of it moves up and
down here to put items down use add to
favorites and now it's in this list here
and remove it just tap and hold compared
hardwired wise to the HTC Flyer from
t-mobile really the Flyers just a little
bit thicker it looks like a little
longer for the same screen size will
cover that more in the hardware review
as well so we tap up here on the upper
right hand corner then we get access to
the volume there is no volume key so you
have to use this volume slider up and
down the brightness so we can go take up
the full brightness down to minimal
brightness and it's got a pretty good
range of brightness their Wi-Fi
synchronization a few more options here
in the more settings there's that home
button if I tap over on this side I
believe nothing happens alright so let's
go back over here to our our menu down
here is our home button our back button
the menu button apparently as well let's
go ahead and here like pulse you can see
the menu button appeared and search as
well got the pulse instructions up so
we'll be looking at this a little more
closely over the next couple of days and
posting some more video content so if
you have any questions or comments leave
them below otherwise thanks for watching
