get enough of its speed well how do we
accomplish that we can do that either
with speeding things up in this case
we're talking about processors so we can
make them go faster or we can have more
of them that's today's topic for the
android guy weekly all right so like the
other episodes let's get some
terminology and vocabulary out of the
way a CPU is a central processing unit
it's the part of a computer or a
smartphone because really those are
computers these days or even a tablet
that processes instructions now the term
for it is CPU another term for it these
days is a core we'll get to some
differences there in just a minute so
what this does is it processes
instructions from programs or from apps
the launcher being one a screen tap
might be one instruction a a
pinch-to-zoom might be another
instruction go get my email might be
another instruction answer this phone
call so so those are instructions they
all get processed through in fact there
might be dozens of instructions for each
one of those tasks we don't want to go
into too much detail here we want to
basically make everything faster right
everybody's about speed they want things
done instantly super fast okay great how
can we make things faster so let's go
back to what I just said I want to get
that incoming call I want to pinch to
zoom I want to check my email check my
Facebook check my Twitter maybe upload
something to YouTube all at the same
time this is all happening in the
background on my smart phone great that
means there's a long line of
instructions waiting to be processed
through the CPU how can I make that
faster all right time for an analogy you
ready for this okay
let's say you are getting on a subway
now this subway has just one car the
train is just one car long and it only
has one door and there's 100 seats
inside of it so far you with me okay now
what's gonna happen is we need to get a
hundred people through that door into
that subway and off to the next stop
where everybody's
gonna get back off again still with me
all right a hundred instructions or a
hundred people in this case that's
that's a long line you're gonna be
waiting for a while to load up that
subway car so how can we improve that
how can we make it faster well first of
all why don't we make that door wider so
that people can get into the subway car
a little bit quicker if the door is too
narrow you know if some big guy like me
is trying to get through the door well
it's gonna take a little bit longer you
know for whatever reason to get through
then some smaller person a skinny person
a child for example it's gonna take
longer so we can make the door wider now
that would be like the bandwidth to the
processor okay how wide is that
throughput how wide is that that channel
to get into the processor we can change
that the next thing that we can do of
course we can make the subway faster so
once everybody's loaded up it gets from
point A to point B a lot quicker okay so
that's that's cool we can do that to an
extent but eventually we run into some
complications like well if we go too
fast the subways gonna jump the rails
maybe crash into the side of the tunnel
not good okay so there's a there's a
theoretical maximum that we can go
before we have to redesign the whole
subway system to make that work all
right so we can kind of do that we've
maxed out our speed there what's
something else we can do let's put in
another door so now there's a door at
the front and a door at the back great
that door at the back that's our other
core by the way or hang on to that we'll
call that a hyper thread because we're
still going into the same car all right
so you've got the door in the front the
door in the back now those hundred
people they can get in two lines and in
those two lines they can go in they're
still going into the same car and now we
can get the processes through twice as
fast right but there's a little bit of a
caveat there what happens if you have a
family who's getting on you might not
want to split up you and your wife or
your kids into the two separate lines
back you might have some people who have
to get on after other people say a
mother
and father want to get on before their
kids to make sure that all of their kids
are there or maybe you have the dab get
in first the kids and then the mom get
in at that the last to make sure that
all the kids got on okay that makes
sense you don't want to split them up
then put them at the other door
well computer tasks are the same way
there are some processes some
instructions that have to be run in a
specific order
you can't split those up easily between
two cores so you just kind of bundle
them together into a single thread in
that one line okay still with me all
right
what's something else that we can do
well we can add another car in this case
that would be another core and in this
case we're gonna put you know two doors
and it one in the front and one in the
back so now we have four lines we can
get a whole bunch of people in there
even if the the cars are smaller if the
cars are only 50 people each well we
still have a hundred in that train and
now we have four ways to get in we can
get into people really really fast and
then of course if we keep it at the same
capacity or the same clock speed we can
fit 200 people in the same space and
just get a lot more people moving okay
so there's our analogy it's all laid out
and then we got kind of that all
understood right okay now let's apply
that to smart phones and tablets and
computers so I've got a smart phone okay
this smart phone is a dual-core
smartphone that means it can run two
processors at the same time but it's all
on the same chip there's kind of a
problem there okay once we put those two
subway cars on the track it takes twice
as much energy to pull those cars down
the track right same thing with a
dual-core phone or having two processors
in a phone essentially you're doubling
again theoretically you're doubling your
your processing power but you're also
doubling your energy requirements if
they will completely discrete CPUs
completely separate chips that would
most likely be true there would be some
advantages of that hey increased speed
being one because you know that you've
got two processors to push instructions
through you don't have to wait as long
so in the screen might be able to be off
for a longer amount of time which will
save you some power and some other
things like that but you're a
to get the processes in and down and
through and it's great but that battery
back there it's only so big
once your battery's gone you're gone and
having an extra processor and there
might be a problem
well dual core chips kind of negate that
not entirely but to a certain extent
you're essentially adding more
transistors to one chip which is going
to take more power but it's not going to
take as much power as if you had two
separate chips so there's the question
and really the topic for this edition of
the Android guy weakly how many cores do
we need well for a long time I had a
single core processor you probably did
too unless you just jumped into the
Android world today most of the phones
out there up until about a year ago
maybe a little bit more were single core
and they work just fine because well
it's a phone it's not all that
complicated there's not a lot of
processing that we do on it we don't do
a lot of heavy lifting with them now
compared to computers of yesteryear you
have we do but in general the operating
systems are lightweight they're
intelligent these are risk sir so we
have reduced instruction sets
we just really grease the wheels to get
things in and through the processor and
on their way so that the phones feel
fast and for the most part they do and
that's great when you get multiple cores
inside of a phone you're just greasing
the wheels even more as long as your
operating system supports it Android Ice
Cream Sandwich does honeycomb kind of
does Gingerbread not so much Froyo it
was yeah we're not even gonna talk about
throw you all right
but dual core it works great I love it
it doesn't really impact the battery
that much I get about the same life out
of this phone as I did on my g2 which is
really really kind of cool you know this
being so much faster and a bigger screen
and yeah so cool the battery is a little
bit bigger too but we're not going to
talk about batteries today so let's get
back to course so that's my smartphone
next up I have 7.7
inch tablet now this tablet I do the
same things than I do on my phone now on
my phone I don't play a lot of games
well not really in depth intense games I
could but I don't I don't do a lot of
heavy lifting I don't do video editing I
don't do audio editing I don't do really
processor intensive stuff it's just
normal stuff and it runs through just as
fast as I needed to it's great well I do
the same things over here the only
difference that I have is well the
screens bigger so I need a bigger
battery and I don't use this for phone
calls now I do some video chat and
whatnot on Google Chat but that's kind
of not the point because I use my phone
for voice calls more essentially that's
a big smart phone okay until we talk
about 10-inch tablets okay so here's a
Motorola Xoom it's 10-inch very very
similar in size battery life and whatnot
to the Apple iPad now this is where
things get interesting right now in both
the Apple camp and the Android camp and
we don't know so much about the Windows
camp until Windows 8 comes out but we'll
we'll reserve judgment on that for later
these are essentially just big smart
phones without the phone and that's so
one of the things that I joked about
when the iPad first came out it's just
like the iPhone but bigger and without
the phone and it was of course that's
oversimplifying and it's being more
humorous than anything but that's
essentially true the apps are
essentially the same of course they're
designed a little bit differently to
take advantage of the bigger screen but
there's not a lot that you can do on a
tablet that you can't do on a smart
phone whether it's Apple or Android now
we're starting to see that change okay
and let me kind of a well skip past that
a little bit video editing for example
you can't do much of it a little bit
sure but you can't do a lot on an iPad
or even on an Android powered tablet but
again 10.1 inch right I've got a laptop
behind me that's 11 inches it's a
netbook it's got a dual core processor
in it
this has a dual core dual core dual core
all right so we've got all these dual
core machines my laptop I do video
editing on it's got a bunch of RAM it's
got a relatively large harddrive 128 gig
SSD which isn't huge but compared to
what I have in my tablet you know it's
about four times the amount but I can do
video editing on it it's big enough it's
got a keyboard I've got a mouse that
goes with it I can do video adding it
takes a long time to do video editing
hence why I have a desktop computer
that's a quad core with hyper threading
so it looks like eight again
I can do so much more stuff or the same
amount of stuff so much faster depending
on how you look at it because of the
many cores so how much is enough and how
much is too much and how much is not
enough here's my thoughts hey but this
is your part of the show use the
comments down below you can use my my
comments and I'm gonna tell you right
now and either rebut those or agree with
those or disagree with those share your
thoughts with everybody else who's
watching ok single core dual core a
single core on a smartphone a very basic
entry-level one I think is fine I don't
think that's a problem and we've seen
that in the past on a higher-end phone
especially with bigger screens and
high-definition screens like we talked
about in the last episode dual core
absolutely no doubt ok then we get into
our small tablets small tablets dual
core absolutely must single core pass
them up if it doesn't have a single core
or if it has a single core if it doesn't
have at least dual core pass that puppy
up
big tablets ok 10 inch maybe even above
when we get those that's where your
tablet stops being a tablet or a big
smartphone and it starts being a small
computer you team it up with a keyboard
you team it up with you know whatever
else to make it more productive however
you need to do that at that point it's
less a smart phone and more a computer
that's where dual-core absolutely
quad-core probably okay and I might even
say definitely once we get some apps
that take advantage of multiple cores or
that require multiple cores you're going
to get to a point where you can't run
some of these apps on a smartphone or
even a small tablet because they just
don't have enough processing power in
them
that's where bigger batteries come into
play with the larger tablets and where
those multiple cores 4/8 who knows how
many are really gonna come into play and
at that point you can truly replace your
laptop computer
maybe someday your desktop computer with
a tablet as long as it's got the right
peripherals to do it you need them to do
so those are my thoughts now it's your
turn like I said agree with them
disagree with them host your own justify
them and help everybody else who's
watching this understand how you use
your smartphone in your small tablet and
your big tablet or if you don't have all
three which one do you have what do you
use how many cores do you think is
enough how many of you think is ideal
how many who think is too much let us
know down in the comments and of course
if you've got somebody who disagrees
with you bring them on over to
