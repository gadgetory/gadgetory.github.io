are not funny fire your writer how am I
supposed to fire myself buddy he says we
bet I like a little to leave it hahahaha
that's not bad and you actually
forgotten our I can't watch the video
ever well let's do something you send me
your computer I'll fix it for you but I
can't promise i'll send it back that's
right it's that time of the week I am hi
Mary Vera this is pocket now and this is
our pocket now daily recap for last week
so when when they ask you what do you
think about HTC's upgrade policies the
news were about HTC confirming to HTC
One X customers that they were not
getting Android 4.4 KitKat on their
phones even for the one x+ and we have
423 comments out of which Cameron
Cummington says buy an iPhone and you
don't have to worry as much about
software updates and it's kind of true
even if you're not getting the full iOS
7 on the iphone 4 you're still getting
iOS 7 why couldn't we get something like
that on old HTC devices like for example
even if it's not the full kit kat
certain features would be cropped out
but it still would be KitKat that
another commoner says HTC One X users
whining about not getting updated to 4.4
kitkat try the LG optimus G and get
stuck on 4.1 point2 forever and he has
LG has a terrible reputation in that
department then lodestar 17 says LOL
just like what they did with a desire HD
after that I never bought HTC phones and
I love your avatar number one and number
two yes that's the reason why I actually
moved away from HTC phones for a while
then on Tuesday I asked you what would
you like for the google nexus 10 to
include the rumors were of a new render
of a Samsung made Google Nexus 10 after
the renders of Anna Sue's made Google
Nexus 10 both being very terrible we
have 226 comments out of which or
modified seno says man you're wrong with
the Nexus 10 league evilly kragh move
the tweet because it turned out to be a
hoax and yes this would be actually the
second time that a su sleek recently was
also a hoax we don't really know I mean
we do assume that it's going to be made
by samsung but again we don't really
know if it's gonna happen or not then
tech been 505 says Nexus 10 with huge
storage that's probably one of the
biggest deals with the whole new
resolution of the Nexus 10 one of the
biggest problems was the fact that you
did have a little bit storage for so
much resolution and application the new
sure Quran says 4k Nexus 10 now and we
already had a 2k Nexus 10 and it was
perfect you couldn't see pixels so hmm
then on Wednesday ask you how big is
security for you the news were about
this new black phone being a phone
that's dedicated to security and
actually only security we have a hundred
ninety four comments out of which dan
Reed says everything can be hacked and
you can build it they can break it and
that's
true actually I really don't get the
point about this black bone it's cool
for you to buy a phone with more
features than just security but then
again just buying the phone for security
it's kind of odd but Johanna Costas s
security is important but not enough to
buy a new phone I'd rather install VPN
and that's true i mean that's like
buying a car without a spare tire there
are certain things that are just
supposed to be basic and in the same
realm I mean smartphones were designed
originally for businesses and therefore
that should be included in the box not
something you'd buy a phone for then Lex
says a phone that cannot be hacked by
the NSA really are there people that are
stupid enough to believe in this and I'm
not gonna comment on that one but you've
got a solid point then on Thursday I
asked you why do you think it's taken so
long for Windows Phone to take off the
news were about Microsoft's possible
buyout of OEMs for 1 billion dollars to
get new phones in the Microsoft
executive saying that they hadn't done
that we have 280 7 comments out of which
one of them says the people who hate the
Metro UI most probably are those that
don't know how to use it right and hema
for at least once in your lifetime make
a video where you don't complain about
Windows Phones smiley face and okay so
what's wrong with the Metro UI and the
way to use it so you're kind of saying
that I have to hold the phone upside
down to use it right or how can you
actually use it wrong I'm trying to get
that that peter griffin says windows
phone boring and not enough apps simple
and yet family guy always gets it right
but to be honest with you the apps are
they're the ones that we want are there
now but the problem is again the Metro
you are has become a little stale and
boring because there's a lot of
functionality in facebook that's no
longer available on the people up for
example so there are reasons why Windows
Phone 8.1 needs to be a dramatic
overhaul in another cometer says I like
Windows Phone 8 fine but it's an app
world now each time a new exciting app
comes to iOS first and later to Android
that it's maybe Windows Phone 8 and that
is so true it's really annoying to see
that everything launches everywhere else
first and then on Windows Phone that's
something that shouldn't be then finally
on Friday I asked you if you were
getting the wooden Moto X for just an
extra 25 bucks the news were about
motorola and now launching the service
with just $25 of premium for a wooden
Moto X and not a hundred dollars like
they were originally doing and we have
20
49 comments out of which Peter the l
tech guy says a regular Moto X is good
enough and I do agree with that I am
skeptical but that's really because I
have not used the wood Moto X I would be
wrong to tell you that I don't like the
phone yeah of course I like a wooden
phone I just don't know if I would pay
to have a wooden phone when there are so
many other color options what is not
necessarily the best thing for me but
that's my opinion the female and says
could last if you drop test just make
sure you don't overclock it because it
might catch fire man this is like the
most hilarious comment of the week I've
idea I imagine a wooden phone Catching
Fire that's going to be odd and the
soldier 2.0 says the question of that
they should have been did you pay the a
hundred dollars extra for the wood Moto
X and are you mad bro and yeah the
question is those of you that paint a
hundred dollars wise Motorola and I'm
giving you back your money I mean hey 25
bucks is a dramatic change for more
wooden options then you order it leave

about it thats it for our pocket I'll
