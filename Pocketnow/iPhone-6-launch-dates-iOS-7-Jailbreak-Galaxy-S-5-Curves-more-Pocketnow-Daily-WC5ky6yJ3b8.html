point to an early launch in 2014 I was
someone finally gets yelled broken even
though there is a catch and Samsung is
clearly cheaping out on their galaxy
commercials I'm primarily that I am
please raise your hand who wants my
amazon wishlist for christmas this is
PocketNow daily listeners they offered
some official news as iOS 7 has finally
been jailbroken yet evasion is working
for pretty much every device that's
compatible with iOS 7 but there is a
catch as sadly even though you can
jailbreak your device Cydia is not yet
compatible for it so even though you
will be able to hack your phone you
pretty much won't be able to install
anything or at least nothing that's
actually compelling so anyways lecture
description for the procedure and let us
know if you're still doing it and
speaking of Apple if you are planning on
jailbreaking your device apparently iOS
7.1 will not be ready until March it
seems the changes are quite significant
up to the point where Apple needs more
time to build this and we really need
this update as many of us are having
issues with our iPhones getting recept
like if we were jailbroken but aside
from that seems that Apple is apparently
planning to launch their next-generation
iphone earlier seems that they're
planning on doing a WWDC launch just
like they did with the iphone 4 which
kind of makes sense since galaxy phones
get announced in May and we do know that
Apple is kind of getting desperate there
and speaking of Nokia and it's
Moneypenny codename smartphone well
we've got some screenshots from the
phone and yes it is confirmed that we
are getting the software buttons and not
the capacitive buttons that we currently
have on Windows Phone devices so expect
that for Windows Phone 8.1 but even more
interesting is that apparently this will
be a dual sim phone which doesn't
necessarily mean a good thing because
this is popular in emerging markets and
in Asia but not of the United States so
let's see how that goes hopefully it
won't be a Asia only phone now let's
talk about Samsung is we've always
praised the company for their marketing
of Galaxy devices and that is just about
to end we talked last week about the
company cutting down their costs on
marketing and apparently we're just
seeing the first results of that as
we've got this ad for the galaxy gear of
this guy hitting on a girl with all the
features of his Galaxy gear in the
ad is so badly made so terribly produced
that has just become a very big viral
video on YouTube and I don't know if
they did that on purpose or what but
it's just so bad that please links in
the description watch the video and
laugh with us it's kind of worth it and
Samson definitely needs to get their act
together and finally for the interesting
news of the day we've got the internet
full of mock-ups of the galaxy s5 with a
curved display but some interesting
reports from some trusted sources
apparently linked to the fact that the
company is not planning on launching a
curve display on the galaxy s apparently
they're planning on making something
more like the note 3 and it seems that
the curve design is going to be left for
the end of the year which is the time
when the note 4 is going to be launched
so it seems that the note 4 is gonna be
the next foe with a curve display so
let's hope they get this one right but
anyways that makes me see the question
of the day how important is a curb
display for you on your next purchase is
that something you will be looking for
because in my particular case I am
getting the note 4 but curve display or
not that's just me but leave us a
comment down below what are your plans
and friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video spell machine follow us on talking
out comment subscribe to youtube channel
as well he also follow me on Twitter
Jaime underscored iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hey Matt I mean that I thank
you very much for watching we will see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
