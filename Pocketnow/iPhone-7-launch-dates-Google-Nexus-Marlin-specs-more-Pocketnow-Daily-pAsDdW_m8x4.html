time we should expect the possible
launch more insight on the Google Nexus
Marlin talks about specs and what to
expect and Android nugen has begun to
reach OEM devices in beta I'm hina
Ravenna and I miss you guys too I'm
sorry the Galaxy Note seven coverage was
crazy but let's get back to this this is
walking out daily it's funny when i read
complaints about having deals as the
first segment of the news think about it
what could be more awesome right now
there is this deal on ebay for the
google nexus 5x two hundred dollars and
i did not get that price tag wrong i
know this is the cool part about getting
deals this one is kind of unbeatable
other official news come from LG this
time with android 70 nougat as g5 users
have already begun receiving the beta
for this new version of android now
obviously this is a closed beta that's
happening only in korean apparently it's
only available to two thousand users but
the cool thing is this is what i love
about LG people complain about their
software and i just love that this
company is really good about software
updates I've got some very interesting
images showing us the new Fitbit charge
to and the new Fitbit flex I've been a
Fitbit user for years mainly I use the
search for running and I use the Flex
for regular days and I love how
everything syncs we cannot deny that
this is pretty much the company that has
the best-selling wearables out there and
apparently the new designs will allow a
very interesting thing which is a
waterproofing and I mean waterproofing
meaning you can swim at these things
which is something that a lot of people
have asked for so stay tuned apparently
this should happen very soon now let's
will the spotlight over to the iphone 7
this is very interesting as we've got
the schedules leaked for employees from
AT&amp;amp;T and listen to this one apparently
pre-orders for the iphone 7 might start
on sep tember 9 and apparently September
23rd is when devices will arrive we know
that an AT&amp;amp;T historically since the
first generation iphone this is blackout
time nobody gets vacations nobody gets
tazed off so apparently these are the
dates and we cannot wait to see what
apple pulls out here and finally the
very interesting news that they have to
do with the HTC nexus google marlin I
love that combination of names it sounds
so terrible
apparently we've got leaked
specifications from benchmarks we are
looking into snapdragon 820 quad HD
display for gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage and judging by the historical
nexus way of handling things apparently
that won't be expandable so we were
expecting something new but it seems
that the Snapdragon 823 is not going to
be available it seems that six gigs of
RAM or just available in the exon 7 and
others apparently companies are wanting
to keep things under this standard for
this year which is okay but hey it leads
me to the question of the day do you
mind the fact that Google is no longer
pushing the bar with Nexus
specifications even on the higher tier
in my case I am because a true the good
thing about nexus devices as you get
stock Android in addition to a very
decent price tag but I mean the price
difference between the higher-end Nexus
and the higher-end other devices is not
really that significant leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
