with the battery of the Galaxy S 9 the
huawei mate ten in the United States
kind of gets official as we hear from
the company's leadership and even if he
didn't really care about the Apple
earpods now it's not a good time to buy
I'm hi Natalie that I went to watch the
last Jedi yesterday and I could totally
watch it again and I think you should
too this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for the HTC u 11 and there
are a ton of reasons why you should the
phone is currently available for $50 off
and there's actually a $35 coupon in
addition to a couple of other gifts now
bear in mind the HTC u 11 is not
necessarily the best phone of the year
but everything that it has it has really
well you can learn more on description
now I was never really a fan of Apple's
ear pods mainly because of the fit and
the price tag and I feel that there are
better options out there from Samsung
with the icon X or from Jabra with their
elite lineup but if you're in the market
for them I highly suggest you wait
apparently there is a refresh coming
next year not exactly sure when but it
sure makes it you know compelling to
wait given the fact that the air pods
are not necessarily perfect as well the
spotlight over to the Huawei may 10 pro
actually my review unit arrived a few
days ago and I can't tell you enough how
much I liked this phone if you want to
get the phone in the United States we
now hear from the company's CEO that
carriers will be announced at CES 2018
so stay tuned we will be covering that
live and for those of you that scratch
our heads over why Samsung waits so long
for a newer version of Android on their
phones it seems that the Oreo beta has
now spread to more countries the full
list is in the description
obviously in addition to Oreo where
there are some updates that do make it
compelling to stick to the galaxy s 8
even though the galaxy as a 9 is around
the corner and judging by the way
Samsung does things it seems we'll have
to wait until that phone launches for
the current wants to get the full
version of Oreo and finally the very
interesting news today have to do again
with Samsung this time with the Galaxy S
9 those of you that want to know details
on specifications again we have renders
we have possible dates for February now
we hear about specs apparently 3200
milliamp hours in the battery of the
galaxy
nine barely a six percent growth and in
the case of the s nine plus we still
don't have details
it's rather concerning as samsung
devices are not necessarily the best
when it comes to battery life so it
leads me to the question today do you
think that Samsung should stop being so
conservative about batteries like sure
we got the picture with the whole case
of the Galaxy Note seven or do you think
that it's good for the company to
continue in this direction in my case
Samsung I know you figured your problems
out and I just want better battery life
however you figure that out leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends if you want to get
the news earlier follow us on poking out
our common hit that subscribe button up
here for more videos like this one you
know watch yesterday's pocket out daily

down here you can also follow me on
