committed to a future galaxy no
smartphone get leaked images of what the
LG G 6 might look like and we also get
to see the future batch of Huawei
devices getting certified I'm hiding
every that I yes I know that mondays
video was late let's all blame it on
Monday this is out daily let's
begin today with some interesting rumors
regarding the huawei watch version 2 or
whatever that's going to be called we've
been waiting for this watch for pretty
much a year meaning it's two years after
the launch of the original one it
continues to be one of my favorite
watches one of the best showcases of
what Android wear can do currently
apparently that's going to be the case
for the next variant things that we're
getting the ability to be able to make
phone calls in addition to everything
that is expected from Android wear to
ATO so we will keep you posted maybe
join us in really liking everything that
Huawei has done with its smartphone
lineup today we learn more about the
huawei p10 in addition to the honor 9 we
get to see leaked images of these smart
phones that are being certified at tina
specifications are rather crazy i won't
bore you with everything you can learn
more on the link in description always
become really aggressive lately and that
is great i'll talk about the LG G six
yesterday we covered the rumors that we
should be getting the smartphone of mwc
today we've got a leak front image of
the phone metallic design in addition to
some rounded corners on the display and
this thing looks gorgeous probably the
only concern we have is that according
to the source it seems that we're
getting a Snapdragon 821 instead of the
835 which could mean either of two
things are there LG is playing a slouch
again or the fact that we're getting the
stone early because the 835 is not ready
remember the whole rumors of Samsung's
this assistance bixby and the fact that
we might be getting visuals with these
assistance well we've got some very
interesting news regarding the fact that
Samsung just trademarked the name bixby
vision we really don't understand yet
what Samsung is planning to do again it
seems that this is more like Google
Goggles back in the day where you can
take the phone
something and you get immediate visual
searches it makes all the sense in the
world for Sam's going to do this I just
don't understand what's the point of
competing with Google and finally the
very interesting news that they have to
do with Samsung two things first of all
the company has posted its quarter
results and believe it or not it's
actually not negative it is pretty much
static when it comes to its revenue but
its operating profit has grown a crazy
thirty percent it could have everything
to do with the fact that it stopped
manufacturing the galaxy note the only
things could have happened but it just
proved that whatever has happened with
the Galaxy Note hasn't really affected
the company but speaking of this mark
phone the company's CEO of mobile dodjem
Co has just come on record to state that
he is committed to a future galaxy note
interesting he actually mentions the
Galaxy Note 8 we do know that there
already was a galaxy note 8 it was a
tablet in the past so whatever the name
of this new smartphone will be the
company is committed to a future of it
but it leads me to the question of the
day one of the things that he mentioned
was that he is committed to future
innovation with this note 8 so what kind
of innovation would you like in my case
I would really just like the company to
take a couple of steps back and give me
a replaceable battery let's avoid this
drama one more time leave us a comment
