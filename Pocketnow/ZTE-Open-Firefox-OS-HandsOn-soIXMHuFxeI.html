now still here at ZTE at mwc 2013 we're
checking out the ZTE open running the
brand new firefox OS unique so the ZTE
open is not a flagship class smartphone
as you may know the Firefox OS is
designed for emerging markets and the
specs reflect that this is a 3.2
megapixel camera the battery is only
1200 milliamp hours the onboard memory
is 512 megabytes and it's 256 megs of
ram backing up the Firefox OS here so
it's not intended to be a blockbuster
it's intended for markets that are not
entirely mature so just a quick OS
overview this is a home screen it is
kind of a mash-up of like me go iOS
Android there's a lot of concepts kind
of coming together here but it's not an
unendurable experience swiping down from
the top brings down a sort of a familiar
notification shade here we have
Bluetooth and wireless toggles and a
quick quick time to settings as well as
a handy meter that presumably shows you
where you are in your data allotment for
the model here's where your
notifications will live and you can
clear them all if we had we can clear
them and we are going to slide our
notifications out of the way this is the
dock and presumably you can swap these
out but this Scrolls from left to right
swiping to the right or to the left gets
you to your Applications drawer and you
can see some familiar titles in here we
have tripadvisor and Firefox and Twitter
and so forth we'll see what one of those
looks like at the end this is a pretty
deep app drawer but if we come back to
the home screen and you swipe in the
other direction you come to a universal
search not unlike the webos just search
functionality the blackberry search or
any other search really and you can
start typing the name of an application
or a recently visited page and of course
you pops up there for you keyboard is
not the easiest to type on the
autocorrect doesn't seem terribly
friendly at first but this is a very
very young OS we're not going to judge
it too harshly on anything at this point
it once again just a just a very very
quick look and we'll see if we can hop
into one of these third-party apps I
doubt our internet connection is going
to yeah Facebook's not loading for other
we have some connection difficulties
here so don't really expect these to
work terribly well but as we say brand
new OS not meant to be blowing heads off
with specs here just a very quick look
the ZTE open running the new firefox OS
i'm michael fisher with pocket now
thanks for watching stay tuned for a lot
more from mwc from me and from Tony
behind the camera thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
