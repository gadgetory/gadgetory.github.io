new party tricks for the upcoming
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 if you thought the
red hydrogen one would be extra powerful
think again if you want the red edition
one plus six you better hurry I'm high
humidity that a fun fact there is also a
Spanish version of the pocket out daily
going live as of today we would really
appreciate your support there will be a
link at the end of the video this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for a Microsoft Surface this is the time
to buy there are options for the surface
laptop currently at Best Buy that are as
low as $6.99 you get the new surface pro
tablet aka whatever for $7.99 and there
are other options as well depending on
the processor you're looking for etc you
can learn more in the description now
let's talk about Oppo as a the company
has just provided us with pricing
information for the new find X for those
of you wondering if you're going for the
128 gig variant it starts out of the
equivalent of 755 bucks if you want the
256 gig model that's close to nine
hundred and five dollars oh my god if
you want that Lambo Edition you get the
Oh free headphones and everything but
it's 1500 bucks again you can learn more
in the description as well now let's
talk about the new red one plus six that
has been teased that is now official
pre-orders have begun and I suggest you
move fast as you know limited edition
phones don't last long that limited silk
white went out quickly you can
definitely expect some coverage from us
on that red one plus six coming very
soon I cannot wait to get my unit as oh
my god the teasers look amazing
now according to benchmarks those of you
that are planning to get this amazing
new red hydrogen one hold your horses
it seems that the project is so on its
way that the company had to stick to the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 I'm not saying
it's a bad processor it's just last
year's processor which is not as
efficient or as capable as the 845 and a
couple of things
so yeah Snapdragon 835 we wonder exactly
why why not just delay it a little more
and bring the 845 if you're already
delayed this much
and finally the hottest initially they
have to do with the samsung galaxy note
9
you that are bored of getting an s+
variant with a pen
apparently Samsung is going to change
things we've got some sources claiming
that we're getting Bluetooth
functionality on the s-pen which could
mean a couple of good and bad things the
good thing is more functionality able to
control your music with the pen etc not
sure you're gonna use that for that but
the biggest hurdle is how exactly are
you going to charge that thing as you do
need to charge the s-pen for that I
wonder if there are some wireless
contacts like we see with smartwatches
or whatever the case may be let us know
in the comments would this be a reason
for you to use the s-pen the fact that
there is Bluetooth connectivity and new
features leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion and again

audience we would really love your
support follow our new youtube channel

love that we've been trying to get off
