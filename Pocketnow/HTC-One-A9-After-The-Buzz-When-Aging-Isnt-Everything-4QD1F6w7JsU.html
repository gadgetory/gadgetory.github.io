every single time the media goes crazy
over every hot new device and after that
review period wears off so does the buzz
behind that new toy you might still want
to buy but that now faces new
competition in the real world things
shouldn't be that way
for most of us aging is just as
important as the moment you unbox your
product for the first time it's how that
device performs after extensive use that
really matters down the line so let's do
something about it let's take a second
look at one of the best iPhone clones
ever given how close its flagship
successor already is I'm high metal even
with pocket now and this is the HTC One
a9 after the buzz
for some of us who grew up seeing
smartphones take shape and form
returning to an HTC device just feels
like home HTC is famous for eye-catching
design on phones built to last and that
holds true on the one a9 at least three
or four people have approached me over
the last week to ask me what this phone
is and none of them have really
mentioned the word iPhone even if the
resemblance is obvious this review unit
has been actively used by at least two
PocketNow editors before spending the
last two months with me it was used
without a case since those aren't really
easy to come by and even then this phone
has really H gracefully the 60-63
aluminum alloy may be dated for 2016
standards but it still looks like new
and feels great in the hand the sheet of
Gorilla Glass 3 has also survived
extensive use quite well at first glance
though it didn't do so without a scratch
of you expose it to warm light other
aspects of the device haven't really
aged at all but do lock an interesting
departure from the HTC that we knew as a
premium mid-range er the one a9 follows
the trend of competitors with a gorgeous
5 inch AMOLED display locked at 1080p
just as the first day it performs
beautifully but the implementation is
rather odd the deep contrast and
saturation of AMOLED is president almost
everything you do but once you jump into
things like the icon pack we don't
understand why these look dull even when
compared to other HTC phones on a super
LCD the same goes for changes like the
speakers and especially when more
affordable HTC devices sports some sort
of boo sound sure the speaker doesn't it
make the iPhone in both placement and
loudness but it definitely is not boom
sound I'm not sure if by Dolby sound HTC
men that it only enhances the experience
through the headphones but overall it's
not the HTC experience that we've come
to love it's time for a good old
fashioned still you have to keep in mind
that the one a9 is not a successor to
the one m9
and instead the companies push into the
premium mid-range as such using it is
actually better than what you'd think
performance over the Snapdragon 617 on
three gigs of RAM
been solid for day to day tasks and the
20 150 milliamp hour battery usually
does a decent job at keeping things up
during the day
the combo doesn't really do so well in
intensive games given the dropped frames
here and there but at this tier it kind
of comes with the territory the company
did keep its promise of pushing Qualcomm
quick charge 3.0 to this phone on a
recent software update but remember that
the charger bundled in the Box doesn't
really do the job or at least there's no
real way to confirm and speaking of
software updates that's another thing
that HTC has done right this continues
to be one of the few phones running
Android 6.1 marshmallow and software
updates and patches have kept coming
over the last few weeks as a result HTC
Sense 7 continues to be one of my
favorite Android skins to date app load
times are quick switching between them
as a breeze and I still find this UX to
be one of the most elegant out there
other cool details like the front-facing
fingerprint scanner continued to be one
of my favorite things about this phone
I love turning the phone on with a
button and the added convenience of
using it as a home button is also cool
even though the navigation keys are
still there the typical HTC gestures
like launching the camera app with the
volume buttons also join the list of
little details that delight the user
experience even if using the cameras
still a mixed story launching the
application can be very slow and photos
on this phone aren't really as great as
we'd want them to be the 13 megapixel
shooter with optical image stabilization
is decent for daylight shooting but
follows the trend of completely losing
credibility in both low light and the
selfie shooter as well at a time when
HTC has spent the last few years
touting the launch of phones with the
best cameras software updates haven't
really saved this phone from being just
another good camera that kneels to the
competition and I guess that's the major
story about the HTC One a9 after the
buzz it looks like an iPhone it behaves
like a very good Android phone and it's
aged far better than many of its
competitors in both hardware and
software if you've ever wanted an iPhone
running Android it really does
get better than this the only thing that
I just can't get over with this phone is
it's crazy price tag even today the 189
is still priced at $4.99 challenging
flagships like the Moto X pure edition
in the Nexus 6p and obviously every
other premium mid-range er including
even the iPhone S II it's got a lot of
things going for it but none of them
hold enough to warrant such a hefty
price tag with the HTC 10 just around
the corner it might be best for you to
just hold off to see what improvements
get launched though I wouldn't blame you
for not waiting at all and just buying
every other competitor out there folks
