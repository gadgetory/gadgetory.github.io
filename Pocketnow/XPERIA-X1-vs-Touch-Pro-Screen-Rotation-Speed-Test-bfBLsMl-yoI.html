pocketnow.com and this is a screen
rotation speed test between the sony
ericsson xperia x1 and the HTC touch pro
as we continue our series comparing the
two devices now they've both been just
soft reset and they're running the same
sort of third party program so there's
no background processes running that
would compromise one of the devices and
we're going to start off in the program
screen and we're going to go to various
other screens and test different
scenarios here about the same their
Xperia was slightly faster they're about
the same maybe expiry Xperia was faster
their overall they're about the same the
Xperia is slightly faster let's try
something else let's go to opera and
load the same web page over Wi-Fi ok so
here we are on CNN com a somewhat
complex web page and let's see how they
do in the rotation of this x1 a little
faster
so overall I think the x1 is faster in
Opera Mobile okay here both devices are
on the same PDF in the same view zoomed
in one time so let's see how they do
with this PDF well let's try to get it
together
the x1 is slightly faster once again
okay so both of these devices exhibit
very fast screen rotation faster than a
lot of devices out there but the x1 is
just slightly faster most of the time
then the touch pro so that's it for this
part of the comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
