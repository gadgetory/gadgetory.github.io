Kakinada comm and as many of you are
power users out there you'll probably
want to backup your entire Android
device to your SD card before you flash
a new ROM or read your device so the
program in show you today is called Maya
backup pro and it is very useful utility
so let's get started okay so here we are
on my backup Pro and it's a pretty
simple program to use all you have to do
is select backup and you can either
select applications or data I'm going to
select applications here and it's going
to get a list of all my applications and
I can either check them all or check
which ones I want to save I'm going to
click cancel here and I'm going to go
back up again and to data and I can
change it to my SD card or to online and
you will get a my backup Pro user ID or
whatnot when you buy the application on
Android Market which is $4.99 so I'm
just going to SD card here and I can
select any one of these so as you see I
can select all of them so I'm going to
check all and hit OK and I'm just gonna
select it to last backup click OK again
and it shouldn't take too long to backup
the entire data to my SD card ok so when
it's all done backing up it'll zip to a
file onto my SD card and then save it
and give me a hundred percent here and
then it should stop and just to say ok
so there we go and give me a done and
successful and all that great stuff we
can also manage if I want I can go down
here and I can manage my applications or
data so I'm just going to go to data
here and SD card and we can look at it
all we can either delete it or view it
so if we want to delete it I can but I'm
not going to so I'm just going to cancel
you can also restore all my data but I
just saved it so there's no point in
restoring it right now I can also set up
a schedule and I can either remove a
schedule or disable a schedule right now
I have one set which was done on the
fifth ok so I can also view all the
applications that I have saved to my
the card so as you see I have quite a
few applications I think there's
probably a hundred or so to get to that
all I have to do is go view and then
like applications but it took a while to
load so I just showed you the end result
so we'll click okay so this is my backup
pro and is another Android Market pick
and the perm costs $4.99 on Android
Market thanks for watching and if at any
time you want to download this program
to your device just navigate using
Google Goggles to the image of the QR
code on the screen and snap a picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
