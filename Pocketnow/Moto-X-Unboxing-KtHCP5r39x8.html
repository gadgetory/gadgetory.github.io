checking out the new Moto X just
announced in New York City and being
unboxed for your pleasure in a New York
City coffee shop hope you like the
background music let's get inside the
box and see this us-made brand new
motorola smartphone okay so there's no
seal to break here let's just see if we
can pop the top well she's not found
about to fall out because I didn't do
that right but these are learning things
this is how we learn this is an 80 units
or 18t reminds us that it can indeed
wait I thought this was going to be a
white unit but it is in fact the black
one no problem there this is going to
photograph just as cleanly once we get
some light on it will come back to the
device in a second but let's see what
else is in the box and don't forget to
follow pocket now on all our social
media outlets and make sure and
subscribe here on YouTube as well here's
some welcome literature which we will
have a look at off camera here's our
white USB cable a white wall charger as
well which we won't pull out and what is
a nice little casing I assume it's a sim
key this is indeed a sim key Rob Thomas
good unboxing music let's see if there's
any juice in this sucker sorry folks
we're not going to be able to get you
that nice audio we like on the screen
peel but at least we'll be able to see
it if in fact we remember not to trim
our nails before another unboxing here
we go oh that's just very nice this is a
wooden at 4.7 yes 4.7 inch amoled just
confirmed by our friend Anna bong from
bored at work doing his own unboxing
right next to us in the coffee shop this
is a lot of fun and I'll take this
opportunity to apologize for the audio
quality guys we want to get this to you
as soon as possible wow look at that I
should have stayed on the splash screen
here this is impressive stuff and there
we go there's a welcome we can see it's
a very close to Android stock experience
but more on that in our other videos
from the New York City event launch
event for the Moto X phone stay tuned to
pocket now for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
