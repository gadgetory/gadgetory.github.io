pacquiao calm and today I'm Marcia
Mozilla fennec alpha 2 and a couple of
features have been upgraded since the
last alpha 1 and we still have the same
tab so we can scroll over and see the
tab so if I wife select a page can just
click on it directly so I have a few of
them that have been loaded here and to
close them you just click the X so if I
want to close this current page I can
click the X and it'll close the current
page and scroll over and go to another
page let's see here i think i have
youtube loaded and the one thing about
this web browsers it only loads the
mobile pages so that is a little bit of
a downfall so if i wanted to watch this
video i can click here and it will load
a proprietary streaming video stuff i
want to click the string player exe i
can click that but i can also choose
different applications i want it to run
there so i can just ok and then we'll
start playing through our windows media
player so that's that's a cool feature
that it has integration but it is kind
of annoying that it has to launch the
windows media player so i'm just going
to close out of this and it will just
bring us back to fennec does he canceled
will you scroll over to some of the
settings go down to the settings user
that's pretty much the same settings
unfortunately the plugins still don't
work but as you can see I can search for
a plug-in and it says no matches found
so unfortunately no plugins are still
available for this version so we'll just
close this and go down to some of the
download setting so if I wanted to see
my recent downloads it'll show me the
site they'll give me the name and I can
also search for other downloads if I
have a large number of downloads that
I've downloaded from the FN 'ok so this
is where the settings can be implemented
so you can show image it's pretty small
and I can't really zoom in with this
camera unfortunately so it can show
image i can click yes or no enable
javascript click here sir no enable
plugins the same allow cookies and
remember my passwords and i call so I'll
clear my browsing history so that's a
good feature so just close out of
settings and it will bring us back to
our web browser
so it's pretty fast to load actually I'm
running on a Wi-Fi connection right now
so it does work both over mobile and
Wi-Fi so it's very easy to access our
favorites it's actually a button
directly on the browser so i can just
click here and it will launch my
favorite so i can see that i have
pocketnow.com mobile like i said it only
launches a mobile browser which is a
little bit but it inconvenience but a
lot of pages allow you nowadays to
select whether you have a mobile or
classic HTML website and it loaded the
page pretty fast and it will show images
it also gives you a touch scroll sort of
effect you can just a flick scroll the
page unfortunately doesn't load too fast
but it did load okay and as you can see
it gives us the same checkerboard effect
on that it shows on the Opera Mobile 9.5
so they click on the web address it'll
give us a list of our favorites and our
recently viewed web pages as well as
these tabs on the bottom so if I wanted
to go to yahoo i can click on this tab
right here and we'll launch yahoo so
here we have yahoo loaded and all in all
it is a pretty good web browser it is
nice that you can just flick over and
select different panels or tabs and just
click back and select your settings from
the other side and your favorites as
well you can also go back and forward
the web browser is free and i'll post a
link on pocketnow.com as to how to get
this unfortunately this is still just
the Alpha to release so there are some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
