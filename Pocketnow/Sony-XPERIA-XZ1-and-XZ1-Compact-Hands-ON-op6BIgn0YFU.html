Sony had some news to share at Aoife
2017 taking the wraps off of a pair of
refreshed flagship phones the Xperia XZ
one ticks all the right checkboxes for a
modern premium Sony handset the design
is nicely evolved removing seams and
breaks in the casing and the internals
now line up with the rest of the
top-tier players
this is a classic Sony build
highlighting front-facing stereo
speakers packed into sizeable forehead
and chin bezels bordering that sixteen
by nine 1080p display we're expecting
some killer camera hardware on tap and
thanks to cual comes current chipset the
XZ one inherits the super slow motion
settings from the XZ premium a fun new
feature Sony's camera is capable of
creating 3d scans by penning across an
object either to create a digital
version or for 3d printers the xc1 on
paper does a terrific job of addressing
our original concerns from when Sony
shifted from the Xperia Z to the Xperia
X line still in an age of taller phone
screens at the bleeding edge this sharp
modern design feels larger than it might
need to be for its normal size display
and that's where my precious Xperia
makes a stunning return the ex z1
compact represents one of the few truly
premium small form-factor phones left on
the market and this year Sony thankfully
refrained from hamstringing the tech
onboard the petite Xperia gets the same
snapdragon 835 the same ram same camera
with super slow motion and the same life
style water-resistant the selfie camera
uses a smaller sensor than the larger XZ
and the internal storage is reduced to
32 gig but otherwise this pint-sized
competitor should be an absolute
screamer these phones should arrive is
some of the first options using Android
8.0 Oreo and both are available for
pre-order now at some reasonable price
points with expected shipping in Europe
