year's pixel was one of the best
shooters of 2016 save for some serious
lens issues in low-light video
performance google has taken steps to
address both of those problems on the
pixel - and this makes it the best auto
mode shooter in Android land trading
blows nicely with Apple's iPhone 8
smooth video colorful exposures great
low-light and fun slow-motion there
isn't a better option for folks who only
want to interact with the shutter button
we all have those friends and family
members who might not even tap on the
screen to focus this camera does almost
all the thinking for you and has
terrific output to back it up want to
see how we arrived at this conclusion
here's our pixel - real camera review
brought to you by D brand Google didn't
have a lot to fix the hardware remains
similar to last year's pixel with the
inclusion of Hardware image
stabilization and a better lens almost
all of the new consumer facing features
are achieved by software where we get a
background blur mode but Google is not
playing the dual sensor game kicking
things off with exposure and saturation
Google intends for most people to use
some kind of auto or HDR mode
maintaining consistency with our other
reviews will first look at the normal
photos before shifting to auto
processing and the pixel is a competent
performer metering draws most of its
info from where the user focuses but
even in situations where the camera is
making all the decisions users are apt
to receive a solid exposure the only
slight weakness we see some clipping and
highlights but this is easily
competitive against other flagship
phones most noticeable and warmer colors
where vibrant saturation works with the
slight overexposure to sizzle some of
that detail otherwise and especially on
cooler colors expect effortless eye
pleasing images and we'd normally save
HDR for later in the review but I can
already feel all the undies getting
twisted up by showing non HDR shots at
the top of this video yes Google intends
for you to use some kind of auto HDR
mode and yes it really is good I'm just
personally not a huge fan of HDR
style processing where the pixel excels
is in providing a safety net for
consumers helping to rein in highlights
while preserving shadow detail and moe
shots it's used to wonderful effect and
Google's processing works great on
warmer color my reservations come with
what HDR can do to a scene like creating
an oddly uniform blue in the sky we
didn't have many clouds in Southern
California but HDR tends to make them
all look like storm clouds and when the
setting is in full auto that means the
phone decides when it's used which makes
output a little less predictable if your
only goal is photos with great colors
we'll look no further but if you're
trying to create a specific aesthetic
manual modes are greatly appreciated
taking a quick look at the white balance
there's an obvious weight towards
lighting information over the true
scientific white of your subject which I
prefer and this makes perfect sense
given Google's focus on image processing
and a happy improvement for Google last
year's pixels major pain point was the
terrible flaring from the lens and this
has been virtually eliminated from the
pixel - while we've been spoiled by the
v.34 clarity the pixel - shows less
distortion and a competitive amount of
flaring opposite other flagships another
reason to sometimes be frustrated by HDR
though this kind of image processing
will exacerbate flaring when you would
normally only have a little and a better
lens means better macro and close-up
performance is spot-on for this class of
camera the natural bouquet from the
sensor is very pleasing from a purely
hardware perspective it's neck-and-neck
with the V 30 and note 8 ever so
slightly busier and edgier than LG in a
similar setup of course software blur is
all the rage and Google is working hard
on their computational photo skills the
pixel manages some excellent software
blur from a single camera lens and a
recent camera update has nearly
eliminated two cutout problems we had
from the first day with the phone still
saw some ugly errors on objects like
this bench but overall this competes
very well against dual camera solutions
that this effect is also used on the
selfie shooter without any kind of you
brow sensor bar is pretty remarkable we
see more cut out errors from the front
camera but given good light we think
people are really going to like this
effect there is no second sensor so zoom
performance is on par with other single
sensor phones some decent reached
through cropping but the results at the
extreme end are fairly lackluster
Google's processing at night was
surprisingly good and video is
restrained from the same full zoom as
still photos to prevent completely
destroying image integrity shifting the
night shots Google's low-light
performance remains top-tier extremely
responsive shutter action again there is
a difference between normal and auto HDR
shots where noise reduction is employed
more aggressively on auto mode most
shots will benefit from cleaner output
even if lights can sometimes flare out
overall though folks might have
appreciated just a touch more sharpening
many exposures from the pixel to felt
soft and splotchy when compared against
other phones in similar setups it's
plenty fast enough to land some night
candid shots but it's not my favorite
output and just like the overall
performance autofocus is snappy quick as
well right up there with Samsung's dual
pixel shooters oddly we did run into a
few issues at macro distances for
example the phone refusing to lock on
these leaves and HDR enhanced but had no
issues focusing when HDR was off but
these moments were exceedingly rare in
our testing in video though there is
just a little extra bounce at the end of
each focus pull which can be interrupted
before the phone is fully locked on your
subject not a huge detriment
more I just wasn't expecting it and
likely an aspect of the camera users
will quickly get a feel for now for all
the improvements in the cool new
software it's shocking Google still
hasn't cleaned up panoramas lining up
these damn dots guarantees a more
difficult shot than how most phones will
smoothly pan through a wide the final
stitching is terrible output is dull
this is one of the few significantly
weak links of the pixel too by contrast
happily the selfie shooter is pretty
solid software processing goes a long
way to improving output selfie video
looks pretty good but it would have been
nice to see some more state
as a Shinto smooth out handshake and
speaking of video the pixel 2 produces
some crowd pleasing UHD footage like
stills expect some great colour pop and
processing though it will more closely
resemble photos without HDR so warmer
colors can sizzle Knight video is
wonderfully improved thanks to cleaning
up the lens flaring issues though it's
almost always about a half stop to a
full stop too bright I am oh the creepy
tunnel looks a lot better in general
when you drop the exposure it's in video
we can also take a quick look at
stabilization and again it's remarkably
smooth this is crazy good the crop does
make framing problematic I didn't intend
to cut off the top of this tree while
zooming for example that makes me
nervous
not knowing exactly what my frame looks
like but it is better than the huge
offset we saw in the first pixel this is
a wonderful combo of hardware and
software stabilization where normally
using both on a phone causes more
problems than it solves the only
downside is still low-light video where
a longer shutter speed causes more blur
per frame and that in turn creates
blurry and shifty looking video well
improved over the pixel 1 but still not
the cleanest look when shooting at night
and we had some crazy windy weather in
Southern California and that only served
to highlight another weak link for this
phone mono audio when shooting video
only Apple and Google do this it makes
no sense why wouldn't you want to
capture a stereo audio track especially
listening to some amazing performers
like the LGV 30 videos from the pixel
and iphone sound dull
it's a shame especially if you like to
shoot video at events or concerts but
back to some happier news the slow
motion modes on the pixel 2 are still
excellent maybe falling slightly behind
Apple's new 1080p mode but still one of
the best available users will be well
served here lastly looking at the app it
stayed simple and that's on point
performance is fantastically smooth and
Loui only a handful of stutters when
used aggressively in 100-degree heat the
organization is spot on
like if Apple we're designing a new
camera app today and didn't need to
include a weird square photo legacy mode
we're sure the pixel camera is what they
would produce there is a token effort to
include white balance presets but this
is not the interface for folks who like
manual modes you can't do this with a
pixel out of the box while the main
interface is fantastic and folks will
certainly appreciate unlimited online
photo storage the organization on device
is a bit of a mess transferring shots to
my PC involved individual folders for
portrait mode shots and I got numerous
transfer errors in moving files over
cloud backup is great until you need to
work with some 10 gigabytes worth of
files I really hope this has cleaned up
a little in a future update so let's
wrap it up folks there you have it this
is the auto mode champion literally
point and shoot and a majority of people
will be pretty happy with what this
phone can do for all the power on tap
though we wish Google wasn't working so
hard to completely ignore folks who
might like a little more control still
for all the drama surrounding the pixel
to launch at least the camera game is on
point and when you're out shooting with
your pixel to couldn't it use a little
extra protection maybe you want to show
off a different style dbrand has a wide
collection of custom fit skins in
different colors and textures to protect
against scratches add some additional
grip and fit your specific vibe head on
