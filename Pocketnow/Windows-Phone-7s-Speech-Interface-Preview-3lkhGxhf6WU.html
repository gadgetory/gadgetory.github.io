calm and you've probably already seen
the know a couple videos of the new
windows phone 7 emulator that was
recently released here we have it on a
multi-touch tablet and I'm going to show
you a couple things you might not have
seen yet here I'm holding down the Start
menu button for a couple seconds open
calendar and that's the tell me app
right there see a parent by tell me
right now please try again later
it doesn't always work but you just
serve it reading the message to me over
the speakers so that's got text to
speech which is really great let's just
try it again find pizza you see this
animation up there just told me it was
searching for pizza and here comes the
list my location doesn't work so we only
get web results but that's all right and
if i go back to bein
see if I press that up
I was already ending okay here we go you
see the microphone icon there we've seen
this before but let's try that pocket
now
and it's searched and we have talked it
out there we go so that's how that's
going to open Internet Explorer
and we're going to load the website
I have three tabs open already
and we can scroll even while it's
loading
still loading
and we can multi touch
so that's really cool one more thing is
cool with multi-touch the pictures oops
I press that accidentally
and I can tap and hold here to see that
menu come up change my background
pictures the loading
can multi touch for enlarging and
cropping
there we go
let me just show you the settings for
the voice
speech
so we've got play audio kind of
confirmations that's pretty important
your speech when the phone is locked
that's really good because you can have
it in your pocket and maybe use a
bluetooth headset to activate the speech
interface and then do some phone calls
or opening applications or whatnot not
clear entirely how many commands this is
going to support right away and then we
have enable speech recognition over the
network that's so that it can use a
server you know the tell me server is to
recognize and transcribe speech that's a
important for the bean searches so there
you go promising not entirely finished
obviously but looking really good that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
