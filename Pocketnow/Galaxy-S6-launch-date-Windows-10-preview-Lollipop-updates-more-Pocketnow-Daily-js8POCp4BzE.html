customers of the galaxy s6 Windows 10
preview for smartphones goes live today
but not for everyone and Apple just
rendered its own 16 gigabyte iOS device
useless I'm hi Mary that' and probably
the thing that I celebrate most about
friday aside from the drinks is really
that I'm free on Saturday and Sunday
this is pocket out daily brought to you
by lynda.com the official lucid I have
to do with apple and these are not
really good news for those of you
rocking any 16 gig iphone or ipad and if
you're into gaming mainly because apple
is just raised the limit for app
submission from developers meaning
before they could only submit the games
or applications that were two kicks in
size now they could upload as much as 4
gigs in size of applications and that is
just crazy if you think about the fact
that on a 16 gig iphone that's a two
applications and your usable space just
goes ballistic but anyways hopefully
Apple fixes things in the future
starting with a starting point for
storage on the iPhone now let's move the
spotlight over to Samsung as if you're
wondering when we're getting the galaxy
s6 well apparently sends an experienced
employees will not be able to take time
off on March 22 to 30th or april
nineteen to twenty seven so either on
these states probably for one variant or
the other are the times then we will get
the launch for the galaxy s6 which is
really close to mwc that's really cool
but even more interesting if you
remember in touch was was supposed to be
stripped down for the launch the galaxy
s6 and then everything else was optional
but apparently in that deal between
Microsoft and Samsung you know the whole
let's not have lobster anymore deal it
seems that now Samsung devices will have
office and other Microsoft applications
bundled into galaxy phones so stay tuned
for that one another company which we
are expecting big news from at mwc is
HTC and we were only expecting the HTC
One m9 and now we've got some very
interesting renders and leaks on Twitter
of a blue body an HTC device that
clearly looks like a desire phone it
doesn't look high-end but it is
something that was clearly not in our
radar until now not on anybody's radar
it could be just the case or sleeve for
any exist
being HTC Desire phone because uh yeah
it doesn't look that high end of a
material in an exterior then again this
could just be a blurry photo will keep
you posted in WC and yes this has been
software update week for everyone
particularly when it comes to lollipop
if you're rocking the HTC One m8 on
tmobile which i do then you probably
already have lollipop right now if not
then go install it and if you have the
LG g3 on AT&amp;amp;T which I also do then you
probably already have lollipop on your
device and if not go get it because it's
already available and those of you
rocking the Galaxy Note 4 apparently it
is available but only on the X and O's
variants we're still wanting to confirm
that on our review unit and we'll keep
you posted on that one but yeah get
software update time and finally for the
hot news of the day have you've been
wanting to test Windows 10 / mobile
today is the day but not for everyone
unless you're currently rocking a Lumia
635 Lumia 636 Lumia 638 Lumia 730 or
Lumia 830 you won't be in luck these are
the only devices that are currently
compatible with Windows 10 and the
installation process through windows
insider is extremely easy extremely easy
I just arrived Olivia 830 it works like
a charm and so far Windows 10 does look
great at least in my initial impressions
it is extremely buggy and laggy but hey
you were warned on this but that leads
you to the question of the day I have a
look at the links of the description and
everything that we've covered with
Windows 10 does windows 10 make you want
to switch to a windows phone because in
my particular case I'll tell you this
much I like it but hopefully it is
better than windows phone 8.1 I'll keep
you posted on my experience and let us
know what you think and friends if
you've ever wanted to learn how to teach
a class make some cookies or even build

sponsor lynda.com slash pocket now
