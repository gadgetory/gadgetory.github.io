their own Exynos processor on the
upcoming Galaxy fold one weight
accidentally spilled the beans and
confirmed everything we need to know
about the Huawei P 30 Pro and agency's
controversial 5ge Network is as powerful
as other LTE networks in America I'm
Jaime Rivera and while you party on
Friday I'll be catching a flight but
expect p30 pro coverage very soon this
is PocketNow daily brought to you by the
honor of u-20 the official news today
begin with things that actually aren't
official just yet as we hear that Apple
is not necessarily just going to revamp
their whole streaming services but
apparently their new services might be
included up to the point where we hear
that companies like Vox media have
already been signed up for this which I
actually find the awesome I love their
videos by the way it's a really great
YouTube channel also their reporting is
really good so let's see what we get in
the end now let's talk about Facebook
and another shady practices actually
it's been uncovered that the company
kept passwords from millions of users in
plain text with access of up to 20,000
employees to the service and the reason
why is because apparently they were
having issues and glitches and therefore
I guess it was smarter to just copy your
password and keep it visible to their
employees for whatever reason obviously
Facebook hasn't really pronounced
themselves about this or oh my god just
change your passwords guys or do
yourself a favor follow me I'm gonna
cancel my Facebook account now let's
talk about AT&amp;amp;T and their 5ge network as
open signal has just run some tests on
their new 5ge with Galaxy phones and
iPhones that are already providing the
5ge indication according to the results
it seems that 5g E is pretty much just
as fast as LT they did notice some
improvements but obviously AT&amp;amp;T network
wasn't necessarily perfect so
improvements to the spectrum are always
welcome but they still fit the standards
of LTE no 5g so just for you to know
you're not really buying into something
cool there and for those of you that are
wondering about the Huawei P 30 Pro
obviously I'm about to get on a flight
to Paris to be part of the event but my
god the company pretty much just spilled
the beans on it
their website in sort of a I guess they
messed up and they posted them and they
pulled it but yeah we get confirmation
on the design the specifications of the
camera as we get confirmation pretty
much everything that we've seen in the
leaks obviously I'm not gonna bore you
this has to be a short video so follow
the link in the description it provides
all the details and finally the hottest
issues today have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy fold which was recently leaked in
a video we saw the crease and everything
that I I'm not really liking from the
design of the display but other than
that we've got some benchmarks of the
device and it seems that this device
will only bring Qualcomm processors and
this is rather interesting because I
read your comments all the time and I
notice how everybody is like oh yeah but
I'd love to try with the Exynos and
listen that so in today's question let
us know I mean what do you think do you
like the idea of an all Qualcomm
Snapdragon tablet smartphone or would
you prefer for them to launch an X and
O's variant because in my case honestly
I really enjoyed the performance of the
Snapdragon 855 so I'm not complaining
but obviously we would love to know what
you think in the comments down below and
today's episode of the pocket out daily
is brought to you by the honor of u-20
this is proven to be one of our favorite
phones of the year thanks to a gorgeous
and unique back design a whopping 48
megapixel camera that brings an awesome
night mode along with an ultra clarity
mode for better photos in all scenarios
it's one of the first with a time of
flight sensor for state of the art 3d
sensing and better portraits it's also
one of the first with a hole-punch
design for the selfie camera and one of
the smallest we've seen in the market
price this plus it's powerful keren 980
processor just $600 and this is why it's
just hard to beat follow the link of the
description below and learn what makes
the honor view 20 so cool friends again
if you want to get the news early or
follow us I'm out odd comments
Kirk to both of our channels English and
Spanish for more videos like this one it
follow me on twitter hi managers
quarterly get on instagram at high medli
data please give this video a thumbs up
