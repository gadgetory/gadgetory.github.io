pocket now that
and in this video I'm going to show you
three different ways to access facebook
from your windows mobile device so the
first method is what I call the light
method so that means it doesn't use that
much data if you're over a you know
pay-as-you-go data connection or you're
using a slow edge connection or
something like that and it also doesn't
have as many images as the other ones
that I'm going to show you so we're
going to go to pocket internets Internet
Explorer here and go to M facebook.com
ok and here we are and what you get is
that the feed the news feed that shows
you what your friends are doing right
now you get some pictures you can go
over to friends up here and look through
all of your friends you can go into the
profiles you can write things on their
wall it's a very basic experience it's
not a very rich experience like you
would find on desktop facebook or
through a facebook application okay now
for the second method we're going to
need opera mobile 9.5 because that is
Ajax support we're actually going to be
using the iphones facebook website to do
this so here we are and i'm going to go
to iphone facebook com and here it is
already now you're going to see it come
up and it's going to look kind of
strange but here's a little trick and
this applies to the touch pro or touch
diamond or touch HD double tap on the
page to zoom out to have it perfectly
formatted to the screen and now it's
basically like using facebook on an
iphone so everything is formatted just
right if you tap on certain tabs it
loads super fast because it's ajax based
if you want to look at somebody's
profile you just go to you know you just
tap on their name it goes over and we
will get their profile we can write on
their wall over here and it loads very
fast and then we can go to photos also
and browse through photos as if it were
a stand-alone facebook application not
quite as good but but pretty good
actually so that is facebook using the
iphone version on in upper mobile 9.5
and the final way to access facebook
with windows mobile is through the
xperia x1 panel and obviously this only
works if you have an xperia x1 so I'm
going
the panel button down here and it's
going to zoom out and show me the panels
and I'm going to go to the Facebook
application now we've shown this to you
before but the facebook application or
the panel i should say has been updated
to better work with the xperia x1 so
it's a lot faster now so right now it is
downloading the status of a lot of my
friends i can log in like so and this is
a really interesting so i appear in the
center there and soon i will see all my
friends fly and who have recently
updated their status and you can have
this update automatically or you can
manually update it if you're trying to
save on data connection and it's
happening a little slow right now but
once things are loaded things are much
faster and in a second they're all just
going to fly in and here they come so
what i can do from here is i can tap on
any one of these circles that represent
a friend and i can read their status up
here and i can just tap along and i see
different people's status if i click on
the center it's asking what am i doing
right now but that's not just the
application what we can do is we can
click over to the actual main
application and the Home tab will show
us our news feed and it is very flick
scroll friendly very finger-friendly
it's just like the iphone application
but i think it's actually better we can
go over to the friends tab and it loads
the friends okay and here we are all the
friends are loaded and you can flick
through them very easily see them
alphabetically like rolodex and i'm
going to tap on somebody's profile and
cover it up for security and i'm going
to show you how it looks when you view
photos of this person so you can poke
them you can call them right from your
phone and here's the photos tab coming
up now and you get all the albums so i'm
going to go to this one and they're
coming up now so I'm just going to tap
on one picture and it's going to bring
it up to a larger screen and we can tap
to the right and to the left to get a
bigger picture and we can flip it to
landscape of course to see the picture
and it's full length great glory and tap
over like so so that is the facebook app
location of the facebook panel on the
xperia x1 so there it is three different
ways to get to facebook on Windows
Mobile you have the light version via
pocket Internet Explorer the more
featured version via Opera Mobile 9.5
and of course the xperia x1 panel that
you can only get right now in the xperia
x1 there are a lot of other facebook
applications that are in the works out
there some of them aren't really ready
for prime time but as soon as there's
something good out there will post
another video about it so that you can
stay connected by using facebook on your
windows mobile device that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
