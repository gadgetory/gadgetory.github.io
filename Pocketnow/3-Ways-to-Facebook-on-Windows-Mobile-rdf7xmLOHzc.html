now
and in this video I'm going to show you
three different ways to access Facebook
from your windows mobile device so the
first method is what I call the light
method so that means it doesn't use that
much data if you're over a you know
pay-as-you-go data connection or you're
using a slow edge connection or
something like that
and it also doesn't have as many images
as the other ones that I'm going to show
you so we're gonna go to pocket internet
explorer here and go to m dot
facebook.com okay and here we are and
what you get is that the feed the news
feed that shows you what your friends
are doing right now you get some
pictures you can go over to friends up
here and look through all of your
friends you can go into their profiles
you can write things on their wall it's
a very basic experience it's not a very
rich experience like you would find on
desktop Facebook or through a Facebook
application okay now for the second
method we're going to need opera mobile
9.5 because that is eject support we're
actually going to be using the iPhones
Facebook website to do this so here we
are and I'm going to go to iPhone
facebook.com and here it is already now
you're gonna see it come up and it's
gonna look kind of strange but here's a
little trick and this applies to the
touch pro or touch Dimond or touch HD
double tap on the page to zoom out to
have it perfectly formatted to the
screen and now it's basically like using
Facebook on an iPhone so everything is
formatted just right if you tap on
certain tabs it loads super fast because
it's ajax-based if you want to look at
somebody's profile you just go to you
know you just tap on their name it goes
over and we will get their profile we
can write on their wall over here and it
loads very fast and then we can go to
photos also and browse through photos as
if it were a standalone Facebook
application not quite as good but but
pretty good actually so that is Facebook
using the iPhone version on in Opera
Mobile 9.5 and the final way to access
Facebook with Windows Mobile is through
the xperia x1 panel and obviously this
only works if you have an experienced
one so I'm going
the panel button down here and it's
gonna zoom out and show me the panels
and I'm gonna go to the Facebook
application now we've shown this to you
before but the Facebook application or
the panel I should say has been updated
to better work with the xperia x1 so
it's a lot faster now so right now it is
downloading the status of a lot of my
friends I can log in like like so and
this is a really interesting so I appear
in the center there and soon I will see
all my friends fly and who have recently
updated their status and you can have
this update automatically or you can
manually update it if you're trying to
save on data connection and it's
happening a little slow right now but
once things are loaded things are much
faster and in a second they're all just
gonna fly in and here they come so what
I can do from here is I can tap on any
one of these circles that represent a
friend and I can read their status up
here and I can just tap along and I see
different people's status if I click on
the center it's asking what am i doing
right now
but that's not just the application what
we can do is we can click over to the
actual main application and the home tab
will show us our newsfeed and it is very
flicked scroll friendly very finger
friendly it's just like the iPhone
application but I think it's actually
better we can go over to the friends tab
and it loads the friends okay and here
we are all the friends are loaded and
you can flick through them very easily
see them alphabetically like a rolodex
and I'm going to tap on somebody's
profile and cover it up for security and
I'm going to show you how it looks when
you view photos of this person so you
can poke them you can call them right
from your phone and here's the Photos
tab coming up now and you get all the
albums so I'm gonna go to this one
and they're coming up now so I'm just
going to tap on one picture and it's
going to bring it up to a larger screen
and we can tap to the right and to the
left to get a bigger picture and we can
flip it to landscape of course to see
the picture and it's full landscape
glory and tap over like so so that is
the Facebook application of the Facebook
panel on the xperia x1 so there it is
three different ways to get to Facebook
on Windows Mobile you have the light
version via Pocket Internet Explorer the
more featured version via upper mobile
9.5 and of course the xperia x1 panel
that you can only get right now in the
xperia x1 there are a lot of other
Facebook applications that are in the
works out there some of them aren't
really ready for primetime but as soon
as there's something good out there
we'll post another video about it so
that you can stay connected by using
Facebook on your Windows mobile device
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
