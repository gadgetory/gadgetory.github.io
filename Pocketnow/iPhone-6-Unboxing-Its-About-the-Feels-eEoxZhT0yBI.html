Taylor Martin opted for Apple's new 5.5
inch phablet for his review device but
me well I've had my fill of big smart
phones for the moment I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow here with an unboxing and
a quick hardware tour of the Apple
iPhone 6
there's no colorful graphic on the cover
this time around but otherwise the
iPhone 6 retail packaging is vintage
Apple stark white and just as big as it
needs to be cutting the protective film
away and lifting up the box lid
carefully so as to avoid any accidents
were shown the device front and center a
presentation that's become widespread
but don't forget Apple is the company
that made this popular and Apple still
does accessory presentation better than
anyone else everything snugly in its
right place from charger and cables to
the special iPhone earbuds complete with
her own carrying case the phone itself
is wrapped in a protective cellophane
envelope that peels away to reveal the
smoothest sided iPhone since the
original in 2007 there are no hard edges
here and barely any borders at all glass
bleeds seamlessly into metal and as I
mentioned on today's PocketNow weekly
podcast the feel in hand suggests a very
dense instrument no space has been
wasted here at all the metal feels cool
to the touch and the chassis seems
smaller than you might expect from a 4.7
inch display nevertheless the power
standby key has sensibly been relocated
to the right side a smart call and the
old palm and Apple trademark of the mute
switch is on the opposite side which I'm
very happy to see I'm not sold on all
this yet the stripes on the casing are
pretty prominent and not terribly
attractive and the camera protrusion
once you stop to look for it is
significant I've definitely seen
prettier devices some of them from Apple
but taken as a whole package just
minutes after unboxing it the iPhone 6
hardware makes a beautiful first
impression overall which really is no
surprise considering the company it
from we'll have much more on the iPhone
6 and 6-plus in the days ahead so tune
your browser to pocket now and rip the
knob off meantime Taylor Martin's
unboxing of the 6 plus is already up so
go check that out and follow us on
social media so you don't miss anything
else till next time this has been
michael fisher captain two phones on
twitter reminding you to keep your phone
front and center
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
