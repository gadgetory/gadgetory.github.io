through a scratch test almost half a
dozen nokia devices get linked own aids
and believe it or not LG still thinks
you want to curate a keyboard on your
device I'm high memory better and I
don't just look tired trust me I mean
you should be filming this video for me
and it'll be nice this is out
daily let's say up with some interesting
news we all complain about the fact that
there has never been one iphone that has
passed the scratch test then as it turns
out it seems that the iphone 5 c's
chassis you know that plastic back has
been taken to the test and apparently it
has to test so well that the phone
didn't really have any scratches from
the usual wear and tear now it's still
hard to know if this phone is real i
mean i still look at that case and i
still think that that looks just like a
snap-on case for an iphone 5 but stay
tuned let's see how that goes now as
well what were to know kit as for those
of you wondering how many products note
gets planning to launch in the next
coming months well we just got some
leaked code names and the number goes up
to 12 that's a lot of there are so many
names I'm not going to bore you links in
the description for full details on all
these Orion and constellations names
that you'll find there but if these
rumors are true we'll probably be seeing
some of these phones for this holiday
season so if the Lumia 1020 is already
out this can only mean good news now
let's focus on LG n I mean focus a lot
for those of you that are wondering if
the company will ever bring a tablet to
the market well it's just stopped by the
FCC already and you bet it's dubbed the
g pad the LG G pad and anyways well we
still don't have specifics on you know
what specification will get on this
thing but judging by the fact that LG
grills the displays for pretty much
almost every Apple product in the market
we aren't expecting a fabulous display
on this device so stay tuned then let's
see what we get and speaking of LG as I
told you we focused a lot on that an
executive from Europe just came on
record estate three interesting things
first of all the g pad which we already
know about from the previous segment
second of all those of you wondering
well we'll see a windows phone from LG
will apparently we will be getting one
in the next coming months and even a
Firefox phone probably by early next
year but
more interesting apparently they are
working hard on bringing us another
SmartWatch remember we already reviewed
1 years ago which was terrible but this
one brings the flexible display that we
talked about yesterday so if you were
wondering what that was for that's the
answer and finally for the nostalgic
news of the day verizon LG have teamed
up to bring the LG and act and no i'm
not saying that you act just yet because
this phone brings specifications that
only a mother could love wvga display 5
megapixel camera and the only reason why
that phone has made it to the final
segment of this video is because it
brings a slide-out curity keyboard I
can't remember the last time that I saw
that thing in the last couple of years
so anyways that leaves you to the
question of the day I mean would you
still want curity keyboards on your
smartphone especially Android
smartphones that release is a feature
that you're looking forward to and it's
not a feature than you nap really have
to put up with low specifications just
to get the keyboard in my particular
case I think I moved on years ago I love
curity keyboards but I you know I moved
on so leave us a comment down below what
do you think of course as always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone it's out
roll by she follows on out
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well it also follow me on Twitter and
high monitors quarterly data please give
this video thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am high net or even up thank
you very much for watching see you
