least one Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus
variant with a ceramic back an insane
amounts of RAM and storage new pens
showed the design of a possible razor
phone meaning the Moto razor and looks
very interesting if more nostalgic and
Oppo just sent out more invitations for
zoom innovation event at MWC I'm Jaime
Rivera it is raining it is Monday and
that hopefully is a sign of a good week
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals that should
have happened a while ago if you're in
the market for a Google pixel 3 or pixel
3 Excel they are both a hundred and
fifty dollars off to a more reasonable
price the price that they should have
always had of 650 and 750 obviously we
don't know exactly how long this is
gonna last so I would suggest you follow
the link on the description now let's
talk about another thing that's proof
that Apple is finally waking up and
smelling the coffee this actually
happened over the weekend the iPhone se
made it back to the store in the
clearance section they're already out of
units so most likely there are other
units or stores out there that still
have the iPhone S II but yep it was out
there and it was extremely affordable
because the company I think now needs to
figure out a way to boost those numbers
how about if we move the spotlight over
to Oppo as the company has just sent out
press invitations for an event on
February 23rd to MWC we are definitely
gonna be covering this and well the
company is teasing something focused on
zooming and if you remember 2 MW C's ago
the company showed us their periscopic
technology so I think it has to do with
something that's there rumors have a 10x
optical zoom but we'll see now let's
talk about Motorola and the Moto razor
as we've got some patents and I highly
recommend you see them particularly if
you ever own a v3 because it seems that
this phone looks pretty much like a v3
with an external display whenever it's
closed then it opens up to be the full
clamshell phone it pretty much mimics
the exact design of the v3 and because
this thing is so thin I I'm really
looking forward to this phone I actually
like what I see I
this is what moto needs to do it's old
but it was innovative back then so why
not do it again let's see if it happens
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10
plus and that possible 10th anniversary
variant at least that's what I'm
expecting this to be because listen to
this it seems that there will be a
variant with a ceramic back that it will
have 12 gigabytes of RAM and one
terabyte of storage so you remember that
there was a variant that was gonna cost
an insane amount of money that it was
gonna be launched in limited quantities
I think that's going to be the phone I
just I don't know if there are 12 gigs
of RAM yet but Samsung is the company
that is in charge of building pretty
much a lot of this technology so I would
assume that they would probably launch
this very soon and then make that
official but whatever the case may be
let us know in the comments down below
if you had a Galaxy S 10 plus with all
these specifications and design would
you pay what how much would you pay I
mean I don't I wouldn't pay more than a
thousand bucks for it which is what I
feel limited-edition phone should cost
nine 1500 or a two thousand bucks but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news early or follow
us on probably not comment subscribe to
both of our channels English and Spanish
