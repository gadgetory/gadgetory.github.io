adult life see I spend too much time
traveling so a desktop console is always
a waste of money
and mobile games have never really been
my thing surely I have an iPad full of
them with most of these being the retro
games that I grew up with in my teens
but I grew up also using Hardware
controllers so gesturing on a display is
really not what I'd call intuitive at
first I tried to solve this with options
like the Moga which I would still be
depending on today if it wasn't for the
software being so hit or miss depending
on the game and then came the Nintendo
classic which I fell in love with
instantly I mean I always loved retro
games like Mario Ninja Gaiden I could
even play Ninja Gaiden for weeks and I
have the only problem is that there is a
limit of only 30 games and there's only
so much you can do with ninja gaiden and
Mario honestly it wasn't until Nintendo
announced the switch that the gamer
spark that I left in my teens woke up
again like seriously a desktop console
that can also become portable for guy
that travels like me oh my god it was my
first impulsive buy in years and since
we're mostly about mobile technology you
know we thought it was a good reason for
us to expand our roots a little further
I'm high mentally that I would pocket
now and this is our impression of the
Nintendo switch from a retro gamers
perspective
now yes we know that the Nintendo switch
has been out for a bit so don't call
this video review call this more my
rediscovery of gaming as the Nintendo
switch is actually the first-ever game
console that I've ever bought
and honestly I'm actually glad that I
waited this long
so for $2.99 this which includes more in
the box than pretty much any other
competitor that I've ever seen you get
the tablet which powers everything a hub
with HDMI in case you want to connect
this to your monitor or TV a pair of
joy' cons that can become just one
controller using the joy con grip or can
be used this two separate controllers if
you want and there are even joy con
wrist straps to help you out with that
like seriously this is far better than
just the console and one controller like
you get everywhere else now really the
genius of this product lies in the
versatility of its design slide the
switch into its hub and you can play
with the switch on your TV or monitor at
1080p resolution with the joy con
serving as a single controller or
multiplayer if you want now you don't
really need the hub though the switch
actually includes a kickstand at the
back if you would rather use it playing
on any surface at 720p and wear a
multiplayer still supported as you can
use the joy con separately now if you
snap these joy cons on the left and
right of this tablet it turns into a
portable game console and by the way all
this works instantly you don't really
need to power it on or off now I've
heard a couple of reviews complaining
about the plastic design or the flimsy
kickstand
but I actually prefer it this way as I
would rather keep the hardware like for
long gameplay while mobile and then once
you gaze around the hardware you'll
notice some very important essentials
that I enjoy like dual front firing
speakers at the front or the option for
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack if you
want and there is also USB type-c if
you'd rather charge it through a battery
pack if you'd like
my favorite though is that games are
very small cartridges that won't scratch
and there is also microSD expansion if
you would rather download your games and
keep everything in that storage now
obviously this is a game console and
what I love the most about it is the
experience playing games I love the
graphics I love the attention to detail
and it just seems like if this is not an
underpowered tablet that you're buying
or an underpowered mobile game I've
heard a few people asking why there
isn't a web browser and I'm like no why
should it have a web browser if all of
us carry a smartphone these days I would
rather this be just a very good game
console and that'd be it this is my
first time playing a game like Zelda
ever yes really and breath of the wild
is just awesome the story is so vast and
so ever-changing that you could spend
days playing it without boredom now your
mileage might vary though as I am really
a noob so I've barely discovered a
fraction of what this game can do but my
brother Oh Scott is an insane fan of
Zelda he's got arts he's got toys he's
got everything and he's played every
single game of Zelda ever so much so
that he's pretty much already beat this
game in the same amount of time that
I've just discovered a few things but I
guess what I find the coolest about a
game like Zelda is that this feels like
reading a book you're following a story
you could pretty much sit in your
favorite chair at home and play or bring
it to the park or continue your story
while in Starbucks or on the train there
is seriously a lot of genius into
everything that the switch can do and
the fact that it's able to do it
seamlessly now the experience like with
every product is not perfect I'm games
like breath of the wild your battery
will probably only last around three
hours so make sure you bring a battery
pack if you're planning on an extensive
trip and then there is the problem of
complexity I mean the switch has an
insane amount of buttons and games like
breath of the wild require you to use
pretty much every single one of them and
my biggest problem is the fact that I
usually forget what these buttons can do
if I stop playing
game for a couple of days I know that
for some of you hardcore gamers the more
buttons the better but this can be
rather daunting for new players like me
at times it's even made me want to play
other games as sort of a palate cleanser
and that's where the curse of the early
adopter comes to play I mean I like the
Nintendo strategy of launching a new
flagship game every month I mean aside
from a few old games from Neo Geo and
fast rmx I haven't really found any
other games that I would consider
enticing it would be awesome for
Nintendo to provide support for legacy
games from Nintendo like you can on the
Wii U but sadly at this point there is
no promise for that anytime soon overall
even with its minor list of cons the
Nintendo switches then one of those
purchases that I am NOT regretting one
bit in the busy world that we live in
the versatility of this console just
fits right into the lifestyle of guys
like me I mean it's not perfect but we
have to hand it to Nintendo for building
the first ever desktop TV experience to
a portable console it's actually plays
the question if we should branch out and
start reviewing portable game consoles
like these and the games that light them
up
since hey PocketNow is all about
portability if you haven't bought your
switch yet I would highly recommend you
do so and we would love your feedback I
mean would you like for us to start
experimenting with games let us know in
the comments down below folks just like
