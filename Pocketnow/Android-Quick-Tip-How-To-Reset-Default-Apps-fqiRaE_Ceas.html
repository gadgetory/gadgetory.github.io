another Android quick tip okay so we've
got here's my Nexus One and I'm running
Android 2.2 and like you saw in a
previous video I'm running the Zune
launcher for the Zune home app on my
screen as my home app and it's really
kind of cool I showed you a video about
that before I stay tuned to the end of
the video and I'll give you a link over
to the Zune one just in case you missed
that but you know what I decided I don't
want to use this all the time just
because but I can't just hit home and go
back to my old launcher my stock default
launcher which in my case I kind of
partial to launcher Pro so how do I fix
that well the answer is not all that
simple there are two ways to do that if
you're running Android 2.2 you have to
reset your defaults that's a little bit
involved so I'll get to that in just a
minute if you're running less than
Android 2.2 so 2.1 and below there's an
app you can download from the
marketplace and let me come down here
and show it to you and it's really
really convenient it's called home
selector so just go to the market and
look for home selector and what this
does is it lets you come in and select
what app you want to use for your home
screen you tap it you hit OK and you're
done now that's not going to work all
the time for Android 2.2 because with
Android 2.2 they change the way that
they're doing things and it's really
kind of interesting now you have water
called notions and those are basically
default ways to handle stuff is that
ambiguous enough for everybody so if you
tap on say an email link it will open up
your default email program which could
be Gmail it could be canine mail it
could be inbox it could be any number of
email apps but it's only going to be one
default same thing with browser browser
could be your default browser
it could be dolphin it could be fennec
it could be any number of other things
or in this case we're talking about
launchers so your
launcher could be launcher Pro it could
be Zune home it could be a TW it could
be all kinds of stuff so how do we
change the default apps and that's
really what this tutorial is all about
so if we go in here to settings into the
system settings and down into
applications we can then manage our
applications which includes the defaults
you want to make sure that you select
all and not just what you downloaded if
you want to change stuff that you
downloaded for example that is over here
and all this does is it filters the list
if you're trying to switch between
something that came pre-installed on the
device you'd want to use all for example
here's ADW launcher which I didn't
download it came installed with my rom
so I wouldn't be able to see that and
downloaded I'd have to use this over
here but what we want to do in this
example is to come all the way down to
the bottom and we are going to find our
Zune home and like I said way down at
the bottom so right there we open up a
Zune home and you'll see right here it
says launch by default you've selected
to launch this application by default
for some actions like pressing the home
button well I don't want that anymore
so I'm gonna clear that default and just
like that I'm done next time I hit home
it comes up and says how do you want to
complete this action pick one of your
launchers so let's say I want to switch
over to that Acer launcher I tap that
and I'm good but I didn't set that as my
default so the next time I hit home it's
gonna bring that up again until I put a
check in that box to use that as the
default action now you do have to select
that first before you tap one of those
so do the same thing for your browser
for your email for whatever you can go
ahead and clear defaults it's not as
easy to get to as I'd like it to be but
now you can go in and easily make that
change if you have any questions or
comments on that please leave those and
down at the bottom of the article or the
video if you like these Android quick
tips and give it a thumbs up if you
haven't subscribed to the YouTube video
channel already do that now and head on
over to pocketnow.com to read our
articles that don't have videos
associated with them so for pocket now
