and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for this phone
let's check it out this week's new xbox
live game is called bullet asylum it's
part of February's must have games and I
got a game going right now so i'll just
hit continue and jump right in and there
we go I had a bunch of guns going
already and we have to shoot the aliens
falling from the sky so right now I have
the default control with you just touch
your finger to where you want to shoot
and what I found is the first ten levels
or so are really easy because I have to
do is hold my finger right here and
it'll kill everything so see I'm already
on way of seven I got a bunch of big gun
upgrades we're supposed to do is kind of
a mitt to two different aliens and kill
them all that way but we can just let it
go like this you can also do two fingers
and shoot the other shoot some of this
way and some that way and once once we
get to every every five levels is going
to be a boss something big that we have
to kill
let's see we get all that pretty easily
and a lot of upgrades already and you
can now obviously slide it around you
get more of a spread
all right here comes the big guy so the
boss that's two of them
I want to get both my guns going towards
each of those while also protecting my
my stuff down here there we go we just
beat wave 10 alright so that's the
arcade mode let's show you there's a
couple other modes go to play that was
our Cade mode we also have survival mode
which is going to just keep going and
see how long we can survive so there's
lots of guns and again we can do to two
fingers
and we also have architect mode where we
can choose to upgrade add certain guns
and weapons and recharging stations Oh
actually I have to pick something all
right
okay we get the idea on that okay so
those are the three modes of gameplay
and also have leaderboards that load me
with the best score of course
achievements lots of these unlocked a
few and the options there's your
tutorial how to play controls this is
important you can choose this is the
default with the finger on the screen
you can do two fingers oh and by the way
doing three things like that is going to
do a special power when you're playing I
forgot about forgot to mention that this
mode is going to give you joy sticks in
the corner to choose where the target
goes so you can choose which one you
like best and we can choose how far off
the target goes from your finger there's
your sound options choose the level
he'll now here's some cool things you
might not immediately understand what
those are
so playing different anyway if you tap
this button there you're going to get a
ringtone comes with free three free
bullet asylum ringtones and so it says
savoring town and I can just make it my
ringtone right there pretty cool so
there's bullet asylum coming februari
ate wednesday for 299 in the windows
phone mark place like this video give us
a thumbs up and that's it for now
