iPhone many for early next year the
google nexus 6p fails terribly at a bend
test and the Galaxy s7 might not be as
expensive as we thought I'm hi meri
behna and the only thing worse than
coming to work on mondays is having to
record this video twice over lighting
issues this is parking out daily
official news today begin with HTC may
be that the company did not only copy
the iphone success sorry didn't copy the
iphone success with the HTC One m9 you
should see the company's new ad campaign
be brilliant and while you're watching
that ed make sure you hit the link in
the description and also watch the 1984
ad campaign for the Apple Macintosh and
see if you find the resemblance we sure
you will and it's great to see that HTC
is boosting their marketing the sad part
is that both ad campaign then really
work well for Apple it's the best ad
campaign in history according to
Wikipedia but the Apple Macintosh was a
flop back then and it seems that not
very many of you are in the market for a
tablet as analysts are already
predicting a very terrible year and for
example last year we ended with 76
million units being sold in the last
quarter this year they're only
predicting 58 million and if you thought
that the iPad pro is going to make a
dent / that it seems that analysts don't
predicted selling more than 2 million
units which is a really bad thing oh
well speaking of analysts KGI securities
is famous for their iOS and Apple
predictions and according to them there
is going to be an iphone mini next year
now we're talking mini apparently they
are going to retain the iphone 5s design
to a certain degree and just boost
specifications like an a 9 processor a
better camera but don't expect for such
technology apparently as Apple wants to
keep this a budget phone that's not the
only interesting change next year when
it comes to the Samsung Galaxy a7 we
hear that the phone is not going to
retail for the same price early next
year apparently Samsung is out to grab
more market and therefore they want to
drop the price tag by ten percent which
is not really much apparently instead of
retailing for six hundred fifty dollars
retail for 600 which yet may not be much
but apparently there is a segment that
they want to cater to and those 50 bucks
you're going to make a difference we'll
see and finally the hot news today have
to do with the Nexus 6p failing a bend
test terribly there are two videos in
the links of the description showing you
why it seems that because the battery is
at the bottom of the phone the logic
board is at the top and there is a gap
in the middle precisely where the volume
buttons are well you can bend it
extremely easily up to the point where
the youtuber claims that even a little
girl could do it which is really
something we need to worry about we
praise the Nexus 6p for its design but
it seems to be anything but sturdy so it
does lead me to the question of the day
would these bends has deter you from
buying the Nexus 6p or returning it for
example or when you just treat it with
kid gloves because in my case I would
return it and buy another phone
particularly because even though nobody
showed us how to bend an iphone 6 I bent
an iphone 6 by accident so it does worry
me leave us a comment down below what is
your case friends yes as always you know
the drill if you want to get them as
earlier before this video was filmed be
sure you follow us on out
comments a structure to a channel as
well and follow me on twitter i
underscore d better on instagram at hind
every better please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
