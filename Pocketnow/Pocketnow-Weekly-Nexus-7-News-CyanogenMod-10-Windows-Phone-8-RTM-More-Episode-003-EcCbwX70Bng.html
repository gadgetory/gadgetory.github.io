weekly hello and welcome to episode 003
of the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss news and opinion from the world
of mobile technology that's smart phones
tablets phablets and everything in
between I'm your host Michael Fisher
contributing editor at pocket now and
I'm joined as always by our managing
editor and Tandy Nagy good afternoon to
you good morning and it's refreshing for
the first time recording this podcast
it's not midnight here in in Europe a so
I'm finally drinking coffee at 6pm
instead of midnight but it's good to be
here hi everybody I'm very glad you I'm
very glad you are and and also our
editor-in-chief Brandon minimun good
morning to use her hey hey hey guys hey
we are yeah as Tony mentioned we are
recording at a slightly different time
today so it's been it's been a lot of
fun to try and get everything together
but we are in a bit of a time crunch so
I kind of want to just jump right into
this but before we get to our topics I
want to talk about the podcast won't
have a little meta moment we're on
episode 3 episode 003 which i always
sounds awkward when i'm leading into the
show but it's i want to make sure we at
least have a hundred episodes before we
do something different here so that's
why that's a thing that I'm stuck on but
we're still very much in the
optimization phase and I just wanted to
kind of communicate with our listeners
very very briefly and say you know we're
still working out technical stuff I mean
we're still working out levels and and
the equalization and and things about
that we've I think we've got our
distribution pretty much settled we're
now officially in the zune store is that
correct Tony everybody can just go on
the zune client search for pocket now
either on your phone or on their PC or
max and subscribe to the podcast it's
there it's the pocket now weekly but the
old podcast is also there if you want to
just listen back in time it is to see
how it sounded yeah yeah
no it and that's it's great so we're on
all three kind of official channels
itunes and zune and I believe Google
listen is finally crawled us but so
distribution is settled but you know
we're still working on audio stuff my
levels are still being tweaked because
I'm recording in in a sound booth that
everyone knows about and you know I made
my living doing voiceover for four years
so it's really ironic that i'm the one
with the levels problems on all of our
podcast but it's because of the
equipment i'm using but so i just want
to touch on briefly also something we've
gotten a lot of feedback already in the
podcast and a lot of has been positive
and it's been really great but we've had
a lot of suggestions to do a video
podcast that is something that we may do
in the future in the distant future but
we have no plans to do it right now and
i'll tell you why i mean i know this is
kind of get a lot of people angry or you
know why we'll do it when the time is
right and when we can accomplish it
properly we kind of we really like I
certainly really like a lot of other
other sites podcasts but i really only
listen to them because when I watch them
I usually find that I'm just watching as
kind of a split screen of a bunch of
people kind of statically staring at the
monitor there's really no added value
when you know it's it's cool to see the
person but it's just it's just almost
you might as well take a picture of each
person and put it in the different
frames and just stare at their face
because it's the same thing exactly for
an hour and a half and while you know
pets and and sisters and and and and
parents are walking by in the background
or you know whatever and it's like you
know if we can do it right like if we
all uh someday end up in the same city
we have a studio something like that you
know who knows what the future holds
like that's something where we could do
something different or if we get high
mayen on the discussion we start talking
about you know a really cool different
multimedia approach something that
nobody's done will do it that way but
we're not gonna we're just not going to
do that right now we're not going to be
these kind of talking heads on the
screen so we you know for those of you
who are annoyed by that we do apologize
but that's just where we're at
now so I wanted to make sure we touch on
that so anyway that being said uh let's
jump right in here we went snack yeah we
pleasing it's got something to say Oh
brandon has some to say I got to give up
a corner at the top of the show man yeah
that'd be that'd be fun all right up so
I've been using my android phone in a
way that I think a lot of people don't
realize they can they can they can do
with their own android phone um it turns
out and and oh this might be common
knowledge I don't think it is you can
run legacy console games on your phone
I'm talking any s8 any super nes
nintendo 64 second dreamcast and it's
very easy to do just the other day i
downloaded an nes emulator for free from
the google play store it's called John
Joh n is light and the the idea behind
this of course to keep it legal is that
you've had you had you have to own the
game or have had or have paid for it in
the past in order to play it and there
are websites out there that feature roms
that you can download and load onto your
phone and it's literally the easiest
thing I've ever ever done on my android
phone and within moments i was playing
mario brothers one you know the first
video game i ever played when I was like
six years old and I was just zipping
through these levels it had multi-touch
so it you know obviously you lack the
tactile feedback although some Android
devices let you control gamepad which is
oh my gosh that way so that would be
amazing yeah but the even Leon's
on-screen controls are pretty good so um
there is an emulator out there for every
game system and if you've purchased the
games previously you can load on
literally every or any game that you've
ever played so it's it's like the
reincarnation of you know is those
old-school platformer sir councils you
know you and you're not the only one
who's done that I I've had an emulator
called nessam I guess any sem on my
galaxy nexus and before that i think it
was on my EVO and I to I'd do the same
thing and I've got a super nes emulator
too so I'll play like mario kart but how
does that work with the roms you know is
that just like the honor system kind of
thing where you
are saying like you have to have paid
for the game in the past like you have
to have bought the cartridge as a kid
like I mean you know cuz securing the
roms isn't too hard you know it's the
same theory behind making a backup like
if you if you purchased a CD remember a
compact disc guy so you know some
listeners might not know what that is
physical media house I change yeah
you're you're legally entitled to a
copier to or I don't know what the
numbers of that as long as you've
purchased for the first time and you're
allowed to use it for personal use you
can't sell it obviously and the same
applies less let last I checked to video
games if you've purchased it you can
essentially download the wrong which is
like a copy for personal use so I last I
checked it was perfectly legal given
those circumstances we should look that
up that's uh that's actually really
really really cool thank you for
reminding me that I have that did you
have Nintendo of any kind over there in
Romania or Tony no at least not when I
was at the age of playing because as you
know or probably some of you listeners
don't know Romania was a communist
country up until late nineteen eighty
nine at that time I was nine years old
and it took a couple of years for
Romania to start to think or to head in
a capitalist way in a democratic way so
no the market was not filled with the
gadgets so that kids could drive their
parents nuts you know sometimes I forget
about that thank you for thank you for
the reminder it's so interesting to to
get that perspective every now and then
particularly when we talk about you
getting devices and stuff like that and
how the process is so different for you
to get review devices than it is for
either Brandon or me but at any rate so
jumping into to using that as a kind of
a leap to jump into Android here I
started my day going to the post office
which by the way is one of the more
infuriating things I think you can do I
don't know it really is horrible as a
technology person especially where
you're so used to kind of convenience
without people this notion of humans
being kind of superfluous to efficiency
or detrimental to efficiency and it well
anyway I it was a fine morning at the
post office but the I don't want to talk
about the post office the point is I was
there so I could send out our give
why phone to our giveaway winner we we
closed the the samsung galaxy s3 give
way we had a winner from Pennsylvania in
the United States her name is Ashley and
so her phone is on her way to her at her
dorm I think she's in college so it so
it's it was awesome it was just a really
cool way to kick off the day I've never
given away a phone before personally it
wasn't my phone to give away obviously
was pocket knives but I was in charge of
the giveaway so that was so much fun we
should get her on the podcast when she
receives the phone nozzoli cool idea
yeah that is an awesome okay look at
this we got ideas and things cool well
yeah anyway I just wanted to say that
the that contest was very much fun it
would be great to do more of that in the
future I'm sure we will obviously it's
not something we can do all the time I
want to talk a little bit later about
the dynamics of running of running a
running a giveaway and maybe not on this
episode but on another one but anyway it
was a lot of fun I some of the
methodology we used to to pick the
winner was fun because I've never worked
with a random number generator before
and that's how we kind of selected the
winner from the qualified submissions we
received there were over 1300 of those
by the way they're still sitting in my
inbox so every time I go to my pocket
now mail account it says 1334 which is
great like somebody's writing you emails
exactly right like somebody wants to
talk to me but anyway it was it was a
lot of fun and the keeping with the
android thread the Nexus 7 I got a
device I got a device in the mail and it
was my Nexus 7 and it's sitting right
next to me here and I don't think I've
told Brendan that yet so yeah it came
and I am one of the lucky ones to have
received a 16 gig Nexus 7 before it sold
out you got the last one I got the last
one yeah yeah before the store was was
cleaned out that's that's kind of really
cool i'm going to talk about how i love
my Nexus 7 at some point in the future
not now but the news right now is that
still as of just a few minutes ago you
go to the Google Play Store you try and
buy a nexus 7 at 16 gigs and it is sold
out you can get an email notification
when it comes back in stock are either
of you guys surprised by this I mean I
feel like almost that maybe this was a
planned thing that they made a limited
quantity for this reason I i think that
they expected people to grab the lower
price but then people quickly realized
that 8 gigabytes is not enough in fact
the unit that i have is eight gigabytes
and i was thinking oh you know it'll be
enough i don't you know i'm not gonna
put media on here I'll stream everything
and then one day I go to update my
facebook app and I ran out of storage
and thus cannot update my facebook app
noches a which is like I'm like wait is
this 2012 I have run out of storage
would hope what is this and and the
reason was because I had several seven
hundred megabyte games that i was i was
testing during the review like shadowgun
and such so i had to go through with an
ex and remove all of those awesome games
so yeah sixteen gigas is the way to go
and I think that a lot of people realize
that and you know when people think to
android tablet they're like oh four or
five hundred dollars and so when they
thought when they looked at the nexus 7
pricing they said well 250 is still
quite good and you know get that extra
storage so there was huge demand for it
yeah I think that's that spot on III
just Ike Ike have been burned by that
storage thing so often now you never
ever ever think you're going to use as
much storage as you actually will I'm
sitting here doing them i'm using the my
macbook air to do this podcast outline
and it's like I've frequently routinely
have to delete stuff just so the thing
will function without giving me
notifications that I'm losing space on
my on my boot drive so it's yeah I could
never even think about going with an 8
gigabyte tablet and and it's it's such a
big decision when there's not removable
storage like you know it's funny you
mentioned your laptop Michael my my
desktop computer I have a hundred and
twenty eight gigabyte solid-state drive
as my primary and I run out weekly and
its really frustrating when I bought it
I was thinking there's no way I'll ever
come up I don't you know I store media
on a secondary hard drive and I was like
there's no way I'll ever you know max
out the capacity and I've done it yeah
so so and then and then with the
ipad when I have a 16 gig I would
download like two or three movies and
it'd be it's a up static you know the
the capacity is fall and I'd be very
upset so I think the the lesson here is
that if you cannot change the storage
pretend like you need a lot and and pay
the slight premium for the higher
capacity model because you probably will
run out agreed I mean it's just like
anything else it's like you spend a
little bit extra money up front to be
happier for a longer period or more
happy in the long run and storage is i
guess like the prototypical example of
that of course if you're gonna buy a
galaxy s3 and you're choosing between 8
16 or what is it actually 16 32 and 64
gigabyte go with the smaller capacity
because because you can cut a memory
card slot yeah get a memory card which
is far less expensive than upgrading to
the higher capacity built-in model yeah
what are you working Tony your daily
driver what's your what's your capacity
on on that whichever it is well I'm
about the only person I know who doesn't
run out of space and I'm about the only
person I know who finds it enough to
have a gigs of space of storage space to
get back to the example of the macbook I
had the 256 gig version i have 2 33 my
ex pc i had a 32 gig SSD before i sold
it and I still had 15 gigs free my phone
is completely mm-hmm sorry empty so I'm
not I don't have that many mp3's or
music or videos or games I'm not playing
games at all so for me eight gigs is
more than enough so this is why I have
no opinion on this just to answer your
question I don't find it surprising at
all i think they produced about the same
amounts of 16 gig and a gig version of
the nexus 7 which is that people need
more more storage because as i listened
to you guys you have lots of multimedia
content and lots of things of stuff on
your devices just like Jaime showed me
in Barcelona his 64 gig iphone was
almost full and my 16 gig iphone still
had 14 gigs free so it's just a matter
of perspective on how you're using your
storage how you're used to playing for
in
I have relatively cheap and fast
internet in Romania so I don't have any
music files on my iPhone and iPad
because i'm streaming from the cloud
that's that's that's interesting because
there's there's sort of two divergent
futures where and they're kind of
competing with each other one where
everything is streamed thanks to the
wide availability of fast bandwidth and
cheap and with and then the other and
you see that with Spotify and Netflix
and the success of those services and
even zune which has a really cool
unlimited download streaming thingy and
then there is the other other part of
that which is you know you're going to
download everything and Google Play is
download everything they don't have a
streaming option and itunes is kind of
split you know you can stream from Apple
TV movies but then you know if you're if
you have an iPhone you download songs
you download movies you download
everything so where do you guys think
the future is going in terms of this but
between downloading and streaming I'll
tell you I mean it jump right in here
because I have been trying to use
streaming only services for the past
week or so because I've been reviewing a
couple phones at once and I haven't been
swapping my memory card very often so I
find myself out with a review unit and I
don't have my music on it so I'm like
well crap so I'll fire up Spotify whose
new app works pretty well and I'll start
seeding mean it is but i'll start
streaming until i have a network problem
even on LTE sometimes it can't handle
you know I can't keep up with the with
the rate that is required for some of
these songs and that is especially true
in the subway system here which is does
not offer ubiquitous coverage so I am in
a situation where I'm in a very you know
I obviously a pretty advanced city full
of technology firms and young people who
value technology so I'm in pretty much
the best environment possible yet I
cannot be I cannot exist as a streaming
only you know consumer I need to have
local storage so i think that the future
is heavily streaming based but I think
we're nowhere close to that yet
especially when that's true for me in
Boston and you know it's it's got to be
true for somebody into
moin you know yeah yeah and and for me I
I have a slightly different existence
than you I never ever take the subway
and the only time where I lose service
completely is on a plane and I don't
like to too much so but but for me what
happens is that for example i'm in my
neighborhood where literally fifty
percent of my neighborhood is LTE fifty
percent is 3g and sometimes i take a
walk around my neighborhood and i plug
in to spotify and i'm listening and and
not only do I lose the the stream which
is incredibly annoying when you're about
to get to a climax of a song and then it
stops um not only do I lose the stream
when I'm transitioning from 3g to LTE in
a lot of cases but when I step down to
3G and I'm in the part of the
neighborhood that has 3g only yeah it it
stutters a lot and it's really
frustrating so I think another problem
there is the ubiquity of higher speed
networks isn't isn't there yet it's a
lot better and they need to get some
cell phone towers in those subway
stations completely agreed but but also
I feel like it's a nap architecture
thing too because and this is not
conclusive I just this is just me
riffing here but I find that Spotify
will skip more often than pandora will
for example like pandora for me it offer
a very very good buffer and it's I mean
it's you know handling that stream with
much more alacrity than even the new
Spotify app so I feel like there's a
there's a an appt architecture question
that has you know that requires some
investigation there so you can tell you
my opinion because I really don't have
what I mean I do have one but it's not
gonna be the same as yours that which
means I disagree well that's good please
do the thing is I have spotify set to
extreme quality and streaming on my iPad
or on my iPhone or even on my android
phones and I am really thankful that I
live in a region where I have very very
cheap and high-speed Internet I will
however put some offline content on my
devices whenever I will go for instance
next month to Berlin to avoid some huge
roaming costs but as as far as I'm
concerned whenever I'm in my home town
or in my home country I
don't need local storage basically I can
lose my laptop my phone my tablet and I
will only be regretting the hardware
itself all my data is safe it's online
and I can pick up a new phone and
continue where I left off now that is
interesting blanketed by HSPA in your
hometown Tony in an hour yes we have
advertised seven points 2 megabits per
second but the averages in at around 3.5
anywhere up to 5 so I never picked out
ok cool I since you mentioned tablet
I'll just I'll just drop this in right
now since and since i've spent about two
days with the nexus 7 now i may have to
eat my words at some point in the future
when I said that I found your idea Tony
of carrying around a 7-inch tablet as a
phone ridiculous I still think it's
ridiculous i do but it is less
ridiculous now because I've now laid
hands on this on this device and put it
in my cargo pocket and things like that
so anyway when I got the the original
galaxy tab which was about the same size
the Galaxy or the Nexus 7 it was the
wintertime and so I was wearing a jacket
and inside there was a jacket pocket and
for about a week I thought I was super
geeky it had been at 3g so I was able to
access the internet I would take it
around with me everywhere and you know I
would be waiting in line at various
places I take out this tablet and at
some point I thought started to think
you know I could achieve the same
results here meaning having a big screen
experience if I just bring around my my
smartphone it's not you know I just I
just need to hold it closer to my face
and effectively I'm a bigger screen
right right that's the way physics works
right first fatality yeah you know what
are you talk about the original Galaxy
Tab yeah wow yeah I remember being at
the coming-out party for that thing yeah
anyway we'll talk more about that in a
while we got it I but I've been carrying
around the nexus 7 all around town or
doing the same thing that you did so i'm
waiting for the buzz to wear off and
waiting for the love to to cave in the
in another sales related news the the
instill on android the galaxy s three as
past 10 million units sold Tony I don't
know if was that you who wrote this one
is this uh it was me okay so this this
may mean shipped 22 carat to carrier
partners or it may mean actually so
actually units sold it is actually unit
sold yeah so and they were protecting
there's a related story which is the
first one attached to this piece samsung
was expecting to sell 10 million galaxy
s 3 units in July so it looks like
they've done just that is anyone really
surprised by this i mean it's it's
pretty phenomenal but it's i'm not
surprised it's a great phone and it's
had a lot of buzz to it there's there's
so much marketing dollars behind this
thing combined I mean there there's
there's so many stakeholders in the
galaxy s3 and you know usually companies
when there when they collaborate on
something with verizon samsung or
Microsoft and Nokia they they share the
advertising budget so you get this
compounding effect where there's just so
many ad dollars you see you go to any
website on the internet right now any
tech website you'll probably see a
galaxy s3 yet you see them on
Billboard's on TV soon and and that
starts to change advertising's effective
when there are good ads and and so
people are buying this thing people know
about this thing in fact I was talking
to a few non-technical friends the other
day and they say what foner using I say
the galaxy s3 other they're like oh I
know about that which is very surprising
that you know such a new phone it has
that has that recognition very it's
working yeah very much so and I'm
actually wearing for this podcast a
galaxy s3 t-shirt that I got at the at
the launch event that is a complete
accident but I'm just realizing it now
there's a lot of swag out there there's
a lot of you know stuff that is branded
galaxy s3 and even though people don't
always get the name right I feel like
I've mentioned this before they'll be
like I'll be like yeah what android
phone you're thinking of upgrading to if
your stick with android know you know
the galaxy I'm like okay well which
which one do you mean and you know
they'll in the past couple weeks they've
been pointing out the galaxy s3 when I
bring it out of my co this yes yeah the
three Wow but I feel like it's I feel
like that's enough of a coup that
Samsung has really gotten the word
galaxy the brand galaxy into people's
heads
but speaking of that same device you
brandon have run a build of what is it
cyanogenmod 10 on your Galaxy s3 yes I
think last podcast i was fantasizing
about what that would be like yeah and
that came true for yer pretty quickly
doesn't it yeah yeah and jeez uh I'm not
I actually switched back to the Galaxy
Nexus and I'll tell you why in a minute
but it's been awesome i'm using the quad
core version and web browsing is
ridiculously fast and head on the video
yes and end at first it's actually kind
of funny when i first put the
cyanogenmod 10 preview on my galaxy s3
everything was working except the phone
and people thought that was kind of
funny because you know I they call me
and they couldn't hear me and you know
for me it was kind of worth it because I
you know I can just text them later but
they fixed the phone issue the only
thing that doesn't work now I think is
that the camera sometimes doesn't work
but you know who needs that anyway even
with two cameras camera icons right yeah
it's got two camera icons because one
time some of the time one works and so
many other but it no it's good good
enough to use as as a daily driver in
fact it's it's the it's made it the
fastest phone I've ever used bar none
and and I think yesterday i found a
tweak on XDA to disable the capacitive
buttons and give you the Galaxy Nexus
like on screen soft keys the soft keys
and that's interesting because you know
the screen on the galaxy s3 is so big
you can afford to give away some pixels
to the on-screen controls but some
people kind of don't like the capacitive
buttons and you get the back button on
the right side instead of the left and
then and then you don't get the
permanent multitask button so you have
to tap and hold so I kind of liked it a
lot except the problem was that it had a
lot of side effects so I had to I had to
reverse that and that's not quite ready
for prime time but but yes up engine mod
10 on the galaxy s3 if you're rooted out
there it is it is awesome and it
fast real fast it is good to hear that
ringing endorsement I mean I met I
always think it's odd to see a stock
build or a close to stock build of
android such as cyanogenmod 9 or in this
case 10 on a device that you frequently
see or only see officially with a skin
on it so I always think that that's kind
of this weird there's this weird
disconnect that goes on in my mind where
I'm like ah that's galaxy s3 where's
TouchWiz oh it's running something
awesome and yeah I'm perhaps predictably
not going to be doing that because I
like TouchWiz oddly enough the new
TouchWiz but I was really glad to see
that video when i was when i was seeing
what's what's gone on the past week and
they're fast that team will make you
know they'll don't build new stuff would
it what is it the nightlies that come
out every every day yeah and that's also
interesting because every day there's a
new building you're like oh should i
flash it and if you flash it you know
and and and you just wipe your dalvik
cache you can basically put the new
system on the new the new files on top
of the existing so you don't have to
start all over um but then this is like
a delta update almost yeah it is it does
work like that the best case scenario is
that you wipe your device completely
which you know i would plan to do every
month or so because they're you know so
many nightlies and they're usually minor
updates but it's good to get a fresh
start once in a while but you know I'm
kind of new to the nightly build thing
and I kind of there there's like a
changelog and I can kind of see what has
been changed if it's worthwhile and
sometimes I'll wait three days sometimes
I'll do it every night it's kind of kind
of fun so it's it's an interesting
concept these nightlies is is there an
equivalent thing Tony you just finished
reviewing the PureView 808 which is up
on our site as of right now is there an
equivalent kind of modding community for
symbian I know nothing about symbian
because it's been such a so absent from
the United States I don't know I don't
know and i'll tell you why ever since i
started reviewing phones obviously when
when us editors or reviewers are taking
a look at a phone we are taking a look
at the out-of-the-box experience how
does that phone behave the
way the OEM the manufacturer intended it
to and throughout the years I've gotten
so used to only working with the stock
experience that somehow along the way I
lost the need completely to flash to
customize too deep tweak and I'm I'm not
afraid to tell you this i'm using all of
my phones in their stock setup whether
it's windows phone symbian apple android
everything is out of the box and if that
means OEM update one year from now then
that it is wow I that is I I actually am
surprised to hear that because I'm in
the same boat you know we talked about
this last week as well and I think you
know Brandon I could I could feel
Brandon's open sneer on the other side
of his microphone but like I you know it
Tony you're like you were the one who
gave me a hard time about not not
rooting my galaxy nexus do it like I do
it what don't do what I do oh oh yeah do
as I say not as I do exactly the thing
is that yeah I I don't need to have
something which is faster because the
galaxy s3 is fast and it's enough for me
and that I don't know point2 of a second
I don't see it and I don't mind if i
push the home button and it takes me one
second to get back to the home screen
I'm not that of a geek for instance as
Brandon is no no hard feelings here but
the thing is that yeah I'm stuck and you
know what's my happiest moment of the
day when I run out of battery on one one
of my phones and I'm just picking
another phone up from the desk random
one and I'm just continuing to do
whatever I did on the other film because
everything is set up the same way on all
of my devices even the icons on my home
screen and if i were to completely flash
continuously tweak and do stuff that
would be meaning for me basically not
using the phone i would be basically
only flashing and not using the phone
for emails for stuff like this i had a
discussion i think it was last year or
when i think it was on the podcast that
and I think I'm going to read my
tutorial about this we are not using
their phones for what they are intended
to we are then of course it will be a
polarizing topic but we basically power
users geeks all they do on their phones
is just applications tweaking extreme
tweaking and flashing there was an
interesting research done three or four
weeks ago 0 2 in the UK told us that
basically making phone calls and sending
text messages is only the fifth or the
sixth thing which people do on their
phones yeah these are phones yes they
can run applications but you don't spend
your entire life in Word and Excel in a
game on Twitter or on Facebook a phone
is for phone calls and the the addition
of running applications is something
which should improve your mobile life
but right now we're kind of lost in our
phones if that does make any sense well
yeah but will it seems to me though
weren't you referencing that story that
said that like phone calls and texts
were like the did you just say that like
the fifth or sixth most common thing we
do like they're not they're not at the
top of the list right and from what I've
seen people make phone calls at around
seven eight minutes per day this and
this we can also refer your refer to
your editorial with where you talked
about texting instead of ever talking
yeah you know what it depends from
person to person I would rather talk to
somebody then write to somebody so yeah
for me a phone is a phone and the
addition the fact that it can run
applications makes my life easier but
I'm not lost within my phone see I get
that completely I think we have to keep
our eye on first of all you make a
really good point about having to keep
our eye on the ball as far as regular
consumers are concerned and we don't see
phones the same way as kind of the
average Joe and we kind of have to for
the purposes of reviews kind of put that
those those those glasses on and be like
okay I need to now look at this from the
point of view of an average consumer but
that said even even the average consumer
like stuff is moving away from from
voice you know and it's moving away from
this kind of this is a phone and a phone
first the mentality which are you
which I'm really not sad about Bob
viously because of you know our
divergent views on voice calls but you
know I I feel like that and that study
bears that out where it's like yeah
voice calls just a few years ago where
King and now they're now they're they're
just another accessory and they're less
important than even apps it's why people
can walk around with custom roms you
know like Brandon was just saying and
not and and you know it's like well the
phone application doesn't work and
that's not a deal breaker because that's
not what I use my phone for it's a
pocket computer now instead of just a
phone yeah there are people who care
about that increase of speed that I
don't know that point something of a
second which makes the difference from
instance to almost instant and then
there are the people who don't really
care or don't really know that Shirin or
don't really know how to do it and we
can all yeah everybody's all we're all
coming at this from different spots and
that's one of the great things about
about this business I feel like like my
father will often ask me the same
question about about writing for pocket
now or for tech sites in general to be
like well is there enough I just can't
imagine there's enough there's enough to
talk about and I'm like no dad that this
is such a massive landscape there's so
much going on every day there's so much
there's so much new happening and so
much to consider about the old that's
happening or that's not happening
anymore that I mean and there's room for
all kinds of views here that's why I
feel like we're we're a pretty good mix
here on the podcast we have all levels
of geka to dat at different fronts so
but moving on I want to I want to just
throw a mention here while we're talking
about jelly bean that the galaxy s 3 and
s 2 are rumored to get jelly bean soon
the official versions of course exactly
yes the official versions the non that
the non-scientist and jobs I you know I
think that in light of it neither the
fact that HTC just released a list where
they basically torpedo to any notion of
Android updates for a couple models I
think that's really really reinforcing
Samsung's position as not just a bringer
of new products but as a you know like
maybe a customer a customer service
improvement on their end and i agree inc
yeah
I think it's a I think that gesture is a
lot bigger than it appears on the
surface because what I picture is a
company that cares so much about their
their flagship line and the previous
flagship that they've they've rallied no
that's not the right word they've
devoted tremendous resources they
probably have maybe a hundred engineers
or 50 engineers allocated just to
getting the customers the latest version
of the Android operating system which
will make the customers feel
tremendously valued and the fact that
they're going to pull it off in such a
short period of time that's amazing and
that that makes me want to buy a samsung
product in the future because if I want
me to get updates sooner than you know
HTC you or LG's gonna send out the
update absolutely yeah no I was
surprised to read it I mean I was
surprised to read the headline when I
just thought it said you know Samsung
Galaxy s3 to get Android for that one
soon but when it said if you know the
addendum that says galaxy s2 is like
what you know that you know your old
phone is gonna get the jelly bean update
at at almost the same time I mean that's
that's crazy that's all let's let's not
forget that the galaxy s2 is still among
the top five phones in the Android land
so it's it's an excellent phone it still
outperforms many of the quad core phones
on the market at the moment and aside
from that yeah let's mention that before
the galaxy s3 the galaxy s2 was
Samsung's best selling phone so it's
just normal the two best settings phone
best selling phones for samsung are
getting the jelly bean treatment and
it's just normal we're talking tens of
millions of users here that is that's a
really good point and I feel like that's
a good illustration of how easy it is to
lose perspective of the global market if
you're in the United States I don't know
Brandon I won't speak for you I'm sure
you knew about this I really the galaxy
s when it first premiered the first line
in in the summer of 2010 I think it was
that was eye-catching to me but the
galaxy s2 went completely unnoticed by
by me and most people that I that I know
because there were a lot of offerings at
the time from they were boring offerings
but HTC had had a few and you know other
companies were bringing stuff out I mean
I wasn't even conscious cognizant of the
galaxy s2 really here in the states
except insofar as the
ridiculous elements were concerned like
Sprint's ridiculously named the sprint
samsung galaxy s2 epic 4g touch 30 just
to complete your sentence Samsung is
doing a great job now but this thing has
to be said samsung did a lousy job in
bringing the s2 to the States I mean it
was launched in 2011 at the IFA in
February and if I recall well the
state's got it somewhere in q3 if i
recall well anyway it was at least four
or five months difference between the
International and the US launch but for
the galaxy s3 I don't think it was even
a month of a difference and this is the
way they should do it and I'm glad that
they have finally learned from their
mistakes and they are listening to
customer feedback at the end of the day
people are dying to put money in their
pockets yeah i think the galaxy s and
the galaxy s2 especially the two was
practice for samsung to basically have
control over the carriers so that when
the time was right with the galaxy s3
they could say hey this is what you're
gonna do and if you don't do it then
you're going to be the only carrier
without a galaxy s3 you're going to lose
out on a lot of a lot of customers so
they think this is part of the plan and
now they they're in this pattern where
you know galaxy s4 comes out same things
can happen with the three and you know
there won't be long confusing names
anymore and that that was probably a
nightmare for samsung marketing but it's
a thing in the past yeah agreed i say go
on Michael oh sorry well I I mentioned a
bit of that and the piece I wrote called
Samsung is in it to win it where I was
like well this feel the feel of this
launch this galaxy s3 push is different
from anything that's come before and it
yet took Samsung a long time to earn
that kind of cachet that right to say no
we're Samsung this is a galaxy s product
and you're going to do it our way
because it's going to work out best for
either for both of us and you just need
to trust us and the you know certainly a
lot has factored into that go ahead Tony
that Samsung was so so against apple's
policy and they ended up doing exactly
what Apple does and if you see Apple
products they're the same across
carriers there's no carrier
customization
the hardware looks the saying the
software is the same and Samsung is
finally achieving that which speaks
greatly highly of them yeah agreed and
while we're to talk about Samsung just
wrap up android this is we just I just
posted the new Galaxy Nexus LTE after
the buzz episode which is the fifth
episode of that series I'm happy to have
done so and I hey I had a little gap in
the midst of the of the video hold on
just it just to make sure we're on the
same page Tony you do not have a Galaxy
Nexus actually you you said that you
haven't even you've handled only only
one a couple times not own a Galaxy
Nexus and I handled hi Mase Galaxy Nexus
when we were in IFA I know when we were
in at the mwc in Barcelona this februari
okay and Brandon you've got the HSPA
version yeah uh well Jaime stole my HSPA
version so I'm using them I'm using the
verizon version handled I handled
Brandon's Galaxy Nexus through Jaime I
see okay um well I i forgot Brendan that
you were in the same boat i was i'm just
i was glad to finally kind of get that
off my chest i really was excited about
doing that after the buzz episode and
the Verizon Galaxy Nexus has just been
such a wonderful Android device and it
just would have been a wonderful Android
device all around if they had if only
they had not marketed it as a Nexus
device I talked about that on the video
and yada yada but at one point of the
video I mentioned in error that this was
a one and a half year old device the
on-screen script i was using said half a
year old device and I just screwed up
because I was tired and I don't know
what you guys I want to hear what people
say about you guys in the videos on all
of our video reviews because it seems
like all of us have like there's always
commenters who we're jerks as always
commenters who are awesome and but I
feel like there are common threads and
the thing that always comes up for me
always every single video there's
somebody is going to say it is that I
look high every time there's always at
least one person is like dude you need
to not you need to not smoke weed before
that's that's because at one point one
internet moron stuck that label on your
forehead and everybody picked it up and
they just no beating it yeah I know I
know you know but hold it here's the
thing I also i watch the videos and I I
as most people know as I think I've
mentioned before I make a fair amount of
my income my livelihood acting I have I
do camera acting work as well I've
watched myself before I should buy
revidian in the booth and pretty
horrible lighting conditions with a
really awful camera but i'm also always
exhausted because i shoot these videos
like early in the morning or late at
night and it's stupid so I know that I
look ridiculous but I it's it's just
hilarious like I can do a countdown
every time I post a video I'm like okay
the video is going up at 11am by 1148
the first person will have come along
and said dude lay off the the toke Piper
but I just made up a term you know what
the problem is Michael the problem is
that they are not looking at a michael
fisher review they are looking at a
phone review and that again internet
morons and I'm gonna keep on saying this
until they drop they will comment on
everything they will comment on your
walls on your t-shirt on your whatever
you have on your desk they will miss the
point it's it's about it's a video which
is ten minutes about a phone and they
will comment about one thing Michael's
red eyes or dude that guy only has Apple
products okay leave that aside it's not
the Apple product review it's the phone
is a pure view it's the whatever but
it's it's been go ahead Brennan and say
so he'll make my plastic yeah I was
gonna say I think that the reason why
you look under the influence of a
substance is because you just happen to
have a bigger what's the word um eyelids
oh oh I've larger eyelids that's gonna
be the next comment thread right yeah um
no I mean you kind of have like I think
Billy Joel actually has similar eyelid
swear his eyes always look kind of like
not one hundred percent open because the
eyelids kind of cut I'm not I'm not you
know saying that it's a you know it's a
problem or I'm just I'm just trying to
figure out why people are saying that
you high all the time hello
but anyway I think I think it's time to
move on from this yeah before we do i
wanna i do want to mention that when i
first started posting videos i was kind
of advised to do not worry about the
youtube comments because they tended to
be really really negative and we've kind
of oscillating back and forth between
those i feel like there have been a lot
of positive youtube comments as well and
i like those but you know I want to just
say that I always say at the end of all
my videos and I think some other people
do too if you want to leave a comment on
one of our videos you should leave it on
the post at pocketnow.com because
they're whether they're good or bad
that's not really the issue it's just
the volume of youtube comments is so
high that if we were to answer all of
them it would just be kind of ridiculous
and we would need like a dedicated
person for that we don't have that so
one word of warning if the internet
morons come to pocket now with their
usual comments I'm gonna make sure
you're gonna be bad so here's moderation
bucket now there's no moderation on
youtube we got Tony Tony the guard dog
is gonna be like taking care of our
comments as usual and actually Tony's
really great because I'll come back
after you know after a long night or
something like that and I'll just be
reading the comments and my articles of
the day and there will be someone who
has posted something you know nasty or
something and within a few minutes Tony
Tony's has popped up and be like hey you
settle down and I love that thank you
for being our guard dog Tony I want to
move on to Windows Phone where we're
coming up on on a little little time
crunch here there's not a lot going on
with Windows Phone in the past week we
did tho have Nokia's numbers released
which I kind of want to talk about first
they I were you guys surprised at these
numbers when when nokia announced that
for the second quarter of 2012 they sold
four million Lumia devices i was i was a
little surprised because i didn't think
it would be that many am i completely
off base or was this i know they're
still losing money like crazy but you
know was this kind of a surprising win
for them in your eyes Brandon it kind of
represents windows phones I guess market
share in general it's it's it's
substantial but it's relatively small
um so I I think that this number
probably was mediocre news for Microsoft
and for nokia and you know if it were a
lot higher he could have done a lot of
good things for windows phone as a
platform and if it were a lot lower it
would seriously call it the question the
viability of Microsoft strategy and
certainly Nokia's so um but I to answer
your question I think that a 4 million
was above where I thought it would be
you too yeah yeah I didn't necessarily I
don't know what about you Johnny I'm
were you surprised disappointed pleased
no I'm how to say this equidistant is
that the word in English I'm your kind
of ambivalent yeah something like that
i'm looking at the numbers from from an
objective perspective windows phone on
nokia hardware has been out for like
nine months i think october last october
and for millions and nine months is a
low number considering the galaxy s3 so
10 million in two months or even one
month and the iphone is selling like
raising millions over the weekend but i
think there's the need for a bigger
picture here we need to look at from
another perspective nokia has been
doubling their quarter-over-quarter
numbers they started off with a million
in the last quarter of 2011 than 2
million q1 and now 4 million q2 as a big
picture considering also the fact that
Windows Phone has still a sub 2 digit
market share four million is a great
number but let's not forget it's 4
million worldwide that's a very good
point yeah it's good to keep that to
keep that in perspective and I you know
at some point I want to have I want to
do some kind of in-depth analysis of
Nokia's Nokia's kind of cash situation
and stuff like that and this is all
business stuff that goes beyond me we
talked to we touched on it last week a
little bit we don't have time to talk
about her too much today but it's it's
really interesting to me now that we
have this kind of data that everyone on
Windows Phone fan sites has been batting
around and saying well we just need to
get the numbers for this quarter and
let's see what it is and i agree Tony I
think the trend is really really it has
some potential what do I want to say I
feel like the trend is encouraging
Brandon you also make a good point you
know they have this is a substantial
share but it is still a diminutive one
and something which needs to be also
addressed and I think people didn't
quite see this coming and or at least I
haven't read about this q3 will be
crucial for nokia because while being in
q2 microsoft dropped the x and they told
everybody that current windows phones
including Nokia's will not get Windows
Phone 8 and that's why I'm saying q3
which is gonna be crucial for nokia
because it's gonna be that quarter in
which they will realize that people do
or do not care about updates if their
sales are stagnant or they're going up
then people do not care about updates
and they care about good hardware which
nokia is also the best hardware which
i've seen for a long time if sales go
down then i think microsoft and nokia
have a problem which they need to solve
ASAP because if sales are dropping again
it will be pretty difficult for them to
to rise them up again above the sea
level if I may and q4 before the
holidays when when Windows Phone 8 is
going to come out and that's a really
good segue because that we have this
other story where the windows phone 8
rtm is rumored to is rumored for a
november or a September or November
debut we have like a couple conflicting
rumors here I feel like and Tony you
wrote this one as well where it's like
you know we heard September November but
Stephen Elop said that Lumia sales were
going to get a boost by Windows Phone 8
coming in october so it's like what
what's going I'm not I'm not I'm not the
person who questions Mary Jo Foley
sources everybody's got their sources
the sources might be right or might be
wrong when rtm hits it's not the
important issue the important issue is
whether the Nokia Microsoft relationship
is that strong so that Microsoft could
allow themselves themselves to to give
nokia a certain amount of time say two
weeks one month then advanced of other
OEMs so for instance really like
if if the rtm hits in November and we'll
be seeing nokia windows phone 8 in
October I think that'll piss off other
hardware makers like HTC and Samsung and
I'm not sure the Microsoft wants to do
that I'm not sure they want to lose any
partners sure but what what are they
doing I mean what does HTC and Samsung
done in the past six months with Windows
Phone that's been at all interesting
anything I haven't seen it you know some
on which market if you're talking about
the US market then you have the the
focus to you have the Titan to you have
lots of great hardware which never ever
made it to Europe and if we're but yeah
I mean it launched here but nobody cared
really I'm you know you know what I mean
like it SAT here it wasn't pushed by
AT&amp;amp;T certainly the Titan to wasn't given
the time of day by their advertising you
know department compared to the the
Nokia push you know these companies were
well aware that Windows Phone 8 would
dramatically change the specifications
for further hardware so I don't think
HTC wanted to to make some
groundbreaking product when they really
couldn't they can't make a you know a
high-risk green they can't take
advantage multi multi-core processors
nokia was really the only company that
could innovate on the hardware and they
and they did it with with just amazing
hardware and HTC and samsung are
probably waiting 22 for windows phone 8
to show their stuff right so i guess my
question is then like HTC and samsung
have released this stuff like you're
pointing out Tony and yeah like
Microsoft would probably get would
probably really annoy them by giving
nokia a big head start with Windows
Phone 8 but but I guess my question is
due to HTC and Samsung make enough of a
difference to Windows Phone that they
deserve to be that that Microsoft should
really heed that that warning I think
that that depends just want one one
sentence Brandon I think that depends on
Microsoft and I'm gonna say this try to
put yourself for instance in Peter Chou
shoes if you are at CES and you're
launching the Titan two and then Europe
starting preparing for in an Android
lineup which is the one the one x the 1s
in the one be where do you spend your
R&amp;amp;D money and all of your company
efforts in in HTC One X which is prob
going to sell millions or in the HTC
Titan to which is probably gonna sell
below 500,000 units yeah yeah yeah that
that that makes a lot of sense the HTC
and the rest have to prioritize to to
the previous point of giving Nokia an
advantage you know Microsoft has already
done that but it will not do that to the
detriment of significant detriment of
its partners because if Windows Phone
cannot exist in a world where nokia has
failed and where HTC and samsung and LG
and whomever else make windows phone
hardware are mad at Microsoft and don't
want to make hardware because Microsoft
has has finded them so it's very much in
the interest of Microsoft to keep these
companies happy but but I think sorry go
on I I just think that that that is true
in the world that we have seen so far
but we have seen a very different
Microsoft especially with this surface
stuff whether they've taken the
manufacturing of the surface in a house
and I think their partnership with lumia
is is excuse me with Nokia is very
important to them and I wonder I wonder
if we will see some some microsoft
sourced windows phone 8 hardware maybe
sooner than we think and whether this
kind of thing where they have to dance
they have to tiptoe around HTC and
samsung might not be the case for much
longer I'm just kind of thrown spaghetti
at the wall here if your name is HTC or
Samsung and for instance you are losing
Microsoft as a partner and you're losing
those units which you are selling you
are entitled to say a big man because
you have all the Android phones which
are selling millions but if your name is
nakia and you're losing Microsoft are
you losing my Microsoft's market share
then you're really gonna die because
Nokia doesn't really have a back-up plan
even though Stephen Elop says they do
have a back-up plan amigo they abandoned
it symbian is dead so it's either
Windows Phone all the way for for nokia
or or nothing else but HTC and samsung
can easily live without Microsoft
Windows Phone because as long as they
sell millions of Android phones which
are good then they don't have a problem
good call well it's yeah it's gonna be
interesting to see
but what goes on with that I want to
keep a close eye on we're obviously
going to keep a close eye on okay but
personally I'm very interested in seeing
what they do that's uh if we can move on
to to iOS real quickly there's really
not much there's there's always
something going on in the iOS world but
the Nano Sims allegedly confirmed for
iOS 5 this is an interesting story I
really hope this is not the case Isaiah
as a chronic phone switcher I hope that
hits not the case but Michael have you
ever cut a sim to a micro sim sighs
that's the thing I had to run all over
town because I didn't have a sim cutter
at the time to do this review for some
phone that I forgot and I had to put my
micro sim into an adapter and and all
that stuff and it was just such an
enormous pain so yes I have done that
but it was annoying yes I well when I I
don't have a sim cutter I just get wire
cutters and I you know I it's a little
risky and I've actually messed it up a
timer to um you can actually just cut it
with scissors and you just got it
doesn't have to be the exact shape like
you know you can have a half a
millimeter off and it will still work
and and and what's what also is kind of
cool is that if you're using a phone
that has regular sim and you have cut
your sim into a micro you can finagle it
to properly line up with the gold
contacts context yes with Mike with nano
SIM that will still be possible but the
occurrences of people accidentally
slicing off one of the gold contacts in
an attempt to get a nano-sized is going
to increase but yeah I want to be able
to do that because the nano SIM is forty
percent smaller than the micro sim
itself so while the micro sim contains
only the chip part of the normal sim the
nano SIM will be even smaller than the
chip itself on the micro sim well I
don't think that's right i think the
nano sim complete it has the same size
context but it completely removes all of
the white stuff and the white stuff is
stoked there on the micro sim a little
bit of it like a millimeter border and I
think the Nano San just takes away that
millimeter border that's it's that's
fascinating III don't know I was burned
I i had a review unit that i had to do
that my
Chris him into some sort of this foa
dapper thing where i put it into the
spent shell of another sim and there was
tape involved and it was very very it
was it was very back alley like chop
shop kind of stuff and then i had a real
hard time getting that sim out of the
review phone when it came time to send
it back to the manufacturer so I any new
standard that comes out where it's like
yeah we're going to we're gonna change
Sims again for the second time in two
years when it hadn't changed for you
know what like 15 years before that I'm
annoyed by and just kind of reflexively
opposed to in this uncharacteristically
afraid of change way like the
grandfather on the porch you know I
forget that dang old technology my
newspaper and whatever I just want
regular I just want one sim standard and
if that's nano sim fine then just make
it happen overnight please I'm really
tired of this already forget that we are
evolving and the a we have evolved from
normal SD cards to mini SD and then to
micro SD is just normal that at one
point will get smaller and smaller sim
cards and SSD drives have became smaller
and smaller up until a moment where
where they solder it to the motherboard
so the the the trending technology is to
have smaller sized larger capacity chips
and it's I'm not sure there's gonna be
anything else after nano sim but the
trend is definitely to go smaller and
smaller please no embedded Simms please
no oh god sprint is already doing that
and it's so irritating it's the worst
it's just well it's fine for people that
you know use a phone for two years and
but for those of us that switch phones
like we switch on just it's not biolog
my friends do it the European Way no
because then I then I you know it's very
difficult to get an unlocked device that
can support LTE here or you know that
has the proper bands and stuff usually
the unlocked ones for the HSPA ones that
are quad jerk now what's that can I be a
jerk now please be a jerk now that's
your problem well said well said jerk
speaking of standards and iOS
bull is going to move to a 19 pin
connector kind of everybody everybody is
aware of this that this the smaller dock
connector is probably is basically a
lock for the new iphone there's going to
be talked about this we've touched on
this briefly we don't really have to
talk about this I just wanted to mention
it Apple is going to make a killing on
on accessory adapters okay yeah if you
were business model exactly if you were
ever thinking of a time to get into the
accessory business two months ago was
the time and you should have started
making these adapters because it's it's
going to be incredible how much money is
spent just to make existing hardware
work with this new connector I'll
probably most likely include included
adapter for free i think i don't know
that doesn't seem like something doesn't
seem like something they would do but it
seems like the right thing to do it's
just it's just funny that you know
Daniel Webster who is on our staff and
he asked me that was back in 2011 that I
think towards august or September to
somehow get him two adapters from the
normal 40 pin connector on the iphone to
micro USB because he wants to charge by
a micro USB end up I looked in Hungary I
looked in the Belgium I looked in Spain
and and I finally found two adapters
this year when i was in london for the
galaxy s3 event and i sent it to him but
now he's gonna be all over me for
another adapter yeah that that's a
that's a part that i don't think many
people know exists it's a micro USB 2
230 m 30 pin yeah that's a very handy
thing but that's only available in
europe we have to mention this because
the european commission came out with
the with the law if i may use this
layman term a directive in which the
standard for europe as far as charging
his concerns micro USB so then everybody
has to align with that an apple had to
align with that by producing an adapter
right and i'm glad that that happened I
mean I you know their policy arguments
to be made on either side of that but
there's something there's a really
powerful case to be made for standards
particularly when it's something is
integral is charging and
it's we did something sort of similar in
the States here but it wasn't as I feel
like it was a couple of years ago but it
wasn't as a far-reaching as the the UK
solution so it was like so microusb sort
of became a standard as a result of I
guess market forces here more than more
than anything legal right but I'm glad
that it did because it's really nice to
be able to be out with friends or
whatever it's like well my phone is
dying and I really need to borrow your
charger you know nine times out of 10
it's going to work yeah it's a it's a
great feeling yeah but this also calls
for another discussion another topic on
battery charging battery capacity you
cannot charge every battery with the any
charger it has to be a certain amount of
current a certain amount of amperage
which goes through through the battery
so I think this should be a topic for
another podcast yeah yeah we talked
about that yeah because the atrix HD in
particular which i've been using
recently it has a very very peculiar
taste in what current it will accept but
we will we should talk about that and
another one as a matter of fact I've
just made a note about it magically
let's see really quick to as we start to
wind down the podcast here we had a
piece called five things you didn't know
about pocket now Brandon wrote it
recently a couple days ago it was a
really cool piece I haven't seen really
anything like it in the tech space at
least not recently and Brendan just
briefly can you tell us how the idea
came about two to post that piece
because there were a lot of comments on
it there still are yeah I was kind of on
the fence about it and I was passing it
around to a bunch of you guys trying to
get your opinion and some people said
yeah posted some people said nap people
don't care they don't you know get on
this is that's me right um but you know
the truth of the matter is that there's
a lot of energy and resources that goes
into pocket now and I don't think people
fully realize that I mean you know it
it's a site and there's pictures and
there's text but all of it occurs with a
very not very complex but rather complex
system that involves multiple systems
and lots of communication
and then there's this whole business
aspect of it which you know it's almost
a little dirty to talk about it but I'm
happy to talk about it in pocket now is
made possible by ads we've got a fair
amount of full-time staff that that need
to eat and I need to eat and we've got
contractors that need to get paid and
we've got ad revenue that supports it
all and the ad revenue bid is
interesting because I think people don't
understand exactly how ad revenue works
in the way it works is that it's
impression based then it's the same way
it is in you've named your favorite
magazine or newspaper it doesn't matter
if you click on a net it kind of does
matter but for all intents and oh I hate
that phrase and all for all intents and
purposes it doesn't matter what it
matters is how many impressions there
are so every time you load a page on
pocket now you see three ads you
generated three ad impressions and you
know are so our key metric to optimize
is maximizing the number of AD
impressions should we want to say stay
sustainable as a business and so so I
you know I wrote this article kind of
explaining this and and fortunately
people appreciated it as a kind of
behind the scenes of you know how does
this all happen and and the the article
goes on to explain out how it happens so
I'm glad it was well received and I
really hope people appreciated the
background and I think they did and you
know I just checked the comments on it
before we came on the air today and it
really am there was a lot of like kind
of gratitude there was a lot of open
speculation about stuff you know
discussion topics that were raised by
the things that you've you talked about
and I I personally would like to see
more of it and i've been batting around
a couple ideas in that vein so we may
see more of that in the future if if I
or anyone else on the team can come up
with something more you know something
has interesting the the other thing that
it was on misc I don't really want to
talk about hey there's new BlackBerry
PlayBook that might be coming out how
excited are you guys man yeah let's
let's talk about that never no actually
that's that's not that's too cruel I
there are things about the playbook i
like and i would like to snap one up but
we'll talk about it on another podcast i
want to jump into two minutes I don't
want to do as much of a debate this week
there's
there's not a lot that um that we want
to debate about at the moment this week
I have an interesting question we
featured another story kind of a
behind-the-scenes thing about what we
carry on the pocket no team what our
daily drivers are it was called here's
what devices pocketnow staff are using
and I noticed as I looked at this
article which I contributed to as we all
did we all almost without exception
carry phones on the top three platforms
and that's to be expected where a
smartphone site I mean in the top three
platforms or iOS Android and Windows
Phone my question to you gentlemen which
will constitute our two minutes apiece
bit today is if you had to carry a
smartphone that was not on one of the
top three platforms what platform would
you choose if you want you can say what
phone would you choose and why well let
me start let me start okay Brandon you
may start you have two minutes ago okay
this is gonna be kind of disgusting but
I would use the pixi plus nice because
there's a lot I don't like about the
pixi plus but there's a lot i do like
about it for example it works with
Microsoft Exchange which is the sort of
email that I that I use and and most
importantly it it has such a cute form
factor the keyboard just for me has the
perfect amount of click that it is
tremendously satisfying on I used it for
like you know a month back in the day
when I was reviewing it on sprint and
you know we had slowed data's fees are
all these problems but I was abandoned
typing with with the pixi plus it was a
little slow but it generally kept up it
got all of my email it had the apps that
I needed and it was just it just fit in
my pocket like there was nothing there
in it and it just felt like this little
mini powerhouse that that you know no
one really liked but you know I had a
little i had a fling with it to be
honest so pixi plus for me Brett um
listeners Brandon and I just became just
became best friends you have borne
witness to a shift to a paradigm shift
in the pocket now team that's wonderful
I'd never would have in a million years
expected you to say any web OS device
but
least of all a pixi plus good for you
sir pixie pixie greetings and mobile
accomplishes nicely done um Tony as
mentioned I'm gonna be very short
because this this is very easy for me as
mentioned in my here's what devices
pocketnow staff are using I am currently
using the Nokia 808 PureView as one of
my daily drivers I have two mobile
numbers so I'm doomed to always carry
two phones with me but right now one of
them is the Nokia 808 PureView because
well go on read the review and you'll
find out by but I need to tell you this
I absolutely love the phone and it's not
only because of the camera the camera is
an important feature of the phone but
nakia Bell X Symbian Belle it's very
usable it has I mean it shines through
the relationship between nokia and
microsoft there is not only full
exchange support which which I'm always
glad to see because i'm using exchange
but there's also sharepoint there's link
there's Excel Word office onenote so
everything you need to be productive
that plus of course the free nokia
services for maps and the voice guided
navigation which is fully offline and
fully free those make up for a great
decision as far as I'm concerned I'm
happy with the ETA 808 PureView it's
it's got great exceptional build quality
but if you want to find out more just go
onto pocketnow.com read the entire
review and you'll find out with a plug
at the end very nicely done sir I you
know I have to confess I sort of
anticipated your response because i had
read your review just before we came on
the air which is a great review and
agree with Tony you should hop on and
read it listeners it's a really really
great comprehensive review of that phone
my response will be very similarly brief
and unsurprising to anyone who knows me
my platform of choice would be webos
even in spite of its current state of
disrepair the March to open webOS is a
long one but I would carry the the pre
three because when i received it when i
bought it right after the webos collapse
and the prices kind of skyrocketed i
nabbed one very quickly and when i
unboxed it i will always remember i
wasn't working for a tech side and I
wish I
were because I would have just done a
whole day of unboxing videos and review
videos and I was so in love with the
phone because it was everything that
everyone on webos had always wanted and
it came about just just about a month
too late hetz hey add to that point I
don't know if you know this Michael and
this I guess will be probably the final
mix we have to wrap up open webOS
happens like this year or early next
year right where there's source codes
released correct correct and I was
watching a podcast I think or some sort
of video from webos nation and they were
they were mentioning I didn't know this
but if it's true i'm gonna i'm going to
jump onto the ceiling that open webOS
will have support for arm devices and
will thus be portable to android phones
yes I open webOS throws away the custom
web OS kernel that they were linux
kernel that they were using and switches
to a more standard Linux kernel so yes
that should be the drivers should be
able to support that Wow yeah I believe
me I mean I am I already have like three
or four videos and written pieces just
ready to go when the open webOS becomes
a thing and I really hope it doesn't
fall off the rails do you guys remember
that news post it was I think just about
the time when when webos got killed by
HP that one of the early devices and I
think it was the touchpad one of either
production prototypes pre-production
prototypes shipped with Android on board
you remember that yep yeah yes sales i
think that's that's part of your
question Brandon we will be at one point
able to run web west on the samsung
galaxy s3 oh I'm looking forward to
running it on on a lot on a host of
devices but you're right Brenner we do
have to wrap up and I could talk about
web West forever but we won't in the
future that we will I want to talk about
it for a long time when it becomes
relevant again marginally so I want to
wrap up this week with a piece of
listener mail this is awesome it's not
our first piece of listener mail but
it's the first one that asked us to some
questions so let's just get right to it
this is from Daniel Daniel I'm going to
butcher your last name like I do to Tony
every week I'm sorry
believe it's Daniel Bell do seda but Bo
diosa de la voz de Velde Isetta he says
hey there I've been a big follower of
pocket now for a couple of years now
wanted to tell you that I really liked
and enjoyed the first episode of pocket
now weekly thank you very much sir I'm
from Costa Rica and I have two main
questions for you maybe you can even
answer them on your next podcast I am
really interested in getting a nexus 7
tablet but the google play store just
won't let me because they're not
available here so do you think they will
be available in sites such as Amazon or
any site like it I mean I definitely
think so personally I just a gentleman
you probably know more about this than I
but I would think that that would be a
foregone conclusion yes yeah definitely
I mean the Galaxy Nexus well that's I
guess a different scenario but yeah I
think it'll eventually be on amazon and
if you want one right now just go to
ebay and you might pay a little bit of a
premium but if you wait until all the
stock is back in and availability maybe
a month from now you'll probably get it
slight have to pay a slight premium on
ebay but not not by that much plus there
are those third-party retailers a
tailor's like our good friends in the UK
clove and a neck we electronically to so
you should be you should be well covered
yeah yeah yeah I think you'll have more
than a few options Daniel there and I
have to tell you I love mine so far
Brandon of course did the official
review you can consult that but I really
it's hard for me not to recommend this
device to people even after a couple
days but I'm keeping my mouth shut until
I get up get past the initial glow it
down you get a second question I own a
galaxy s2 the i-90 100g do you think
that jellybean is going to be available
for us to devices anytime soon and we
just discussed that earlier on the
podcast it looks like that is going to
be the case pretty soon Daniel Daniel
listen to me be a man go to go to go to
your favorite development site root your
phone and get jelly bean on it today
it's it'll be stable as the phone app
will work and and you'll get jelly bean
today just do it do it do it do it one
word one word of warning though it's the
90 100 G if yes I understood well that's
slightly different
from the 90 100 which is the
international version you have to check
whether it's compatible with grams out
there so be on the safe side and due
diligence read the feedback yeah agreed
yeah and I think we've just decided that
Brandon minimun should have a should
have a recurring column called be a man
yeah please please allow me to do that
that's awesome and is Daniels kind of
snuck in a bonus question here can you
tell me where Jaime Rivera is from his
accent sounds very much like mine
speaking English haha i am going to get
this right this week hi Mei is from
Honduras or at least he lives there now
he's from there originally right
gentlemen yeah cool Daniel there are
your answers thank you so much for
writing in we really appreciate it yeah

listener mail read on the air gentlemen
