pocket now calm the Samsung Galaxy Note
is an awesome phone it's got that huge
screen it's got a dual-core 1.4
gigahertz Exynos processor and it's got
pretty good battery life to boot the
problem with the Galaxy Note is that
it's running TouchWiz well what if you
want stock Ice Cream Sandwich better yet
what if you want something better than
stock Ice Cream Sandwich like
CyanogenMod 9 well it's ready for use in
this video I'm going to show you
CyanogenMod 9 on the samsung galaxy note
let's get to it so this is still
technically an alpha but every bug that
I found in previous versions of
CyanogenMod 900 for the Galaxy Note have
been worked out so this is good enough
plenty fast enough to use as your daily
driver and you get all of the cool stuff
of Ice Cream Sandwich that look in the
field of raw Android plus a lot of
really cool enhancements provided by
CyanogenMod 9 so let's talk about what
we have here this is the stock Ice Cream
Sandwich experience we're gonna dump
into the settings in a second just want
to show you that this is indeed the look
and feel of Ice Cream Sandwich as Google
intended it and there's actually a
really cool piece of functionality with
the stylus of course we don't get all of
the S Pen applications but you can still
use the stylus and interestingly if you
can see that let me zoom in a little bit
on the screen the pointer a pointer
actually shows up on the screen even if
you're not touching the screen I'm not
touching the screen right now so you can
still use the stylus to move around it's
kind of a novelty at this point you can
download some handwriting applications
and it will work and you get the mouse
pointer but all in all the functionality
is pretty much gone because you don't
have the s-pen widgets and so forth
anyway let's go into the settings and
take a look at some of the stuff we get
with CyanogenMod 9 we get the trebuchet
launcher which allows you to do all
kinds of fun stuff with the homescreen
for example you can set the grid on the
home screen or the number of home
screens which you can't do
stocke Ice Cream Sandwich you can change
the grid size so you can really take
advantage the Galaxy Notes high-res
screen for example if we go back home
you'll see that I've got a grid setup so
that I can fit a ton
by cons whereas stock ice-cream sandwich
or on TouchWiz you only can have like
1628 ons whatever it is we'll jump back
into settings and by the way here's the
stock Ice Cream Sandwich multitask UI
and it works just like it does on any
other stock Ice Cream Sandwich device so
let's go back into the launcher and see
what else we can do here tons of
settings we can enable the persistent
search bar or turn it off if you just
don't like the look of that we can
resize any widget which is super fun we
can scroll wallpaper the list goes on
and on on and on we can have a
transition effect with the app drawer
and finally there are some general
settings such as auto rotate screen
other things that you can customize
typical for CyanogenMod is themes and
some system settings we can change for
example the status bar up here we can
show the clock or not show the clock
which is cool we can have the battery
status show up I have it kind of low and
battery there we can have an icon that
just has an icon or we can have it
hidden all together if you don't care
about battery life and you don't want to
be watching it the whole time you can
just remove it altogether and if you
also don't want to have the the signal
up there to show how many bars you have
you can take that off but I kind of have
that hidden I kind of like to clean and
look up there and there are some other
things you can do there are also some
performance settings down here that is a
that has been added with CyanogenMod we
can change the CPU speed which is kind
of fun so built-in CPU adjuster thing
that's probably not the right term so we
can change the CPU governor to
performance and have it run at fourteen
hundred megahertz the whole time this
will kill your battery but it's kind of
fun to see how fast the phone runs I'm
going to put on demand which scales it
up and down let's take a look at web
browsing performance here in CyanogenMod
9 so we're gonna go into the browser the
totally stock Ice Cream Sandwich browser
experience let's go over to engadget.com
a long web page we get the stock Ice
Cream Sandwich keyboard everything stock
it's just it's great stock plus a little
bit more because you get that
CyanogenMod 9 features so we're gonna
look at the mobile site really really
snappy performance here in the browser
even though this is still an alpha this
thing flies and it just feels really
good in the
so we can zoom in text clears up very
quickly and you get that beautiful view
because the screen is so big on this
phone and all other apps work previously
the camera didn't work right YouTube
didn't work all of these things have
been fixed in a latest alpha your phone
has to be rooted of course and once you
root your phone it's very easy to swap
roms on this phone there are some other
cool roms out there we'll put up some
links to xda-developers where you can go
to get this ROM and once you get it it's
easy to install again as long as you're
rooted and you'll all be off and running
with stock ice cream sandwich which
feels a lot faster on the samsung galaxy
note if you like this video please give
us a thumbs up and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
