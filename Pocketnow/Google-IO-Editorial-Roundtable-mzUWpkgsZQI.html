everything for everybody else my god
Tony what time is it in Romania is happy
Lord well let's start with a roll call
good whatever to everybody this is hi
Mary welcome parking now along with the
rest of the pocket our team we are
talking about google i/o the event just
finished around 30 minutes ago probably
40 and aside from a lot of coding and a
lot of technical talk that only Joe
understands thank you Joe let's go
through let's go through a roll call of
everybody that's here mr. Anton Dean
onshore editor-in-chief how are you good
morning good afternoon good evening
everybody I am tired but I am excited
about everything that I've seen today I
am happy to have you on the show dude
it's just so hard since you're pretty
much asleep at the time that we've had
these roundtables before it is good to
be here finally and yeah I really great
it's great Oh how's the Porsche that's
good mr. Joe lead by how are you senior
editor it's great to have you here oh
it's a great day for Android this is a
great day for Android and we can't wait
to hear your particular opinion on
everything that just thought because
you're the only one that understood the
half of it man I mean as the show is
like half code and everything else was
for the rest of the world then mr.
Michael Fisher our own editorial
director how are you I forget your
titles are doing very well well that's
all right my title you know is it
dynamic and changing a fluid thing like
we all are as humans and as beings of
light and Duncan I can't believe by the
way the only reason I drink this is
because Michael Fisher got me into this
but anyways aren't you our chief news
editor mr. Stevens Schenk how are you
and fun how's it going it's going great
we've got a good day but we don't really
have much time for the show we have a
lot of coverage coming up a lot of
editorials we have full video coverage
on everything that's happening Michael
is that the show floor right now by the
way you was at the event and so let's
just try to give a little rundown of
everything that was talked today there's
a lot on the floor how about you mr.
Stephen shank how would we like to start
with I don't know android l let's be
with that it's definitely made the big
news out of the i/o keynote at least
four users are concerned we got a
preview today of what the next new
release for kendra's gotta look at the
whole thing isn't arriving to the fall
of the Developer Preview is coming out
tomorrow so Def's to get a head start
working with all these changes and
really there are a lot of them here we
have this new look for her and right
here the material design of bleep around
here a little bit this is like you
really like jeans and it goes into jelly
be like them but a lot to get through
here into the new look we have some UI
tweaks new way of describing how apps
will have their interfaces to allow a
better expansion between devices the
same apks will run on do android TV
getting yourself ahead of ourselves here
as well as on phones or tablets we
learned about expanded notification
options changes to the lockscreen chrome
a lot of stuff more technical things
like battery improvements and this moved
art how that's going to improve the way
apps Ron and a little talk about gaming
as well looking at some of the graphical
improvements going to Android it's a
heck of a lot here cool cool I mean
Michael you were at the events how was
the I was the vibe at the show how was
everything for first I needed to unmute
the microphone I'm sorry about that bump
so I need to make it clear that I'm at
one of the extended events it i am in
cambridge i'm at MIT or right outside
MIT where google has an office and i've
been surveying things from there and i
love coming to this office it's a lot of
fun add but the thing is the mood here
has been sort of diametrically opposed
to mind the entire time during the
Android wear segment most particularly I
was in like rapt attention thoroughly
enjoying everything I was seeing and you
know being mildly aroused by the whole
thing I was really really into it and
during that maybe 35 minutes of time
about half of the auditorium I was
sitting in kind of like pick that
moment to go get a sandwich there's
always food at Google events so like
I've I've been existing in this world
where like no one else is excited about
the things I am because this is you know
a developer conference and I think a lot
of the people here this isn't a very big
Android town like this isn't a very big
Android office so it's been a you know
they've been excited about the other
stuff Google's nice I wouldn't assume
for the Android TV stuff in and when the
developer stuff would be the things they
should razon out on Android wit or where
we're getting the sense that smartphones
are finally the public at large and yet
you just weren't seeing them responding
to it yeah you know that and that's the
thing you know I think this this this
town in particular in this office and to
a lesser extent e the industry as a
whole it has this as a much broader take
on a lot of this stuff and you know we
all at pocket now get really jazzed
about the consumer level devices because
you know it's like that's the stuff
that's the for us i think is easiest to
get excited about i don't necessarily
want to talk long term strategy and and
and business competitive tactics and
that kind of thing i want to talk about
this new thing i can wear that'll make
me make my life easier or at least make
me feel like I'm living in the future
and I think that's the cool stuff but
you know that not everyone is into the
same thing so I mean no hey maybe I
maybe I need to grow up I'm not going to
do it well speaking of wood and I would
love to get your everybody's opinion on
this what do you guys think of the whole
material design I think that's probably
one of the biggest things I mean we we
really didn't think or at least I
particularly didn't think we were gonna
get a revamp than you I and it's quite
significant and funny we've kind of been
using it on google+ probe forbidden ever
since the application got updated a
couple of weeks ago it's pretty much the
whole element of the material you I I
don't know what do you guys think let's
how well you haven't been using good
plus nobody's been using Google+ don't
lie to us yeah I have Oh Joe you're like
the only guy with Tony what do you think
the process first and see that we're
seeing something strange here which is
strange in a good way I I think that
Google didn't necessarily have to update
its user interface because the stock
Android interface was good and apple on
the other hand who really needs to
update something on user
interface and that will probably not do
it and they didn't do it in the past so
I think that the new user interface from
Android L which is going to be either
lollipop or something else is a welcome
it's a breath of fresh air it brings you
something new but this brings me the
question I would like all of each answer
what do you guys think will happen to
OEM skins now that we have this great
looking stock vanilla user interface on
Android oh yes just screw it up well
haven't we gotten a statement already
from at least one OEM HTC has addressed
this matter with us where they've said
that they're going to keep up with the
changes the clock starts now they're
going to be rebuilding that the skin
around the new thing I mean isn't that
is that your question I like our OEM is
reacting well to it that's part of the
question but we could put it more
brutally if you want would HTC this
sense would Samsung's TouchWiz just to
get the stock user interface in the
hands of customers or what Google
require OEMs to do that now that if DUI
is polished no I really don't think
we're going to see OEMs ditch their
their third part of you is for this I
mean yeah there are some changes here
some of them are more significant than
others but there's nothing here that's
going to cause a manufacturer to do an
about-face on their their strategies
with regard to Android I don't think the
only things that we did see was there
were some hints dropped regarding how
how dynamic colors are going to be
brought in how images are going to be
able to programmatically you're going to
be able to pull an image color out of an
image and use that and they kind of
dropped some hints about how some of the
more thematic elements are going to be
able to be applied throughout the entire
OS so rather than seeing a custom skin
we might start seeing more custom
theming done which then goes back to way
back in the day of cyanogenmod when we
have that theme engine from t-mobile if
you guys remember that that's still
there running at the core of the
cyanogenmod roms we may see a shift from
you know TouchWiz or a sense UI over
more to a custom theme with a custom
color palette that's
using the the android l framework if you
will for lack of a better word so you
think that that sense for example would
turn into just a theme and no longer dig
into the rest of the UI that's our junk
I'm hoping that that's the way it's
going to go and then that will leave
om's a little bit more able to develop
apps and to build a little bit more
around the notification shade and some
of the other elements in the device
they'll spend less time working on their
skin and that's really the wrong term
for it but we'll go ahead and use it and
they'll spend more time giving us value
rather than just a brand or some kind of
a marketing gimmick that helps their
diff I stand out from the other because
I'm hoping android l will have all of
that functionality built in and it works
for everybody yeah and anything about it
I mean like for example out of
everything that we saw I think that HTC
Sense is probably like the UI that looks
the most like Android L should I say
well that and I also just got off a week
of using that asus padfone x and it
looks an awful lot like what we're
seeing with android l the long way books
a long like android huawei one looks a
living the LG g3 like there's a point at
which you know you have to acknowledge
that trends move in a certain way in
design and it doesn't matter what
company you're talking about like you
know the circular to toggle elements and
you know unified sort of color banding
at the top of certain apps like these
are not things that have been stolen for
me anything it's just everybody's kind
of doing the same thing that the field
is narrowing quite a bit yeah you guys
can hate me we had this like common over
at the chat as we were going through the
keynote of obviously there you can't say
you can't say that iOS doesn't look like
Android I mean the notification shade
for example even if they don't look
alike the idea came from Android and in
that same way ever since we've seen that
change in iOS 7 where the top bar
changed into a specific color and then
the rest of the UI elements became
around and we kind of see this a little
in android l though obviously there is
it's funny my group Michael was saying
of how it went away from being
skeuomorphic Android and now it came
back to being
morphic with that whole paper sort of
elements I don't know if you guys are
very then it didn't come all the way
back yet came it came half way back so
yeah we went to a totally flat area for
a little bit we're still a lot of
manufacturers are still in the midst of
making that change with their UI skins
but now we have we have stock Android
saying okay but we do want to
reintroduce a little bit of dimension to
it and so that was you know that's kind
of interesting to see it's interesting
you know intervention being the school
morphism here because when i first saw
android l my initial impression was very
negative with as far as the the sort of
emphasis being placed on transitions
being able to show the user what's
happening you on screen elements let you
know leave those ripple effects and
stuff when you're touching things I'm a
very pared down you I guy I like to
touch something and see changes
immediately and transition star my bag
but I also realize it's kind of a you
know retweet ivory tower position to put
yourself in where you need to have deep
understanding of how the system works
learner to appreciate how to work with
it I think what the changes are seeing
with el it's going to be even if it's
not you know the note app looks like a
notebook in order to let you know how to
interact with it the way that on screen
elements are going to move around are
going to help some guide users through
things even if we're not seeing explicit
school morphism there are still some
visual decisions being made to to guide
users in the right direction I think
that's a beast and Dave now Michael one
question to you since you were at the
show what so why is it being called
Android L listen I mean we came from a
transition of cake names and pastry
names you know kick cat and key and you
know into L they have you any idea why
they call it android l um you don't know
but I Tony had some wonderful
speculation and the chat about this
because and I think it's one hundred
percent right and I think Taylor backed
you up on that Tony what was your
explanation for that I don't remember
that oh I'm sorry that I'm it must
have been tailored and then you agreed
with him or we all agree with him I
because they want a more professional
sound too this that's when I first no no
I think that they're still seeking a
partner like like KitKat to to partner
with on this show Jose laughing as
though I've just said something idiotic
well show you disagree you think this is
going to be a droid I think you can cope
with it okay Android L we Noel comes
after k so it's obviously the next
version of android we don't know if
that's 4.5 we don't know if it's five
point oh they really didn't tell us and
I haven't seen anything to that end
what's different from today versus
previous releases is we haven't gotten a
release yet we've gotten a preview and
most of the time in the past it's gotten
its its pastry or its sweets name when
it was released so I'm wondering if in
the fall when Android L becomes a real
thing and is available to end users if
we won't then get licorice or lime or
whatever else L could stand for I'm all
for Lima Bean but I don't think they'll
go that route or 11 hi 11 pi when I
lemon meringue sure so I'm wondering if
L is just the internal one because it's
still a developer release for now and
then when it's finally released that's
when it will get its traditional sweets
name and the statue outside of the the
Android building on the Google campus I
hate before before we move on because I
know we have to wrap up this segment in
order to go to the next one now this is
more aimed at Joe and those who are
interested in technical details I won't
go into art belviq and the other ones i
have the simple and user question we've
seen the new user interface we've seen
that it solicits the CPU and the GPU for
all those layers and shadows and
everything now the phones on the market
today like vm eight like es5 the g3 and
the z2 will have no problems running
android l probably last year's flagship
didn't have or will not have problems
either what about mid rangers what about
those phones who will be in the cheap
segment those who will be aimed at the
emerging markets how will those cope
with android l and all these changes
well specifically we saw today what
Android one that's going to be thar
get it specifically to these emerging
markets and combined both with KitKat
and with android l we're seeing more of
a push over there a lot of the devices
that I've been testing have had kind of
lower end specs and run KitKat just fine
one of the very underutilized things
that all of these devices have inside of
them is that GPU the graphics processing
unit and up until just recently that's
been there primarily for games and not a
lot of the whole user interface apps and
your home screens and just stuff that
you do to interact with the device
itself as we're moving forward and
making this progress we're seeing more
emphasis put on that GPU and a lot more
of what used to be handled by the CPU
shelved off to the GPU so now you've got
these two different components working
in concert and you're more than doubling
the the processing power that you had
before because that GPUs gun under
utilize the second half to that question
and it might segues into it is the
difference between dalvik and art and
art according to what we saw today has a
2 x speed improvement over dalvik on the
Nexus 5 at least the Android L version
of of the art runtime environment so
what you're saying for instance if I had
this one mini the original one or ds3
mini or s4 mini chances are that aight i
will get android l as an update or b i
will get angry what is an update or see
HTC or Samsung my just abandon these
phones I think the likelihood is the
latter everyone's not going to be an
option for existing phones I don't think
about Google's trying to really
streamline this thing to talked about
choosing the specific hardware and even
get companies that sell the hardware so
that om scan just put a phone together
real quickly sort of like the industrial
version of project all right it's not
the same any other a few things coming
together row one on it you're done so I
don't think we're going to be on to
existing and it was a hardware reference
platform and you don't want it it's like
it's really interesting Android one is
sort of like it's like if Google wants
to take you know it wants to take over
feature phones like completely
and they're like okay don't you know
oems forget about the software we will
deal with the software we will give you
software updates will give you
everything just build a really cheap
phone and we will make sure that the
operating system runs on it and they
will take care of everything we were
talking about skins a little earlier I
think so a big part of the direction of
choosing for Andrew it's smaller
companies an option to have a stock
Android experience as conveniently as
possible to maybe discourage them from
you know cooking up some half-baked
scheme just for the sake of having one
say no no do this it's easier yours will
like it better so I feel like while some
of these the bigger companies with their
own skins they might live on to one
extent or another we're not going to see
much of that at all on the lower I think
a lot of users love that and another
advantage of and ruin one that they
mentioned is they're going to have the
same update mechanism where updates come
directly from Google just like the Nexus
family of devices in Google Play edition
devices so where these smaller companies
might not have the resources to maintain
and update their i'll call it bloat i'm
happy to call it bloat put that in the
hands with Google Google will take care
of all of the updates and push them down
through their existing services so that
frees up these the smaller especially
emerging markets to be able to make
devices that work in those emerging
markets at bootstraps and then it gets
them going now one question and
particularly for Michael and back to you
Joe as well did anybody hear anything
about 64-bit processors that was like
the big push that we were waiting for um
you know you right right well I mean got
64 bit but we didn't get 64 bit
processors per se we didn't hear
anything about hardware or any partners
that are coming in with 64-bit anything
we didn't get any announcement there it
was just kind of like an afterthought oh
hey by the way android l and the new art
compiler their 64-bit and everything
that's already out there and artery
written is just going to work fine and
hey let's move on to the next slide
where it was kind of interesting that
nothing was announced there it was
almost like an afterthought it sits
there and it works and developers don't
have to do anything it's just going to
work
by moving on we had all this big now
just repress cosi companies and going
back to last fall these SOC s are
confirms just a matter of when they're
going to show up in devices so now with
the Android 64-bit software side all the
pieces are in place just a matter of
who's going to be first to come out with
a phone it takes advantage of right but
Jen and SOC first in front yeah well
anyways I are we missing any things
particularly from Android L aside from
the designs you all from the only have
like ten minutes left then we have a lot
with exactly and we have a lot more to
talk about I mean what else are we
missing because I really want to talk
about Android wear I haven't eaten
before we move into that and with this
can segue into that the new one locking
mechanism when when the phone doesn't
require you to enter your PIN when you
are wearing your watch and if you take
off your watch then the unlocking
mechanism switches back to asking for
your Bend I had this question while I
was watching the stream live Bluetooth
has a range of up to 10 to 15 meters if
I just take off my watch and put it to
the side it will still be connected to
my phone my phone will still see me in
its range so I think that it was either
an exaggeration well the presenter took
off his watch and the phone has for the
pin or there's some hocus-pocus there
which we didn't hear about your business
if a guy run out of the you know of the
stage and just running out to all the
way to the back of the event I thought
you didn't see so either he turned the
watch off or had a Faraday cage or there
might be some some proximity sensing
going on where maybe the device is
looking for the signal strength of that
Bluetooth connection and saying hey it's
getting weaker and weaker and weaker I
know that that device is getting further
for the way and maybe there's some kind
of a toggle where it's 5v 10 feet 20
feet as estimates before it finally says
okay you're too far away and it locks or
it could be just if it's within that
whatever the theoretical maximum limit
of that bluetooth device is but they
don't know they just creep on dude its
books are sitting at a table sharing a
meal or a beer or something and
I reach over the table to take your
phone and I don't need to unlock your
phone cousin I'll still see you ya boy-
that's today morning point is it or
you're some guy in the ball are two and
they just walked by the table pick it up
go over the table next door you don't
know it's been stolen but it's still
within range of your watch are they
going to have access to all of your
information because it's unlocked point
is if you don't have if you have a
commanding wife and you don't live in a
mansion where you can just stick your
wife at some point at the other end of
the building or something the thing is
going to know your you know it just
won't be able to tell the difference
obviously it's something that that we
have the test but the thing is we've
seen this on the Moto X already right
Michael we haven't deed yet Taylor was
make mention of that during the chat of
the actual event yeah trusted devices
it's called and it's a pretty cool thing
on the Moto X when you have a toggle you
have with you and if you get too far
away from your phone it'll it'll lock up
I think it's a cool thing and I wouldn't
as Joe was saying I wouldn't think it
was a big technical hurdle to specify
the range at which you want that to
apply I mean I certainly wouldn't
wouldn't want it to be 30 feet I
wouldn't yeah i mean that's that's no
security I mean if a guy steals my phone
and he stays in the same train car as me
I you know I don't want me to be able to
unlock it so I'm fairly certain you can
select the range but I may be wrong
probably I don't know one of the things
one of the things it's a cool feature I
just probably one of my biggest
disappointments with Android L is or at
least the fact that we didn't get
anything announced of you know all that
boys have activation features that we
currently get on the Moto X the fact
that motive that Google kept all these
patents and I don't edit it's not like
if police saw that Google is using these
patents in favor of Android to get that
always-on feature that the Moto that the
Moto X currently has well that Hardware
pennant oh hi ma'am and yes the
Snapdragon 800 has a similar ability
built into it but the Moto X have custom
computing like SOC built to support that
feature as well as some other so it's
not you know Google can't just come out
and say like hey it's going to be
available in every Android device
because these it's a hardware specific
feature well we'll see sadly Steven for
some reason God dropped
the call he should be back with us soon
I think we should segue over to Android
L but in wearables because so the point
being is one of the coolest things about
Android L is the fact that there is no
separate SDK for everything else we got
Android auto we've got android TV we've
got android wear and android on phones
and tablets and it's pretty much the
same platform the only thing that
changes is the form factor and probably
that was one of the coolest things about
Android L the fact that you will not
have you know developers will not have
to redo code I understand Joe they would
pretty much just build an application
for the phone and there will be an
Android wear a portion of it where they
can just immediately pass whatever the
SmartWatch will be able to pull from the
application right yeah so essentially
any notification that you get or present
in your app is automatically exposed
right over to your wearable you can
dismiss that notification on the
wearable and it dismisses it everywhere
else or dismiss it everywhere else and
it dismisses it unwearable so that
interaction is there by default when you
write custom code to give additional
information to that wearable you're
writing it in the same SDK in fact
you're publishing it in the same app the
app that you download and install from
the Play Store to your smartphone or
your tablet runs on your smartphone and
tablet and if you have a connected
Android wear device it automatically
gets that partner app if you will that
little segment of the app on the watch
or what a notice they didn't just say
watch they said wearables over and over
again so we could see something else
coming but it gets that that part of the
app automatically it's installed
automatically it's updated automatically
when the app on your phone or tablet or
updated as well if you want to do
something extra special and specific you
can write custom code for that wearable
but it's all part of that that app that
you get through the current distribution
mechanism and through the current
development environments and speaking of
apps on the on the Android wear devices
it was really really awesome the apps
that they chose to demo
on stage really sold the case for for
these watches because the apps on smart
watches are nothing new I mean we've
seen the month on the gear devices are
seeing them on the pebble and and
they're really good on some of those
other hardware but like this app that
was called eat24 where singleton ordered
a pizza in like 20 seconds on stage
right from his wife with no interaction
with his phone you can think lift has
built an app you can order a car hat and
Andrew all right yeah yeah like all on
the on the on the watch and then the the
cooks one the chef one where you can put
the recipe on your wrist and they took
that opportunity to say that all the
watches are going to be ip67 you know
yeah it all comes together me the
package that the I think this is going
to be one of the more better integrated
and and more powerful wearable packages
we've ever seen I think what's
interesting is what we didn't see and
correct me if I'm wrong but I didn't get
any mention of completely autonomous
Android wear smart watches and there's
been this talk about maybe a new gear
from Samsung that so everything depends
on ya ya know it and I'm and I'm glad
that we didn't because you know every
said yeah Samsung's been talking about
that and it would be pretty cool to see
like a gear were they calling it a gear
solo or whatever your stoli yeah but
like that's a very samsung thing to do
you know and I I don't mean to sound
derisive when I say that but it's like
that's a very like hey well let's try
everything once kind of thing to do I
don't see Google that in its current
iteration being like yeah you know what
let's just give it a shot and see if it
works you know it's a much better
experience when you have the phone
backing up your your your wearable I
today was all about tying devices
together and having them you work with
content from one another rather than
splitting things off and going in their
own way tell me something guys tell me
something guys is Tony the only person
in this room that is not excited about
Android wear probably yes okay Tony why
are you not excited about android wear I
want to understand because everybody I
mean we were all chatting and we were
all going crazy when it was announced
and when we saw the demo I mean I was
probably a little underwhelmed with the
what the LG G watch is display it looked
really low resolution but after I kept
seeing everything that
you can do when i saw that moto 360
being demoed my god i was drooling Tony
why don't you like it so I said it a lot
of occasions before he'll continue
saying it i will use a SmartWatch when
it will improve my life when it will
improve my multitasking way of being but
the way Android wear is now it is for me
personally nothing more than an
extension still an extension of my phone
a secondary screen and this is probably
has a lot of things to do with the fact
that Google now and all of its Dian's is
not available in my region I constantly
communicating three or four languages
every day in English with you guys in
Romania and Hungarian who knows an
Italian I can't dictate in four
languages for an email plus when I phone
is non-stop in my pocket or connected to
my computer and in the car so right now
for me and river doesn't bring anything
to be excited I don't know you know do
we want have a good point when I go
ahead skip go ahead kind of the same way
um I I realized why Google is doing
things the way it is where this focused
on using the watch more it's an
extinction of the phone than anything
else but I'm a guy who likes the idea of
software instead of services I like the
idea of the autonomous SmartWatch even
if it's not connected to you know song
the radio just the things are happening
on the watch itself and instead we're
seeing it just being used as a screen to
the cloud or to the phone or something
else it's just not the product I was
looking for but that doesn't mean that
it's not really really cool for what it
does and will be useful to a heck of a
lot of people so it's not for me but I
think it's extremely awesome you know it
could be I mean Joe correct me if I'm
wrong I mean it could be that for of a
SmartWatch to be fashionable in today's
technology age it could be that the
technology is just not there for the
SmartWatch to remain small and also be a
standalone product I mean first of all I
would how many people would be able to
pay for a secondary phone line just for
their watch when you already have one
for your I don't know for your phone
tablets ah but not everybody pays for
them I mean you have the option that's
cool to have but how many people
actually pay for four separate data plan
just for
tablets sure yes I'm feel good in pain
or an extra one for your watch I mean
that's that's every carriers dream now
we can charge everybody three times or
for whatever they have connected the
SmartWatch is a standalone I think is
missing the point and a lot of people
were asking that in the article that I
published earlier this morning people
seem to think that a smart watches a
replacement for a smartphone and in my
opinion it's really not what this does
is it's a way to augment your your
experience with either you smartphone or
tablet and it lets you keep that phone
in your pocket more it lets you keep
that screen turned off more of the time
and it lets you have this little
itty-bitty screen showing you just the
information that you need or the
information that you might not need and
can just easily dismiss right there
conveniently quickly and if you're
sitting at a table you guys can tell me
this more than anybody and somebody
pulls out their smartphone and looks at
it it interacts with it and puts it back
in their pocket the person sitting
across from you is that's just rude
right but if you look at your watch and
swipe across and you're done and you're
back to the conversation much easier
once you it's fair that those tities
here it's what it is much easier to Joe
but like for example what I think one of
the things that I've noticed with with
the with my use of the pebble is every
time that I get an alert people are like
do you need to leave these people
because I'm constantly looking at the
watch and I'm like oh ok and I don't say
anything I just look at the alert and I
dismiss it but everybody's like be need
to go is it time is it late like crap
that's my heavy burdens gonna have to
change yeah there is Republic ethic got
any issue go ahead maybe using my phone
wrong in the first place but every time
i sit down i take it out of my pocket
and put it on the table I don't trust
you know it getting scratched up or
bumped against something down there so
it's already out there for me yeah and
that's exactly my user scenario so for
me whether I just swipe on my wrist or
swipe on my phone or talk to my wrist or
talk to my already there it's the same
effort and I really find no use of
wearing some foot
not if you're driving washing dishes
walking down the street you have fun if
you have one thing and your other had
their like 400 million circumstances in
which i am not going I agree with
Michael and like for example in my case
in particular why do I like a SmartWatch
there are certain areas in the city
where I can't walk and show my phone
because it'll you know I will
immediately be targeted to be mugged so
for me to have a watch that you know
what do you what do I like the most
about the Moto 360 the fact that it
looks like any other watch you know it
looks very elegantly simplicity it
because it's it's gonna become a symbol
like you know wearing the white earbuds
like you are now that people know you
have an expensive you know ipod or
something it's just gonna oh there's a
LG G watch this guy must have a nice
smartphone under his jacket there just
yeah we gotta get we got good high my
some like sweet beats you know headphone
yeah and the motivation thing is a
really good a bluetooth connected
boombox it it on his shoulder go back to
the years those are cheap right Michael
which which which android wear product
are you getting the Moto 360 is
absolutely without question but I was
surprised to see that the gear live
you're not the gear yeah the gear live
was announced today and I think the ones
that we are getting first are going to
be the gear live and the G watch but the
Moto 360 will be the one that I probably
spend my own money on you know because
it's just that that's herbal there at is
just awesome and I'm glad to hear it's
not going to be the last circular
display they're going to use from what
we heard on stage today yeah well Tony
Tony you won't care Joe what are you
getting I'm getting the the LG G watch
just because it's going to be available
in the play store later today and
actually I'm refreshing the page right
now to see if I can buy it well all
right I think I know no I I really
really like the the Moto 360 I
especially like that it's got cheese
support built-in and even if I do get
the the G watch which I probably will as
soon as it becomes available today just
so we can get it in hand and start
getting some videos and I'm getting some
articles written about how
at what it is how it works some
shortcomings and what not even if I get
that I'm most likely going to get the
Moto 360 just because it looks more
elegant it looks more like a timepiece
than it does a SmartWatch Steven what
about you you don't care are you getting
more tea that wouldn't be the Moto 360
because come on circo displays they're
just cool any like just that it looks
awesome it's good at the most high-end
at least appearance-wise even it's a
little thick it's nice looking I mean
unless you knew to expect that it was a
moto 360 look like any other watch
that's gonna be one it looked like
another watch and it's gorgeous but one
question cuz I heard that it was a
different UI for circular displays it
helped no nn-no it's the same it's the
same UI it's just frame differently it's
just circular yep the Gators a day
includes but the SDK includes design
hints and essentially you're designing
for circular first and then it also
works on rectangular so we're going to
see more circular stuff going forward as
circular LCDs become more of a thing
become more technologically easy to
produce that's my prediction for the
future some people are still going to
want to rectangular watch and they'll be
able to have them some people are going
to want around they're going to have
them the SDK answers that question any
app is going to work on either one no
problem you don't have to worry about it
it'll just work I want to hear what
which before Stanton to carry one I want
to hear which one is his favorite back
in the pebble days in the original
pebble days I said no it's not yet for
me i'll wait for other players now we
have sony we have samsung and I said you
know what no I'll wait for Android wear
because it might be something which is
useful for me now I say no I'll wait for
you i watch because maybe the iWatch
will be something useful for me I'll
tell you straighten out nothing from the
market you guys can have mine as well ok
I'll get done it to me I'll take the 360
look I don't know I guess probably the
biggest disappointment of this event is
no hardware aside from the fact that you
can buy the g whoa
and you can buy the samsung gear live
today we did not get a smartphone we did
not get a tablet I mean the Nexus 7 has
been historically launched on google i/o
for the past two years we were expecting
either a nexus eight ER and Nexus 9
depending on the rumors and we did not
get anything oh and they have talked to
the tablets on the Play Store to which
is kind of indicative that we should be
seeing something today they're just
messing with us at this point I think
they are if if there will be a
smartphone or a tablet and or both I
think we'll see them around the time
when Android L will become final and it
will be shipping and those devices or
that device will celebrate the launch
the availability of Android L I think if
gopher if we're waiting until the fall
it might be too late for the Nexus line
I mean Android one could just be the
predecessor getting us ready for Android
silver yeah that's what everyone out
comes out might be ready we're also
likely going to have 64-bit hardware
coming out as well and I think I think
that's really where it's going to be
will have an Android silver in the Play
Store will probably still have play
edition devices at Google Play edition
and they'll be 64 bit they'll run
whatever they call the L version of
Android because I still think they're
going to do that but we'll get those in
the fall along with the new smartphones
in the new tablets that's my prediction
will ste and I guess final thoughts over
the rest of the things that we're now as
we saw Android TV which is again Android
L expanded to the television had a
really cool UI and everything but and
tailor made a really good point the
chapters we were talking about Taylor
talking about Android auto and then
Android TV the fact that you know it's
hoarsely specific on brands like Sony
TV's you know it's not like something
where you can just buy a dongle or buy a
chromecast or buy a bigger box and just
make it work on your current TV no use
have they have to buy a new TV in the
case of Android be releasing boxes I and
you'll see boxes and you'll see keys
just like the chromecast don't worry
they didn't announce them but you will
the main take-home out of both Android
TV and Android auto is it's not really
software that's running there it's it's
more like an ability to cast stuff to it
and display in that environment from
your phone or from your tablet so you no
longer have to worry about updating your
car or updating your TV or updating
whatever else you're updating your
tablet and whatever you're running there
whether it's Android L or whatever
letter comes after L or whether it's a
new device as a faster processor you're
automatically just going to get that in
your car on your TV it's it's going to
be there all over the place which is a
different approach than what we've had
with Smart TVs today where you're hardly
ever going to see an update to whatever
is running on your LG TV or on your sony
TV it's old right out of the box and
it's never getting an update and that
has some serious usability as well
security concerns probably the only cool
thing that I found about Android TV was
the fact that I could control it with my
whatever SmartWatch I get oh that's
beautiful that was cool that was really
cool probably the only cool thing that
we saw in a future update that will come
to the chromecast by the way you will be
able to create ambiances in order to
have your TV become your picture board
or whatever but probably even cooler is
that now you won't have to share your
Wi-Fi pass where people will be able to
control your call your chromecast
remotely so it's interesting how they
keep enhancing this $35 accessory into
doing more things so again a lot of
things were announced today a a lot of
things were good I don't think we could
say that there was anything negative
announced everything was very positive
if I thought we were going to get that
we did I oh Lord I'm shutting down then
I'll jump in and do negatives we did
have protesters there and my god hello
well is that killer robots I mean that's
awesome so developers if you are
watching this please make sure you
include as mobs Three Laws of Robotics
when you're making your killer robots so
please
my god what was the guy complaining
about that was just like you couldn't
even let the guy talk I was expecting
eggs and tomatoes being thrown at the
guide stuff it was really yeah you had
net neutrality protesters there which
Google is all behind that duality so
that didn't make any sense to me you had
fair housing I don't know what that has
to do with Google maybe we can talk
about that offline after and then killer
robots wow there's a very large local
dispute in San Francisco with regard to
Google and how it occupies the space and
how it is is where is not contributing
to the to the what do you call but the
whitewashing of the space i forgot the
the fancy word for it because i'm tired
but yeah there was a lot of protests
have gone on it was pretty nuts okay
Steven before you get dropped off again
Hyderabad I don't move is the negative
throw everything at the table right now
it's not so much negative guess I was
expecting to get something about glass
and I mean we had the expanded
availability coming to the UK they
announced those the new hardware upgrade
yesterday I suspected there to be if
finally this big we're making glass
available for seven hundred dollars it's
gonna be in best buys you can go try out
and right I mean this has to happen
eventually in just a matter now of how
long kugels gonna keep dragging us along
and that talk about you know wearables
in general vs smart walk is is kept
implying oh there's going to be some
other form factor here but didn't come
up maybe for another day I'm all for the
pocket watch yeah that would be
interesting but anyways well isn't the
pocket watch your current smartphone
dude just put it on a gold chain and
absolutely yeah yeah well head around
smartphone wow that was really wanted
and prepare clocks but anyways let's go
through some final thoughts guys because
we have a lot of work and we are we just
ran out of time mr. Tony what are your
thoughts I think everything we've seen
is positive I think everything we've
seen is pushing the envelope Google
managed to up the ante
and I think right now it's apples move
because after everything we've seen
today Apple has to really come up with
something better and not saying they had
to have an iphone 6 which is better than
any other Android phone out there I'm
talking services I'm talking orientation
towards your user experience usability
and future I love that well that's your
opinion obviously I don't know I just
for example they threw in Google fit
just out of the blue you know cuz you
know there was helpful health could be
announced and I at WWDC and things I
don't know I it seemed like you have a
lot of the things that they announced
just try to match what was announced
WWDC in a way but yeah definitely Apple
will have to push the ante with hardware
indeed how about you Joe well I did
notice that there was one little quip
pointed right at Apple basically saying
here's the timeline of Android and look
we've had lock screens we've had
notification shades we've had widgets
for the last four or five years oh and
by the way yeah 64 bits here and we're
doing android fit and android wear and
so it was kind of down playing on Apple
saying Apple just came up to speed with
where we were four years ago and yeah
we'll have 64-bit in some of this other
stuff and it'll just be there and it'll
just work and that was great but it was
a lot of reading between the lines they
told us a lot of cool stuff but they
left a lot of stuff to the oh yeah we've
been doing that you didn't know that why
didn't you know that you didn't tell us
but overall I'm impressed i like it one
little bit of information that i have
breaking from mkbhd per hour fun users
accessing apparently the LG G watch will
be available on the google play store at
4 p.m. pacific time so there we go no
sleep for you my friend mmm that's one
of those things that's going to break
the internet little bit miss them mr.
Michael Fisher what are your final
thoughts well Michael so
doesn't matter acting beautiful I think
the internets dying over there he did he
said it was gonna break the internet and
the building rate the internet and
because now I'm hearing when you guys 30
seconds ago and now it's what mess I
hate hangouts only when I have a poor
connection the point is if I in fact
still do any uh we tell shy making
things today I think I was to press your
PHA em once or not if you like them or
not but did kiss tortoise is definitely
if nothing else consistent we've seen
ripple touch interfaces you know from
him before we clean certainly card-based
paradigms before and I'm excited to try
out in particular the new multi tasking
approach because I think that's going to
be a very fun thing I didn't happen to
catch whether the cards are live when
you see them but I hope they are and I'm
pretty jazzed to try it out but on the
phones i think the user facing stuff was
pretty you know pretty tame I don't
think anybody's gonna we're gonna be
flipping out over you know shadows on
cards I'm certainly most excited to see
what happens with where and I think it's
going to be a big ol challenge do
competitors sent whatever but but pebble
I'm really interested to see how people
react to that from a computed standpoint
it would be cool if they will came out
with a android wear you know SmartWatch
I think that's like the smartest way to
go ah and we do have an editorial on
what they could do to a 2.5 version of
pebble but we don't know the fall
through without her we'll see what about
You mr. Steven sure unmute there um I
think a lot of the we saw and it wasn't
too surprising this isn't groundbreaking
stuff would you can get the harder a lot
of people were looking forward to
personally I think material design was
the most important thing to come out of
this and I'm getting shut off again well
to pick up where Stephen left off
material design is a really big thing
going forward and probably the bigger
thing about it is it's not just android
google said they also updated their web
development sdk
they're also pushing some of that over
to their laptop at Chromebook and that
now we're seeing that on some of the
other devices as well so really material
design is what this what the whole
software side of the aisle was all about
and we'll see more of that as as
breakouts are happening i'm sure
developers are sitting in those right
now which is where i'd love to be but
material design that's going to be the
direction of android for at least the
next year or two in addition to the web
stuff all of google's web services and
all of the peripheral devices whether
that's in your car on your TV or on your
wrist Jaime I think it's time for us
conclude yes 30 minute round table after
an hour yeah sorry about that i muted um
definitely if my final thoughts are just
you know to wrap up I am very excited
especially for Android where I think
that that's really where smartwatches
had to go at some point google now has a
point an additional point of being now I
I did like the fact that Google decided
to integrate everything the chromecast
Chromebooks Android applications on
Chromebooks the fact that now there is
an advantage to owning an android phone
and a Chromebook for example I liked all
those things but specifically wearables
and there's a lot more coverage coming
up obviously we will be talking about it
on tomorrow's podcast as well we will be
talking about it on editorials coming up
we have another video coming up the
parking out daily so please everybody
stay tuned thank you very much for
watching this video and hopefully we
will see you soon as we are completely
off time already um if we're not missing
anything else I we are signing off thank
you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
