now we're at Aoife we're at the Samsung
booth again and we're checking out a
variety of accessories for the note 3
we've managed to corral all these
together we're being the total jerks of
the booth and are stealing half of their
phones just to show you the variety of
color and this isn't even all of them we
have to give these back we're going to
show you more than these right now just
to show you this is the flip cover
without the window obviously in the
front notice the leather goes all the
way around to the back and it leaves a
hole for the camera there and there's
that stitching pattern that is you know
evident in all of these note 3
accessories calling out the note lineage
and the lack of Piper glaze it opens up
like that we've got a little a little
slot there for your credit cards your
driver's license whatever a little hole
for the earpiece you can have a
conversation let's go over and check out
the ones with Windows built in and now
for something slightly different the new
s view cover with this giant window we
saw this the other night we have this
special operating mode on the display
we're quick enough we can show you that
there that is saves a little bit of
battery power by only activating that
AMOLED element at least that's so
Samsung's claim and we saw this on the
galaxy s4 but this is a much larger
window the window is still present there
is still plastic here as there is on
most accessories of this type but now we
have a lot more surface area to play
with and we have these apps that we can
kind of
play with here now I think what's
happening is we're activating the 70
sensors something's going on this is
timing out really quickly over here you
can see the music controls they are a
shortcut to the camera or shortcut to
the action memo and if you have the
s-pen out you can take a note right on
the cover and it doesn't seem affected
by it I wonder if pressure sensitivity
seems yep it seems to work just fine it
would be dainty or we can be fierce that
is very cool to do through the plastic
there and then a quick shortcut to
camera if you want to jump in there take
a quick shot while the case is on very
well thought-out shortcut there a little
flash toggle just stripped-down versions
of the full functionality available
right in the window here once again you
can take calls for the earpiece that
protrudes through there otherwise very
similar to the traditional has covered
with the stitching here galaxy note 3
don't know if you like that color but if
you don't there are a billion the 11
other choices for you or 6 or 9 or
whatever it is but it's still quite a
lot of choice of course you get some
more diverse taste or some more fashion
centric ones Moschino and Nicholas
Kirkwood whose names I don't know how to
pronounce well but I hope that worked
out or fashion designers who've created
some custom cases here custom versions
of the S view cover there's a moleskin
branded stuff up there and as my first
time seeing that actually we compared
this thing to a moleskin so it makes a
lot of sense that that is there and of
course the Galaxy Note 10.1 is not left
out of the fun and the color Department
either with these flip cover cases over
there
if those options weren't enough for you
Samsung has thought of that and given
you a whole lot more by the way I was
wrong the flip wallet is what that is
called without the window this is the S
view cover here you can see the vast
array of colors available here it
doesn't stop there the galaxy note 3 is
also available with different back
covers if you're not into a flip cover
you can still customize your device and
by the way you can make it match your
galaxy gear if you prefer but if you're
little rough around your devices Samsung
has there its own branded protective
cover plus here in this kind of
ruggedized plastic feel of shirt doesn't
add any milspec but it does add some
peace of mind probably and of course the
classic black and white available for
the S charger kid with the Qi enabled
wireless charging pad so Galaxy Note 3 I
don't think there's any disputing it
probably the most customizable phablet
ever released at least so far
Anton Dino drew behind the camera I'm
Michael Fisher were still here at Eva's
a stay tuned for a lot more from pocket
