named for its rebrand that beats music
service we get solid dates for when to
expect the LG g4 in the US and microsoft
launches another preview of windows 10
mobile and supports new phones I'm high
meddling that and to avoid all the tommy
hilfiger complaints and comments i'm
going to start showing my pants going
forward this is pocket out daily the
official new suit I have to do with
Microsoft as the company has just
launched its new technical preview for
windows 10 mobile that's the new name
and well in addition to having support
for the Lumia 930 and Lumia icon finally
we also get the HTC One m8 for Windows
you can test it out there as well and
the cool things are the wiped i'll
slider for you to add transparencies of
the background in addition to office
mobile reaching uh you know universal
application testing period here it's
cool to get it let us know what you
think in the comments now sad official
news have to do what samsung as the
company has just removed the samsung
gear live from the google play store
we're not sure if that's going to happen
as well in Samsung's own store since you
can definitely get it there as well but
yeah it's no longer available in Google
Play and that happened to the G watch a
couple of months ago as well so yeah
we're wondering if Samson is going to
say goodbye to Android wear particularly
with the gear a rumors that we've been
covering and for those of you waiting
for the LG g4 the United States
t-mobile's a Twitter account at least
for the g4 preview has just announced
that we should expect the g4 to arrive
in stores on jun 2nd and this is
definitely something we're looking
forward to g-force so far one of our
favorite phones this year in our reviews
and almost everybody has the same
consensus so keep an eye on that now
we're not so positive news we've got a
good batch of users that are complaining
about Sam sings clearview case to be
marring the display of the samsung
galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge apparently
it is scratching the display in some
cases minor scratches in other cases
major scratches and we really can't
figure out why we're still waiting for
samsung to bring an official statement
on this we're not sure if they're going
to switch devices or what obviously
they're going to try to prove that's
really the case
so if you're having these issues keep an
eye as probably you will be benefited
with something or probably not and
finally for the very hot rumors of the
day we've got trusted sources claiming
that beats music is going to be no
longer it's going to be called Apple
music going forward once apple announces
of WWDC are probably you know an apples
music event in September it seems that
the company is going to do things a
little differently pain is not coming
back you remember that to see social
network but it seems that it will go
social in many ways allowing artists to
promote concerts and so many other
things that ping did but it seems that
never became popular other interesting
parts is that it seems that iTunes might
be no longer as well it seems that Apple
music is going to be the way to go and
this is going to be cross-platform now
again there are just a ton of rumors
here we're not really sure what to
expect but that leads me to the question
of the day so tell us what is your
current streaming service right now and
what would a Polly to do for you to
switch to apples music service in my
case it all narrows down to price for me
to want to move from Spotify Apple will
have to play with the price but leave us
a comment down below what's your case
Renzi know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
filming she fall was I'm talking about
