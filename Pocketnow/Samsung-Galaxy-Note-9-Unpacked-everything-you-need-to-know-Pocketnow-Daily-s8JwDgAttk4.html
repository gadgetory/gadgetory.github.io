announced and we went hands-on with the
beast it turns out that we don't have to
wait until Aoife to see the Galaxy watch
reveal this we just saw that and we get
a preview of the brand new Galaxy home
in a very awesome way I'm hi I'm Emily
that up this is the face of a person
that is filming at 10:30 p.m. because he
just came from unpacked and it's been
crazy because we've been filming videos
but we have the awesome new galaxy note
9 leave your comments down below I will
go to sleep after this video but I will
read them tomorrow
this is firing out daily all right so
the official news today begin with deals
that have to do with the galaxy note 9
definitely the hottest news is this as
well but for everyone that wants to buy
this phone like Sprint does got it 50%
off if you grab their flex plan we
already heard about the buy one get one
free deals from Verizon we also have
that same thing from AT&amp;amp;T ended in the
case of t-mobile you can swap an old
phone and get this as well for nearly
50% off there are a ton of deals I don't
ever remember a samsung being so
aggressive about launching this phone so
yeah I'll let you know why in future
videos and definitely for those of you
that were wondering what will happen
with fortnight for Android it is now
live for those of you owning Galaxy
phones and because you're not gonna be
able to pick up a Galaxy Note 9 until
August 24th definitely even though that
phone's on the list that doesn't really
count because the exclusivity is from
now up until the 12th for all Galaxy
phones after the s7 so if you have one
you can definitely download it and there
are definitely some deals if you buy the
Galaxy Note 9 particularly with that
skin from for tonight which is valued at
150 bucks I find the pricing crazy but
anyways you can learn more in the
description you know we kind of heard
that we weren't just getting a Samsung
Galaxy smartphone at impact and oh my
god that was so true we were introduced
to the new galaxy home for those of you
that were wondering what was going to
happen to the rumored Bixby speaker it
is now live now the biggest problem is
that the demos that were being shown
were really 160 speakers that were in
charge of providing the audio for
Barclays Center that is insane
just the whole ensemble of how they
pulled it off was great the problem is
that it seems that the product is not
even close to being finished because we
weren't really allowed to see more than
just that stay tuned you know what we
also thought that we were getting the
galaxy watch up until Aoife and no we
were surprised to see this watch today
as well it looks a lot like the gear s3
frontier up to the point where there are
casings 46 millimeter and 42 26
millimeter pretty much being the gear s3
frontier but it's got a couple of added
tricks it does look more refined the
back also seems to provide a better
heart rate monitor and also this one is
going to be LTE it's even salt water
resistant there are a ton of things that
I can't wait to get my hands on one
honestly
Samsung yes because we weren't given a
unit we'll see nobody was given a unit
but it was actually even hard to get one
at the event but I can't wait to tell
you more and finally yes the hottest
news today were the Samsung Galaxy Note
9 I think this is the first time that I
kind of do like a sort of a hands-on
there's a full hands-on video with all
the details that you need to know about
this smartphone all the specification
everything that's special about this
phone and what we're expecting during
our review process we actually already
filmed their unboxing but we did it sort
of special so it's gonna take me some
time to edit it up so I will ask you in
the comments what do you want to know
about this phone what would you like us
to compare it to I have to admit I'm
really excited because as much as I
wanted to love the Galaxy Note 8 if you
watch my after the buzz there were
things about that phone that would annoy
me that were actually fixed here so even
if most people call it an iteration it's
a good kind of iteration in my opinion
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
if you want to get the news earlier

English and in Spanish for more videos
