for the one plus six and they're not as
bad as we thought
LG is equipping its g7 think you with
boombox speakers that are promising
apparently and for those of you that are
expecting a low cost MacBook you're
gonna have to keep waiting I'm Jaime
Rivera and believe it or not there is
actually a balance between rumors and
news in today's video oddly this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Sprint and t-mobile I
don't understand why this announcement
was made on a Sunday at noon but yes
both companies are merging apparently
with the whole purpose of having a more
robust company to deal with the 5g
investment that's coming not only that
investment is going to be up to 40
billion in the full valuation of both
companies 146 billion they are
confirming that there will be no layoffs
that the whole idea here is that they
just want to build a bigger company to
compete let's see if it pulls out now
for those of you that we're expecting
the low-cost MacBook that was supposed
to be announced that the company's
education event well don't wait for it
for WWDC according to some trusted
sources it seems that it still will
happen but apparently later in the year
in the fall and the price points are
somewhere around 800 bucks so I don't
exactly understand what the whole low
price point will be but apparently this
will be the refresh to the MacBook Air
now let's move the spotlight over to
blackberry we can't wait to see the
successor to the key one I wanted to
love that phone that there were a couple
of things that we're missing there for
those of you interested apparently
something will happen soon this key to
might bring dual cameras according to
some leaked images renders out there and
certification documents and well
snapdragon 666 gigabytes of ram this
actually seems like a compelling phone
let's see what we get now how about if
we talk about LG the company continues
teasing what to expect for the LG g 7
thank you now we notice that the company
is apparently going to bring some boom
sound speaker and the reason why I say
speaker is because if you notice the
teaser it's showing that there is
spatial audio coming from the design of
the phone but it's coming from one
direction it's not coming from two which
is definitely not with flagship phones
too lately but yeah it seems that it
will be this great audio and you know LG
has been doing an amazing job in this
department
ever since the LG g3 so let's just hope
it's stereo or at least great enough to
not make us miss that
and finally the hottest initiative a I
have to do with the one plus six we're
still waiting to see when we get the
phone but we've got some teasers or
rumors on the price tag they don't seem
too crazy I mean the previous rumors
were talking seven to eight hundred
bucks but according to trusted sources
the 64 gigabyte variant is going to
start at five hundred fifty five bucks
which is a small price hike compared to
the current five T 600 bucks for the 128
gig variant and then if you want to go
eight gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigs of
storage
apparently that will jump to 700 bucks
but still we've seen the rumors
apparently we are getting water
resistance in addition to other things
that previous one plus phones didn't
bring so in today's question let us know
if we are getting water resistance and a
better design and all the things that
we've been seeing in the teasers will
you be willing to pay these price tags
for the one plus six in my case I would
I have become a really big fan of these
phones but leave us a comment down below
