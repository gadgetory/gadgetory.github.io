against the best Android has to offer
and now it's time to shift our focus to
Windows Phone I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Samsung Galaxy s4
vs. Nokia Lumia 920 we've already
reviewed the galaxy s4 and run it
through an extensive battery of
comparisons visit pocketnow.com
subscribe here on YouTube and follow us
on social media so you can stay abreast
of our latest content we're using the
american sprint variant here the L 720
instead of the octa-core AI 9500 but
even considering that it almost seems
like an unfair comparison the galaxy s4
is fresh out of the factory
while our AT&amp;amp;T Lumia 920 here was
released back in November still for now
it's the cream of the crop as far as
Windows Phone goes and if someone was
trying to choose between the top of the
line of Windows Phone and the top of the
line of Android this would be a relevant
comparison so let's dive in in this
comparison will cover hardware and build
UI camera and some test notes even if
these phones weren't painted in opposing
colors the differences would be evident
the polycarbonate Lumia 920's squared
off corners palm kissing curved smile
cross-section shaped gorilla glass
display covering and robust 185 gram
weight give it a feel in hand like no
other it feels solid heavy and big in
the good way the galaxy s4 almost
couldn't be more different with its
rounded corners faux metallic mid plate
micro crosshatch finish and hyper glaze
glossy coating the s4 is also made of
polycarbonate but it's ridiculously
light in the hand at 130 grams we've set
it before it almost feels like a dummy
phone you might handle at a retail store
each of these devices has its ups and
downs in terms of build quality you'll
notice each of them bears a few bumps
and bruises but the crucial difference
is that we've been using the Lumia 920
on and off as our daily driver for about
five months and we only took delivery on
the galaxy s4 a few weeks ago the
Samsung products Gorilla Glass 3 display
protection is holding a fine but the
rest of its casing scratches incredibly
easily it's too early to make a
definitive
call and which one is more durable but
make no mistake our money's Honda Lumia
we just wish we didn't have one of the
defective units that lets a lot of dust
into the front-facing camera lens and we
wish windows phones were friendlier to
the idea of notification LEDs Samsung's
is here on the s4 and it's as big and
bright as usual which we love in terms
of horsepower there's a generational gap
here the AT&amp;amp;T Lumia 920 is powered by
last year's American darling the
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 running
at 1.5 gigahertz and backed up by a
single gig of ram powering the galaxy s4
is the newer quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 at 1.9 gigahertz and
backed up by double the RAM the Samsung
device also offers a choice in memory
capacity and microSD expansion and it's
2600 milliamp hour battery is user
replaceable Lumia owners need to be
happy with 32 gigs of on-board storage
and a 2,000 milliamp hour battery they
cannot replace but the silver lining of
Qi compatible wireless charging is nice
though samsung has announced plans to
build that functionality into s4 battery
doors this summer on the radio side both
of these phones feature LTE support in
addition to their respective 3G Suites
but the galaxy s4 steps up its Wi-Fi
offering with AC support it 1ups the
Bluetooth 3.0 on the Lumia 920 with
Bluetooth 4.0 and it features an IR
blaster and a host of other sensors
again you can tell which one of these
devices was just built yesterday and
which ones been around the block a few
times moving on to the display it's very
clear that Samsung has been making smart
phone displays for a while
shoehorning a 1080p five inch Super
AMOLED into a frame as small as the
galaxy s4 is quite a feat but more
importantly the results are incredible
the display is vibrant its modes are
adjustable on the fly and it's 441
pixels per inch sharpness is just
outrageous it's definitely one of the
best smartphone screens we've used the
Lumia 920's screen is by no means a bad
one at 4.5 inches and WXGA resolution
making for 332 PPI it's certainly no
slouch and Windows Phones modern UI
doesn't exact
need 1080p to shine it looks great but
the IPS LCD technology means blacks
aren't as deep on the 9:20 and the
polarization filter nokia uses in part
to simulate deep blacks also impacts
side on visibility pretty extensively
neither is great in direct sunlight but
both of these phones offer
hypersensitive touch for gloved users
which is nice All Things Considered
though the galaxy s4 definitely carries
the better screen here that screen is
also used to greater effect on the
galaxy s4 through a gesture based
interface though the usefulness of the
hovering air view functionality is up
for debate actually that holds true for
almost the entire suite of new features
Samsung is lumped into the galaxy s4
it's not just an Android phone
it's a TouchWiz phone and that makes a
world of difference we've covered the
full extent of Samsung's feature
offerings in other gs4 videos at pocket
now so it may be the best way to
condense it is this there are more
features on the galaxy s4 than most
people will know what to do with so many
that Samsung has built in an easy mode
to allow new smartphone users to
gradually acclimate to the massive array
of add-ons this phone includes by
contrast Windows Phone 8 is like easy
mode without sacrificing the core
functionality of a smart phone make no
mistake you get far fewer features but
as a result everything runs more
smoothly despite the Lumias last
generation hardware the experience is
fluid responsive and reliable and about
the only downside is that it doesn't
allow the kind of in-depth tweak ability
the GS 4 and other Android phones offer
there's also the ecosystem question to
consider which is a conversation we've
had before and one you should definitely
think about in advance of any hardware
buying decision the platform is a huge
part of what makes a smart phone a smart
phone and Windows Phone 8 really
couldn't be any different from TouchWiz
atop Android jelly bean if it tried so
do your research
choose your platform first the Lumia 920
was and still is sold heavily on the
merits of its PureView camera the 8.7
megapixel shooter with carl zeiss optics
optical image stabilization and some of
the best low-light photo taking
capability we've seen thanks to Windows
Phone standards
the camera also features a hardware
shutter release which doubles as a
shortcut key to jump right into
viewfinder mode which we wish was on
every phone ever the viewfinder itself
is Spartan like the rest of Windows
Phone and we continue to be annoyed at
its lack of commonplace features like
HDR and on-screen indicators if you're
shooting in a special mode the absence
of that simple indicator can really mess
you up if you forgot to take the phone
out of night mode the last time you shot
a picture fortunately those deficiencies
are offset by some really nice manual
exposure ISO and white balance controls
as well as the Windows Phone lens
functionality that allows other apps to
plug into the camera there's also tap to
focus and shoot and the quick swipe to
the right to jump into the gallery from
the viewfinder which we've always found
very intuitive the viewfinder for the
galaxy s4's
13 megapixel shooter is predictably more
cluttered but it's also more useful
shooting modes can be selected from a
friendly scrolling wheel on the side and
there's an awful lot to play around with
here so many that we are right now
shooting another video tutorial on how
to use all the s4's camera features
check for that this week settings are
available behind a cog in the upper left
alongside other toggles for dual shot
and switching cameras the settings menu
allows all the fine-tuning the Lumia
920's software does and then some in
terms of how the cameras perform most
consumers probably won't notice much
difference in broad daylight there's a
bit more saturation from the Lumia 920's
camera but there's no huge difference in
resolution in these shots predominantly
because the GS force default shooting
mode is 9.6 megapixels to preserve a 16
by 9 aspect ratio shooting in the full
13 megapixel resolution is possible but
results in a 4 by 3 image the added
saturation in the 9 20s image
intensifies indoors in dim lighting but
where the nokia really beats the pants
off the GS 4 is in low-light situations
the 920 continues to lead the pack in
extremely dim conditions bringing an
almost unearthly glow to areas that
other phones can barely capture if
you're looking for a solid smartphone
camera either will do if you want more
features and higher resolution not to
mention features that really take
advantage of the
dust-free front-facing camera go with
the galaxy s4 but if you want
outstanding low-light photography and
optical image stabilization you'll want
to go with the Lumia Network differences
prevent us from making too detailed of
comparison in terms of speed and call
quality but fortunately in our area of
Greater Boston these were about on par
call quality is similarly even with
callers telling us we sounded okay but
not great on each phone on our end the
Lumia 920 produced the warmer sound
through the earpiece with rich side tone
we really appreciate it
Samsung has moved its loudspeaker lower
on the device and expanded its size
greatly which gives it a much louder
deeper sound than its predecessor on the
galaxy s3 still the speaker phone on the
Lumia 920 seems to be the base here and
the louder of the two just watch out how
long you go listening though battery
life has never really been the Lumia 920
strong suit maybe it's because of our
comparatively ancient launch day device
but the 920 couldn't really keep up with
the battery endurance of the Sprint
Galaxy s4 variant your experience will
vary depending on your usage but
considering the extra capacity and
removability of the s4 s power pack it
shouldn't be a surprise that we'd
recommend the Samsung device over the
nokia one for road warriors as we
mentioned in episode 12 of pocket now's
after the buzz series the Lumia 920 is
aging very well it's durable it's
beautiful and it packs a camera that
while not king of the hill anymore is at
least a high deputy or something but up
against a cutting-edge piece of
technology like the galaxy s4 it does
start to show its age still if you're
looking for the best available Windows
Phone experience the Lumia 920 remains
the best way to go you just need to
decide whether you want to buy it or
wait for its successor which we're
expecting to see revealed somewhat soon
and in the meantime if you can put up
with its boatload of gimmicky software
features and almost toy like build
quality the galaxy s4 sits shiny on the
Shelf ready to take your money the
question underneath it all is as always
Android or Windows Phone in this
instance either path you take you'll be
getting one of the
best examples of each platform folks
