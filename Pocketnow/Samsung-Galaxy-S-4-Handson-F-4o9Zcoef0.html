this up is how incredibly lightweight it
is and some people will quite like with
cheating and in this case that is
probably true it does feel a little bit
cheap just like the galaxy s3 even
that's what you get when you get a
plastic phone it is thinner it is
lighter yeah but compared to the HTC One
it definitely feels a little bit cheaper
we've got the hyper glaze coating it's
doing a pretty good job at deterring
fingerprints I'm a 13 megapixel camera
back here I mean a new texture here it's
not actually textured oh I know this is
completely smooth we've got this
interesting coding what your little
diamonds it looks like kind of hard to
see from this angle but you continued
around to the front really nice detail
we've got a home button that you saw
more square than it was in the last
galaxy s ii we've got to continue to
matter we've got it earphone piece here
we've got a 2-megapixel front-facing
camera just how the crazy fan crazy like
device and then we've got some blue
display a 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display
have you ever seen an AMOLED display
this high resolution you probably
haven't what that means is that all the
cool stuff about an AMOLED display the
super deal X in super-high resolution
this is a gorgeous screen no human can
see pixels on this thing and we've got a
ton of features that Samsung is added
one of them allows you to use both the
front camera and the rear camera at the
same time in you mama it's kind of a
strange feature that will allow you to
include yourself in the picture when you
take one so if I'm taking a picture of
someone over there and
camera under photography you can dance
come on take some lipstick some practice
a lot of these users take to practice
you can move it around how can you
resize it but there is a lot of other
stuff that we want to talk about we got
an octa-core processor here and
Samsung's not talking about yet maybe
cuz I don't want to set people for
disappointed cuz the US version is
likely to have the Qualcomm Snapdragon
600 swimming around everything feels
very very good um and it's funny we
talked about this epochal amount of time
that processors the specs don't matter
as much because android games just so
good let's go to the settings and what
you will notice here's the TouchWiz has
not been redone maybe in a little in
kind of ways but we still have the thick
bars up here the blue the gray the the
very contrasting look and feel some
people love it some people think it's a
complete inefficient use of space we've
got the HTC One which going in a
different direction with kind of black
on black kind of an elegant hip more
look so just an early look at the galaxy
s4 this is gonna be an awesome phone
this is going to be huge seller they've
added a lot of software features i think
the headline here is the hardware
surprisingly it's it's thinner and
lighter than you could really ever
possibly imagine so we're gonna have a
lot more videos on the galaxy s4 here at
the launch event
