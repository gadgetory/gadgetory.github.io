pocket naka today we're going to look at
an application which is called
voice-to-text
it comes from LG and we heard about this
application when LG announced the lg
optimus 7 and the LG optimus 7q which
goes by the name of quantum this
application will transcribe your voice
into text making it easy for you to send
text messages emails or Twitter tweets
so up let's take a look
okay so let's start the application and
it will bring up a nice black screen and
since this is not our first start of the
application you will not see the License
Agreement but make sure you read and
accept that before you start using the
application what I really like about
this app is that it takes full advantage
of Windows Phone 7 span remic display
and hubs meaning you can swipe to the
left and then to the left and so on
until you reach the point you have
started the main screen is this and from
here you can select to send a tweet you
can select to send a text message email
or a memo plus you have a short shortcut
here for settings swiping to the left
will bring you to the Twitter part of
the application and if you have your
account set up with voice-to-text you
will see all your updates for the people
you are following right here on the
screen one more to the left brings you
to the list of memos you can use this
application to make a note to self or
start recording something just in order
for you to play back later to remind you
getting back to the first screen let's
try to send an email message using our
voice and let's see how well LG's voice
detects behaves in transcribing our
voice to text so the instant you tap on
one of these icons right here on your
home Twitter messaging email or memo the
application will start listening to
whatever you say and hopefully
transcribe it using voice to text
technology so let's try and send a text
message a short one dear John please
note that I will be running late today
let's processing and let's see how come
this dear John please note that I will
be running late today fantastic let's
take another example when we hit the
back button it automatically asks if you
want to save this message as a memo or
not we will not keep it let's try an
email dear Michael thank you very much
for the email you have sent me
everything is ok its processing
dear Michael thank you very much for the
email you sent me everything is okay now
punctuation is not one of its strongest
points but it's always easier to dictate
rather than to type all the message
let's get back and let's try another one
let's just try a man'll this time note
to self do not forget to buy the flowers
this weekend processing notes to self do
not forget to buy the flowers this
weekend so this was a short presentation
of LG's voice-to-text application and
how it behaves in different scenarios
now for this to work properly you will
have to get closer a little bit to the
microphone but for sure is a time saver
for all those times that you cannot
spend five or ten minutes typing an
email on the keyboard just push a
certain button start talking to your
device and it will transcribe your voice
to text you can always read it
afterwards make small Corrections maybe
punctuation but it's working as
advertised and I hope you will like it
this wasn't on the united front pocket
not come with a short presentation of
LG's voice-to-text application thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
