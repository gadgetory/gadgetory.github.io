now tired of hearing about samsung
galaxy pro products neither are we we've
checked out the new tabs the new notes
and now we're seeing how the smallest of
the new breed measures up against the
apple ipad mini and the nexus 7 2013
edition from google in a quick look
let's see how that goes so if you're
looking for a spec rundown folks don't
worry we will do that in an actual
comparison when we get a hold of one of
these devices for an official review an
official comparison but right now I just
want to talk about how these respective
things feel in the hand the new Samsung
device is definitely feels in the hand
feels like the lightest of all of them
sorry about all the gunk on the screen
we've been using it quite a bit and so
is everybody else the nexus 7 from 2013
this one has is completely dead so we're
just using it as a physical reference
you can see if you take a look at the
footprints of these devices then new
Nexus 7 is considerably smaller and it's
smaller than most tab this is a very
very small tablet our unit here doesn't
have any juice as i mentioned i think
the samsung device also boasts a much
larger display at eight point four
inches versus seven inches on this unit
but it's also feels considerably lighter
and that doesn't mean cheaper by the way
I mean the Nexus 7 feels really good in
the head I have to tell you
comparatively speaking I would probably
prefer to carry the Nexus 7 just because
I prefer a slightly heftier device if
you want something a little bit lighter
that doesn't feel quite so close to big
phone territory but it's very definitely
a tablet without being a mammoth beast
well the new tab pro is definitely worth
a look see how it compares physically
with apple's ipad mini obviously
footprint comparison is going to go
similarly in terms of height but look
how wide the apples product is this is
not a surprise to anyone of course we've
reviewed this device turn on the screen
so we can't see as many of the
fingerprints this device very very wide
in the half
the new samsung tab pro is not the
difference in display aspect ratios is
apparent four by three on the Apple
device 16 by nine on the Samsung product
obviously the internals are quite
different as well but if you're talking
about what you prefer from a build
quality perspective well that's all
going to come down to whether you like
the cool touch of raw metal not raw
metal but you know what I'm saying or
the soft touch or the semi soft touch a
faux leather with stitching detail that
we see that we're familiar with from the
note devices so in terms of iOS versus
Android and specifically samsung's new
news magazine like you x we can talk
about that for ages we're not really
going to talk about that the day-to-day
interface differences what I want to
focus on just as we're talking really
quickly here it's multitasking iOS 7's
new multitasking paradigm there's
nothing really wrong with it as far as
I'm concerned I like it a lot but it is
your loan method of multitasking on this
device where that Samsung true to their
reputation delivers more options than
some people know what to do it but in
this case it's really really cool hey go
come back you drag the panels in here
you've seen this if you watch our other
hand Zhaan's but being able to multitask
in this manner using two apps at the
same time is a real time-saver in some
instances but that's not your only
option you can also window them up so if
you really want to max out your
productivity or I don't know maybe your
distraction level feel free just bring
the multitasking frame out start tapping
on step willy-nilly and you've got not
just two apps running foot size by side
below but also windowed apps above
obviously that's going to slow down your
performance a little bit wow that looks
a lot like our website but it's not
close it on down and then we're back to
the main UI here so Samsung with the pro
moniker obviously really trying to take
on the likes of a consumer level device
like the ipad mini like the Nexus 7
which I didn't mention once again sorry
it's dead but only gives you one
multitasking interface the stock Android
one the pro in the new tab brand name
obviously well not exactly all bark
there's some bite to it we're going to
take a closer look at it when we get a
device in a quiet room with good
lighting and more than a few minutes to
get to know it i'm michael fisher with
pocket now that's anton Taylor's here
somewhere at CES 2014 we've got a lot to
say so stay tuned for more thanks for
