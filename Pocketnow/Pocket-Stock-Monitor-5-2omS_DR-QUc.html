Pocono calm and today I'm going to show
you a pretty cool application allows you
to keep track of your stocks or
portfolios and the program is called
pocket stock monitor 5 and there we go
okay so the cool thing out this is it
allows you to actually manage your
portfolio so if you had a quantity of
stock that you purchase it allow you to
put in the price I'll show you that it
allow you're putting the purchase price
of what you made so if you had 2,000
chairs of let's say Microsoft and you
bought for 20 to 45 share you can put it
in here and it will actually give you
your gains and losses unlike most
programs will just give you the purchase
actually just gives you the current
price so this one will tell you if
you're making money or losing money so
to check on your portfolio you just go
down here to portfolio check on
performance and you can update and see
exactly how much money you've lost or
gained select load there real fast okay
and I'll give you the total value of
actual portfolio and your gains or
losses so it looks like I've lost eleven
thousand dollars okay so close this and
we can set an update timer so that the
stocks will actually update every minute
or whatever you specify under tools and
options I mean it is the the fastest
that the stocks will actually update on
this program and it does require an
internet connection so another cool
thing about this is allows you to have
different views so you can see the
Nasdaq here and Dow Jones and it will
give you a chart we can switch that to
whatever our companies are we can select
them from up here so let's see if we
wanted to look at a Google you can
select this
I'll just load here in just a second
okay there we go and you quickly about
this chart is you can change the picture
which is kind of it it's kind of cool
but I don't know exactly how useful it
is and you can also clear it so it
deletes everything this is just this is
just up to when you load the program you
can also see the Daily News and charts
but it's going to load an internet
browser so I'll let you see that one on
your own you can see up to four
different different stocks at once so
here's a few google and cisco and
microsoft and you see up to 12 well each
portfolio will have up to 12 different
stocks or commodities and you can name
them all from this screen here so if i
wanted to rename this one I could rename
it another cool feature about this is it
allows me to change the colors of the
background to what pretty much whatever
preference I like so let's pick one I
like that one okay we'll choose that and
it also gives you a button to select an
update now and you can also add symbols
from up here so let's say I wanted to
add starbucks and if I didn't know the
stock ticker number I can just go to
hear a symbol locate in it will help me
find whichever stock I need to look at
so SBU X so we'll just add that one okay
so there we have starbucks purchase
price per share right there and the
program does costs about twenty-five
dollars and it will run on any windows
mobile device or any pocket pc device
actually with any display resolution the
only thing that requires an internet
connection and if you have Wi-Fi that's
free and a touchscreen so thanks for
watching i'm daniel webster i will post
a link on pacquiao calm as to how to get
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
