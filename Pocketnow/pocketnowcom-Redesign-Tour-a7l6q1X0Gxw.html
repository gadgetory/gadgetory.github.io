pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to show you the new pocketnow.com
the most significant redesign since our
inception in the year 2000 we're going
to talk about the new features that
we've put in place to make using the
site a better experience for you so
let's start at the top up at the top we
have quick links to subscribe to our RSS
feed or to tip us on a new piece of news
to the right of that is a new in town
button which is really designed for our
new users people that haven't been to
pocketnow.com before and aren't really
sure what the site is about and how to
use it below that are some buttons to
show people where we are in social media
so we have a big presence on YouTube
with over 550 videos we do a lot on
Twitter and now we are on Facebook in a
big way let's jump down to the nav bar
the main nav bar of the website if you
click on reviews you'll be taken to our
reviews archive let's jump to there and
see how it's changed so here we are in
the new reviews archive which is a very
clean display of the reviews that we've
recently posted with nice thumbnails a
little bit of a blurb and read more
button in case you want to click on to
read the review let's go back to the
right of the reviews button we have a
Q&amp;amp;A button which actually links right to
Facebook so let's go there so here we
are in the discussions tab of our
fanpage on Facebook this area will be
monitored by experts in the industry to
answer your questions about smartphones
and windows mobile you can also jump to
the wall where we will be posting
announcements about exclusive contests
only running on facebook Plus this is a
great way and a great place to interact
with other smartphone and windows mobile
device bats sliding down our nav bar we
have the download software button which
will link you to our software store
where you can download trials of
thousands and thousands of windows
mobile apps to the right of that is a
link to our phone database sliding all
the way down to the right of our nav bar
is the more predominantly placed search
bar which has much improved accuracy so
if you want to find all the posts we've
made about a very particular specific
topic the search bar is a perfect place
to go for that below that we have the
new feature rotator and the idea here is
that some of these will change every
time you come to the site to suggest new
content but some of them will stay the
same based on what we want to show you
such as a hot piece of break
news or a featured review going down to
where the actual content begins we have
a category picker so if you have in mind
exactly what you want to see as it
relates to news or reviews you can
choose the category you'll be drilled
into that specific category and a
nice-looking index so we really wanted
to keep the front page clean which is
why we give you a blurb plus a little
thumbnail and the category in the upper
right corner that way you can quickly
glance down the page and see if there's
anything that you want to read about
there is of course you can press read
more if not you can just continue down
the page and at the bottom of the page
instead of having to jump to the next
page by clicking the next page button
you can take a look at our more posts to
see if there's anything that interests
you there let's jump up and take a look
at the sidebar here in the sidebar we
have what's called the Hot Topic filter
here we will be sticking together pieces
of content that relate to a hot topic so
for example if you're interested in
everything we've posted about the new
HTC hd2 you can click on the hd2 icon
and be taken to an index of that content
or if you're on AT&amp;amp;T and you're shopping
for an AT&amp;amp;T phone and click on the logo
see all of the content that we've posted
that relates to AT&amp;amp;T so a great way to
sort of find content that you're looking
for without having to search through
things and spend a while digging a lot
going down the sidebar here we have a
look at our live Twitter feed down a
little bit further we have our latest
video coverage this actually taps right
into our YouTube channel so our latest
video is always right up on the screen
here in the sidebar going down a little
bit more we have a top commenter module
which is an active yet because we're on
the beta site basically this will show
you who's commenting the most on our
site it will also call out the most
commented pieces of content that we have
currently and finally on the bottom
we've more suggested content if you
still want to see more stuff this is
hand-picked content that people have
been reading a lot about so we really
hope you enjoy the redesign we designed
it to be clean fresh and to help you
find the content that you're looking for
thanks for all of your support and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
