pocketnow.com
and this is a tour of the latest windows
mobile 6.5 rom to come out of XD
developers now we've shown you windows
mobile 6.5 roms in the past but I think
this is closer to what we're actually
going to see when it's released this
brings a lot of the new changes that we
saw at the mix 2009 conference which is
kind of a developer conference then
Microsoft is heavily involved in and in
this particular ROM we don't have the
honeycomb interface on the Start menu
instead we just have a bunch of icons
arranged in a staggered kind of way so
let me walk you through all the changes
and I think you're gonna be impressed
with what you see so as we know the
sliding panel interface comes over from
windows mobile 6.1 but there are two
ways to actually move this we can slide
the magnifier itself like so or we can
actually move the entire background like
so and the magnifier will stay
stationary and of course we can slide
our finger to the right and to the left
and I think this is a really smooth way
to use it because you can you have the
option of moving slowly with your finger
like that or jumping really fast to the
top by moving the magnifier area okay so
let's take a look at the Start menu and
as we can see here in the Start menu we
no longer have the honeycomb grid we
just have a bunch of icons and we get a
little highlighting area and that
highlighting area implies that that is
the icon that is currently selected so
if you have a d-pad on your device you
can move around and that sort of thing
but yeah we now no longer have the
honeycomb interface now something else
that is different for windows mobile 6.5
that we really haven't noticed yet is
that the waiting cursor has changed the
cursor that tells you that the device is
thinking so let me try to bring that up
I'm gonna click on file explorer maybe
you'll see it there and let me go to
Windows because that is always a file
that takes a long time to show up yep
see it right there that is the new
waiting cursor so just a bunch of little
dots moving around and as you probably
also know in windows mobile 6.5 there
are new soft key menus there they're
further evolved in this build let me
show you what they look like so really
nice you can flick your finger all the
way from bottom to top to kind of
carousel through them and we also get a
little fade here when
so that we know which softkey we've
actually chosen there and actually the
kinetic scrolling is totally new as you
can see it's very springy very bouncy if
I flick my finger it's quite smooth of
course it's not going to be as smooth as
it is when it gets released but this is
a huge improvement over previous builds
of windows mobile 6.5 that we had on
xda-developers so that's pretty much it
for the latest build of windows mobile
6.5 it's working out to be a much more
refined operating system than we even
saw a few months ago as we saw in this
video there are three new things that we
can look forward to we have the Start
menu without the honeycomb boundaries we
have the much better flick scrolling
that you can find in other programs and
of course we have the new waiting cursor
which kind of just gives you a nice look
and feel when you're waiting for
something to happen oh and by the way
the today screen is much easier to
navigate now that we have two different
ways to move along the magnifying glass
so that's it for now for more on windows
mobile 6.5 keep it to pocketnow.com for
more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
