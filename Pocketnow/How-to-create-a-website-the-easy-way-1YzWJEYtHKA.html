create a new website are brought to you
by the genius as overhead Wix this is
PocketNow and I'm Joshua fiqar what's
going on everybody and I just named off
basically two different brands there now
after I went ahead and started my own
solo career and I also freelance here as
the host of the bog in our weekly but
also as an occasional video creator on
pocket now obviously I have a lot of
different projects that I have my hands
in and I've started even more of them
recently and I needed a place to put
them all together now when you attack
youtuber when you are on social media
when you're on Twitter half the time but
you also have other things like podcasts
obviously you want a place to be able to
put that all together and one of the
most natural and also original ways of
consolidating all of your content is
through a website now I do have the
domain Joshua Vergara com but I haven't
hosted it anywhere or had a website made
in that domain for quite a while and
that was when a good opportunity came in
to check out the work of the guys over
at Wix in this video I'm going to go
through the main web browser version of
it that way we can see what kind of
tools we have once you sit down at a
computer and put together this website
from scratch at first it feels like a
daunting experience trying to create a
website from scratch you need to figure
out what kind of elements you want to
have on there and then once you even
know what kind of information you want
to put out there how are you going to
even design it well the people over at
Wix actually help out with that from the
get-go once you start to sign up for
their free plan they ask you a number of
different questions and it's from there
that they can actually cater a website a
beginner's template for you that will
have those elements in mind what I found
very interesting is that a couple of the
questions dealt with me as a person and
as a brand and what I ended up finding
was a listing for a template that had
the tech youtuber in mind there's so
many different categories here but based
upon the kind of category you put your
website into or who you as a brand are
and will then find the different
elements that Wix can provide on
websites and put them into an easy to
edit template after a few choices here
and there about what my template would
look like at least at the start and then
I can edit it later I'm then brought
into the Wix Adi this is
where I could actually create the
content meat and design of the website
and it was through a tool an editor of
sorts that made the process super simple
I needed no coding knowledge I just
needed to look at the different elements
that they gave me maybe change the
colors around a little bit and using my
logo I'm really happy to have black
white and this shade of green available
as my main website colors and it did a
great job of moulding it all together in
a minimalistic design so what are the
elements that I'm really trying to have
here well I obviously want to have my
face on the website so you know where
you are have my youtube channel as part
of a feed right below that that way you
can see all of my videos if you're
coming to my website for the first time
and you may or may not be familiar with
my YouTube channel to begin with and
then below that I can do some blog post
so I can post other things onto my
website that may not fall into the
YouTube category or the social media
category that I created down below there
is a built in Instagram feed that just
squirrels through all of my photos over
on my Instagram profile and makes this
website much more visually pleasing
after all as a visual content creator I
want to have everything that I create as
part of the main backdrop and finally at
the bottom a place for people to be able
to get in touch with me all of these
elements - the Twitter feed which I'll
get to in a second were created within
the window of less than an hour honestly
because from the beginning to the end of
having a good looking website without
even having to code one thing I was able
to have a good looking website that
looks good on desktop but also works
perfectly on a mobile browser and this
was all via a free plan so you can get
started right away but I did spring for
a premium plan the unlimited plan
because I wanted to connect my domain
that I said already I own to Joshua
Vergara calm that way I can have the
branding be the same all across the
board and is easy to just tell people to
head to my website and then it will
consolidate all of the different things
that I'm up to right now all of the paid
plans give you a lot of different
features however the one that I picked
gives me a little bit of storage on the
wick service if I have to use it but
that's ok because all of the content
that I want to show on the website is
embedded from the original source like
YouTube or Instagram and because of that
Wix doesn't charge anything for putting
bad media on to your website
want to get a little more fancy you can
actually get into an advanced editor
you're going to go past the Wix Adi and
go into a drag-and-drop apparatus where
you still don't need to have any coding
experience you just have to put a little
bit more due diligence into arranging
everything and putting them into
different guidelines and also making
sure that none of the elements overlap
one another and that's how I added in a
Twitter feed the official Twitter embed
from twitter.com of my profile and the
mini tweets that I have and the other
later that I don't have to worry about
is making sure it's compatible across
all devices as Wix takes care of that
themselves you've seen the desktop
version of the or rather the regular web
version of the website behind me this
entire video but right here on my
Android smartphone I have the version of
it already scaled perfectly Wix takes
care of all of this and it's a
good-looking website that I can give to
anybody and they can even access on
their smart phones so that they can see
all of my information and all the
projects I'm doing so if you haven't
noticed by now I'm very impressed with
what I've gotten out of Wix just in the
short amount of time that it took for me
to create Joshua Vergara calm once again
it's been a long time since I've had a
website because it's usually a daunting
experience or process to go through all
of the little bits and pieces of a
website builder but Wix makes it as easy
as possible you can get a good looking
website pretty easily if you want to
learn more about how easy Wix makes it
for you to create a website you can head
to the links in the description down
below let us know what websites you
might host on Wix as well and if you get
into the comment sections we can discuss
what it's like to have a brand and also
to be able to put it all out and of
course you can check out my content as
well at my youtube channel youtube.com
slash - Joshua Vergara and find me on
all of my social media channels if you
want an easy place to find all of that
you can just head over to the website
I've been talking about this whole time

gonna go ahead and call it on this one
