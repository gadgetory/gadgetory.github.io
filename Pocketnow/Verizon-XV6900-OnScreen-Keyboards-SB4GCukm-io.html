pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at the text entry
methods for the verizon XV 6900 now
obviously this device doesn't have a
keyboard so how do we enter data well
let's let's take a look we zoom in on
the screen a little bit alright I'm
going to go into word mobile and show
you the different keyboards that comes
on this device so I'm going to select
new here at the bottom and the first
keyboard that I want to show you is just
the standard Windows Mobile professional
keyboard i call it the tap tap keyboard
because you know you sit there tapping
with your stylus and it takes forever to
type most words though you do have some
some assistance here if you let me type
the word assistance you have the kind of
t nine xt9 which will provide some
suggestions for you but that really
doesn't speed up the process very much
at least in my in my use of the device
let me show you the other keyboard the
other two keyboards are really meant to
be used with your fingers so here's what
they call it the touch keyboard which is
very similar to the shirt type keyboard
found on the blackberry or the t-mobile
shadow because this is a resistive
touchscreen not capacitive you have to
press pretty hard on these buttons to
get them to register but I think with a
little practice you can get pretty quick
I've been working at this for a little
bit and let's see if I can type
something quickly it's come kind of
holding this in an awkward position so
see here
let's see here the quick round flat fox
yeah there we go let me finish that
sentence jumped over the lazy and I want
you to notice how small this space bar
is so I'm typing along pretty quickly
with two thumbs and let's see how it did
jumped over the lazy got it almost right
except for the word though and it's
really hard to narrow in on that small
space bar it's kind of difficult but in
time I'm sure you'll get used to it now
let me show you the other one which I
like a lot more if you've ever used the
touchpal keyboard you'll recognize this
immediately it's called the touch
keyboard instead of the excuse me the
touch keypad instead of the touch
keyboard and it's basically like teen I
so this is made for use with just your
thumb and I find it to be much quicker
so let me try that again and of course
you have to be good at t9 to be able to
to get this to go fast okay the quick
you can tell that i don't use t9 very
much but the fact that these buttons are
much larger makes it much easier to type
on although look at this space bar it's
even smaller than the space bar on the
20 kishore type keyboard that we were
looking at earlier but my advice is if
you're going to get this device or if
you have an HTC touch or something that
has an on-screen keyboard like this and
the HTC touch diamond will have similar
keyboards than the ones you just saw I
would stick with one of the keyboards
and get used to it and use it over time
and and eventually you'll be able to use
it just as fast as you would possibly a
hardware keyboard if not a standard t9
number pad on a regular phone so those
are the keyboards on the verizon XV 6900
now I want to show you some settings
that will make the text entry more
accurate so if we go to options here by
selecting the keyboard down there let me
close the keyboard so we get the full
screen I'm going to click on options we
can select the keyboard here I'm going
to click on options and here we have xt9
settings so click on there now by
default spell correction is turned off
i'm not sure why when I'm typing alone
typing typing a quick text message I
often misspelled words so you definitely
want to turn that on and then I turned
off word completion because that was
fouling me up a few times when I was
meaning to spell a word and the the
device that I was trying to spell
something else so I turned that off and
that increased the accuracy quite
significantly and you only have to
change the setting once it actually
reflects in the touch keyboard as when
you change in the touch keypad and let
me just show you that so spell
correction on work completion off so
those two things will help you type
faster and with more accuracy so that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
