pocket now calm and this is the software
toward the HTC snap that was just
released in europe and will soon be on
many global carriers at subsidized
prices now the snap isn't trying to be a
super capable do everything device like
the HTC touch pro and you can tell that
because it doesn't have a touchscreen
it's got lower capabilities in terms of
in terms of the hardware specifications
less ram and so forth fewer wireless
radios but it does so unapologetically
it's made to be a really killer
messaging device thanks to this
fantastic keyboard and the trackball
which allows you to move quickly around
on items on the screen and as you're
going to see in this video it helps a
lot to make navigation much smoother but
as you saw in the hardware tour if you
watch that video and i'll put a link up
on the video towards the end one of the
biggest problems with this device is
that the eight key isn't all the way to
the left instead there's a tab key here
so what that means is you're typing
along expecting there to be an Akey
there because other similar devices like
the motorola q9 have the a key over
there and you accidentally press the tab
key it gets kind of annoying but it's
something that you'll have to learn to
live with if you're getting this
particular version of the snap so let's
go through the software and i'm going to
zoom in on the screen so right now i
have the device locked so i'm going to
hit the unlock sequence and over there
and here we are now in terms of software
there's pretty much standard fare on the
snap there have been a few
customizations made from HTC for example
the volume comes right from the HTC
touch pro and all the new HTC touch
screen devices but of course that's not
that big of a deal let me get a little
bit closer and on the screen even so
let's go through the sliding panel
interface because HTC has added a few
things so here we have the clock up here
of course and it tells you if Wi-Fi is
available we can go down to our calendar
and flip to the right to see our next
calendar appointments see if we have any
mixed cause or missed emails of course
it'll tell you if you have text messages
or emails right in that one screen and
again I'm just moving the little ball
down gently and it's it's the
sensitivity is quite good you can change
it I'll show you how to change the
sensor
tivity and this is for making a new
message here our emails this is whether
and if we tap on the weather we actually
get a nice little five-day forecast here
we have internet explorer and you can
add your favorites here although if
you're not using Internet Explorer if
you're using skyfire as I am this really
doesn't do you any good now if we go
down to play all songs and we tap in
word it will search your device for any
multimedia that you have on your device
now I have some Dave Matthews on here
and I can go into the audio manager and
this is the cool looking HTC audio
manager we can go back to the library
and this makes it just really easy to
play music right from your home screen
if you're at the gym you'll have to use
HTC's proprietary headphones or use a
converter Jack because of course the
port over on the side get that uses
HTC's proprietary but it's nice to see
this audio manager which makes it pretty
easy to you know manager multimedia
right from the home screen going down we
have an entry with multiple options we
can you know change the date and time
setup EML lock the device set up
bluetooth set a background change the
ringtone and transfer music to your
device going down we change the profile
as well as always stipulates whether
your device will vibrate whether it will
ring whether it will be completely
silent or if it's on automatic which is
the best choice it'll determine that
based on your availability in the
calendar okay so let's go into the
programs and we're gonna venture Lee
talk about that inner circle feature
this is probably the biggest deal about
the snap beyond the keyboard so let's go
into the start menu and see what we have
here so again pretty standard stuff
messaging calendar we have off this
mobile which is good if we go into
multimedia we have some interesting
things we've HTC's album and again this
is another element that has been ported
over from the touch pro and the other
higher-end HTC devices it's a really
slick looking photo gallery so we can
tap on a picture and if we go to the
right with it with little trackball we
get to the next picture if we tap on a
picture we get some options we can go to
menu and we can set it as the home
wallpaper we can make a slideshow you
can save it to a contact if you want to
have it's a picture show up in full
screen so let's go back and back again
we have the camera applique
for the 2 point 0 megapixel camera we
have the standard windows mobile photo
gallery we have streaming media meaning
you can watch youtube videos on here if
you're using em youtube com which is
good we have a video recorder which
works in a similar fashion then the
camera does we'll cover that in the
review and of course windows media
player right there to the right here we
have internet explorer which actually is
a little bit different this is the newer
version and you saw a mouse cursor on
the screen you see that it's a very
blackberry pearl like way to navigate
and so if we go to a site like you know
pocketnow.com and again I'm using
skyfire because I just like the added
speed of that but you may find this new
version of pocket Internet Explorer to
actually be somewhat compelling it's not
as fast as skyfire so I'm gonna probably
to jump ahead in the video to show you
what it looks like when it loads on the
screen and then we have the mobile
version of pocketnow.com and you should
be able to change that actually if we go
into this menu when we go to view yes
see we can change it to mobile or
desktop so that's that's the Internet
Explorer let's get out of here so what
okay other stuff call history of course
games the standard fare google maps and
gps on the HTC snap works very well it
has full assisted gps indoors on a cold
start i was able to get a signal in
about 12 seconds in a hot start or a
warm start it's you know 34 seconds very
fast great gps performance as good as
the touch pro to go into accessories we
have some new things so we have you know
clear storage clock and alarm
communication manager which again is
skinned just like it is on the higher
end HTC devices so you have this nice
looking 3d switcher internet sharing sim
manager voice notes task manager and
here we've google maps and of course i
put skyfire on there because i think
it's a fantastic web browser twiki any
which is a really really good twitter
client for windows mobile
non-touchscreen or touch screen and
inner circle which i'm gonna explain
right now because that's the really big
feature of this of this device now from
any screen whether you're in you know
skyfire or your
and you know TWiki knee or in your
calendar you can go to the bottom of the
keyboard and press this inner circle
button and I know the camera is having
trouble focusing right now so if i press
that button you'll be taken to a filter
screen which filters out all of your
email by only the people that are in
your inner circle right now I have two
people set Anton and Adam Lane and the
way that you set the people in your
inner circle and by the way from this
screen you just tap on a message and it
brings it up just as usual just as just
as if you were in outlook mobile and
then of course you can jump right to all
email if you press this button and
there's some menu options in here so if
I go to menu and I go to member list it
shows all the people that I have in my
inner circle so right now there are four
people so it's going to stand my inbox
for any messages from Chung Adam Ilana
or Anton and show me the matches now I
can add people of course if i go to add
and i am taken to my standard address
book that comes out of my phone and i
can just go down the list and check off
people that i want to be in my inner
circle or uncheck them and they will be
added it's a very very simple concept in
fact there's actually a tutorial that is
very very small let me show you the
tutorial here it is tutorial and this is
it group your closest contacts in one
location your inner circle dedicated
inner circle key so you use the key down
there simply add members from your
contact list or receive messages and
then it goes through a little animation
and it's demonstrating how it would work
I hope these aren't really now dresses
and that's it that's the death the end
it's a very simple concept really so
does the inner circle actually matter
what people use it well here's the thing
if you get a lot of email and I know a
lot of people do from you know 10 15 20
people a day and really at the end of
the day you only care about what five of
them have to say those are the five
people you correspond with the most
they're your business partners or your
co-workers or your family and your
friends then if that's you then inner
circle is a fantastic feature but if
you're like me and it just so happens
due to various email filters that the
email that I get on my phone is we're
already filtered then it's it's not
going to have much utility so I'm not
going to be using the feature that much
but I know so many people that could get
a lot of use from it so finally we're
going to go through some settings and
see if there's anything interesting in
the settings which there really isn't
there are some speed adjustments for the
trackball which is really all that is
different so we can go into trackball
here and we can change the sensitivity
from slow to normal too fast right now
I've it on fast which I honestly don't
think it's fast enough I think it needs
to be even more sensitive we can show
this change in sensitivity in the
browser enable repeat mode and kind of
stipulate exactly how many lines it
scrolls when you're in an email and that
sort of thing so overall the software on
the HTC snap is very standard stuff HTC
has done you know a few customizations
to make it more elegant as they normally
do but in the end this is a windows
mobile non-touchscreen device it has
very snappy performance the trackball is
a really great way to navigate and it's
quite unusual for a windows mobile
device of this kind and the keyboard
does take some getting used to as we
mentioned in the hardware tour video and
you can actually use it to do certain
things like the inner circle or open up
messaging or start a new text message
there are a bunch of keys here we can
even lie launch windows live messenger
from the keyboard so that's it for the
software tour will be back soon with the
full review on pocketnow.com in case you
missed it i'll put the unboxing video
and the hardware tour video up on the
screen now so you can jump to that after
this video if you're interested in the
HTC snap again if you want to snap up
your own you can get one at clove coat
UK shipping for about 255 British pounds
that's around 430
others depending on the time of day and
that's it for now we'll be back soon
