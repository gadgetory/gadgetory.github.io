corner and you know what that means more
cool stuff coming to Google's Android
operating system what are we going to
see we don't know for sure but here are
some of our predictions what are some
things we might find at this year's
google i/o number one hardware Google
loves to release new hardware at Google
i/o that's where we saw the motorola
xoom that's where we saw the Galaxy
Nexus so what are we going to see this
time around probably not a phone because
we saw that last time with the Galaxy
Nexus but one thing we probably will see
is Android 4.1 which is codenamed
jellybean some things that we know so
far one it might not be 4.1 probably
will but we won't know until they
announce it I'll get to that in a minute
jellybean we're pretty sure because
earlier today they got a big Android
filled with jelly beans out in front of
you know the Android building at the
Google campus so chances are it's going
to be called jelly bean now 4.1 versus
five point oh well Google kind of let
that one slip as well so you can buy the
google nexus directly from the google
play store and we did capture a
screenshot that said that it's going to
be the first device that gets jelly bean
android version 4.1 they quickly took
that down so of course they could change
their minds it might be 4.3 it might be
seven point 12 I don't know but if I
were a betting man I'd say it's 4.1 and
it's coming to the Galaxy Nexus as the
first phone phone so probably no new
hardware tablets however rumor has it
google is going to get directly involved
into the tablet market you see to date
we haven't had a google nexus tablet
what do i mean by that well we've had
google nexus phone starting with the
nexus one which was a google phone
it was built by HTC and later later
iterations have been built by Samsung
but it was a google phone pure Google
with tablets we haven't had that we had
the motorola xoom but it was a motorola
tablet just running a pure stock version
of Android Honeycomb which since has
been updated to Android Ice Cream
Sandwich but it still hasn't been a
Google device so what we suspect and
what we're predicting is we will see a
Google branded tablet it will probably
be called the Google Nexus tablet or the
google nexus 7 or the Nexus 7 tablet or
something like that it will probably be
a 7-inch device and it will be able to
go head-to-head against some of the
e-book reader / hybrid tablet things you
know who you are nook and kindle fire
they're cheap and they're not a real
Android experience but they're half the
price of an Android tablet Google is
probably going to offer this tablet for
somewhere around one hundred and
ninety-nine dollars another prediction
but beyond hardware what else are we
going to get moving from hardware to
software let's start with the operating
system jelly bean we predict is going to
have improvements to the way Android
handles some of the hardware that we
have in existing tablets and smartphones
particularly around multi-core
processors GPUs and being able to more
adequately handle additional amounts of
RAM all three of these components need
to play nicely together we suspect the
jelly bean is going to help unify all
these take advantage of some of the
higher-end features and functionalities
that we're seeing in the latest rounds
of hardware next since LTE is coming to
most carriers around the world the US
has been a little bit slow to adopt but
we're getting there we suspect that
voice over LTE would become a native
part of the operating system so that the
dialer will be able to handle that right
there inside the dialer app itself right
inside jellybean what
not any need for additional third party
stuff to make it work speaking of
graphics there's probably going to be
additional support for higher
resolutions specifically 1080p we really
haven't seen much of that in current
versions of Android and we suspect that
may be a limitation of the current
iteration of Ice Cream Sandwich jelly
bean however we suspect is going to be
able to handle these larger resolutions
and be able to do so much more
gracefully than a lower version of
Android would we also think that this
might tie in really well with Google TV
which is currently running up to Android
Honeycomb 3.2 and is designed for a
ten-foot experience on large
high-definition television screens can
you imagine Google TV in full 1080p with
really really crisp graphics we might
also see some hardware announcements
around that as well number three is apps
now I know apps aren't specifically
jellybean related but they are hear me
out so Google has this new 3d mapping
technology they kind of tried to beat
Apple to the punch kind of give them a
little of a bit of a jab back after
apple pulled support for google maps as
the default map provider in iOS so
Google came out and said well we got
this really cool 3d thing where we can
make 3d maps and you know buildings
trees terrain based on photography we
don't have to have modeling anymore to
do that instead just a whole bunch of
computing power and a really smart
algorithm they showed that off in fact
we showed that you can check that back
at pocketnow.com and it's really really
cool but we haven't seen it in action on
any one of our devices yet reason I
suspect is it is going to be jelly bean
specific they're going to be some api's
and some extra stuff inside jelly bean
that are required to make this new
version of maps work to get all the 3d
glory and let me tell you if you haven't
seen it it is amazing just completely
blows your mind can you imagine
individually modeling not only every
building but every tree
in a metropolitan area you just can't do
it this however this can be done so
we're probably going to see Google Maps
3d released for devices running
jellybean which it release time is
probably going to be the tablet and
maybe if we're lucky galaxy next I that
are running or upgraded to jellybean
very very shortly however don't want
that concern you if the past is an
indicator of the future will likely see
Google reverse engineer these new
features to run on previous versions of
Android starting first with ice cream
sandwich and then moving slowly backward
until they get the majority of everyone
covered so we suspect that Google Maps
3d will be a major component that's
going to be brought forth with Android
4.1 jelly bean Google assistant or
Google assist or who knows what they're
going to call it but Google needs to do
something to combat Siri Siri is
ridiculously intuitive and helpful and
bridges the gap from well user and
computer to digital assistant which is
really the holy grail of where we want
these devices to be we haven't heard
much but we suspect google has been
doing something to improve the the
google voice intense that we have right
now and have had for some time in
previous versions and current versions
of android we suspect we might see
something from google that will help to
bridge that gap and at least catch up
with where Apple is with Siri lastly
polish operating systems look best when
they're polished when there are no rough
edges things look right they look
consistent and their intuitive they do
what you want to do without you thinking
about how they have to be done now this
is something that is a continuous
process so we're going to continue to
see that refinement that polish in this
and future versions of Android it's
nothing groundbreaking but it is
something that just makes the overall
experience even better so there you go
our four major predictions four major
areas of prediction
really but what about yours I know we've
only got a few hours left before so go
ahead and go on the record with what you
predict we're going to see at Google i/o
specifically what we're going to see in
Android 4.1 jelly bean make sure you
head over to pocketnow.com and leave
those comments over there for pocket now
predicting the future I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
