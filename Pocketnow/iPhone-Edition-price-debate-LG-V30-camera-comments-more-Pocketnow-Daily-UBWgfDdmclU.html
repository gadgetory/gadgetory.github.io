the possible iPhone edition price tag
another separate debate goes around the
aperture for the LGB 30 camera and
Netflix HDR just got deployed to a good
deal of new smartphones I'm Jaime Rivera
and with all this debating over the
price tag of the next iPhone I wonder if
all that is going to lead to any sort of
discount this is parking out daily the
official lucid a begin with deals if
you're in the market for the Huawei
watch 2 and there are a ton of reasons
why you should continues to be one of my
favorite watches and you'll probably
notice that in my videos well it's
currently for one hundred and ninety-six
dollars in the case of the sport variant
on Amazon you can actually find the
classic variant which is the one that
I'm currently wearing for 237 bucks now
you all know that Huawei watches are not
cheap so this is about the best time to
buy a couple of very interesting things
have happened to the Microsoft Surface
laptop number one there are more
countries being supported now when it
comes to sales so yeah you can follow a
link in the description you'll get the
full list and hopefully our country's
there but the second and most important
thing is that for those of you that are
not liking Windows 10s well the window
to upgrade to any other version of
Windows has just been extended you can
now actually choose until the end of
March 2018
that is great as I don't know why
anybody would stay in Windows 10 s like
seriously not on a product is powerful
and for those of you that don't like the
fact that there are very few smartphones
to support HDR and Dolby vision for
Netflix actually Dolby vision I believe
is only supported by the LG G six but
yeah when it comes to HDR the LG b 30
the sony xperia xz1 and the Galaxy Note
8 have been added to the list of devices
that supported
sadly the LGB 30 is not close to being
out and then the Galaxy Note 8 is still
shipping to certain consumers so yeah
the cool thing is you'll unbox your
phone and you can watch the Netflix in
HDR even if I still don't watch Netflix
on a phone a very interesting debate has
been happening on the web over the LGB
30 and the camera aperture of the
primary lens there are certain
publications that we're claiming that
this device is just of F 1.7 according
to the exif data and now we have other
publications in year
that are showing the device is
effectively f 1.6 aperture the reason
why we haven't really shined over the
comments or the topics is mainly because
we are all using prototypes this is not
final hardware I will trust the numbers
and I will mention these numbers in our
review whenever the final review units
arrive but yeah this is something that's
been happening out there and finally the
very interesting news that they have to
do with analyst and the price tag that
they're predicting for the iPhone
addition notice we're not calling an
iPhone 8 or iPhone X anymore it makes a
lot of sense for this device to be
called iPhone addition according to one
publication $1200 is too much money for
this phone it is closer to 900 dollars
and this publication is actually very
trusted and there will apparently be a
higher tier device more storage that
will cost you more money and that more
money is something we still don't know
how much it will be obviously it'll
depend on the storage but yeah the
question for today would be I mean
regardless 1200 900 do you feel that
either of these price tags make sense
for a device like this because in my
case hey if they said $900 it makes a
lot of sense meaning from an economical
standpoint yes of course I'd love to pay
that but judging by what Apple has done
over the years and by what I paid for
the iPhone 7 plus I don't think it's
gonna be that inexpensive but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
