is the new kid on the block and the
galaxy s4 will be obsolete in about five
hours from now we're just going to
compare the two so that you can get a
sense of how they fare up as I mentioned
the galaxy s4 will be the old phone in a
couple of hours but just for a quick
size comparison between the two you will
see exactly how these two compare and
both in terms of height width and
thickness we're not going to go into too
many specification here because
obviously we have a top-of-the-line
phone here on the x xperia z2 we have
these navigon 801 plus 4 processor
clocking in at two point three gigahertz
this specific galaxy s4 which I'm
holding here is the Exynos octa core
version which is really a dual quad-core
version 3 gigs of RAM on the Z 2 2 gigs
of RAM on the s4 camera 20.7 megapixels
on the z to a regular 13 megapixel
camera on the s4 again this will be
obsolete in a couple of hours just a
quick quick a person so that you guys
can size it up and see how much bigger
the z2 is but also in terms of its
display which is a five-point to ensure
that was a quick look at the z2 compared
to the s4 we're going to compare it to
the one and then move on to other phones
thank you very much for watching hannah
behind a camera this wasn't done and
you've been watching bucket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
