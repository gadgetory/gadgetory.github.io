preview but there's one thing power
users have been missing more than
anything else I'm Joe Levi with pocket
now this is how to root Android L I've
gone ahead and downloaded the latest
version of the cf-auto-root package and
extracted that to my desktop once there
you can see we've got a folder that's
got a few script files for linux mac and
windows i'm going to show you the
windows version here and we've got some
other directories the image itself and
tools just a quick peek in there if you
wanted to see what's in there ADB and
fastboot will use fastboot here in just
a minute and then image is our
cf-auto-root with the Hammerhead image
hammerhead of course is the nexus 5 so
I've opened up a command prompt with
administrative privileges and navigated
to that folder in fact I've navigated
into the tools folder the reason for
that i've rebooted my device up into
fastboot mode and the way you do that is
power off and power back on holding down
volume down and power at the same time
you guys know how to do that so there's
just a quick refresher once you're there
we want to check and make sure all the
USB drivers and everything are installed
so we're going to type in fast boot
space devices and here is the serial
number of that connection and we are in
fact in fastboot mode so we should be
good to go I'm going to go ahead and
clear my directory navigate back one and
at this point really all we should have
to do is type in route dash windows hit
enter it tells us at this point as some
warnings so let's go through them really
quick if you have not already OEM
unlocked your device which I have you
are going to have to OEM unlock it for
this process to work that process will
wipe everything on your device it's a
clean clean Factory reboot the whole
thing so this is your chance to abort if
you don't want to do that now an item of
note for you to flash the Android L
Developer Preview you have had to had an
unlocked bootloader already so it was
possible for you to relock your
bootloader but most of us don't do that
at that stage of the game so
you're probably okay just keep this in
mind it may wipe your device after we
unlock this cf-auto-root is going to
boot we should see a big red Android on
our devices screen and we should be good
to go so let's press any key to continue
you can see it failed because I'm
already unlocked that's a good thing
don't worry about that it's downloading
the boot image rebooting to that boot
image there's that big red Android that
they talked about rebooting in 10
seconds after that it says that it may
take a minute or so for the red Android
to appear but mine was almost immediate
and I'm going to press any key to
continue and that's it my device is now
rebooting we'll wait for that to come up
and once it does we'll walk through and
see if we've got super user and all
right we're rebooted and i have
downloaded and installed super SU now
again this is the management utility
this is not an auto Rooter as some
people might might assume that's that's
not correct open up super SU and we're
not getting a warning message like we
did in the past when we did not have the
superuser binary installed so everything
looks good there I don't have any apps
that require yet so let's go ahead and
fire one up let's go over to our place
tour I like clock sync app so let's type
that in clock sync we will download and
install this now this is a really cool
app it's pretty basic it goes out and it
gets the the time from the internet time
servers and it updates your clock based
on that and you can set it to whatever
time server you want and have it do all
kinds of cool stuff there is a root
version and a non-root version it all
inside the same app so let's see if this
works there's our ntp server enabling
auto synchronizations i'm going to
change that to every three hours just
for kicks and giggles and we'll do that
only when the device is awake this is
where we could change it into rootless
mode if we needed to so once we've got
all that done
we want to do is synchronize our clocks
and this should then throw up a
challenge a root challenge for us and
we'll see if everything is working the
way that we want it to so will
synchronize there's our super user
request we will go ahead and grant that
it's been granted superuser permission
time has been synced we're good to go we
now have root on Android L that's how
you go about rooting your Android L
powered device now this could change
over time because Android L is not
firmly locked down yet also as my old
Uncle Ben used to say with routing comes
great responsibility so use it wisely
the last item of note is that Google is
continuing to make changes to the way
root access works and putting more
restrictions on it to find out more
about that make sure you click on the
link in the description down below where
we'll have an article that describes
some of the changes that you can expect
in the meantime that's how to go about
getting root on your Nexus 5 running
Android L if you like the video please
give it a thumbs up and if you haven't
subscribed yet we'd love for you to do
so so you don't miss out on any of the
cool stuff that's coming up we're also
on all your favorite social media
networks so you can tell your friends
all about us over there for Puckett now
showing off root android l and lots of
other cool stuff i'm joe levi thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
