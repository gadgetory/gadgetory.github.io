xoom but wait a minute did pocket now
just get really big pockets or does this
have something to do with smartphones
let's go see all right now like i
mentioned in the intro this is a
motorola xoom the zoom is the launch
device for google and the honeycomb
tablet platform what do i mean by that
well Google when they come out with a
new device or new technology that is
really supposed to form the way that
other manufacturers build devices for
their platforms that's called a launch
device and the person who or the company
who helps realize that vision is called
the launch partner well with smartphones
you're familiar with the the nexus one
the Nexus S and maybe the nexus prime if
our rumors are correct about what it's
going to be named those are all the
launch devices that Google has come out
with it mark the next major step in the
Android platform development well this
is a tablet and we're not a tablet site
so what does this have to do with
anything well Motorola long was the
launch partner for tablets and for
honeycomb which is great but again what
does that have to do with smartphones
let me show you a couple things here
with honeycomb and then we'll see what
it has to do now I'm going to launch my
app drawer and let's take google
messenger and put it out here on to this
screen just like that you saw the frames
right there and how this interface works
to get stuff from there to there it when
we switch from screen to screen you can
kind of see a little ghostly outline
over here that has to do with the mark a
shin of the screen now watch real close
when I move this there's a very subtle
grid of pluses in fact let me see if I
can zoom in on that
little bit for you so you can see
exactly what I'm talking about so right
here let's move this around and ever so
slightly you can see a grid a little
plus signs that's a better place to seem
you see the little plus signs and the
little drop shadow that shows me where
it's going to snap to kind of cool right
there and then I can drop it it helps me
a line what I'm doing on my screen with
with where I can put stuff and it helps
answer a question that people have had
regarding how do I organize my home
screens and what not now the same thing
is true with widgets fact if I come over
here move this you'll notice on this
widget not only is it scrollable but if
I long hold I get these little pull bars
on the side and I can make that widget
longer just like that so very very cool
very easy and a nice way to help
organize stuff on this much larger
screen now let's go back to launch
partners motor oil is the launch partner
for the tablet version of Android which
is honeycomb so arguably this is a pure
Android Honeycomb environment this is
the interface that Google wanted it
doesn't have any TouchWiz it doesn't
have anything else to overlay on top of
it this is it so let's get back now to
smartphones this is the droid bionic
you've seen that in some videos of ours
and a couple of things that you'll note
let's come over here here's my calendar
widget let's tap and hold on that and if
you notice I've got little grab bars now
the kind of frame it and let me
manipulate it and move it around as I
scroll from side to side let me do this
rather as I move something from side to
side you can see those little ghosts
there on the side see where my where my
screens are and then if you look real
close in here you can see if I don't
accidentally push the power button you
can see that I've got those
little plus signs down there as well get
a little bit closer view of that for you
too if it stops auto focusing now this
interface is not uncommon from what
you've seen another Motorola devices it
kind of takes a step towards something
else something interesting it's not
really motoblur it's not really a droid
what is it well I don't know for sure
but it sure seems to me like they took
some hints from honeycomb on the
motorola xoom and incorporated them in
the launcher on the motorola droid
bionic was that just hints or are we
actually seeing some of the bits of
Android Ice Cream Sandwich built into
the Droid Bionic I don't know but it's
looking kind of that way to me let us
know what you think in the comments down
below if you like seeing some of these
speculative videos make sure you give
the video a big thumbs up if you haven't
yet subscribe to our video channel make
sure you do that we've got some fun
stuff that's always coming out and we
want to make sure you don't miss out on
anything of course head on over to
pocketnow.com and read the article
associated with this video leave your
comments there as well and let me know
if I missed anything are there any other
bits and pieces of honeycomb for tablets
that have been put into this version of
gingerbread for smartphones really
interesting really fun I'm eager to hear
what you have to say for pocket now
showing off what could be bits of ice
cream inside your smartphone i'm joe
levi
