Android and it starts with a more
serious attempt at hardware the stamp
something is made by Google should mean
something and that even includes a great
honeymoon phase I'm hematuria vana with
pocket now and we just spent 24 hours
with the Google pixel since its
inception Google has vowed for
simplicity from the barren landing page
on its search engine to the little
things like the disappearing navigation
buttons within applications the key to
understanding Google is to notice just
how much it cares about the content and
not how its portrayed that's the perfect
way to describe the Google pixel its
front is as barren and as basic as a
smartphone can get since the story here
is what's portrayed on the display we've
got a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED panel with
punch of your colour than we've seen on
previous Nexus devices and about my only
complaint is that the quite black finish
doesn't blend well with the deep blacks
of the display the real story is the
back the anodized aluminum feels very
smooth and actually different to every
other phone I've held as if there was an
added layer of texture to the aluminum
that's not felt on the latest iPhone or
even the HTC 10 the curves then blend to
a device that feels small in the hand or
at least smaller than your average
5-inch display device setting it up for
the first time shows a very different
Android to set up there's a new
animation that hints to a phone being a
work in progress you're prompted for
your SIM card and I'll be continuing to
test project Phi on the pixel here you
connect to Wi-Fi to activate the phone
and it offers options to the restore
from the USB OTG from another Android
phone or set it up as new I decided to
restore from an old phone which now
requires me to go to the Google
application on the old phone to restore
the project file setup follows and you
add one or more fingerprints along with
your password the most important part of
the setup is with the Google assistant
the main reason for this phone to exist
and be unique is really this service in
particular and Google teaches you how to
use the assistant and what it can
- before it starts restoring your
applications the coolest thing about the
honeymoon phase with a Google phone is
trying out the latest developments for
Android to start I've never seen Google
so serious about wallpapers they
understand insane list of options to
choose from and I decided to go for a
very interesting aura option the change
is depending on the time of day I'm
really liking most of the elements of
the new launcher like the denser grid of
icons I've pretty much narrowed my
homescreen to just two screens and I'm
really struggling to fill up the second
one I love that there is still an app
tray from a single swipe from the bottom
instead of a button and the new
notification shade that can go from six
quick icons to two lists that you can
edit around for your convenience and
even cooler that navigation shade even
works with the fingerprint scanner
there are even new tricks like a
nightlight to make the low light use
convenient though it's more aggressive
than I've seen on other competing
devices obviously not everything is
perfect and what I really don't like is
this persistent date bar at the top
that's kind of unpredictable sometimes
it shows you the weather sometimes it
doesn't if it does you can tap on it to
show you the forecast but if it doesn't
you can't tap on it and select anything
and as much as I love that the
persistent search bar now became a
button you're pretty much just left with
the same experience where you really
can't move anything around here anymore
another is that welp who came up with
this design of the folders you know I
honestly don't mind that the circles
aren't standard but the rounded cross
effect on the applications within
folders is just weird and then finally
the fact that the always-on display is
not really always-on anymore in the past
that was really hard to figure out how
it worked with the Nexus 6p but now it
just flat-out only works when you get
notifications and as for the main
protagonists of this phone the Google
assistant so far my experience has been
mixed I love the quick way you can just
call on it from the phone being on
standby
I love how easily it is to be accessible
from the home button I love the
conversational style of the user
interface I love that it's really smart
at getting my information on the spot
and it's also contextual what I don't
like is that it's not
as smart as Siri and things like for
example getting you an uber sending a
tweet or updating your Facebook status
now we do know that Google has a plan to
provide support for third-party
developers but that really can't come
soon enough
still let's be fair which is scratching
the surface of testing this phone so far
battery life has proven to be decent
even for its small size and one thing
that I really like is how fast it is to
charge topping even the HTC 10 on its
speed the single speaker is also plenty
loud but just keep your fingers away
from it as it's the worse whenever you
muffle it and then there's this new
approach the camera that's really got me
curious Google has decided to not jump
into the sub f/2 aperture race but has
compensated with software this is a very
speedy camera that takes very good and
colorful photos even in the fog loom
that I'm dealing with I love that HDR
plus is now miles faster than on the
Nexus 6p and as for night shots well I
have noticed a little bit of grain but
it's not really that bad but again it's
too early to judge performance overall
the Google pixel is a very neat little
package that has done a good job at
pulling me back into the Google
ecosystem my first Android phone was a
Nexus One and following the pure Google
Hardware mentality has been my preferred
way to enjoy the ecosystem ever since I
won't lie I am very excited for the full
review period coming up and we would
love to know what you would like us to
test in the comments down below
