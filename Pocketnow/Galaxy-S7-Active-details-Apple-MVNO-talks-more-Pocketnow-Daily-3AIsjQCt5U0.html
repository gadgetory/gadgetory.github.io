gets confirmed by sources we get more
details on what to expect for the one
plus three and the rumors of an apple
MVNO might have just gotten shut down
I'm hey I'm gonna be verra reporting now
from Beijing trying to look for VPNs
like there's no tomorrow this is pocket
out daily
the official news today have to do with
the the new pebble to the new pebble
time to and the whole change in the
company's approach to focusing on
fitness it's funny we don't select this
as the hottest news today and that's
mainly because pebble has really been
struggling this is another Kickstarter
campaign we are expecting a lot from
these new products we still do not have
a final date as to when to expect them
but it does seem like a pebbles on to
something let's just see if it pulls off
and speaking of wearables one company
that's not tired of experimenting is
Google now we hear about its new project
soli which is a new radar based system
that allows you to interact with your
wearable without the need of touching it
through gestures and we've seen
gesture-based interaction for the
longest time on smartphones and that
never went anywhere but let's see if
this one actually works even though it
wouldn't be the first time the Google
try something that it just did just two
years later and for those of you that
are concerned about the future of the
one plus three mainly because of its
invite system the company CEO was just
on record not to deny that it won't
happen but sort of saying that it won't
be that bad in addition we also hear the
device might bring an 8 megapixel selfie
shooter which was the missing link in
all the leaks and specifications it
could just be that the one plus three is
a hot device again the design looks
really nice let's just hope that the
invite system just doesn't kill things
off now as will the spotlight over to
Apple the company CEO Tim Cook was
recently interviewed and when asked
about a possible Apple envia know sort
of like what we see with Google's
Project Phi according to Tim Cook the
company likes to focus on things that
are global and having a carrier would
not be a global product obviously this
is something that would only make iPhone
experience is better but not something
they could implement in other parts of
the world even mentioned its
partnerships of carriers and everything
which is sad news we were expecting for
Google to pull something similar to
project 5 but it wouldn't be the first
time that apple says it won't do
something and it does as well and
finally the very hot rumors that they
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy s7
active famous tipster Evan blast was
recently telling us that we can expect
two very important things number one it
won't remind us of the galaxy s7 edge
instead it will look more like the
galaxy s7 with a 5.1 inch
display in all the specifications but
what makes this device cool is the fact
that we parently we were getting a 4000
milliamp hour battery yeah that's a lot
of battery and given the legendary
battery life of the galaxy s7 edge this
could only mean great things but it does
lead me to the question of the day when
given the choice galaxy s7 galaxy s7
edge or galaxy s of an active which one
would you pick because I'm not going to
deny after seeing the galaxy s6 active
that the sign was so cool that actually
I preferred that phone over the galaxy
s6 but hey we would love to see what we
get with the galaxy s of an active and
we can't wait to hear your comments down
