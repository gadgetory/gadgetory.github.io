multi-touch gestures for your iphone
verizon to offer rebates for some who
perches the iphone 4 and a Steve Jobs
steps down for another medical leave
what we expect for the next generation
our iphone all this and more coming up
right now hello everybody I'm hi Madame
iveta and welcome to the pocket now I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
well iOS 4.3 beta 2 is out and you
guessed it just as we talked in the past
I review we do get multi-touch gestures
on your iPhone hopefully this is still a
beta and it's still a demo and rumors
are that we won't really see it come out
on the next generation release for the
OS though even though it may be a little
you know complicated for hands like mine
to be able to handle four finger
multi-touch gestures on a small screen
it does become really cool to have the
options so we'll see what Apple chooses
to do in the end and while aside from
the gestures other new features that
will probably come to iOS 4.3 is native
cropping or should we say a better way
to crop images and also the possibility
to finally rotate your images in a you
know simple way we're really not sure if
this will also make the release but you
know this is something really overdue so
hopefully we'll see it come out now
rumors are that iOS 4.3 beta 2 also
hands into features we could expect on
the next generation iphone and not
necessarily the next generation OS these
features have to do with improved media
streaming services to what we get with
airplay and also improve services that
will allow you to stream images now the
cool thing is apparently the service
will allow you to stream images and
video between the vices meaning between
users not necessarily other things like
a TV or the Apple TV if this becomes
mainstream then we could expect the
ability to be able to take an image
right now and stream it to different
devices or different users in our
network now the problem is it seems that
this feature will be stuck to mobileme
users so yeah we'll probably have to pay
for it but again these are only beta
rumors so let's see what happens in the
end
now if you recently got stuck to a
contract with verizon meaning you bought
a smartphone between november 26 2010
and january 10 2011 you'll be happy to
know that verizon will be offering a
debit card for two hundred dollars if
you purchase a verizon iphone 4 at full
retail price now remember full retail
price means a six hundred and something
dollars for the 16 gigabyte model 750
and over for the 32 gigabyte model still
not cheap but then again it's a cheaper
way to get your hands on a new verizon
iphone 4 if you really want one so
anyways and well jailbreakers keep
having fun a new feature in cydia now
allows you to record the applications
that you've downloaded in the past all
you have to do is log on to cydia with
your google account or your facebook
account and you just have to hit manage
from now on and it will remember all the
applications and packages you've
downloaded onto your iOS device so why
is this cool well in the past if you
have to upgrade to a new version of iOS
you pretty much have to lose everything
you did with Cydia so from now on all
you have to do is upgrade log aren't the
city and you'll be able to download the
packages you had already downloaded in
the past and not as I shall we have to
look for them again so new features
coming in really cool
well that does it for the coolest
continue on with the not so cool Steve
Jobs steps down for another medical
leave and our opinion is that we should
be concerned both about his health and
also about apples future if he doesn't
return sadly if you remember back with
the release of the iphone 3gs there
really wasn't much of a difference
between the iphone 3gs and the 3g
hardware really wasn't revamped that
much and it did have changes internally
but then again the outer portion of the
device remained pretty much the same so
I do hope this is not the trend for
apple with the next generation iphone
though we could expect it to be true
steve-o we do hope you get back soon we
do hope your health is better we do hope
to see you back you are the iconic
figure that has Apple where it is and it
has provided the vision of all the
multiple gadgets we do enjoy so yeah we
do hope you get better soon and well
Apple's new thing seems to be tamper
resistant screws yeah from pentalobe to
some really weird holes and slabs of
metal it seems that Apple doesn't want
you to tamper with your device now yeah
well expect it to be a lot more
expensive for you to fix your device if
something goes wrong and while you live
in the United States or in countries
where genius bar is awkward then you do
have an easy solution if something goes
wrong but if your iPhone Falls and
something you know falls out of place
you'll be set to know that it won't be
that cheap for you to fix your phone
from here on anyways and well-paying the
long-lost flop from 2010 now offers push
notifications for user activity which is
actually really cool considering the
fact that pain didn't really have a way
of letting you know something new happen
with one of your artists now then again
if we really cared about pain to start
with we could find this feature to be
useful but since we don't uh you know
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
