pocketnow.com and this is part two of
two of the sony ericsson xperia x1
software tour now be sure you check out
part one where we talk all about the
panels and what they actually do because
I'm not going to talk about them right
now to start off I want to show you a
few things about this main screen we
have the HTC task manager in the upper
right corner which lets us close program
selectively and programs all at once or
we can dictate what happens when we
press the X in the upper right corner
and windows mobile because as you know
by default it hibernates the program it
doesn't actually close it thus eating up
program memory well you can choose to
have the button actually close the
program with this task manager what's
really interesting is that out of the
box the the x1 is set to end programs
that are running I think this was
something that Sony Ericsson did to try
to get back more program memory this
device is fast enough to where opening a
program is very fast and it doesn't
matter if it's in already in program
memory or not now something that really
bugs me about the x1 is that there's no
easy way to find out how much battery
life is left as you can see there's no
information about battery life on this
panel or on any of the panels we don't
have anything up here except if we hit
the clock but then we get a very crude
battery meter that only shows us every
quarter so we don't know if we have
eighty percent left or seventy-five
percent or anything like that okay so
let's go into the start menu in the
start menu we have Office Mobile so the
full version of office 2007 mobile which
is good if we go into programs and by
the way everything is so fast on the
Xperia if we go into programs we see
that everything is finger friendly here
so we can do the flick scroll we can do
that in context an Internet Explorer
pretty much anywhere in the whole device
you can use your finger let's start off
in games and usually I don't go into
games but in this case hey we actually
get some extra games and it's not trial
where we have extra where Sudoku and
astraware bejeweled 2 let's take a look
and see what they look like
so it's a game of sudoku a full game
it's great okay let's get out of that
and we have adobe reader for pdfs
standard things here let's look at the
Communication Manager which has been
changed a little bit it looks very
similar to the communication manager in
an HTC device while this is an HTC
device technically if we want to file
explorer you can see that I can flick my
finger to move around we've getting
started Google Maps this includes
handango in hand and we've talked about
this before this is really the only
application store program for windows
mobile and it's not even it's not even
that great unfortunately you can't
download trials windows mobile software
is typically more expensive than than
some of the other platforms but you know
it's it's really better than nothing I
suppose so I'm going to close that okay
going down the list we have internet
sharing something for java messenger
quit gps for using a gps okay so let's
go into the phone application so i'm
going to press the call start button
this is how i dial phone numbers and
let's say i want to die on my friend met
so i do ma TT and I scroll down where I
can unhide the keypad and there is right
there and as you've noticed on the skin
for the phone application is really cool
it's it's brushed metal it looks like it
has this 3d effect when you press inward
it looks really great okay so let's go
into the settings there's a lot to show
there okay so here in the settings i'm
going to show you the bands that i can
use this on this is the x1 I and here's
a list of the bands that I can do gsm
900 1800 1900 and 850 and then for UMTS
i have 2100 919 and 850 that is why i'm
able to use this device on AT&amp;amp;T and get
3g speeds if you see up there in the top
here at says h4 hsdpa I was kind of
surprised by that by the way when I got
the phone I wasn't expecting to be able
to get 3g on AT&amp;amp;T let's go to the next
one which says
there's a lot of lot of stuff in here
let's go down the list to illumination
this device actually has indicator
lights all around the device one here
here and here and here and let me show
you what that looks like i can give you
a demonstration so when it's charging
this is what it will look like see that
it's kind of a multicolor LED that that
fades in and out let's see if i have a
low battery it will look like this red
if i have a voicemail it will look like
this kind of a orange color double looks
like it's blinking three times two three
yeah three blinks for a missed call or
for voicemail so if you kind of memorize
all of these different notifications you
can just glance at your device and know
if you have a missed call or if the
battery's low or if you have a reminder
for your calendar appointment so it's a
really innovative notification feature I
like that and of course you can turn it
off completely to save some battery life
going down the list let's go into memory
okay and in terms of memory we have 200
and a little more than 200 megabytes of
program memory total to use which is
huge it's as much as the HTC touch pro
and a lot bigger than most other windows
mobile devices so that really lets you
multitask a lot and use advanced
programs let's go down the list here
optical joystick here we have some
settings for that we can set the
sensitivity we can enable it we can
enable the scroll functionality and
Internet Explorer messaging in contacts
going down the list we have some
settings for spb mobile shell which is
now installed on the device for free
courtesy of that free xperia x1 panel
that you saw in the first video on
software let's go to power and this is
where I come pretty much all the time to
see how much power I have left so far
battery life seems to be ridiculously
good right now it is about five o'clock
and I've been using this device all day
long and this is how much battery power
I've left this is pretty amazing and the
backlight can automatically be adjusted
with a light sensor although
I have it on manual right now so that
when I shoot the video it's not going in
and out different sort of brightnesses
and if we go over to connections we have
some Advanced Options like I said I
inserted my AT&amp;amp;T sim card and the device
automatically configured itself which
was great it asked me do you want to
configure to AT&amp;amp;T settings which is
fantastic and finally i want to show you
opera mobile which has been optimized
for the xperia x1 it's much faster than
any of the betas out there and it looks
a little bit different too ok so here it
is and i'm going to go into landscape
and i'm going to go to cnet com I like
to go there because it's a relatively
complex web page so cnet com you can see
the keyboard backlighting as i type dot
com ok there we go all right and this is
over hsdpa right now i'm not even
connected connected to Wi-Fi and look
how fast it is and i think a lot of this
has to do with the speed of the device
the speed of the software and also the
speed of the network certainly helps and
just as in any opera mobile browser you
can just move your finger move your
stylist double tap to zoom in on an area
opera mobile works really really well on
the xperia x1 so i think the xperia x1
is a really good software offering one
of my favorite parts of the device is
how fast it is even things like screen
rotation are super fast almost instant
which is kind of unheard of for windows
mobile devices will be back with the
full review check out our twitter
account to know exactly when it hits
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets
we'll talk all about battery life will
run benchmarks and we'll talk about all
the pros and cons of the x1 to determine
if it should be your next device that is
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
