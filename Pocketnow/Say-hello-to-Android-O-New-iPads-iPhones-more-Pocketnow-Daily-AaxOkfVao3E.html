a few welcome things and keeps others
Apple surprises everyone with a bevy of
new products silently announced we'll
get quality renders of the samsung
galaxy s 8 along with a pre-order date
I'm hi Mary vetta and thank you very
much Google for making me redo this
video again because you announce things
until after I record this is parking out
daily if it's elucidate again with deals
it is no secret that one of our favorite
smartphones last year with the lgb 20
even as LG didn't really do it much
justice with it advertisement but
anyways it was seven hundred and
something dollars in pretty much every
carrier but if you're interested now
t-mobile has it for a whopping four
hundred eighty dollars I wouldn't even
think about it I would definitely go for
a deal like that other very interesting
rumors now emerged with the samsung
galaxy s 80 s it is not at the end of
this video it's at the beginning this
time fine we apparently have two things
number one possible pre-ordered date to
start on april 7th possible launch date
to be on april eighteenth and if you
want to see some high quality renders of
this phone you can currently find them
in link in the description so far I like
what I see ouch will the spotlight over
to Apple as we've got some trusted
sources that claim that Apple is
planning to reinvent augmented reality
as microsoft hasn't already done that
apparently Apple has something
interesting up its sleeve we heard all
the rumors of the company partnering
with calls ice and everything now if
you're wondering when it's going to
happen apparently the iphone 8 will be
the device for this the only college
that it seems that the glasses that will
be needed for this will not be ready so
we wonder exactly what Apple plans to do
at the beginning we'll see and speaking
of Apple the company has just surprised
everyone with a silent launch of a
couple of products that are actually
noteworthy starting with a new iPad
because the ipad air 2 is no more this
is actually a slightly thicker ipad air
2 the name 9 chip nutella specifications
that make it compelling starting with
that crazy price tag of 300 and
something bucks that's actually hard to
not consider but even the ipad mini 4
got an upgrade
actually now only available at 128 gigs
and is more expensive than this new iPad
we also see double the base storage for
the iphone SE all that is great but i
think that everybody is going crazy over
the new product red iphone even though
we don't really know what else changes
just the color option and the color
option is actually great and obviously
you are supporting a noble cause you can
learn more in the description ads all
the announcements are just too many for
one segments and finally the very
hotness today belong to google the
company has finally announced android oh
and the developer preview is available
it'll take us some time for us to give
you a full video everything that changed
we really don't like to rush these
things but to hate you are getting some
substantial differences and some that
aren't any differences first of all we
are getting more granular controls on
notifications we are getting improvement
in battery life we are getting
improvements we always on this play but
what is not changing is the visual
appeal it looks a lot like Android M it
looks every bit as much as the pixel
launcher and these things could be
positive they could not be positive I
feel that we could have probably called
this Android I don't know 7 dot to
instead of jumping all the way into
Android or it could just be that Android
Oh will be version 7 dot too but anyways
it leads me to the question of as a what
do you think about Android Oh
particularly the fact that it's not
really changing in its design it's
pretty much the same that we're used to
in my case I like it I do like the pixel
launcher I just feel that it could get a
little flash here but anyways leave is a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get this earlier
