all you'll be able to see at the front
new model information already hints to a
feature oneplus in the works and it
seems that Samsung's Galaxy S a has
already begun to ship for some I'm high
metal Iveta and I hope you don't mind
but I feel that it's only adequate that
we commemorate the Star Wars trailer
today it was awesome this is fucking out
daily the official news today begin with
lucky customers if you were on the first
batch of people that ordered your Galaxy
s8 on t-mobile you probably already
receive notification that your device is
shipping and the reason when I say lucky
people is because we were expecting
supply constraints for the galaxy s 8
plus we did not think that it was gonna
ship that early but apparently that
device is also shipping early so yeah we
can't wait for our unit to arrive as
well how about if we talk about market
share as we continue learning how things
are going worldwide for iOS the reason
why I say iOS is because this is the
operating system that's having the
hardest time Apple continues to sell
iPhones like crazy even if it's not
selling as well as it did in the case of
the iPhone 6 for example but apparently
this has really taken a toll in
countries like China where Apple is
taking a dramatic hit that all combined
is an 8 percent drop in market share
yeah Android currently owns 86 percent
of the market Apple is pretty much stuck
at 13 point something and then there
aren't any other mobile operating
systems to talk about that are worthy so
anyways as well the spotlight over to
one plus I am a big fan of what the
company has been doing ever since the
1+3
can't say the same about the previous
attempts but now the company has figured
a lot of things out I am really excited
for the feature of what this company is
going to do and we hear that there is
already a model number a five thousand
this hints to one plus five why because
the number four is apparently for bad
luck in China so one plus five is in the
works I can't wait to see it honestly
now how about if we talk about Toshiba
we rarely ever discuss this company
because it doesn't build smartphones but
it builds a ton of the chips that make
up a smart phone there he was not having
a good time the company just sold its
imaging division to Sony it sold this
medical division to canon
apparently it's next division and
subdivision and Apple is one of the
highest bidders right now there are
other companies interested but we know
that Apple is interested in making a lot
of things on its own so buying this from
Toshiba would make a lot of sense let's
see if it happens and finally the very
hot news today have to do with the
iPhone 8 mainly because it is apparently
going to bring a ton of changes there is
this internal source from Foxconn that
claims things we're not exactly sure if
we should consider them to be final
apparently Apple is struggling with a
few things number one it wants to build
touch ID into the front of the display
it wants to eliminate the button but
it's struggling with yield so it seems
that it does have a plan B to set the
fingerprint scanner at the back second
is that apparently Apple is also working
on having that front-facing camera not
visible apparently it's gonna figure out
a way to better than the display we can
not wait to see that but for those of
you that are wondering exactly how will
this iPhone eight look apparently
according to the source it's gonna look
a lot like the iPhone 7 and what
pertains to size but obviously the
display will pretty much take up 86% of
the screen to body ratio just to give
you an idea the LG g 6s 80% so that is a
lot of display it leads me to the
question of the day if all these things
were to happen do you think that this is
enough innovation for you to consider an
iPhone next in my case yes I'll admit it
will but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
you know the way it goes if you want to
get the news earlier before the video
was filmed follow us our pocket our
comment hit that subscribe button down
below for more videos like this one you
