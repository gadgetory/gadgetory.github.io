all you'll be able to see at the front
new model information already hints to a
feature one plus in the works I think
that Samsung's Galaxy S a has already
begun to ship for some I'm hi Natalie
vetta and I hope you don't mind but I
feel that it's only adequate that we
commemorate the Star Wars trailer today
it was awesome this is out daily
official news today begin with lucky
customers if you were on the first batch
of people that ordered your galaxy s 8
on t-mobile you probably already receive
notification that your device is
shipping and the reason why I say lucky
people is because we were expecting
supply constraints for the galaxy s 8
plus we did not think that it was going
to ship that early but apparently that
device is also shipping early so yeah we
can't wait for our unit to arrive as
well how about if we talk about market
share as we continue learning how things
are going worldwide for iOS the reason
why i say iOS is because this is the
operating system that's having the
hardest time Apple continues to sell
iphones like crazy even if it's not
selling as well as it did in the case of
the iphone 6 for example but apparently
this has really taken a toll in
countries like China where apolis taking
a dramatic hit that all combined is an
eight percent drop in market share yeah
android currently owns eighty-six
percent of the market Apple is pretty
much stuck at 13 points something and
then there aren't any other mobile
operating systems to talk about that are
worthy so anyways now sort of the
spotlight over 21 plus i am a big fan of
what the company has been doing ever
since the one plus 3 can't say the same
about the previous attempts but now the
company has figured a lot of things out
i am really excited for the feature of
what this company is going to do and we
hear that there is already a model
number a 5000 this hints to one plus 5y
because the number four is apparently
for bad luck in china so 1 plus 5 is in
the works I can't wait to see it
honestly now how about we talk about
toshiba we rarely ever discuss this
company because it doesn't build smart
phones but it builds a ton of the chips
that make up a smartphone there she was
not having a good time the company just
sold its imaging division to Sony it
sold its medical division to Cannon and
apparently it's
next division it's a ship division and
Apple is one of the highest bidders
right now there are other companies
interested but we know that Apple is
interested in making a lot of things on
its own so buying this from Coach Eva
would make a lot of sense let's see if
it happens and finally the very hot news
did they have to do with the iphone 8
mainly because it is apparently going to
bring a ton of changes there is this
internal source from Foxconn the claims
things we're not exactly sure if we
should consider them to be final
apparently Apple is struggling with a
few things number one it wants to build
touch ID into the front of the display
it wants to eliminate the button but
it's struggling with yield so it seems
that it does have a plan B to set the
fingerprint scanner at the back second
visit apparently Apple is also working
on having that front facing camera not
visible apparently it's going to figure
out a way to better than the display we
can not wait to see that but for those
of you that are wondering exactly how
will this iphone 8 look apparently
according to the source it's going to
look a lot like the iphone 7 and what
pertains to size but obviously the
display will pretty much take up
eighty-six percent of the screen to body
ratio just give you an idea of the LG g
6 as eighty percent so that is a lot
display it leads me to the question of
the day if all these things were to
happen do you think that this is enough
innovation for you to consider an iphone
next in my case yes I'll admit it will
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion brands you
