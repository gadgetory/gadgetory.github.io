only thing you're missing is the plastic
cover for your sofa not just that I'm
missing the big stereo system and one of
those paintings of dogs playing poker in
the wall I was the type of dude to punch
another hole in another side of his s10
to make it symmetrical dude you know me
so well Haymitch should review coconut I
should review Diego's jokes more often
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hi maybe that aw this is PocketNow
and this is the pocket house daily recap
your comments for last week on Monday
the topic was the fact that Samsung
acquired core photonics the company that
had pretty much built that optical zoom
for Oppo and well I asked you how it
born is zooming into photos for you I
care a lot about it for street
photography we had 358 comments up to 25
X zoom huh okay time to wake up the
creep inside me oh my god I was waiting
for this one zoom is very important to
me because I have a student and I have
to take photos of the lectures from a
distance true that I mean again there
are so many uses for it so long as it's
lossless 10x should be more than enough
even 5x is good it depends then on
Tuesday the topic was the Galaxy f and
galaxy s7 we had VJ code the head of
Samsung claiming that his products this
year would not disappoint
I asked you what were you expecting we
had 437 comments my expectations from
Samsung is not to follow Apple and make
their phone so damn expensive dude
exactly but actually it was the other
way around there was a point where
Samsung phones were more expensive
actually I want a huge battery great
cameras amazing screen and for the love
of God don't remove the headphone jack
dude yes and it seems that the company
is actually listening to that one I
would like to see an affordable price
that's the most killing feature you know
the biggest problem is that Samsung has
been doing the galaxy em and then
they've got so many line up so it's like
they sell a product at every price so
that's that's their proposition which I
don't consider I get where you're going
I would love for them to do that
actually and then on Wednesday the topic
was again the galaxy has 10 the rumors
that we might get that terabyte of
storage coming on the next Galaxy
actually how much would you be willing
to pay for that
we have 383 comments 1 terabyte what the
hell are people storing on their phone
exactly dude like the laptop that I'm
using for the audio recording of this
video is 1 terabyte and I've still got
like 500 gigs available and I have
ProRes video renders in this thing once
everybody has lots of storage and as a
normal human here I don't have even
completed half terabyte in my laptop so
what terabyte is just marketing
strategies exactly I do believe that
it's just one of those bragging rights
roots like we've got a 1 terabyte film
but I don't the other will be people
that'll buy it three or four I guess one
thousand dollars for one thousand
gigabytes dude I feel that that's
actually a reasonable price I mean do
the math if you get a McLaren from the
oneplus 60 that one is $700 $6.99 so I
mean yeah one terabyte 1000 bucks fine
and then on Thursday the topic was the
iPhone 11 the rumors of what we're
getting like a dark mode 3d sensing and
the camera and so many other things I
asked you what do you think about the
propositions we have 316 comments while
others are coming up with foldable
phones 52 megapixel cameras one terabyte
of storage etc Apple is innovating and
putting USBC in their phones yes exactly
I thought it's gonna happen why in the
holy hell would Apple want to save
people money well they're gonna have to
get creative now that people are not
willing to pay so much money for their
phones
I like that Apple is switching to USB
see it will let us carry around one
cable for pretty much everything true
that I just hope that along with the USB
see they also include a fast charger and
then finally Friday Huawei surprised
this with an invitation from WC showing
off sort of like a foldable product with
a V and so uh su I mean do you care
about all the foldable rumors that are
happening we had 402 comments foldable
phone if they can't fold the price down
then nope yes you deserve those 54 likes
agreed there's this proposition where
because you have a phone in a tablet it
should be more expensive no that's not
the way it works for folding phones
these companies need to think small we
have big enough phones already make them
full smaller do it exactly like I love
that
whole idea of the motor razor where you
can actually turn it into a smaller
phone that for me would be a good value
proposition but then because the screen
is plastic I don't know if I'd like it I
feel like we aren't ready yet for
foldable smartphones we already just
begun the era of truly bezel of
smartphones why can't we just stick to
that form factor for a couple more years
the biggest problem is what's going on
smartphones aren't selling more so what
companies are like you know they're
struggling if you look at global
smartphone sales they're actually
stagnant and on decline and so they're
looking for the next best thing to spike
up the market and so they're coming up
with crazy ideas Samsung came up with
one and it worked which was the phablet
that drove the market for years but now
what and so I get it that's really what
they're trying to do that's it for the
bargains daily recap thank you so much
