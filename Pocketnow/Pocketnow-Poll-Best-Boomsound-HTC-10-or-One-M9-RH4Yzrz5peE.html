we want to talk about boom sound now
there's been a lot of discussion about
boom sound as that HTC has changed up
the speaker arrangement on their
flagship phone this year splitting up
instead of using front-facing stereo
speakers on the front of this phone
we now have a front firing higher
frequency speaker and a bottom firing
lower frequency speaker to give you the
impression of that you're listening to a
tweeter and a subwoofer it's an
interesting and nuanced experiment for
smartphone audio you're listening to
music you're watching movies you're
playing games it's a little more
detailed but we want to hear from you
all how you think it might compare
against some older HTC phones like the
HTC One m9 a proper front-facing stereo
speaker so we've tried to devise a test
where you can listen to some audio
playback on stereo microphones and then
we've got a little poll set up that you
can vote on this poll to see which one
you think is the winner between the HTC
10 the HTC One m9 which I was just
holding up here just a second ago and
the galaxy s7 just is a little palette
cleanser between the two just a little
bit of history before we talk about this
test
now HTC as a company has been a champion
for high quality audio on mobile devices
we can all think back to devices like
the HTC surround a really audacious
Windows Phone with a sliding speaker
could stick out the side of the phone
now that was a partnership with Dolby
then moving over to a phone like the One
m7 this was actually the product of a
partnership with Beats Audio
now back when HTC owned a stake in Beats
that was the branding down at the bottom
of the phone of course
HTC returned to Dolby for the One m8 and
the one m9 and Dolby is of course still
their partner of choice for the HTC 10
while the 10 is losing front-facing
stereo speakers HTC is still holding to
a hardware design I wish more companies
with latch onto instead of having a tiny
little earpiece speaker and then some
other loudspeaker like one firing out
the bottom of the phone
the main loudspeaker is also the same
speaker that you would hold up to your
ear for a phone call
we can turn that speaker down when
you're trying to take a regular phone
call but when we fire up a speaker phone
situate
this is still the loudspeaker so you
don't have that weird like I'm in a busy
place and I'm gonna juggle the phone
around my face to take this speaker
phone call cuz there's too much noise
around me in the year 2016
I really wish all smartphones had this
type of speaker arrangement so for this
listening party as you might have
noticed we've got three phones labeled
above my skull and if you've got
annotations on this video turned on you
can click on any of those and go
directly to audio samples from those
three devices if you don't have
annotations on and you're watching this
on some kind of monitor or display or a
TV you can go to the description below
this video where all of those links are
available for you to click on there
these are not public videos these are
only tied to this video that I'm
explaining what's the audio test is we
really didn't want to clog up your
YouTube feed with a bunch of videos of
just static phones playing music and
movies and if you want to compare back
and forth really close you can click on
each of these open them up in their own
individual browsers and you can play and
pause to your heart's content for this
audio test we're using my Olympus LS 100
which has a pretty decent set of stereo
microphones built into the front they're
not quite far enough apart that we've
got that proper stereo human ear head
mimicking but they're angled out away
from each other far enough that we
should at least get a sense of how these
phones perform producing audio in an
environment this environment namely
being my office all three phones are
being run through these same files we
have a movie sample up front which is
going to simulate the experience that
you have when you're holding the device
the screen is really what you're
focusing on and you kind of want that
audio to support what you're looking at
on the screen and then we have a series
of four music tracks after that audio
files now we're really focused on the
actual audio output from these speakers
not necessarily how these phones might
be used in real-world condition so when
we get to the test the music test for
the galaxy s7 we are going to turn this
speaker more towards the microphones so
we can hear that output as clearly as
possible that does give the galaxy s7 a
little bit of a bump considering that's
not really how we would be using that
phone ir l but you know that also just
speaks to the advantage that HTC
naturally has in that they point speed
towards your face which when you think
about it that's really where speaker
should be pointed all of these
recordings were produced with the phones
12 inches away from the microphones
built into the LS 100 and no edits have
been performed to this audio other than
to raise up the levels so that they're a
little bit louder but they've all been
raised by the same amount so they should
be commiserate against each other once
you had to listen to all three or if
you're just totally biased against one
you don't feel like listening to any of
them you just want to cheat your vote
the here's a poll that we've set up on
this video we'd appreciate it if you
would vote in that poll there should
have been like a little card interface
thing that just swung out on this video
which what you can click on or the
little information the little eye on
this YouTube video for more information
there should be a link there so we'll
let this video run for a week maybe two
weeks and then in a future episode of
the PocketNow weekly podcast we'll
announce the results see which one you
guys prefer you know especially having
played with all these devices listening
between an HTC 10 and an HTC One m9 is a
pretty close battle it's a lot closer
than I would have thought especially
after our first impression some of our
initial comparisons so I'll be curious
to see what you guys think once you have
a listen yourselves especially in these
sort of slightly more strictly
controlled testing situations than what
we do on our fold reviews and if this is
something that you all have fun with
maybe this is a series that we can look
to for future devices and future reviews
in future comparison a way for you to
provide a little input things that you
think companies are doing really well
areas where you think companies could
improve so give those samples a listen
get to voting and we'll pick a winner
based on the samples that you all say
you prefer as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel from our full coverage of all of
the major flagship phones like the HTC
10 the LG g5 the galaxy s7 and make sure
you hit that thumbs up button for a
little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos Pagnell you
can chat me up on Twitter and Instagram
as some gadget guy and I will catch you
all on the next comparison
