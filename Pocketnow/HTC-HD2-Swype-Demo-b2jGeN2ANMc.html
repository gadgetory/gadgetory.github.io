pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to show you swype on the HTC hd2
we've showed you swipe before which is a
new way to enter text without actually
lifting your finger off the keyboard
it's pretty cool first came out on the
samsung omnia two since then it's been
released and you can get it on really
any device now but we haven't shown it
yet on the HTC hd2 so we never could get
it to work but now it does this is
rumored to be coming with the tmobile
hd2 in the u.s. in a short period of
time so just wanted to give you an idea
of what that's going to look like we're
also going to talk about this rom after
we talk about swype it's very
interesting rom with really every icon
in the system redone so let's go first
to the swype demonstration and we'll go
to office mobile 2010 will go into word
here so we can get a blank document and
here's the swype keyboard it looks just
like a standard keyboard and you can
actually use it like a standard keyboard
so i can do letter by letter this is a
test but that's not how it's intended to
be used in fact it doesn't even work
that well if you are using it kind of
traditionally so the idea behind the
swype keyboard is that you don't lift
your finger up off of the keyboard so i
can say this is a test and I mess that
up this is terry let me do another one
this is a test of the keyboard test of
the keyboard pretty impressive right
it's very very accurate let's give it
another try it well first let's see if
it works in landscape it doesn't look
like it does and let's type something
else the quick brown fox jumped over the
lazy dog
and I'm not even paying attention jumped
over mr. there over the lazy dog so
pretty good there the quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy dog I may have
missed a word there but very very
accurate way to input text so really
excited to see this come out on the HTC
hd2 this is a method of entering text
that I think we're going to see a lot
more of in the future just makes a lot
of sense now I want to show you this rom
a little bit this rom is done by someone
called Laurentiis from XDA developers
and what this person has done is totally
revamped all of the icons every system
icon has been changed so all the HTC
Sense icons are completely different so
here is for people you get a little a
phone book we have here for messages
email browser is all different here's
the reader tab that's coming on the hd2
multimedia music calendar I mean
everything here is is different and even
the Start menu has changed a little bit
if we go into the dialer you can see
that the icons on the bottom are a
little bit different there so really
really cool rum from XDA developers and
Laurentiis and even all of the settings
here all of these icons are different
just a really fresh way to kind of
experience your device i think so i'll
post a link on on how to get this rum
but i just wanted to show you swype and
how it works we're looking forward to
that coming out on the HTC hd2 on
tmobile that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
