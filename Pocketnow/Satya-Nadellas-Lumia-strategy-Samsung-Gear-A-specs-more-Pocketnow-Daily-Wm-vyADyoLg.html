strategy has everything to do with the
phone business we get more details on
the possible launch date for the Moto G
and believe it or not Apple has just
launched new ipods I'm hi meri behna and
I apologize in advance for the noise it
is pouring rain outside but the show
must go on this is parking out daily
believe it or not the official news
today are about the ipod as Apple has
just launched a new ipod lineup and that
includes a significant refresh to the
ipod touch first of all it's the same
fifth generation design up to certain
point because you get a new a8 64-bit
chip in addition to an 8 megapixel
shooter in the back a better shooter at
the front you get new color options at a
new pricing scene and even in 128
gigabyte option for around four hundred
dollars really interesting updates links
instrument for full details on what
you're getting and if you do not
remember the Commodore pet or PE t we
don't blame you that computer was built
before I was born which is a long time
ago but anyways Commodore has just
launched a new smartphone being dubbed
the Commodore pet again and it's got
these in specifications a very decent
price tag at the turn of dollars almost
for a 16 gigabyte variant but the
coolest part is that if you like the
old-school Commodore games there are
emulators for these games available
we're talking about free Atari days this
is really cool but hey let's see when it
comes to the United States currently
will only be available in here those of
you that have high hopes over the
Samsung gear a which is its future round
SmartWatch we've got the good and bad
news for some of you first of all well
it got specifications you're getting an
AMOLED display that was to be expected
but we also get a dual core Exynos
processor 250 million power battery but
for those of you that were waiting for
this to run Android wear it won't it
will be running Tizen according to the
sources and with all the previous leaks
that we've seen we kind of knew that it
was going to run Tizen let's just see
how sams and wants to boost it up to be
better now the next generation Moto G is
something that is highly anticipated
particularly because of its price tag
we've got some more rumors that claim
the same specifications we had already
seen Snapdragon 410 processor 720p
display yada yada yada but the even more
interesting is apparently we have a
launch date and it'll happen this month
July 28 which is extremely interesting
we've also got more rumors that we
covered yesterday over the possibility
of moto maker so huh this would be a
really cool phone and yes it will also
be waterproof at sea and finally for the
very interesting news of the day Satya
Nadella was in a recent interview and he
claims they should worry about windows
10 mobile because the whole Windows 10
project had the phone in mind according
to him making windows 10 free and the
fact that Microsoft is banking a lot on
the Windows Store and the fixing the way
you can discover the store on Windows 10
is a way to boost mobile as they are
trying to have developers build that
sport because it's now free and that
those apps will be easily ported to
windows 10 mobile according to him it
doesn't really matter of other OEMs
built windows phones because Microsoft
will build windows phones but it does
lead me to the question of the day do
you trust Satya Nadella and Microsoft
with the future of windows 10 mobile or
do the recent news just tell you that
you should move over to Android in my
case Microsoft has really done a
terrible job lately so I don't think I
would trust the company anymore but

drill if you want to get those earlier
