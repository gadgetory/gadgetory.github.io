actually the company's new mobile
payment system iphone 7s predictions
continue to point to an oled future and
it seems that the sony xperia x and
performance just joined the wagon of
phones that Miss features I'm hi Mary
betta and if there were levels of
tolerable cold I seated them yesterday
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with t-mobile and the
LG G for those of you in the market for
a current flagship this is probably the
best time to buy three hundred and fifty
dollars is the retail price tag for the
g4 right now obviously the company is
preparing for the g5 to come out and if
you ask me three hundred and fifty
dollars for a g4 is a crazy price this
is a great phone i highly suggest you
consider it if you are now let's talk
about devices that are coming very soon
starting with sony's new xperia x lineup
yesterday we were talking about the fact
that the galaxy s7 will not include
quick charge three point 0 at least on
some of its variants and it seems that
this will also be an issue for sony
apparently the sony xperia x performance
is not including through point O even
though all the processing power is there
it could be a typo stay tuned we will
try to clarify that and another devices
that are coming very soon HTC continues
to tease the power of 10 please follow
one of the links of the description that
shows us the new teaser from HTC we now
see a new video where the company is
telling us that they are extremely
passionate about so many things that are
coming out with this phone we can't wait
to see it it's just kind of disturbing
that the audio and the video sounds a
lot like Tim Cook now even though we are
still far from the iphone 7 we continue
to hear more rumors of an iphone 7s in
2017 with an oled display we hear that
suppliers like Samsung are already
preparing and building the 90,000
display units for this device as of now
because apparently obviously there will
be a ton of the man and companies need
to start preparing now pretty much it's
kind of weird to see that the Apple is
already preparing for this S model even
though we're so close to this one and
one is apparently coming with IPS but
then again OLED is always a benefit and
that would definitely be a major
improvement for whatever iPhone comes
out in the future and finally the very
hot news today have to do with mobile
payments google is showing off a new
feature that they're testing out called
hands-free it sounds like a phone but it
actually isn't talked about a new
version of Google Wallet this is beyond
Android pay because the whole concept
here is that you really won't need to
pull anything out when you want to pay
all you have to do is walk up to the
counter there is a receiver in the
counter that will detect your phone and
all you have to do is pretty much say
that you want to pay with Google's hand
free service and the person will get
your photo on their display in a way to
be able to confirm that you are you this
isn't really a cool feature we obviously
don't know exactly what'll happen with
identical twins but hey it leads me to
the question of the day mobile payments
have struggled for years and trying to
find that balance do you think that
Google hands-free will work you'd notice
the ad they're trying to show you how
cumbersome it can be to pay for
something and how cool it'll just be to
say I want to pay with Google but we'd
love to know your opinion in the
comments down below I kind of feel that
there will be a lot of security concerns
here friends you know the way it goes if
