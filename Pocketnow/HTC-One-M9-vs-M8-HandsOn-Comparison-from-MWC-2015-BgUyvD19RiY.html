m9 in another video now let's see how it
stacks up against its immediate
predecessor I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is HTC One m9 vs. HTC
One m8 a quick look from MWC if you
looked at these phones from afar one of
the things that might strike you is just
how similar the m9 and m8 appear to be
they're both tall aluminum phones with
prominent speakers upfront and prominent
cameras around back and indeed there are
some technical similarities as well the
displays are essentially the same Full
HD s LCD three panels though the m9 s is
cooler and greener and everything from
the headphone jack to the USB port to
the IR transmitter can be found in its
usual place on each pick them up and the
differences become apparent while they
weigh about the same the m8 and m9 feel
quite different where the m8 is so
smooth as to be slippery and very easy
to drop the m9 sticks to the hand pretty
well thanks to its blockier build and
the use of a stickier coating on its
chassis this silver and gold edition of
the m9 has a very sharp corner that's
less comfortable than the m8 smooth
casing while the gunmetal version of the
m9 is a little better I still think I'd
prefer the m8 polished stone like feel
slippery though it is I much prefer the
m9 though when it comes to the power
standby button which has been relocated
to the side from the inaccessible top
and given a distinctive texture to
separate it from the volume keys by and
large those are the kinds of small
cosmetic changes you're in store for in
the jump from m8 to m9 on the inside we
get more significant improvements the
new Snapdragon 810 processor replaces
last year's 801 a massive architectural
change that's also helped along by a 50%
increase in RAM on the newer phone the
storage options go away to the new phone
only comes in a 32 gig size but last
year's microSD support thankfully made
the cut the new boom sound speakers have
been retuned and now feature Dolby
multi-channel 5.1 support for surround
sound effects
we already covered all the software
changes in our HTC One m9 hands-on video
so what's the one remaining big hardware
shift to call out the camera Nach with
the one m9 HTC has ditched last year's
conventional duo camera arrangement and
moved the ultra pixel sensor to the
front taking its place is a 20 megapixel
F 2.2 camera protruding slightly from
the casing and protected by sapphire
cover glass we took a bunch of sample
photos in and around Barcelona more of
which can be seen in our one m9 hands-on
video
unfortunately the m9 s camera software
is not yet final and so these results
are basically worthless for making any
judgments at this point about all I can
say is that it's gonna be hard to match
the excellent low-light performance of
last year's camera so I'm glad HTC
decided to keep the ultra pixels around
in some form on the m9 that is in the
selfie shooter will have proper m8 vs m9
comparison photos and video in our full
review and comparison coverage coming

don't miss those keep it locked to
