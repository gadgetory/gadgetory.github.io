pocketnow.com
we don't really cover blackberry that
much on Pocket now but we couldn't
resist the opportunity to review the
9930 the hottest blackberry beau that's
out there right now it's got a
high-resolution VGA screen a 1.2
gigahertz processor running on
BlackBerry OS 7 it's hot it's on Verizon
let's unbox this so if you're looking
for a phone with the best keyboard out
there this is probably it and you're
kind of going to be discovering it for
the first time along with me again we
don't cover blackberry that much on
pocket now I'm going to embrace this as
a daily driver for a few weeks and
really try to experience blackberry the
best blackberry really that RIM has to
offer right now to see really where the
operating system is how the hardware is
now that it's competing against what's
out there for Android the iPhone and of
course Windows Phone 7 so here we go
this is on Verizon Wireless of course
kind of an expensive price tag 249 with
a new two-year agreement definitely
pushing the envelope there in terms of
pricing so we've got the device here
we'll take it out and set it aside
really sweet keyboard we're going to see
what's down below here we've got some
some manuals included nice screen clean
cleaning shabby that's always going to
be important set that aside to the left
we've got the battery which I've already
put in just to turn it on and we've got
the charger over there and over here we
have a holster so let's see if the
holster is made out of quality materials
hopefully leather or something good
smell test I'm definitely not leather
it's kind of a lower quality case it's
got the magnetic clasp here and a nice
sweet buckle do you want to carry it on
your belt so let's take a look at the
bode 9930
again we're running with a Qualcomm 1.2
gigahertz processor here 768 megabytes
of RAM definitely a lot of power here
and the screen has an impress
we high pixel density it is at 286 PPI
which is getting close to the 300 PPI
threshold of where the human eye can't
even see pixels anymore the resolution
is 480 down by 640 across that is VGA
and it's a 2.8 inch screen it's touch
screen so blackberry putting together
sort of a hardware form factor with the
touch screen so you get a the best of
both worlds over on the back we've got
this cool carbon fiber look the device
is pretty darn thin it's about ten point
five millimeters it's got this nice
brushed aluminum fit and finish
definitely a super high quality looking
device here and it feels super high
quality in the hand already have turned
it on but haven't activated it yet but
we can just get a sense for how crisp
and clear the screen is it's really
going to be a fantastic experience
running here on BlackBerry OS 7 so we're
gonna activate this test it going to
integrate it into my personal life so I
can report on what using on blackberry
is like these days I've been using
Android for a while before that I was
using Windows Phone 7 before that I was
using iOS so kind of doing the round
robin here trying to experience the
latest and greatest from the smartphone
manufacturers if you liked this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
