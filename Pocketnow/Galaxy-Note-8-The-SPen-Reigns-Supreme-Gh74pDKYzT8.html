world of large screen competitors one
feature stands alone on Samsung's newest
phablet it's evolved over successive
generations but is it an option worth
the heavy price tag I'm Juan Carlos Pegg
now for pocket now and here's our note 8
S Pen review brought to you by deeper
and the claim is a higher order of
productivity thanks to a large display
and fine point controls the immediate
visual we all create with the stylus is
scribbling in a note app now I'm no
artist but apparently few other tech
bloggers traced Garfield cartoons when
they were kids there's quite a bit more
going on with this stick however where a
note and a Galaxy S can overlap on
custom interfaces like a slide-out edge
panel Samsung creates a completely
unique user interface built all around
this point at that point by the way is
ultrafine interacting with the screen
coding in a way reminiscent of a fine
tip pen being a passive stylus without a
battery S Pen still doesn't track angle
but it is pressure-sensitive we all
apparently hate phone screen bezels now
but curved displays introduced concerns
it's difficult writing on a surface
warping away from you so many apps will
just build in an artificial border a
digital bezel if you will those apps
that will let you draw right up to the
edge of the screen you're more likely to
lose some contact with the digitizer so
you're probably not gonna want to
scribble there anyway like the note 7
before it this phone and stylus are
water-resistant even with the s-pen
removed from the silo again bringing a
nifty benefit that this is one of the
easiest to use when the screen is wet
but cool hardware won't mean much if you
don't have good software to back it up
where last year Samsung streamlined the
number of note and sketching apps we are
seeing more features applied to this
phone in their place from your air
command menu users can now specify up to
10 shortcuts this in addition to edge
displays and your home screens so no
matter how you hold the phone you can
get to apps that fit for that kind of
usage Samsung Notes is still one of the
crown jewel applications showcasing the
flexibility of the S
and capturing a thought adding to a list
or doodling in your downtime it's a well
featured service improvements to screen
off capture are certainly appreciated
giving users up to a hundred pages of
space before you even need to turn your
phone on
unfortunately Samsung notes still often
feels like it lives on an island sharing
for example you can send a static image
but trying to collaborate means saving
an s stock which doesn't seem to play
nice with my desktop yet again we have
to plug one note as a terrific
replacement with better sharing options
and an interface which makes good use of
Samsung stylus s-pen becomes something
of a catch-all for the note services
without a home elsewhere in Samsung's
lineup can just be stapled on to the
stick of better screenshot tools sure
s-pen though it is nice having a
streamlined way to draw on a capture
before sending it better foreign
language translation of course s-pen
first-party jiff creation tools you
guessed it s-pen these tools aren't
necessarily stylus dependent services
the Galaxy s8 has an option to create
gifs too but for whatever reason when on
the note they get linked to the s-pen a
few options tie in really well though
folks with accessibility concerns will
appreciate quick access to a magnifier
that hovers smoothly above your display
coloring is a nice way to waste a little
time share art projects on Samsung's pen
on network and I have to admit that
doodling messages is more fun and
engaging than I thought it would be
especially for working through pretty
much any messaging service you might
prefer though loading each individual
graphic can sometimes lag outside of the
software Samsung delivers for the s-pen
though this implementation points to one
important idea Steve Jobs was not
completely correct when he launched the
iPhone there are times where finer point
control is simply better than your fat
finger tip sometimes those situations
are frivolous sometimes those moments
are productive but the fact remains that
only one device properly integrates the
experience to deliver such a refined
input scheme all too often reviewers are
tasked with somehow justifying a device
or explaining to people how they should
spend their money big screens are no
longer a novelty so that's not the hook
for a note anymore there is a flavor of
power user though who will value the
notes ability to perform in nearly any
scenario one-handed or two-handed and
with the markets best justification for
why a user should dedicate both hands to
using a phone
all hail the s-pen and while your GTD
getting to done and running through
airports with your thousand dollar
pocketable supercomputer shouldn't you
also be trying to protect it from
scratches while keeping a better grip on
it D Brand has a collection of skins and
different colors and textures to keep
your Note 8 looking sharp
