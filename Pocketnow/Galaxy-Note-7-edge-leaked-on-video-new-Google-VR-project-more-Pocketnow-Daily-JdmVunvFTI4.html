expect on the Galaxy Notes of an edge
reports claim that Google's plan for VR
doesn't really end with daydream and
Corning Gorilla Glass 5 intends to save
us all from that selfie behavior I'm hi
Mary vera and hopefully Corning Gorilla
Glass six will protect us from Pokemon
go in the subway this is bargain out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you are in the market for the
Google Nexus 6p it's not necessarily an
affordable phone but it's not expensive
either even so best buy is currently
offering the refurbished variant of the
Nexus 6p for 319 dollars which is pretty
much a $20 save on the price tag it's
really compelling just bear in mind that
we are very close to the future Nexus
whenever that may happen I was fooled
the spotlight over to Corning as the
company has just announced Gorilla Glass
five and what makes it special is that
look guerrilla glass for was great from
protecting your device from falls from
your waist down Gorilla Glass 5 is all
about selfies up to 1.6 meters which is
pretty much 5.5 feet it's able to
withstand the fall from we cannot wait
to give it a try so far it seems that in
video looks promising obviously it will
take some time for it to deploy to
devices for those of you that are
currently rocking devices that are the
only ones that don't want to admit to
using gorilla glass but do well that's
iOS those of you that are rocking the
iOS 10 beta and public beta 1 you can
now access public beta 2 is available
for this in addition to natural West
Sierra and so far the changes as with
the beta 3 for developers are pretty
much just bug fixes I do notice far
better battery life hopefully you do the
same as well give a try I was will the
spotlight back to Google we have got
some very interesting rumors that claim
that Google is trying to for engineers
and employees into a newly our project
according to inside sources apparently
they dream VR is not really the final
plan for google it's just something
that's out there and it's a stepping
stone towards whatever google is
planning to bring the river claims that
apparently google is working on its own
standalone VR experience and it makes
all the sense of the world given the
fact that this
the company that pretty much invented
Google glass we just wonder how that is
going to play in the feature is
apparently augmented reality will be
part of it and finally the very hot news
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
Note seven we are less than two weeks
away from the event we will all be
covering it live we cannot wait and the
leak videos have already started
emerging probably even though the video
is extremely blurry we can't really tell
much one thing to note is that yes the
curved edge display is their number to
this phone looks far thinner than we
thought and hopefully that doesn't mean
terrible battery life we hope not given
the fact that the Galaxy s7 edge is
iconic but it leads me to the question
of today what are your expectations
given this video of the galaxy note 7
does it look pretty to you is it
something that you look forward to
