calm and today we're gonna be taking a
look at the Motorola Droid X for Verizon
Wireless the Droid X is scheduled to
launch on July 15th for $200 after a
$100 mil and rebate and a two-year
service agreement from Verizon it is a
Verizon Wireless exclusive device for
right now it is a very slim smartphone
as you can see from the profile here it
is slim but does have a little
protrusion here at the top where the
camera bump is let's go ahead and take a
look at the hardware of the device at
the top here you have the earpiece
speaker along with the proximity sensor
and light sensor to automatically either
dim the screen or turn the screen off
when you're in the middle of a phone
call the device also has GPS Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth technologies as well
there is also an accelerometer on the
device who automatically adjusts the
orientation of the screen at the top of
the device you have one of three
microphones at the bottom here you have
another microphone and on the back you
have another microphone so these
microphones serve to help cancel noise
and wind sounds when you're in the
middle of a call and the back microphone
serves when you're shooting a video and
once you capture the noise that's coming
in front of you rather than catching the
noise that you might be making when
you're holding the phone up to look at
the screen as a viewfinder the at the
bottom here you do have physical buttons
these unlike on the Droid Incredible and
the original Motorola Droid you do have
to press in and are not capacitive
buttons on the left hand side of the
device you have a very clean profile you
do have a microUSB port as well as a
micro or a mini HDMI port so you do need
a mini HDMI cable to HDMI cable to
connect to your TV or you can also
connect to your TV to share videos and
photos with the DLNA technology that's
bundled on the device the bottom of the
device is clean except for a little
lanyard loop here at the lower corner
and on the right hand side of the device
you have at the top here volumes up and
down
control which also does dual purpose as
a camera zoom in and zoom out control
when you're in the camera mode speaking
of camera mode here's the shutter button
which is in red metallic red color it is
a dual press button so you can press in
lightly to focus and you can press it
harder to capture your image or video
the camera is located on the back side
where the camera on bump protrudes it is
an 8 megapixel camera with autofocus and
face detection and can record video in
720p HD recording it has dual LED flash
and you can store your pictures with the
on-board 8 gigs of storage the back
battery cover for those who are familiar
with the original Droid should not be
concerned because this one actually
stays on pretty securely and fit snugly
so there's no concern of the back
battery cover slipping off when you're
putting the phone in or taking it out of
your pocket the device also ships with
16 gigabytes a micro SDHC card which you
can augment to 32 gigs optionally so you
can bring the total storage up to 40
gigs on this device the phone has a 1500
milliamp per hour battery which is
slightly larger than the one on the
original Droid and is a very power
efficient smart phone just like the
original Droid as far as smart phones go
the smart phone is powered by a one
gigahertz processor that's made by Ti
Texas Instruments it is an OMAP
processor and in my experience I found
it to be a little bit more zippy than
the comparable Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor at a similar clock speed it
does have 512 megabytes of RAM as well
the device actually does not have
motoblur although these widgets are very
reminiscent of motoblur found on other
motorola devices such as the click and
the click xt on t-mobile as well as the
motorola Devourer on Verizon Wireless
these widgets
unlike motoblur offered the user a
little bit more controlling
customization so you can resize the
widget
to fit your screen and to fit how you
want to lay out your screen so this
large widget that aggregates from
various social media feeds I can go
ahead and resize however I want the
device also has a number of added
services one of which is the blockbuster
app right now the blockbuster app is in
beta mode so it doesn't launch correctly
but hopefully that should be rectified
by blockbuster and Verizon Wireless in
time for launch on July 15th the
blockbuster app will allow users to rent
and purchase movies but right now
there's no update on the Android Market
to get it going other features that are
part of the device include a backup
assistant that's tied to Verizon
Wireless this network and also a 3G
mobile hotspot app so you can go ahead
and turn on 3G and set up a WEP or WPA
password to secure your connection and
tether devices once you connect a device
it will show up under the connected
devices list here and you can go ahead
and share your Verizon Wireless mobile
broadband 3G connection with up to five
other devices these service is an
optional service and will cost $20 extra
per month for two gigs of data once you
go over the two gigs you will be charged
overages by Verizon Wireless the phone
will require a $30 smartphone data
package which is unlimited and according
to Verizon Wireless the data begins at
the beginning of your billing cycle and
ends at the end of the billing cycle so
there are no caps another service
included by Verizon Wireless would be
the V CAST video service which is sort
of an on-demand TV streaming service so
that you can watch your programs
whenever you want so you can choose from
entertainment sports and pop culture and
once you click on it it will bring you
up to a screen that will give you
selections for the various different
networks
on the phone does support a live home
screen it is powered by Android 2.1
Motorola and Verizon Wireless has
promised an Android 2.2 upgrade which is
the Froyo build Froyo will bring with it
a number of improvements including the
ability to support Adobe Flash 10.1 so
you should find most of the video
content on the web that has been encoded
with newer Adobe Flash formats to be
playable and compatible with your
smartphone there's also a calendar
widget and here we see that Adams
birthday is on June 30th which is
tomorrow so happy early birthday to Adam
Lane who's an editor here at
pocketnow.com so this has been a quick
look of the hardware on the Motorola
Droid X what's also included in the
retail packaging box here which I have
in front of me would be this would be
where the smartphone will sit and also
included would be a wall charger which
connects to via this USB to micro USB
charge and sync cable so you can either
charge and sync from your computer or
plug it into the wall charger there are
a number of leaflets here which is good
to get users acquainted a consumer
information product safety and warranty
as well as some getting started guides
in both English and Spanish the getting
started guide folds out and is in color
so you'll become quickly acquainted with
your smart phone as well another widget
that's included on the Droid X is
Motorola s-- tips and tricks widget here
so if you click on see all articles
you'll see different tips and tricks to
get you started on the device or you can
learn about the device as you're getting
acquainted with it there's also a news
feed aggregator and on the top here you
should see an LED notification once you
get any new notifications from the
notification system on Android which is
very robust here you also have a
pictures gallery if you have an album
loaded or photo album loaded you can go
ahead and play through it and it will
play in the background here as well I'm
John win for pocket

unboxing and hardware tour of the
Motorola Droid X for Verizon Wireless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
