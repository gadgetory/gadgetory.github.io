calm and today we're going to be taking
a look at the motorola droid x for
verizon wireless the droid x is
scheduled to launch on July fifteenth
for two hundred dollars after a
100-dollar mail-in rebate and a two-year
service agreement from verizon it is a
verizon wireless exclusive device for
right now it is a very slim smartphone
as you can see from the profile here it
is slim but does have a little
protrusion here at the top where the
camera bump is let's go ahead and take a
look at the hardware of the device at
the top here you have the earpiece
speaker along with the proximity sensor
and light sensor to automatically either
dim the screen or turn the screen off
when you're in the middle of a phone
call the device also has gps Wi-Fi and
bluetooth technologies as well there is
also an accelerometer on the device who
automatically adjusts the orientation of
the screen at the top of the device you
have one of three microphones at the
bottom here you have another microphone
and on the back you have another
microphone so these microphones serve to
help cancel noise and wind sounds when
you're in the middle of a call and the
back microphone serves when you're
shooting a video and once you capture
the noise that's coming in front of you
rather than capturing the noise that you
might be making when you're holding the
phone up to look at the screen as a
viewfinder the at the bottom here you do
have physical buttons these unlike on
the droid incredible and the original
motorola droid you do have to press in
and are not capacitive buttons on the
left hand side of the device you have a
very clean profile you do have a
microUSB port as well as a micro or a
mini hdmi port so you do need a mini
hdmi cable to hdmi cable to connect to
your TV or you can also connect to your
TV to share videos and photos with the
DLNA technology that's bundled on the
device the bottom of the device is clean
except for a little lanyard loop here at
the lower corner and on the right hand
side of the device you have at the top
here volumes up and down
control which also does dual purpose as
a camera zoom in and zoom out control
when you're in the camera mode speaking
of camera mode here's the shutter button
which is in red metallic red color and
it is a dual press button so you can
press and lightly to focus and you can
pass it harder to capture your image or
video the camera is located on the back
side where the camera on bump protrudes
it is an 8 megapixel camera with
autofocus and face detection and can
record video in 720p HD recording it has
dual LED flash and you can store your
pictures with the onboard eight gigs of
storage the back battery cover for those
who are familiar with the original droid
should not be concerned because this one
actually stays on pretty securely and
fit snugly so there's no concern of the
back battery cover slipping off when
you're putting the phone in or taking it
out of your pocket the device also ships
with 16 gigabytes a micro sdhc card
which you can augment to 32 gigs
optionally so you can bring the total
storage up to 40 gigs on this device the
phone has a 1,500 milli ampere hour
battery which is slightly larger than
the one on the original droid and is a
very power efficient smartphone just
like the original droid as far as
smartphones go the smartphone is powered
by a 1 gigahertz processor that's made
by t.i Texas Instruments it is an omap
processor and in my experience I found
it to be a little bit more zippy than
the comparable Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor at a similar clock speed it
does have 512 megabytes of RAM as well
the device actually does not have
motoblur although these widgets are very
reminiscent of motoblur found on other
motorola devices such as the cliq and
the cliq xt on t-mobile as well as the
motorola devour on verizon wireless
these widgets unlike motoblur offer the
user a little bit more controlling
customization so you can resize the
widget to fit your screen
to fit how you want to lay out your
screen so this large widget that
aggregates from various social media
feeds I can go ahead and resize however
I want the device also has a number of
added services one of which is the
blockbuster app right now the
blockbuster app is in beta mode so it
doesn't launch correctly but hopefully
that should be rectified by blockbuster
and Verizon Wireless in time for launch
our July fifteenth the blockbuster app
will allow users to rent and purchase
movies but right now there's no update
on the android market to get it going
other features that are part of the
device include a backup assistant that's
tied to verizon wireless network and
also a 3g mobile hotspot app so you can
go ahead and turn on 3g and set up a WEP
or wpa password to secure your
connection and tether devices once you
connect the device it will show up under
the connected devices list here and you
can go ahead and share your verizon
wireless mobile broadband 3g connection
with up to five other devices these
service is an optional service and will
cost twenty dollars extra per month for
two gigs of data once you go over the
two gigs you will be charged overages by
Verizon Wireless the phone will require
a thirty dollar smartphone data package
which is unlimited and according to
verizon wireless the data begins at the
beginning of your billing cycle and ends
at the end of the billing cycle so there
are no caps another service included by
Verizon Wireless would be the V CAST
video service which is sort of an
on-demand TV streaming service so that
you can watch your programs whenever you
want so you can choose from
entertainment sports and pop culture and
once you click on it it will bring you
up to a screen that will give you
selections for the various different
networks
on the phone does support a live home
screen it is powered by android 2.1
motorola and verizon wireless has
promised an android 2.2 upgrade which is
the Froyo build Froyo will bring with it
a number of improvements including the
ability to support adobe flash 10.1 so
you should find most of the video
content on the web that has been encoded
with newer adobe flash formats to be
playable and compatible with your
smartphone there's also a calendar
widget and here we see that adam's
birthday is on june thirtieth which is
tomorrow so happy early birthday to adam
lane who's an editor here at pocket now
calm so this has been a quick look of
the hardware on the motorola droid x
what's also included in the retail
packaging box here which i have in front
of me would be on this would be where
the smartphone will sit and also
included would be a wall charger which
connects to via this USB to microUSB
charge and sync cable so you can either
charge and sync from your computer or
plug it into the wall charger there are
a number of leaflets here which is good
to get users acquainted a consumer
information product safety and warranty
as well as some getting started guides
in both english and spanish the getting
started guide folds out and is in color
so you'll become quickly acquainted with
your smartphone as well another widget
that's included on the Droid X is
Motorola's tips and tricks widget here
so if you click on see all articles
you'll see different tips and tricks to
get you started on the device or you can
learn about the device as you're getting
acquainted with it there's also a news
feed aggregator and on the top here you
should see an LED notification once you
get any new notifications from the
notification system on Android which is
very robust here you also have a
pictures gallery if you have an album
loaded or photo album loaded you can go
ahead and play through it and it will
play in the background here as well I'm
Chung win for parking
