I'm going to quickly show you some of
the new features in the Zune HD 4.5
software release that was just released
today so first off I'm going to show you
the marketplace that same as usual click
on music now it has pics at the top and
this is basing off of my normal music
listening habits and it gives me some
recommendations as to a few other
artists that I might like so let's try
the academy is I don't have any of this
music on my zoom this is all downloading
over the Wi-Fi and you see the top is a
mix our smart DJ makes playlist button
you can recognize that from the desktop
and if I press that I am going to smart
DJs picking music and so that made a new
playlist for me just based off of that
one artist and if I look at the playlist
you can see there's a bunch of different
artists there what comes back to this
and you see a little Wi-Fi icon there
that indicates that these are all
downloading over the Wi-Fi and they're
not on my player but if there were any
on my player they would show up without
that icon and you can see there's a
pretty good variety of different artists
showing up in this playlist another cool
thing if we let it play for a while the
screensaver is updated a bit you're
going to see some new artwork as we wait
that Adana there we go
got some nice background images now in
text and album art will float around so
that's pretty nice some of the other
features are work best with the Zune
dock yeah I didn't plug that in yet or
it also has some new code s so you off
to transcode video then you want to play
on the Zin and that's but it's really
nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
