making full-blown laptops with this
update to its first ever Windows machine
and it's a huge update which will swung
on camera I'm editing better with pocket
now and this is our hands on of the book
X Pro brought to you by invisible shield
all right let's face it there's only so
much innovation that a company can bring
to a laptop and even so what way has
brought one of the most impressive
approaches as bezels continue to
disappear on screen so this new laptop
takes the cake to the most complete
approach mate book X Pro features a
14-inch 3k display that covers 91% of
the body yeah and it provides decent
contrast and brightness specs for an LCD
now with a sleek metal design that's
even thinner than a 13-inch MacBook Pro
you'd wonder where the webcam is no it's
not necessarily in the awkward placement
we've seen from the Dell XPS line but
close in a button impressive right and
while you may bristle at people looking
at your fingers as you type or other
more awkward locations this design
actually makes sense as it lets users
protect their privacy by hiding the
camera when it's not needed the bulk of
specs include options for an eighth
generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor
top-tier models include the scree
graphics from Nvidia with an MX 150 GPU
you've got 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM and
256 or 512 gigabytes on the SSD Huawei
says had got 12 hours of continuous
video playback on a single charge
but as always your mileage may vary the
65 watt adapter includes USB C and
thankfully you can plug it into either
one of the two ports provided unlike the
original mate book X keep in mind though
that one of these type-c connectors is
actually Thunderbolt 3 compatible which
is awesome finally just like last year's
may put X the MacBook X pro brings Dolby
enhance speakers and I'm talking quad
speakers but this is one of those things
that I'd recommend you hear for yourself
as the demos were simply awesome but
there's only so much I can show you on
video
you can see pricing and availability
