those were samsung's promises just a few
weeks ago at the ephah 2013 unveiling of
its newest phablet the Galaxy Note 3 and
now thanks to our friends at Negri
electronics we've got a brand new Note 3
of our own here at pocket now let's find
out just how big an improvement it is
over its predecessor last year's
surprise blockbuster the Galaxy Note 2
first things first yes we did just unbox
the Note 3 a mere 48 hours ago so
impressions of the device are in their
infancy wait for our full Galaxy Note 3
review coming the week of September 30th
for are more detailed feelings on this
device be sure to follow us on social
media so you don't miss it
secondly we want to make clear exactly
which models we're comparing here the
Galaxy Note 2 we have on hand is the
AT&amp;amp;T version for North America while our
new note 3 is international unlocked
model SM and 900 and finally as we
mentioned in the intro this Note 3
review unit comes to us from Negri
electronics visit them in the link in
the video description if you're looking
for a note 3 of your own now let's see
how the incoming and outgoing kings of
the phablet world compare Hardware is up
first and there's actually quite a big
disparity here last year's Note 2 was
very much an expanded galaxy s3
featuring a lot of curves and a faux
brushed metal finish on its plastic
battery cover all of it topped off with
a thick coat of gleaming Samsung hyper
glaze all that plastic surrounded a 5.5
inch Super AMOLED display at 720p
resolution with a Wacom digitizer
capable of over a thousand levels of
pressure sensitivity used to great
effect by the note 2's onboard s-pen the
whole affair felt good in the hand solid
because of its 183 gram mass and nine
point four millimeter thickness but not
great because of that glossy plastic
well much as we love to hate on that
hyper glaze coating we have to admit
that we do miss it just a little on the
note 3 not due to appearance we actually
much prefer the look of the note 3's
faux leather with it's fine border
stitching
motif that plays better with the concept
of the note family and does a better job
of setting it apart but the new material
is slippery and that combines with the
new notes sharper corners and reduced
thickness and mass to make it a little
less comfortable in the hand the
trade-off is absolutely worth it it's
nice to see the note 3 stand out a bit
aesthetically from the galaxy s line and
the new larger 5.7 inch 1080p display
features over a hundred more pixels per
inch and much more accurate colors for
those who crave maximum performance from
their phablet screens but for us the
note 2 is still the more comfortable
device to hold in the hand the Galaxy
Note line is for the most power hungry
of power users and so we shouldn't be
surprised to find the so-called Exynos
octa-core Evac tup by an impressive
three gigs of ram us versions of the
note 3 will feature LTE support and a
Snapdragon 800 processor at 2.3
gigahertz in lieu of this setup but
either way the new combo easily Trump's
the note twos 1.6 gigahertz Exynos 44 12
and 2 gigs of ram these being samsung
devices the removable batteries and
expandable storage options remain though
the note 3 does bump its battery
capacity a bit to complete its spec
dominance the note 3 adds a handful of
new features not found on the - like an
infrared port Wi-Fi 802.11 B 3 port and
cable for faster charging and data
transfers but don't worry your old
microUSB cable will still work that's
the end of the spectrum
catch your breath while we hop on down
to software the result of all this spec
one-upmanship should be a significantly
more capable device but you wouldn't
know it necessarily by looking at the
interface we're admittedly running an
older Android version on the note 2
thanks to AT&amp;amp;T but Samsung's TouchWiz
layer is so thick you're hardly going to
notice that Gulf and that heavy UI is
much the same between these units if you
didn't like Samsung's bloated cartoony
UI before you won't like it now then you
certainly won't like the occasional skip
or stutter the heavy software imposes on
your expiry
if your the routing and modding type
you'll probably be switching to a custom
launcher soon after picking up either of
these thankfully not all the changes are
bad Samsung has added it's useful s
health fitness suite to the note 3 which
leverages the device's new sensor array
to help you stay in shape and Samsung
Knox is here for those who need a
firewall between work and play on their
smart phone more importantly the company
has also overhauled the S Pen interface
on the note 3 instituting air command a
circular launch pad containing useful
shortcuts to stylish related system
functions as well as a system-wide
search tool called s finder the S Pen
itself has received a slight cosmetic
upgrade on the 3 and it can now be
inserted into the silo at any roll angle
but it is a little harder to remove and
yes this time around Samsung has given
the S Pen the ability to trigger the
capacitive buttons a feature we saw on
the note 8 and a very welcome addition
here back on the software samsung has
added a few more touches like the
Flipboard asked my magazine feature kind
of like HTC blinkfeed it lives below the
homescreen and the company has also
renovated the multi screen feature on
the note 3 to make it a little smelter
and easier to use and it's also built in
yet another multitasking feature quick
apps in repositionable self-contained
windows we didn't like this approach on
the LG g2 and we can't see it being
terribly useful here either but it's
worth mentioning that it's not found on
the note 2 now we do expect some of
these enhancements to come to the note 2
with software updates eventually but for
now they give the note 3 a pretty
decisive edge in terms of functionality
those improvements continue popping up
not just in benchmarks where the note 3
predictably trounces its predecessor but
in day-to-day use as well for the first
time in a while we've got a new Samsung
device that actually delivers better
voice quality than its predecessor the
note 3 delivers crisper sound on our end
and callers said we sounded better on it
than on the note 2 in both conventional
and loudspeaker modes speakerphone
performance is another story with the
bottom mounted unit on the note 3
sounding quieter and less bacing
delivering thinner sound overall it's
still a fine unit it's just not as
throaty as the one
the older phone the new note steps it up
in camera performance replacing the note
2's 8 megapixel camera with a new 13
megapixel unit very similar to the one
found on the Galaxy s4 the note 3's bump
in resolution is welcome and even
shooting at 9.6 megapixels to preserve
the same aspect ratio the photos
produced are visibly crisper improving
on an already pretty solid camera under
ideal lighting conditions unfortunately
the new phone features a problem we
remember from the s4 it may not be a
problem for you but we found it annoying
a much narrower field of view is present
on the note 3 meaning you need to get
quite a bit further from your subject to
fit it all in the frame also Samsung has
inexplicably removed the night shooting
mode from the Note 3's viewfinder
meaning low-light photos aren't nearly
as good in its place novelty modes like
golf shot this would be pretty funny if
it wasn't so disappointing we look
forward to the company's rien clusion of
night shooting mode in a future software
update which we hope is forthcoming
things get brighter on the video side
with the note 3 delivering superior
audio performance and faster exposure
adjustments along with a more balanced
color overall than the note 2 though the
autofocus is a little on the slow side
fortunately the software anti-shake
makes up for it it captures pretty
smooth video for a phone with no optical
image stabilization so should you invest
in a note 3 of your own well listen if
you're a die-hard phablet fan you
already know the answer the added
horsepower of the note 3 spec sheet and
its many many improvements over the
previous generation means you've
probably already pre-ordered one and
from what we can see at this early point
you should probably feel pretty good
about your purchase but if you're
already carrying or thinking about
picking up a note 2 you should feel
pretty good about that too the phone got
one of our highest ratings last year and
it's aged quite well since the note 3 is
still the more impressive device by a
longshot but not so much so that you
should be throwing your note 2 in the
recycle bin just yet
there's much more to come from pocket
