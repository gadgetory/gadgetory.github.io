now calm and this is a demonstration of
the Seelie ored fly ca10 with two
windows mobile devices the touch pro 2
and the blackjack two now for those of
you that don't know the celio red fly is
like a windows mobile terminal so the
idea is that you tote the red fly around
with you and you can utilize the full
capabilities of your windows phone
although you have a very large screen
here this is the the higher end model
with an 8-inch screen you have a full
keyboard a mouse pad and even if you're
using a non-touchscreen device you'll
still get a mouse cursor on the screen
plus a host of inputs so for example
this has two USB inputs m1 can be used
for the device one can be used for a
mouse you could also connect a USB flash
drive for storage which is kind of cool
so if you have a word document or a
PowerPoint and you want to sit down and
edit it you can bring around your flash
drive plug it in and be good to go you
can also connect it to a VGA video
report so you can connect it to a
monitor or some LCD televisions will
allow you to connect dear red fly or you
can connect it to a projector if you're
giving a presentation in addition most
read flies will come with this media
cable which allows you to connect to the
composite cables if your display or your
projector doesn't use a VGA connector
like this so let's go through the
process of actually connecting a device
the first thing that you have to do is
install the drivers on your phone which
takes probably five minutes if you know
how to install a cab file and I've
already done that on the touch pro 2
here so I'm going to take the sync cable
you can also do this over Bluetooth but
the performance is much much better over
USB and I'm going to plug it in to one
of the USB ports I'm going to turn on
the red fly with this button open the
screen and already it says red fly it's
it starts up in literally half of a
second it's very fast startup time
connect the device here wait about five
seconds and watch what happens
okay here we are so reviewing spb mobile
shell three on the red fly which is what
I'm running on the touch pro two it's an
800 x 480 resolution right now and
that's actually the same resolution as
the touch pro two if you saw the
previous video you know that this model
of the red fly will actually scale to
1024 x 768 on some devices in fact
you're going to see it scale that high
on the blackjack to right now red fly or
see Leo is working out some issues with
devices with the wvga resolution like
the xperia x1 and the touch pro two so
right now if you have a touch pro 2 or
an xperia x1 or anything else that has a
wvga screen you're only going to get the
native resolution on the display so
let's click around a little bit I'm
going to go into the start menu just as
normal let's go to office mobile and we
get of course Office Mobile and we can
click on word mobile and we can type a
document just as if we were on the
device but of course we get this nice
spacious keyboard which allows for some
quick or text entry although there's a
little bit of a lag let me try to to
show you it's actually pretty good in
word mobile you'll get a little bit of a
lag in messaging and SMS but it's really
great to have such a large keyboard the
keys are smaller than they are on a
standard laptop of course but that's
because it has to fit into the small
form factor now we get some special
buttons on the keyboard we have the call
start and call end button here and we
can tap the call end button which will
take us of course back home we have a
messaging button a home button we have
things to allow us to connect to the
external projector we also have the red
fly menu and you may be able to see that
down here you press function then r
which takes you actually into the the
red fly menu which is based in windows
mobile and the interface is kind of
clunky i'm surprised actually celio left
it so ugly we can set up a connection
via bluetooth an input we can change the
speed of the touch bed make a little
faster a little bit slower change the
keyboard repeat rate battery power and
by the way I should mention that the red
fly has an inbuilt very large battery so
not only does it power itself but it's
charged when I touch pro2 as well so
it's kind of another function of the
red fly can actually charge your device
we can increase the screen brightness of
course you want to leave it a little bit
lower so you don't kill the battery
external power same settings for screen
brightness hotkeys so you can set some
of these buttons on the keyboard to do
different things we go into advanced
ClearType support which is turn on right
now so that you can cut get get kind of
a crisper font performance you can
specify if you want the device to have
better image clarity or better
performance right now it's on image
clarity so that it's the clearest
picture that we can do although I want
to slide it to performance and see how
well video playback is in core player if
I open up a of the office so I'm going
to do that now okay we're trying to play
an episode of the office right now and
it's not even applying so you don't want
to use the red fly as a mobile you know
video viewer it's not going to perform
very well in that respect it's more so
for productivity and that sort of thing
speaking of which let's take a look at
how the red flight does with internet
browsing how it looks on a larger screen
so we are going to go into opera mobile
and we're connected to Wi-Fi right now
let's go to pocket now calm all right
looks like I just got a text message out
there hit enter and let's see how it
looks on the screen and here it comes
now it's a bit slow right now over Wi-Fi
guess I'm connected to a slow network
but that is opera mobile 9.5 things
appear as you would expect them to fear
except video doesn't work too well as we
just saw previously so let's take a look
at another device connected to the red
fly we're going to connect the blackjack
2 here and so I'm going to disconnect
the touch pro two and take it out from
the back then I'm going to get the cable
the Samsung proprietary cable for the
blackjack 2 and plug it in and of course
i've already installed the drivers onto
the blackjack two so that's ready to go
and the screen dims here after a little
while of inactivity
plug it in and connecting
and that was about seven seconds and
when you connect to a non-touchscreen
windows mobile device things get a
little bit more weird because the the
that took about seven seconds and when
you connect to a Windows Mobile standard
non touch screen device things get a
little weird they don't appear that
great on the screen you don't get the
sliding panel interface now that took
about seven seconds so when you connect
a non-touchscreen windows mobile device
things get a little bit weird but they
still work generally speaking so we have
the mouse cursor on the screen of course
we can click on the start button and
there goes and we just get a tremendous
amount of icons on the screen at one
time if you're using the blackjack to
you know that because of the low
resolution screen you have to constantly
be tapping over to get to see all your
programs but here we get to see all the
programs in one screen if we go into
settings for example we get a ton of
settings on the screen at one time and
there's the next screen and now of
course on Windows Mobile standard you
don't have an ok button in the upper
right corner so this is really where the
home button on the keyboard is good
it'll take you back home ok so and I've
just connected the red fly to my
computer monitor to see what the video
output looks like so I hit the f2 button
and I get this message on the screen
there are three display modes I can go
with LCD only LCD and VGA or just vga
i'm going to do LCD and vga which means
that it'll be on the red fly the image
and it'll be on the monitor and you can
change the resolution to 800 x 480 or
800 x 600 we're going to go the maximum
here 800 x 600 and click OK and it says
changing resolution while connected
requires the red flag to disconnect and
reconnect so we're going to allow that
to continue ok what we have here is the
red fly exporting video from my
blackjack two to my computer monitor
here so it's really interesting to see
such a massive display to come from the
the mobile device and so imagine
connecting this to a projector or to a
you know any kind of computer monitor to
get a really really big view this is
perfect for presentations I think if you
don't feel like toting around a laptop
and not everything scales just right but
some things do so overall the Red fly
acts as a nice mobile workstation for
your windows mobile device it allows you
to have a big screen a big keyboard a
mouse pad it allows you to connect to a
projector if you want to do a
presentation although you don't want to
watch movies on it it gives you USB
ports so you can use an external mouse
external keyboard or even connect a USB
flash drive so you can bring the
presentation along or listen to some
music or look at some pictures comrade
said a lot of people probably wonder why
would I spend two to three hundred
dollars on a red fly when I could just
buy a netbook for two to four hundred
dollars well there's good arguments for
and against that and a lot of it has to
do with cost of ownership and other
issues relating to to price when you
actually cut it down to what things
actually cost we're going to go through
all of that have a little bit of a
discussion about the red fly versus
netbook question coming up in the next
video for more on windows mobile and
windows mobile accessories be sure to
