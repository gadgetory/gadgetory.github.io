apparently there will be a unit we will
be able to afford we get leaks of the
honor 10 with a gradient color and good
specifications and 5g technology might
still take off later this year I'm high
metal Iveta reporting from Rome now
Aoife GPC is beginning tonight wait for
our coverage very soon this is PocketNow
daily the official Lucius today begin
with deals if you're in the market for
the Samsung Galaxy S and Landon s 9 plus
and I'm really shocked the deals have
pretty much already begun we're talking
about $150 off in certain retailers and
then he's a Verizon you didn't get as
much as 300 something dollars off
depending on what combination you get
obviously there are some limitations you
can learn about everything in the
description now let's talk about the
iPhone se 2 we thought we wouldn't be
getting this phone and we've got some
sources that already have a model number
and a possible launch that'll happen
sometime with between May and June it
makes a lot of sense WWDC is around the
corner we still don't have specs or
prices but it seems that it's still
coming now let's talk about 5g we were
expecting this to be a reality more as
of next year it might still be the case
when it comes to deployment but the
auctions from the FCC are now officially
happening on November 14 Qualcomm being
the largest innovator in this department
pretty much providing all the technology
needed for 5g so yeah we really can't
wait to see exactly how this is going to
pan out over time as obviously even if
the technology launches this here you'll
need a phone that's compatible with it
which most likely won't launch it until
next year now let's talk about the
honored 10 we are expecting an event to
happen from honor later within the next
couple of weeks we are expecting the
honor tend to be the reality and
remember this is pretty much the phone
that set the company in the map or you
know the Huawei variant in the map as
yeah this is pretty much a p20 when it
comes to design we even get the gradient
colors we've got here 970 processor
cameras are not necessarily the same but
it still is a great phone we can't wait
to see what we get and finally the most
interesting news today have to do with
some iPhone 10th
20:18 model KJ's Mexico has shined then
over the fact that yes we are getting an
affordable variant this affordable
variant will have the difference of
supporting an LCD 6.1 inch LCD to be
exact and apparently there will be a
dual sim model available obviously for
countries like Asia where that is
extremely popular and this is clearly
the iPhone that's going to be launched
heavily in this market up to the point
where the price tag drops apparently 650
bucks for this phone that's a
significant price drop compared to the
iPhone 10 apparently that will be the
only model priced in this range and
today's question let us know I mean
would you like for this phone to be an
exclusive to China and not have the
option to buy it in the United States
for example because in my case I really
don't understand why OMS don't sell dual
SIM phones in the States like seriously
but that's my opinion leave us a comment
