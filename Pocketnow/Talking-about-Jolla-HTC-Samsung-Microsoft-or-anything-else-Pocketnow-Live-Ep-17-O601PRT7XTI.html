morning good afternoon good evening
everybody and after I don't know 5 10 15
attempts we are finally live this is
pocket now live episode number 17 I am
Anton denied managing editor of
gawker.com and I have the utmost
pleasure of being joined today by our
chief news editor mr. Steven shank hi
Steven I how's everybody doing out there
everybody should be fine how are you
through this google + / hangout ordeal I
don't know second time hopefully be the
charm here I can't see your videos I can
see your video in the little icon on the
bottom there but not showing big so I
maybe occidental to see show if you're
mad voice that is yet so everyone out
and clear we are hopefully live this
thing is hopefully working and before we
say anything else I have an important
announcement to make bucket now that
comes youtube channel will approximately
in 30-45 minutes 1 hour reach 300,000
subscribers and we have prepared
something special for you i'm not going
to ruin the surprise but anyways in case
you're watching this in a recording
thank you very much please go watch the
video we say thank you and watch the
post on pocket now I've written a couple
of Thank You words for you guys and a
couple of logistic stuff if you have
comments or questions you want to ask
anybody on the Hangout steven myself or
any of the participants on youtube as
well as I'm pocket not write the
question in all caps question column and
your question as you've gotten used to
by now so that it pops up in my eyes
everybody on the Hangout please mute
your microphones on until we talk to you
and without further ado let's let's jump
in to this show Steven please have the
floor sure let's see who should we talk
to first I saw Nick Carol pop up both
the first time we tried to get this
started and he's back now so hey Nick
how are you doing hello okay I had
your video sorry sorry for the delay um
what do you guys think about the HTC One
being possibly supported by google like
a Google Experience HTC One do you think
that's a legitimate possibility I don't
know man I I totally believe that there
could be a nice clean AOSP version of
this sort of like what so needs been
doing with some of its roms but I don't
know if it's going to be as formal as
what we're seeing with the the galaxy s4
I mean HTC pretty adamantly denied that
anything about was going to happen so it
could i'm just not betting too heavily
on it what are you having okay well it's
it's an interesting question and as as
much as i would like to see the HTC one
being a officially supported google
edition phone because we have obviously
the s4 i'm not sure it will happen I
mean we keep on reading and hearing all
these rumors of the HTC One coming as
the google editions doc and great
vanilla phone but Nicholas Oliver please
meet your microphone thank you but I'm
not sure it will happen because HTC has
been built if you follow HTC as a
company they they were so much basing
themselves and and and relying on sense
and sense is basically an integral part
of the HTC experience now of course they
deliver the HTC first where you can
disable the facebook home and have a
stock experience i'm just not confident
personally that a stock google edition
HTC One will will happen I don't know we
think that HTC is more invested in sense
than Samsung's TouchWiz I would stay
that so yes okay yes i think if that's
the case that also rules out the
possibility of them coming out with
their own like it's one thing they have
a Google Experience HTC One because
Google will then support that but that
also rules out the possibility the HTC
themselves would produce a stopped one
so yeah if we're going on the belief
that they are so strongly committed to
being seen
hand in hand with sense that's the HTC
experience then yeah I mean if that's
where they're coming from then I think
you're right it could be just a bunch of
hot air all these rumors I'll ask just a
one more question or I guess a two-part
questions and I'll get out of the way
for others to login would you guys
consider reviewing either a google glass
or be the Nvidia shield since they're
both portable but not strictly cell
phones or tablets I know the exact
answer i'm not sure if Stephen knows it
so that's why I'm going to hand it over
to Steven to answer fifth well I know
we've talked about how we feel about
some of these gaming Android things that
are just they're not straight up
smartphones like the Ouya one that plugs
right into your TV and now shield shield
is something that we've decided that yet
these things that are basically just
smartphones with some controls glued on
like the Xperia Play we're going to be
covering those I'm not sure how we're
going to approach glass though tony do
you have some insight here i have that
much insight that at one point i have
sent an email to brandon our
editor-in-chief and i was like listen
brandon i'm i'm receiving so many ideas
from the team regarding google glass do
you think we should cover it and he was
like why not so yeah we'll cover google
less as as far as the review is is
concerned I will tell you this much stay
tuned to pocket now next week one of the
two will be reviewed cool that's good
either all right law get out of the way
i'm nick roux houston on twitter and
google+ and you guys have a great day
and happy 300,000 make thank you very
much anyone have a nice one Steven do
you mind taking another cool while I
keep on monitoring the comments and and
the logistics and the embedding and
everything which went crazy but of
course no problem let's see who do we
have how about the data shakeela be
right next to me down on the bottom here
shakeela mute your mic and everybody
hello Oh everybody okay well something
awesome hi
hopefully the audience are away sorry
already when he drums problem their
problem you sound fine now so what's on
your mind you would talk about the one
you've been looking at this jolla news
this week where do you stand actually
yes it's the water hello well you know
I'm I yoga said jolla before I heard it
pronounced it's ingrained in my mind its
Jonna I have to deal with this it's just
like a boom boom once you've been
reading something for so long it doesn't
matter like i found out apparently the
guy who invented gifts prefers run see a
cinch if i'm sorry it's gift i don't
care if you hate is wrong yeah it your
all we exchanged it for four wrong for
like ten years but this is how we
pronounce the G and I it's a G anyways
back to you Sarah yeah yeah so I'm just
yeah about Halla or depends how ever you
want to pronounce it but um I was
listening to the podcast yesterday and I
think it was Michael Fisher and Taylor
they were talking to a guest you guys
out on I forgot his name um Stefan that
was it yeah he was describing how he
went yeah he went to the event in
Finland and he I was really looking
forward to seeing the phone and seeing
the quality and all that sort of stuff
and he came on and he really didn't like
the phone he said it was pretty poor
quality like and I was really
disappointed I was like no I was looking
forward to this phone yeah I get the
feeling that they haven't even finalized
a lot of the hardware I mean they've
been so ambiguous about some of the
specs like I haven't even decided on
chipsets and things ensure the phones
you're not coming out too much later
this year that's to an extent fair its
kind of waiting to the last minute but
maybe some of those problems will be
resolved in the upcoming months I don't
know but you're right I guess such high
expectations it's upsetting to hear that
it may not be all we hope for it's kind
of one of those brands that a lot of the
techie geeky people they want to get
behind but then when they fail we're
even more critical of them it's like
the Blues muted you got muted for a
second there I had no nothing to do with
that sorry oh it's sorry about that yeah
just no problem Google Hangouts google
hangouts yep you mentioned that hardware
and the geeky side of this I'm really
curious about these the interchangeable
back covers here because it sounds like
a possibly really great idea but we know
so little about I'm a techie hardware
guy I want to know how are they
connecting here what's the interface
what's possible the talking about like
everything under the Sun you know Oh
again you know have it can print money
and it will have you know a hundred
megapixel camera and the built-in
battery pack there's so much you're
saying it can do but what's the actual
constraints of what pins are going to be
there this is stuff I want to know about
I'm up so late it's kind of like up in
the air sort of dreaming they're not
really telling us anything no and I've
got some fundamental problems I really
like that something new and different
and that all these options are being
discussed but wasn't the point of a
smartphone that it's one gadget that
does everything you need you know it's
your camera it's your it's your laptop
computer for a lot of people if you have
to carry around with half a dozen
accessories to snap on the back isn't
that working backwards I mean this is
going to want to do that it's kind of
like with the Lumia 925 it's like why
would you design such a good-looking
phone and then make us stick this ugly
thing on the back to get water usability
out of it I know what Tony's gonna say
but uh it doesn't look right I'm going
to refrain from commenting so I mean
there's a lot a lot of potential
obviously we've seen some tantalizing
things but it's I you know it doesn't
seem to have the whole thing put
together yet there's a lot of things
that we don't know there's a lot that
they're just not telling us and it's so
hard to form very strong opinions at
this point so we've actually had a
chance to you know go we weren't at the
in Finland we couldn't go hands on them
I don't know maybe later on this year
will be able to form some stronger
opinions on and I hope so yola oh just
one more question for you guys yeah all
right I'm jump out um regarding all the
doom and gloom for HTC lately are you
guys genuinely worried for the company
I'm not Tony r you I am a little bit yes
whenever whenever a company starts
losing not only employees but key
executives and when some of those
executives go to Twitter and say
everybody should just leave HTC do it
now and you'll be happy that makes me
feel a little bit worried you know what
are they leave because they know that
the ship ship is sinking or whether they
leave because they don't agree with a
new policy of moving some HQ from
Seattle to Taiwan that doesn't interest
me that much but in in the general
context of HTC stocks going like this
and guess it worries me a little bit i
mean the executive stuff though is that
really going to impact the phones that
we see sure they're the ones leaving the
direction of the company but they're not
the designers they're not the engineers
as long as the creative people are still
in place i don't know if it's going to
be that applicant impact on the the
products we see in the end I got your
point completely but I think that once
employees start losing their faith or
not believing anymore and either the
products or the direction the company is
going towards or going in that's a huge
question mark for me yeah it's
problematic I will try to you that yeah
I'll admit one of the only reasons I was
worried because I'm being a bit greedy I
just wanted 4.2 jelly bean for my HTC
One without you guys yes mentha don't
like knife you get that done you can
leave I've heard rumors it supposed to
be just a couple weeks away i think yeah
let me just ask you something do you
have the HTC One me yes yes you said it
okay
would you have preferred to get the HTC
one google edition if that ever happens
or are you okay with the normal HTC
Sense 5 point elevation honestly I
prefer it with sense because it gives me
that option if I really want to try out
4.2 jelly bean i can just try out a
custom rom I mean some of them are so
close nowadays it's not a it's not a big
difference to what Google gives me I'd
be paying the same price for a google
edition but no sense at all and that
software actually costs them money to
put into the phone there's no but I can
say galaxy yeah okay though I want to
follow it up with deal likely 4.7 inch
size or now that we're hearing about a
possible you know five and a half six
inch one and I'll so this 4.31 mini
would one of those be better do you
think yeah I just I read your article
just now and I was like if they're
thinking of going any bigger they should
go straight to a tablet don't bother
with them because that's that's not
their market a seven inch metal tablet
that'd be pretty hard oh yeah it'd be
nice yeah you see if HTC actually feels
like you know getting serious about
tablets any point in the future I'm not
holding my breath but who knows me
neither I would love to have one but
yeah we know it's probably not gonna
happen who knows let's wrap it up see
them yeah any last question for us or we
know that wasn't pranks okay thanks for
your help guys all good weird anyway
yeah regulations people want to reach
you on twitter or whatnot how can they
they find you I it's all down below
shakeel under squirrel camera on you
yeah underscore a yep and that's about
it Twitter and Facebook is the same
thing Google thanks for talking with us
thanks guys Congrats thank you very much
you take care bye bye and before I
choose somebody to talk to i have a
couple of questions one is directly
addressed to me Anton do you ever leave
that room this you know I've been born
in this room I'm living in this room I'm
living my entire life in this room and
there's nothing beyond
these windows and beyond that door so my
entire universe is happening here at
least you have the window open now so
you can get some nice if reason it's
because I need to smoke to get out but
it's just I don't care whatever happens
on the other side it's just my reality
and I like paranoid like that so it's
okay another question what do you guys
think of the samsung galaxy mega 5.8 and
6.3 and when are you gonna review it
right since I'm the jumbo film freak I'm
the one who talks on a tablet of raising
it to his ear I will review the galaxy
mega 6.3 whenever it's available and you
will read about it and a question to
everybody Steven maybe you want to
tackle this yeah i buy an HTC One I
currently own a galaxy s3 mmm s3 to the
one I don't know I think it's too soon
yes three probably still has another you
know nine months to a year of life left
it and will still be getting the latest
software I'll get all the good stuff
that the s4 had unless it you know
there's something wrong with it or you
just got money burning a hole in your
pocket maybe now's not the time to to
upgrade no wait and see holiday season
will have great phones if you look at
something better than I mean don't if
you love the one by all means it's a
fantastic whoa get it but you don't have
to s3 is an awesome phone to give it
some more couple more months yeah and
and i agree with stephen so if you got
the s free the s3 will get probably if
not all but the majority of s four
features through an update we also have
a video on pocket now youtube channel
with the leaked s3 rom which brings a
new android version and some features i
would not upgrade but it's up to you and
with that let me choose mr. met Pietro
Jacques okay and now you tell me how you
spell your name a pet Shack be a jerk so
you have a Polish route yes good and
I've been traveling a lot to bowl until
at least I was a little bit close yeah
well you know the whole flock language
is
basically all the same so tell me what
do you want to talk about we have we
have yo la we have HTC we have samsung
we have Microsoft or we have anything
else you want to talk about whether if
it's mobile or not we don't care it's
well yeah I was reading that article
about the people but Kate it on their
phones and you know just a whole comment
or in the comment section you know that
always happens but personally I have
never used the case for my phone ever
and I don't know if because I baby my
phones or it's because the phones meant
to be you know use not being on the
couch cushion example of the way agree
with you and I have no pouches on my
phones either so here's the HTC One
here's the octa-core s4 here's the
iphone 5 and whatever else i have here
it's without a pouch but our own Jaime
Rivera has an awesome awesome saying and
I'm gonna try to quote him to my to the
best of my knowledge you buy a BMW and
it has leather seats do you cover them
with something to protect them or do you
just show them off no you know I would
obviously film off but there are markets
for this they do it sell like you know
car seat covers so yeah I think with
phones you want to figure that the
manufacturer spent all this developing
money making it look a certain way and
that's how the experience that it was
users to have so do you want to be
having that same experience every day or
you want to get the one that you get
from a you know ten dollar piece of
silicon that probably witchcraft it up
in an afternoon from a couple cat-scans
oh you know it's it's about getting the
full manufacturer's experience and so
that I mostly been with you guys I've
always hated cases I did finally get the
bumper case for my nexus 4 honestly I
think it makes it look better and that's
the only reason well and the fact that
is phone is just an ax
waiting to happen but we've manufacturer
cases there is the chance that they will
actually enhance the look of the phone
and I think that's what LG did here so
I'm a recent convert but by and large I
am agreeing that cases are awful Matt I
can I can only add this it all depends
on the type of person you are and how
well you take care of your phones and
without any ill will or or anything
which which should be interpreted else
else it's for instance Brandon minimum
he's an awesome guy but he doesn't
really take that much care of his films
he drops them occasionally he tosses
them and for him protection might be
important if he would care about that me
for instance this is actually the way
I'm having my HTC one on my wooden table
it's a cloth and the HTC One is sitting
on the cloth and that's how I put it on
a table and this is how I treat all my
phones so it all comes down to how you
care about your devices how often you
wipe them clean and how often you check
four scuffs and stuff like that so in my
case I good care of them and I don't
need a case it's funny when you
mentioned about Europe in your HTC One
on a cloth or whatever everything sits
on something it's not directly on
anything yeah on my neck that's four I
do that all the time but now I have a
Lumia 920 and well I think it's durable
enough just to put on table that's a
tank yeah yes if I wanted to go back to
what tony was saying a minute ago about
people who maybe don't take the best
care of their phones I kind of feel like
a jerk sometimes because when I try it
well when I try to explain these anti
case of feelings I have a lot of it is
you know if you have a case maybe it's
because you aren't respectful of the
technology you got the phone free on
contract you know look at it as a 600
700 dollar piece of high-end electronics
you want to just throw it around and is
it wrong to be judging people for just
wanting a phone that's durable I
maybe it's a double standard or
something I feel uncomfortable when I
espouse such thoughts occasionally me
any any other topics or questions you
want to uh well you know the whole rides
of Microsoft that their recent
commercials which ones the ones
regarding the ipad or yea though they're
really something i have recently learned
that there is a huge disconnect between
me here in europe and the US apparently
and stephen can testify to this in the
u.s. it is acceptable to have
commercials which are not only calling
out the competition but bashing the
competition and that thing is against
the law in europe so I've been born and
raised yeah I've been born and raised
under under these circumstances with
with these ideas and whenever I see any
company samsung bashing Apple HTC
bashing Apple nakia bashing Apple
because Apple for what it's worth and
I'm not talking about the Mac versus PC
ads which were like 20 years ago but
recently Apple is not featuring any
other device in their ads except for the
iphone so I have this feeling that it's
not right because i've been i've been
raised thinking like this but but Steven
can tell you that that in in the US this
is normal and he will say that the the
new surface vs iphone vs vicious iPad
ads are just normal and I would say that
they suck because in my opinion you
cannot sell your product while bashing
another product but Stephen will say no
it's not like that here that is finally
ingrained in American Advertising
culture I mean going all the way back to
you i can give the 80s that famous
where's the beef at making fun of I
think was Wendy's making fun of someone
else but it was always been a case where
manufacturers publicly parade each other
and usually it's a little
tongue-in-cheek I mean they'll you know
do a past each of the company rather
than directly attack them but it's not
especially with a technological devices
like this it's not on her
to just put one up against the other and
frankly I think Microsoft is I mean
there's a little bit of controversy
about exactly what it's saying about the
ipad which I might have seen in a post i
had up last night but I mean good for
Microsoft or at least trying to get
people questioning the the status quo
and trying to get some you know more
interest in the this struggling windows
a chaplain market yeah well I have a
surface pro myself and I love it so you
know more people get windows 8 the
better well i hope i have absolutely
nothing about the surface pro windows 8
bro on the form factor like the surface
pro is an awesome solution if you want
to have uninterruptedly from your
desktop to to the tram to your commuting
to the office but I I have a problem
with the surface RT so oh yeah I cannot
get overhead but the service bro yeah
that's that's a good product and I wish
the surface pro would come in a
seven-point something form factor I
would buy that over the ipad anytime i
think it's headed in that direction we
might see that by the end of the year i
hope so yeah well we'll see no Xbox
one's around the corner so we note that
Microsoft Delta will announce right yep
a little Oh controller for the game
that's a tablet maybe hmm Microsoft has
been pioneering the gaming console and
and the gaming experience for for quite
some time now with the xbox it just
comes down to whether they can connect
windows phone with surface with Windows
PC with the xbox and have a complete
ecosystem which is seamless I mean
they're trying already and it's not it's
not bad but they've come up with I'm
just curious where they can really go
from here what you know the xbox one
will do differently from the 360 had you
know interactivity with Windows Phone
it's just maybe not enough we'll see
we'll see Matt do you have any any final
thoughts we have to do while slowly uh
no i am good then please make me a favor
and tell everybody where they can find
you on social networks in case you want
to be bound
you can find me on twitter by searching
PPR said k BR zet k it is everybody they
are that came the t r zi k thank you
very much go and follow him on twitter
Matt it's been a pleasure take care
alright see ya before I hand it over to
Steven I have a question from Speedos I
think he's from Greece judging by his
name he says question oppo or oh BB 0 is
coming to europe on monday there's
actually a new speech saying that they
are opening their european online store
and they will be shipping phones to
anywhere in europe for free so a PO is
coming to europe on monday should i buy
one or wait for the next Nexus see them
ah I'm glad someone mention that I saw
that on the news feeds this morning and
it's awesome that all those doing this I
mean the best way that a brand that's
mainly focused in Southeast Asia looking
to get broader international appeal is
to directly go after the customer so
this is great for them I don't know if
you should get an epiphone though
because they're so focused in Southeast
Asia we we write about them we hear the
news about them but compared to allow
the other phones we have very little
hands-on experience with these so it's
tough to say and again the other side of
that question we don't know whether the
next Nexus device is coming out I mean
we might get this news white nexus for
next month but a nexus 5 could still be
you know 56 if not more months away and
and from what I've heard just to
complete your sentence there might not
even your nexus 5 there there might be
the motorola x which might be our next
is so who knows whatever it is yeah i do
not know how to answer to that but
definitely you should check out the Oppo
offerings it's great that they're going
to be available so take a look at what L
say okay thank you for your answer and
there's somebody who says should i buy
the galaxy tab to 7.0 and my answer to
who is definitely not because the galaxy
I happy to ah it's a two year old device
I can hear some background noise so
everybody please greet your microphones
if we're not talking to you it's an old
device and we have some new offerings on
the market we got the asus fonepad if we
want to keep it Samsung we had the
galaxy note 8.0 if at all the tab 3 is
coming up it's coming out yeah according
to rumor so if you are short on your
budget and the galaxy note and the
galaxy tab 2 7 point 0 is the only
option which you can get yeah go get a
nexus 7 or something that yeah word so
yeah and the Steven it's your turn yeah
what's the UM I like alawi al-haddad
because he has the biggest head in the
lineup here and so he is he I mean by
nature of sitting closest to the camera
not some physical know this criminals
out of here unless us are really uh
angle there he is you know 40 feet tall
but Zoe how are you doing I'm fine how
are you I am well what did you want to
talk to us about well I'm gone I want to
talk about I want to ask Anton about
nokia lumia 925 yes please ask on
whatever you want to know yeah I want to
know how I was feeling between nokia
lumia and HTC One does it work really I
can tell you this much it is definitely
much much much lighter than the Lumia
920 for instance and it is even lighter
than the HTC One now if you compare the
Lumia 925 with the samsung galaxy s4
which the galaxy s4 is a I'd say light
device I couldn't really tell the
difference which one is lighter so I I'd
say this much the Lumia 925 is thin and
white much thinner and much lighter than
the Lumia 920
and what is killing it killing of the
Lumia on the frame yeah can you please
repeat the question the almond almond
Lumia dollar menu the aluminum the
aluminum uh so if you have you ever held
an HTC One or an iPhone 5 in your hand I
have held okay so you know that whenever
you get the iphone 5 in your hand the
back is cold because it's aluminum and
and it feels cold yeah okay now the
Lumia 925 feels the same way around the
edges the top and the bottom because
that's where the aluminum is and the
back of it feels exactly like the Lumia
920 or the HTC or the samsung galaxy s4
without the hyper place so it is cold to
the touch on the edges but it is kind of
warm plasticky on the back so that's a
mixed feeling of cold and warm ok now
let's fill out all HTC company okay
please disable later Stephen back to
Stephen and whatever a question for me
just call me out in the comment that HTC
I mean company when way if it stink
carrot and it's out of the market we're
gonna lose the really nice sign phones
that made for people I mean if you hear
that you look at the Sony so they make
very nice phones and really great twice
but they like some things that Samsung
have like software and stuff like that
as for HTC they mix between sony and
samsung in kind of way like they make
the software and they make design that
are much better than the system so
what's your opinion HTC gone from
apartments ok so what effect would HTC's
absence have on the sort of the quality
of phones we're seeing both from
hardware and software oh that's a good
question HTC like you said it's
definitely a company that puts a higher
focus on design then Samsung does while
still having some very attractive
software so I think it's a good
comparison the mix of Samsung and Sony
first off I don't think HTC is going
anywhere so it's a bit of a a moot point
for me even considering this um but I
don't think we'd see other companies
necessarily spring right up to fill that
exact role because like I said we have
other companies doing these things
individually there might not be someone
who arrives to do things in exactly the
same way HTC has been mixing the
hardware and software focuses as they've
been but for looking at the Android
landscaping general and the effect it
would have minimal I mean HTC has been
scaling back the number of phones it
makes and when it did make a lot a lot
of them were very similar so it would be
awful I don't think it's going to happen
and if it does the impact we would see
would not shake things up to I think the
extent some people are worrying about I
could be totally wrong you know but I'm
really hoping she does not disappear 11
failure I mean right it's one failure
after years of middling success but if
you're not read too much into this you
know the cancellation at first in the UK
it's just it's a road bump it's not a
collapsing building here well I also saw
the news about galaxy s4 active I mean a
design of the therefore this forum how
if they did it for generations for will
be really much better yet the s4 looks
really cool um
that design with the the bright orange
that's not the sort of thing we're used
to seeing from Samsung it actually kind
of looks a little bit more like what HTC
might do leave or a windows phone model
or something no that's a really
compelling phone I really hope the
hardware ends up being able to deliver
because it the specs have been a little
all over the place we're not quite sure
if it's me quad core dual core it could
still be a good phone if it's dual core
but as a really pretty phone I am
excited to see it actually be just
around the corner they've been saying
end of may possibly so we might get the
full scoop on that one sooner than we
think hopefully and and let me just got
in with with a a quick question what do
you guys think and this is a question
for everybody what are you are
participants or you are watching this
what do you guys think about the recent
rumors about the Nokia EOS I mean I know
I'm a PureView I'm a real PureView
fanboy so that's 41 megapixel camera
over sampling all the way we've heard
some rumors that there might be an event
sometime next month maybe in two months
what do you guys think of that obviously
jump in here first ah I'm really
impressed but we've heard about the
physical aspects of the device that they
managed to get that big sensor in there
and from all accounts it should be the
same 41-megapixel we've seen on the 808
while not making it super thick I mean
possibly even thinner than the 920 and
just being either lying down day or
point I'm going to lock my camera on you
while you talk and I'm going to show off
the 920 versus the HTC One that is
ridiculous I'm gonna throw in the galaxy
s4 and I'm gonna throw in the apple
iphone 5 and I'm going to do a four-way
thickness comparison lie so this check
this out that is a tasty smartphone
sandwich right there so getting this any
form factor which would be like this or
this or this is awesome on it by itself
yeah I'm just worried though because
it's a thing we might not see really
fancy stuff like the optical image
stabilization but still a little big
megapixel camera and a decent lens will
be more than enough
to make Windows Elias ridiculously happy
and my experience with the with the 808
PureView the 808 PureView is better than
any other phone out there even in
low-light conditions given you are using
a tripod it is the rub it yeah it has a
long exposure time which which generates
awesome awesome low-light pictures but
you have to have a tripod for those i
think it's 3.3 seconds the longest
exposure time and for that you have to
hold the device still this is getting a
little off track that reminds me there's
this feature that Adobe demoed a couple
years ago for things going to be in the
next photoshop now that they're going
all online only where it can when you
have a long exposure time it can sort of
track out how the camera was shaking and
then post processing correct all of the
the movement blur and we'll thought that
if we combine that with a 41-megapixel
sensor that would be incredible assuming
that a smartphone has the processing
power to do it but oh man please license
that two camera companies I beg of you
not agree with you about the children of
you it's 808 you are breaking up just a
little bit on my end I'm sure on
Stephenson too so if you can please
repeat the sentence or the beginning of
it pew pew true that you have just now
okay I the thickness of the phone can be
reduced because cuz that's in on then
the you know the thickness of the phone
might be because of the Xenon's you know
you know the Xenon flash is just a small
part of it the thickness comes from the
super super huge sensor which is the
41-megapixel sensor which is also huge
in size so it does have nothing to do
with the Xenon flash the Lumia 928 I
don't want to spoil anything but by the
time we finish this hangout the Lumia
928 on
boxing will be live on YouTube and I'm
pocket now and you'll see that it has
nothing to do with it yet they're saying
that the EOS might have a smaller flash
the 808 but the flash is not what back
hey thank you okay I'm locking my camera
on you as Stephen Willa Willa talk you
out yeah I think we can see if your your
Twitter handle down there is it blurry
over here we owe it out early ee yeah
hello all right so that's where they go
to follow maui on twitter thank you very
much for talking with us and please come
on back some other week yeah why thank
you bye-bye and ate a question for pot
from pocketnow.com do you think that if
HTC one had something like Siri or s
voice then it would help HTC to increase
their sales and do you think that they
should add this feature in their next
key lime pie update what it does it's
called google now next next is seriously
what would more functionality do you
want that I agree with you if you happen
to live in a region like I do which is
not fully supported by either Google now
0 or s voice you learn to not care about
either one of those so as far as weather
is concerned as I said previously I have
a window and usually the online weather
channels are wrong all the time so when
it's raining outside it's sunny on my
phone and aside from that I have no use
of these but sure if you live in the US
or a supporter country it's up to you
next question what do you guys expect at
WWDC I don't happen all the ways
actually I had a piece up which was this
weekend a part of the series and on
things I think that Apple does not need
any new hard work this year what they
need is a new version of iOS a new
breath a something refresh even if it's
if it's like this hey guys we have no
phones we still have the iOS 6 running
iphone 5 only that now it will get iOS 7
and it will look completely different on
your phone so that would mean for me a
probably a stop in decline of the market
share loss for for apple apple doesn't
need new hardware you're right it's so
insanely profitable but it puts out a
new phone I was looking at some chart of
a apple sales and you see it like it
climbs up for a while all the cells go
on and then when a new phone come out it
just shoots up and sort of you know
smooths down but when they introduce one
that's going to be millions billions of
dollars coming in for them even they
don't need it they're gonna do it but
that's off the point of WWDC like you
were saying yeah we're not going to see
any hardware if we do see hardware it's
going to be like macbooks it's going to
be more of you know the OSX side of
things iOS 7 could be very interesting
I'm not sure how much of it we're going
to see though as they're really not
going to release it now this is going to
be like hey developers check out where
you're not working with in beta for the
next six months I don't know if we'll
see enough to be blown away but like you
said Apple could really have a big the
big success of this year just be
software wise so and maybe maybe they
will bring a iphone 5s with slight
improvements but the main selling point
will probably iOS 7 okay mr. Seth
perfect your name is perfect I want to
talk to you are you doing I am awesome
how are you where are you from good uh
united states north carolina north
carolina your of the steven is is taylor
from NC you're from SC teller i think
it's north he's a human Charlie I'm not
mature Allah too awesome what do you
want to talk about today from everything
we have mentioned or from whatever else
well I miss the beginning so
I just recently read a guess an article
on some new a bigger HTC one I don't
know they're going to call it but that's
that Steven's derf JCC one point
something yeah what about it i like it i
wish i wish they would do it what do you
think it should be more like a five
incher or closer to six inch tablet e
sizes probably five and a half I had a
had a note 2 and I gave it up for for
the one just because I I just love the
speakers and the build quality and I do
miss the battery life though that's one
thing I hadn't thought about if they do
go with a bigger phone that's room for
the battery to get larger as well so
yeah I'm just worried that it's HTC
walking backwards it sounds like a droid
DNA again if it's tour the smaller size
but another boom sound you're right
that's a really big deal if they had a
phablet size device with boomsound I
would be interested in trying that out
right and something and something with
uh with the metal design you know design
just like it how do you think will a
larger form factor with the impact on
portability on weight specifically say
the HTC One is a relatively heavy device
the same build with a six-inch for a
fact or will it be too heavy for you I
don't know what's the note is the note
felt pretty heavy the note 2 I mean uh
pretty heavy but I don't know what the
difference is between look you're
looking for the note looking for to
notice we Tony's basket oh he's there
Harrison on the fly well I'd say that
let me switch hands I'd say that these
two feel approximately the same but the
difference in screen size is about this
big the problem is if you do the
speakers on the front I think the phone
is going to end up being too big but
probably way to go though I love it that
would be even better i think on the
tablet
having lost matters on the front it's a
trade-off but I think it would be worth
it Stephen a memory exercise wasn't the
galaxy blared the first-ever device to
have front facing the front firing
speakers it's the first I remember
having stereo front-facing speakers
right like summer of last year was it
yeah yeah yeah I think yeah I had the
same memory but that I just wanted to
check yeah that's the first that strikes
me a recollection set back to you I'm
sorry okay I got another thing yes my my
friend's wife sent me a message a little
while ago saying she wants to buy our
her husband a nexus 7 for father's day
they'll buy a nexus 7 now that's what
I'm saying so I don't know what to tell
her I'm telling her to wait but I don't
think it's gonna be by father's day but
what is father's day I think it's a 16
jun oh yeah we're not going to hear
about a new Nexus 7 by then but anyways
the nexus 7 should be one year old in
one or two weeks max so it is due for a
refresh and I actually posted this
morning a rumor that the
second-generation Nexus 7 should be out
by the end of q2 so that's
january-february a pro may do so by the
end of june i don't think it's worth
risking for just a couple of weeks
buying last year's hardware with the
Tegra 3 processor when it can have
something you in one or two weeks so I'd
say and I think that Steven agrees with
this that just just hold on just for one
one or two more weeks yeah and maybe
he's like me and doesn't know when
father's day yes or you won't I do have
one other thing I have have appetit v
and i like it i think it works good but
I don't have apple devices anymore
what's up with the google TV when can
they make it so it's like apple TV where
everything is just seamless the phones
connect you could view everything up
that's on your phone what's going on I
can talk about the Apple TV because I
have an apple TV I have an iPad
i have a macbook i have a apple router i
have the ipad i have the iphone i have
everything in addition to the android
devices which i had so they all played
together they do not play with android
devices and windows phone so i cannot
comment on the google q I think the
Nexus Q but i'm not sure Stephen can
either he had that I always wanted one
of those i fortunately didn't get in the
when they were available for pre-order
and I think everyone got them for free
in the end I do think that the one thing
to pay attention to is this gadget that
showed up in the FCC like earlier this
week your last that might be a new Nexus
Q it was definitely line power it had no
radio bands just Wi-Fi is a google
device it looks like it could be you
know the next thing that goes in your
living room I don't know if it'll have
the same functionality as Apple TV it's
still too early to to tell but I would
wait and see where that's headed
something it exists we're not quite sure
what it is but it could very well be the
product you're looking for and then
would have all of the integration with
our smart phones you all be on the same
in the same ecosystem and google has the
power to do with and they had the back
end and and it's only up to them really
yeah that's what I'm saying how long is
the apple TV been around and all its
features that Google can't catch up with
it I mean that's something else they got
all down on yep I am still upset about
what happened with the Q last year that
thing looks like from the beginning that
Google didn't know what they were
thinking I mean banana plug connectors
for stereo it's like it had this they
thought they had to do this they had to
answer apple yet like design by
committee or something I don't know what
I'm Steven by the way have you read the
the new reports that the I think it was
the google music the new version of it
that does not support the last year
Google Nexus Q yeah I think I was just
an oversight they had it I saw those
headphones I didn't get the meat of the
story there yeah me neither specifically
blocking the queue or if it was just non
smartphone devices I think that's
than what it was wasn't set up to run on
yeah things that didn't have a built-in
screen that was embarrassing but I think
that was just a good they're gonna fix
it hopefully if they haven't already set
any final thoughts questions that's it
it's the three things I'm hoping for
hope somebody's listening hopefully
there are if you want to tell anybody
and everybody where they can find you on
your social networks I'm locking my
camera on you you don't have any dog
tags as I like yeah I gotta I gotta
figure that out like my profile which
was blocked for three months for good
was plucks I guess because of my name
and I had to figure out how to get him
to approve it and I finally did this is
my first time joining in sorry like that
thought that you were just some random
guy named Seth claiming he was the best
set out there you might want to spell
out your ear or Facebook or Google+
Google Plus is that perfect SC th p RF
PCT awesome on thank you very much for
jogger weekend guys have a nice to take
care my way Oh Steven no more questions
for the moment so it's back to you jump
right in here how about Karthik Karthik
tell us how you're doing hello hi there
where you are not calling where you're
video chatting from I'm from Texas
Arlington all right another US bound
visitor here I like that but what do you
want to talk about with us I have three
questions basically sure and first one
will be especially to Anton and on what
you think of iOS nokia is I mean they're
going to release it but will they
release their on all carriers remember
the make they made a mistake with 920
and they just released on AT&amp;amp;T that's an
interesting question so first of all
before I answer that question I'm going
to sound off my concern that I'm still
not really clear about this the from
what I know windows phone does not
support
31 megapixel images image sensors and
the rail officers yeah and the
processors inside windows phones do not
support that Nokia might show off a
device in June or July saying hey this
is the EOS it's gonna be available in
October but by that time windows phone
8.1 or 8.5 will be already out and to
answer your question I think no I think
the Lumia eos whatever its its code name
will be 1000 one will be an
international device and I think that
AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and t-mobile will get
specific models and no I think Nokia has
not learned you know as for that the
camera issue there I'm not sure it's the
deal breaker that people have been
making it out to be even if the the SOC
is that we already have that are
approved for windows phone 8 don't
natively support this you could always
throw another chip in between the two
that talks directly to the camera sensor
and then to the processor and it can
read all those pixels and deliver them
it's not going to be the cheapest
solution it's not going to be the most
compact solution but if they want to
make a big show hey look what we can do
they could make it work they could yeah
because I'm with with Microsoft fully
supporting them they I can even see them
having a very custom version of Windows
Phone specifically for the EOS oh okay
makes sense but really hope they don't
make mistake exactly like Lumia what
they did I'm not sure about the ante so
the 920 AT&amp;amp;T 925 tmobile/slash
international 928 verizon do I need to
tell you more later history look I don't
mind 925 920 and 928 but they should
release at the same time yeah otherwise
there's no point in I did not agree with
you more and I think props the Samsung
because they were the first ones to
manage to do with this with the Galaxy
Note 2 because we know the galaxy s3
he was kind of a different s2 and s3 was
different carriers different form
factors but the note 2 I think was the
the first device from Samsung having the
same specs across the world with the
same design and the same internals and
they managed to do that first and HTC is
doing the same with the HTC One so
hopefully nakia learns I believe they
will not learn okay next question google
i/o Anton you said it's a disappointment
why I mean it because there is no new
version of Android yes mainly yes I've
been expecting one of two things to
happen at Google i/o number one because
of the nexus 7 will be soon what year
old I expected a nexus 7 point something
refresh that did not happen the second
thing I expected was something i don't
know what four point two point three
four point three four point five point
75 points something and updated to
android but as it turns out google i/o
was a mainly developer oriented event
and that is why i was a little bit
disappointing and i'm looking forward to
a dedicated android / nexus event soon
yeah I almost got the feeling from IO
that it was intentional that they were
trying to refocus development so maybe
we'll get like a big commercially
focused advantage towards the end of
june or july global see oldest on which
you would make all the sense in the
world given the new dates for WWDC hmm
talking about apple do you really think
they'll will they release a new new
handset especially bigger one because
they really always stress on the form
factor and portability and all those
things and nowadays phones are bigger so
we like he's a bigger question knowing
knowing apples history Apple is the
Apple was bashed because they had the 4
inch screen and on the iphone 5 and now
Apple has managed to become about the
only manufacturer to offer a smaller
solution to
4.7 inches to almost five inches and
Apple is about the only phone about the
only high-end phone delivering good user
experience which is in the smaller form
factor part so people who want a smaller
phone can only go with apple in my
opinion I'm ledge Steven what do you
think I wouldn't go that far there are
some smaller options in women both
windows phone and Android they might not
be the highest end for their platforms
but I guess want to back up and talk
about the idea of this larger phone in
general these rumors the next Apple
devices are ridiculous how is completely
all over the landscape of the Arts well
we're going to get seven new iPhones
next week oh no we're going to get 120
inch iPad in February of next year and
everything in between and when you look
back on what happened last summer with
all of these iphone 5 weeks ago that's I
mean compared to years previous we were
getting those tight as a drum was a huge
deal when that oh is it iphone four of
the 4s prototype the quorum about their
hand as a 4s and now this year we're
hearing a lot again but it's so
disjointed I can't help but wonder
Apple's like doing a disinformation
campaign out there and it's trying to
muddy the waters a little and we hear
about a bigger iPhone smaller iPhone
plastic iPhone yeah I had them looks
like the ipad mini it's maybe we'll get
half of this stuff maybe we'll get none
of it but I think Apple might actually
be trying to purposely confuse us here
you know I've no evidence for this this
is just paranoia I had this one sony
ericsson x10 xperia and I have this
Lumia 920 now when I was looking at that
the old phone it looks and feels so
comfortable in hand small and this is
huge and I'd I mean I don't like to have
a big phone which is much more bigger
than this you know the small and huge
without being misunderstood is a very
civil
acta thing so what would I be small for
you might be big for me and vice versa I
need to adapt so if i am using the gs4 i
need to adapt to it and if i am going
back to the iphone 5 I need to adapt it
but if I was not working with pocket now
and I had to buy my own phone my
personal perfect size is the 4.0 4.3
inch form factor that's good for my
hands okay you're just so upset the HTC
first couldn't catch on i was going to
save the 4.3 inch for you back and and i
believe in that phone i mean just one
click away from nexus applying it come
on that's it and one more thing i would
like to buy yola phone just because i
was a note i am a nokia fan and i loved
me go and I want to see how your love
works I have met eola in person at mwc i
have met marc dylan i met all the
awesome people at yola here's a question
for you would you rather give say six
hundred dollars for a yola phone or
would you give six hundred dollars for a
samsung galaxy s4 I hate them so the
problem yeah the problem that's what I'm
trying to emphasize I love you and I
have a t-shirt here to prove it the
problem is that that they they have
priced their phone somehow too high I
mean an order for you as a newcomer even
if the hardware is awesome but we don't
know anything about it you have to price
it like a newcomer I mean if you price
your phone like the flagship Android
phone whether it's this or this you're
likely going to have the Windows Phone
affect all over or the windows tablet
effect or that yeah okay I don't
understand that so that's that's my
personal bliss but if you want to buy
elephone all means
I think that the other half is awesome
and as Mark Dylan said that there are no
limitations you can customize the back
cover and and the experience there are
no limits to that but but I really think
that it's it's a new platform it's
starting from zero and from 0 to 3 point
something percent where Windows Phone is
there's a long road Windows Phone got 23
points something okay let's say five
depending on who you believe it took
them two years and we're talking
Microsoft yeah yeah okay that's it thank
you guys and yeah get in touch with you
we went to a fighter I wish I could
figure that out I'd read it but it for
some reason google being google so he
said everybody loves google yeah we're
just gonna be reduced to wearing you
know signs around our necks next time
yeah i guess makes sense anyway a
congratulation on 300,000 muslim thank
you keep up the good work that's it have
a good weekend guys thank you so much
take care you Tony I think you're up for
you wanna talk or not before a question
questions questions Anton when are we
going to see a real battery that can
last for days without charging it no
matter how hard we are using it well I
have one right here to quote Ace Ventura
it's a extended battery for the guy it's
a sixty four hundred million power
battery i had a review on pocket now
make sure to read that basically wear
whatever you want to get extreme battery
life out of your phone you have to have
an external battery of course your phone
has to support external battery unlike
me one so that's the first prerequisite
else i'm oliver with the razr maxx is
your max or you can just get like an old
motorola what was the phone it looked
like a brick a startac but yeah large
enough to hold on
acid car battery you can do that if you
wanted to go down that road yeah okay so
um to me you say okay Nicholas Oliver re
hi we are good if I can please kindly
ask you to speak a little bit longer oh
my mission we are barely hearing you but
yeah it's it's working fine what do you
want to talk about today yeah iris lee
yesterday about the windows phone
youtube app gets put off by google yup
right you to the advertisement and the
in-app the blogging video Steven did you
get that I do most look at the question
there yeah googly block the YouTube apps
for the windows phone what did they they
actually block it I know they were
threatening to and the Microsoft came up
with a new app that is correctly
downloaded from what I know they they
called out Microsoft for not for not
obeying their terms and conditions and
and Terms of Service because of the ads
and downloading of YouTube videos and
Microsoft issues a update for the
YouTube application and by the way
install or not oh yeah and and that
should fix part of the issue but we're
not sure if it's going to be a nun
Google could still block YouTube or your
find a way to break what they're doing
Microsoft might you know do what they
did this past time and just try to
reverse-engineer some of the API
themselves so it could be like a
back-and-forth they get into here yeah I
think Microsoft is I don't know how much
interest it has and doing the right
thing but it's it's definitely it's put
the ball back in Microsoft in Google's
court I'd use that phrase quite a bit
lately but the google totally did at i/o
with Larry Page they made this an issue
that Microsoft could get a lot of
attention about by saying we're all
about
you know interoperability and openness
and Microsoft's Kinect very valid point
if you are you know we want to show
these ads give us the ability to its
Google should it's nothing to be Google
will come forward with that and everyone
will be happy or Google will have to
finally put its foot down and say we
weren't as open as we were leading you
to believe and we still has control over
YouTube and we want to dictate how it
works since this is an editorial I want
to know your personal opinion regardless
oh not a pocket now opinion but your
opinion do you think that Google has a
personal vendetta against Microsoft and
in this specific case with with all the
api's with YouTube with with the
services on gmail and exchange and so on
so as a whole do you think that Google
wants Microsoft Windows Phone to
disappear or to not allow those people
who are tied in with the Google
ecosystem to switch to Windows Phone
absolutely I don't think that they're
being necessarily malicious about it but
they see or the audience here they don't
need to serve they it's not like iOS
where it's so big that you can you can't
ignore them they're going to have to
even if it means helping another company
with their platform the benefit who the
size of the user base is big enough to
make to compel Google to provide apps
the windows phone it doesn't have to and
so it's either going to be a case of
Google deciding but we're going to be
the nice guy who just shares with
everyone or it can be the guy who says
well we're big enough that we can pick
and choose who we play with and we don't
think windows phone is big enough um so
yeah I think it sort of has singled the
maps aside if this isn't worth our while
and we're not going to put ourselves and
any sort of not going to put ourselves
out in the slightest bit in order to to
to force a solution that works here so I
don't know if that's going to be enough
though to actively try and get in the
way
Microsoft but absolutely they're
purposely not trying very hard to bring
Google Experience to Windows Phone users
Thank You Nicholas back to you yeah I
take the relationship between Google and
Microsoft has to be an unstable recently
so the google recently that they wants
block the google maps from the week
those phone users so yeah we've those
and Luclin did it did they actually
block that though I can't remember then
I have a feeling that came out that it
was just like because it was all being
done in browser was something about it
no user agent pro like user agent
strings was thinking it was the right
ml5 versus something else yep I have a
feeling that wasn't exactly the same
thing as this but yeah there has been
more than one event in the past where it
it seems at least there's a public
perception that at Google is trying to
make things difficult for Microsoft yeah
well that's your question oh are you
looking forward to happy google glass i
will go first because my answer is short
i personally am not even if elaborate on
that little tony chicken do you want to
elaborate on that at all yeah so i am
not that much into wearable technology i
would probably accept and probably use a
SmartWatch regardless of who makes it
samsung pebble apple or somebody else
but wearing glasses with a camera to
which I would talk to take a picture and
know that that's just not me it's not my
style so it's it's not it does not fit
my personality you guys are me I don't I
don't mind the look of the thing i mean
it's its scientific and you know sci fi
locate another but she looks like it's
about what it offers or what what I
don't need right it's like right now
we're not walking around doing augmented
reality with our phones
all the time we're not I mean it seems
like we're taking pictures of everything
but it's not it's a not a constant thing
like glass does and so I'm also not that
excited about it i like that someone's
doing it as far as what features it
offers it doesn't seem worth fifteen
hundred dollars yeah by a long shot one
last question of what do you think about
the bleep blackberry procedure available
on android and iOS IP blackberry
messenger is the main selling point for
blackberry because it in a particular
country like Nigeria and our magic heart
cuts blackberry is really really really
well due to blackberry center so if
correct me if I if I misunderstood the
question is blackberry versus Android
iOS and Windows Phone and their main
markets a blackberry messenger going
Stephen you wanna go first or I'm i'll
be honest i don't get blackberry
messenger I understand what it does and
I see some of the appeal there like the
ability to to know when messages have
gone through that's great but if not
very bid they back themselves into a
corner here locking it in and that was
cool when they had a market share to do
it and like I said there are still these
regions where blackberry does have a
sizable market share so into when I said
I can see this in this willingness to
open up at this point as blackberry
trying to try to integrate this you know
the closeted position would be the large
or smartphone ecosystem but it also
feels a little bit like admitting defeat
like blackberry is no longer big enough
to keep this train moving on its own it
could be the beginning of the end for
blackberry messenger and people are
using you know whats app and all this
stuff to communicate now and I feel like
it's it's boat has sailed I agree I mean
I had lots of friends and colleagues and
co-workers on BBM and usually companies
went for blackberry because of carriers
supporting blackberry at good price
points and there was awesome VES and
the other IT department implementations
but right now at least part of Europe I
see facebook Messenger I see whats app I
see skype and probably one other
solution which is not BBM for instant
communication plus in this part of
Europe SMS is still a huge thing yeah I
mean in a certain countries of
blackberry messenger is the main way to
communicate with their friends I have a
friend of mine in Oh contact blackberry
nation Indonesia is in that country
everybody use blackberry so yeah don't
get me wrong and in countries like
Indonesia or or even India where
blackberry is still a huge thing that's
that's a good thing that they have
blackberry messenger on blackberry and
they have it now open or they will have
it open on Android and other platforms
but that's the exception as far as I'm
concerned i mean if i take the world and
I say okay the world doesn't care about
BBM but Indonesia and India desk here
that those are the exceptions for me
even if India is one of the biggest if
not the third item biggest mobile market
and on this planet yeah it can be the
semester before blackberry because in
those emerging markets like maybe saying
here's the main selling point that's
awful though the base of platform around
the selling point is just a messaging
app that's like admitting defeat yeah
the yeah I think it means that that very
is confident enough with its blackberry
10 so yeah they are not just relying on
blackberry center they're going to show
the world that they can compete with
Android and iOS its bb10 that's the
interesting perspective I think we're
going to get a lot of answers to the
success of blackberry 10 over the next
few months now the q10 is finally out in
some markets it sort of feels like the
complete blackberry 10 package has
arrived
so this is the time for us to find out
is is this going to be enough and if you
know by the end of the year things
aren't looking up will probably be
writing our new 2013 prediction yet
lists with another one another look at
Ellis last year's that wasn't it was a
black hurry I think it was two or three
years in a row but it has survived for
its credit bid it did against a lot
Nicholas if if you have any final
thoughts or any final questions for for
anybody yeah when you will be reviewing
the google glass I'm looking forward to
it if I will have any word in this it
will be never but again I have at least
so anyways it's not all coming down to
only my opinion we have a voting system
and if I'm downloaded then will we will
review it but it is not a mobile device
per se it is not a major scope of our
coverage we cover smartphones and
tablets now if you can consider us as
either smartphone or tablet we might I
do not steven is disagreeing so please
do I can see how you in stretches just
far enough to fit in our constraints I
mean it runs Android it is a mobile
device if not a traditional form factor
I don't know with even do you remember
that certain team web email which we
sent back and forth I think one year ago
or maybe 16 months ago that bucket now
we'll never cover devices with with 5
inch plus screens hello quickly things
change yeah so but I don't know I I am
NOT into google glass and I don't really
see the need for us as a mobile website
to review with other sites and gadget
the verge they cover everything from
from coffee grinders to two cars they
might review that but we are
specifically only covering smartphones
and tablets
yeah I'm one last question Leslie this
last long because we have to move on
okay okay is where she keyboard a
portion for a physical keyboard not
anymore I am a convert I used to be a
big party man but this the jellybean
keyboard is so nice just sliding around
I totally not missing and not only that
I mean iOS does a great job windows
phone does a great job II stock android
keyboard doesn't great job there are of
course within Android some keyboards
which are worse than others but as a
general idea I do not miss the qwerty
keyboard even if it makes me feel old
and the stellar but that's it I do wish
that there were more options right out
there because I understand there will be
people who do like it and especially in
Android land there's are just not that
many good bones especially my
blackberry's he's bad all rolling
Nicholas I'm going to lock my camera on
you so that people can see where they
can reach you on Twitter YouTube and
Google+ and with this I'm going to thank
you very much for joining us yeah you
can find me on google+ at t-plus the tos
last week last Oliver and then you can
find me on youtube oh I play youtube
channel that is T ACH p I a PLA and I'm
also writing an article or Detroit in
fact com that's your article awesome
thank you very much for joining us have
a great weekend and before I hand it
over to Steven there's a question for me
Anton and this is also going out to you
Steven ok Anton honestly speaking shall
i buy the Lumia 925 or wait for the EOS
by the way i'm using lumia 920 so is it
worth to buy the Lumia 925 now if you
have watched the video i have uploaded
to YouTube well being in London at the
event I had this exact question in mind
why should somebody by the 925 when they
have the nine
money or the 928 and nakia made it very
clear that the 925 has not only a
different lens structure with a 66 lens
but they also have some software tweaks
in addition to some camera applications
which by the way will come to the 920
line now strictly to your question
should you buy the 925 having the 920 no
should you wait for the EOS now the EOS
is a dream phone it's what we call the
leaf I don't know how to say this in
English anyways it's it's what she it's
it's your uber phone it's what she
dreamed for having if it will happen by
the EOS I will Steven please I'm pretty
much doing a mirror Tony's response
there if you have a 920 there's no good
reason to upgrade 925 I mean if it looks
cooler it has these better camera
features but it's just so closed what
you already have these the improvements
do not seem worth the expense the u.s.
in the other hand it could be this hero
phone the windows phone to end all
windows phones for the conceivable
future if you can wait for it you know
give it a month see if it comes out we
still don't know if this is a week away
or six months away so we give it a wait
and see sort of attitude i would say
okay and with that i'm gonna hand it
over to Steven for I think the last goal
of tonight I'm a deeply sorry I'm sorry
I I see some of you waving to get my
attention but zodi arc Fang has the
coolest name I've ever heard so d arc is
that's not your real name is it no it's
not man you tube cuz that would have
been the best name I ever it's still
very cool because it would have been
cool with your parents had thought that
was cool anywho where are you located
I'm UK in the moment in the UK ok and I
would even talk to us about today well I
read a few articles today I don't know
even if you've seen them but one of them
was that the rumor about the HTC One
getting a google edition yeah I hope is
that we not only read them we have
actually posted them it's it's this guy
who posted about it all right and but my
question is um do you think we have the
possibility that the HTC might maybe the
next Nexus oh I can go first yeah please
so the possibility is there what it
happen no and this is what I personally
think if you come to look at google's
support for oems we had to HTC devices
at the beginning we had to Samsung
devices following up and we are at the
1st LG device so normally it would
either be the second LG device or if if
you are listening to the rumors maybe
the new acquisition immoral otherwise
the reason I actually because i read
somewhere that i don't know who said it
within google but but the the idea of
the nexus was to bring the best hardware
and couple it with the best software and
now as far as I understand the HTC One
at the moment is the best hardware phone
connect a lot of us agree though making
a nexus version of it would make sense
you know when it would make sense now
with all the rumors of HTC going down
and it's not about fanboyism or or media
interpreting things differently it's
about just looking at the facts HTC
stocks are going down since 16 months or
so so if Google would had an interest in
saving HTC as including at the bigger
picture they would probably offer
support for HTC and having a next Google
Nexus but I don't see that happening now
at this release cycle
I'm not sure that having a Nexus device
would necessarily save the company I
mean yeah it would get them some better
brand recognition but if if they do
another you know Nexus 4 here I have the
feeling that you know they're gonna be
an HTC would sell the phone at cost to
Google who would then give it
practically a cost to us they're not
going to see a ton of money from a Nexus
device here I mean and let size that the
nexus devices don't sell volumes yeah
there's no you know sales through
carriers generally we're just not it's
not gonna be like another one or
something it'll just be a hundred to a
hundred thousand millions of sales with
maybe not tens of millions also I'm not
sure I agree with Tony about that
pattern we've been seeing with Nexus
phones i mean it's there i'm not
convinced that just because LG had did
one they're going to do the next one as
well it very well could be um I guess
don't think that Google would go back to
HTC just because it already dealt with
it it feels like it's moved on I'm not
sure if that means we're gonna see LG
next door I got to admit my vets
probably on motorola raising its it's a
visibility in the nexus in this google x
field of becoming the google phone of
choice is there snow besides what you
said about nexus phones being the best
of the best I don't think HTC really
enters into Google's your consideration
at this point it's a good phone it's a
good phone but there's going to be
better phones and a couple months from
now and you know the one star is going
to get a little bit different yeah I
love you with that point now the other
thing I have them spotted is that well
it's reported that Android 4.3 has been
spotted on an actual device yeah and
it's bringing from what I understand
it's bringing new camera software well
that's always really just yeah we have
not seen much of this and we've heard
all about these new google services but
as far as what specific features we
could hope for and 4.3 we've talked
about no bluetooth or point of the
low-power support and
when we saw these cameras but that's
just scratching the surface here there's
probably a whole lot more going on that
we haven't seen there were only you know
four or five pictures that have come out
of this it was a nexus for that was
spotted a an expo in Thailand and I
didn't post all of them that had surface
but the rest aren't showing anything new
a lot of questions a lot of unknowns but
the question I was going to actually
this is this is something that that you
raised Anton it was about how you said
that Google doesn't have a unified
services platform and what I'm saying
what would it do you think that you've a
4.3 or five point O might bring that to
the table it might bring a unified
services platform so everybody gets the
same thing at the same time and it
becomes available no matter where you
are in the world no and I think that's
never going to happen with Android
because androids policy and and business
model is different say from from iOS
Apple is always in control whether you
having an iphone on AT&amp;amp;T or recently on
t-mobile organ a lot more or anywhere
else on the planet Apple controls the
updates there are no carrier brandings
or no carrier blotter in addition to
this Android is different and grid has a
lot of carrier customization once a new
platform comes out the applications have
to be implemented than field tested then
approved and sent may be back and and
it's it's a backend for so because of
the business model I I don't think that
this is possible at this time with with
a great yeah and Windows Phone Windows
Phone try to Microsoft try to be like
like a combination between Google and
Apple and Microsoft said at one point
that we are controlling the updates and
that that is true Microsoft is is in
control of the switch itself but they
don't flip the switch until they have
confirmation for every from every
carrier across the world that that
app platform that rom version is
available and they don't flip the switch
until until that happens that's fair I
supernatural fan access to me that
that's that's that's my best yeah Steven
do you agree um yeah they really tried
to release give us the impression
they're going to be things differently
but it made the actual implementation
may be different but the end result for
users is more of the same it's it's them
yes because i'm just wondering whether
because a lot a lot of people are saying
obviously because we're going to have
apples of n on the tenth of june and
what I'm just wondering is maybe after
will bring out well it's going to bring
iOS 7 hopeful and on the same day maybe
after the after Apple has an answer
Google will sweep in and say we've
brought em you know unification to our
services anywhere on the world anywhere
they want and they can they have active
you are waiting for that specifically
then mark my words that will not happen
this you know I'm not waiting for that
to specifically but I'm just saying
maybe that's what Google is going to do
something to try and outshine Apple that
is not a spectacular that isn't in the
best I think they're gonna bring
something I'm not gonna say like truly
truly groundbreaking but I think they're
just gonna bring something that takes
the shine out of apples there now that
would certainly explain why we didn't
see anything really uber groundbreaking
at i/o that's an intriguing theory oh
god I was about to say not necessarily
the same day but who knows two three
four weeks after that say if apple says
iOS 7 is here will be available as
usually not with hardware available
today but with software available in
September and then in August Google will
say here's angry five point O with this
this this this and this and it's going
to be available in one week that's what
I mean I'm just I'm just saying maybe
that's what Google is going to do
they're gonna they're gonna try and come
up with something that count
wrecks because we've because a lot of
people are saying iOS 7 is is
make-or-break Apple has to do something
groundbreaking with it and my point is I
think Google has been a come up with
something that's just gonna take that
bit that just take a bit of shine out of
iOS 7 if another google has to sweat it
quite that much I mean yeah iOS 7's
because looks like it's going to be a
really big refresh to the design of the
platform and it could you know dictate
how iphone sales go over the next few
years assuming this is a direction it
continues but Google is doing fine they
do not you know desperately need to
counteract apple's announcement Yuri
they can play it cool I think okay
Steven let's wrap it up um say so so the
