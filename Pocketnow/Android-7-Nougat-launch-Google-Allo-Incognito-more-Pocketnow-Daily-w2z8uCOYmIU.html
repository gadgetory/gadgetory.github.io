and nexus owners rejoice google aloe is
rumored to bring a ton of very
interesting and shady features and
Twitter extends some of its new features
to iOS I'm hi Mary vera and probably the
only thing I can celebrate about monday
is the arrival of new t-shirts this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you found the
one plus three to be great but not as
inexpensive as you wanted it to well the
one plus two is still available on ebay
for two hundred forty dollars and that
continues to be one of our favorite
phones last year so i would highly
suggest you consider the link in the
description other official news have to
do with twitter I wouldn't go crazy over
the fact that there was a night mode for
Android but now it's available on iOS
and everybody's going crazy about it
obviously the advantage here is that
well you get a dark theme that is not
necessarily just dark for the purpose of
being dark but obviously darker themes
perform better and make it a lot less of
a hassle to your eyes whenever you're
using them during the night hence the
name night mode even though windows 10
mobile hasn't really driven anybody
crazy the last film that we had anything
good to talk about if we could say that
was the HP elite x3 we saw it at mwc in
Barcelona we then waited and waited and
waited this is the first film with a
fingerprint scanner it's also of the
first and a lot of things this phone is
pretty much a no holds bar windows 10
mobile device if you're in the market
prepare those seven hundred and twenty
bucks you can pre-order in the
discussion other great news today come
at the hand of Android 70 nougat that
just reached Nexus devices now it
reached our own Juan Carlos bag no early
so he already published his hands on
video I have this just you watch it
sadly it hasn't reached my Nexus 6p yet
I'm still waiting for that but yeah it
brings all the changes that we wanted
which is rather interesting usually we
have to wait for the next version of
android to launch with hardware which
makes us wonder what's going to happen
with the hardware and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
Google a low usually the
the news if they don't have to do with a
nap especially we talked about it at
Google i/o but this time we've learned
new things apparently there is this new
incognito mode coming it reminds us a
lot of telegram and the fact that you
can expire a conversation but this one
allows you to expire messages no time
stamps will be provided in addition you
can share photos and there is no way to
screenshot them unless you have another
camera it reminds us a lot of snapchat
and given the fact that Instagram just
launched its story services which
competes with snapchat as well it seems
that the whole purpose here is again to
make good competition for the social
network for reasons we're trying to
really understand which leads me to the
question of the day would Google aloe
and Instagram stories move you away from
services like snapchat in my case it
kind of has I was struggling to use
snapchat and then the fact that the
Instagram stories came along just made
me even considered twice but we would
love to know your opinion in the
comments down below how important is
snapchat to you there's a fly flying
around that I wish I could kill let's
see if I can because if not it's gonna
drive me nuts got it flies in the united
states i left the third world country to
not be bothered by flies how the hell
did that then get in here friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
