hey everyone Daniel Webster here at
pacquiao calm and today I'm going to
show you a new web browser for windows
mobile devices and the program is called
ucweb and not much has been talked about
this program but after playing around
with it I can say that it works rather
well the browser is somewhere in between
opera 9.5 and sky fire it has the
stability and similar zoom style of
upper 9.5 but it does lack the flash
integration which is what makes skyfire
so useful so if we click on the search
it will default to Google which is kind
of nice we can search on one of our
recently found searches will just click
search here and I'll load in a second
and it's actually pretty fast to load
and it does use flick scroll which is
nice and with us click on with the web
pages and the only downside about this
program is that it defaults to the
mobile browser which is kind of annoying
but it's okay because it works a lot
better than pocket Internet Explorer
another cool feature about this is we
can just slide back from page to page if
we want to go back and it'll take us to
our home page you can also enter an
address in the address bar and we can
pick any of our previously viewed
address in our history so if we want to
go to Google can just go there and will
give us many different selections for
Google just to enter and it'll take us
to google and I can all sit at the
classic and will take us to classic but
it doesn't really look like a classic
Google until we go down here to settings
and browser mode we can it soom and will
take us to what looks almost like a
skyfire interface we can just select
this and will doom into what we want to
search for and it gives us a big huge
area to search so if we want to search
for something like let's say pizza ok ok
I'm feeling lucky and it will take us to
it took us to Domino's mobile that's
interesting and we can just go back and
from here we can also go to our
favorites this is pretty neat because
you can actually import all of your
internet explorer favorites which I've
already done so and you can move them up
and down the only downside is that you
cannot delete the UC web official forum
which is kind of annoying so if one to
go to manage it doesn't allow us to
delete that so that's kind of a bummer
but anyways so if you click on this
little house it brings us back to our
home page and the neat thing about this
is it has these categories and they're
actually pretty useful websites some of
them are a lot better than others but I
use some of them pretty regularly so the
best feature about this program of posts
like opera 9.5 is it gives us many
different windows that we can open we
can open many of them as you can see
just one after another and it does have
security so you can also go to websites
that require certain security enabled
applications like PayPal or your bank so
as you can see here we're on paypal
another cool feature is we can just
flick back from to our home page from
this page that we're over here so the
best feature about this program about
this browser is actually the settings
because you can change so much in the
settings you can change your font size
you can change your font style your page
subsection your text size it allows you
to do a lot in the settings so that
that's probably the best feature about
this browser and we'll just met hit menu
and save save all those another cool
feature about this is it gives you under
settings you can actually pick a skin so
if you wanted to pink or whatever color
you prefer black whichever color there's
not too many but it is pretty neat you
can also pick one for night which is
kind of nice because if you're in the
car or something as a passenger of
course because you want to do this while
you're driving vited it you wouldn't
distract your your your driver so that's
pretty nice so the program is free and
i'll post a link in paki com where you
can get this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
