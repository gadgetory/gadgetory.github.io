without looking at your phone or even
touching it this is adam lane for pocket
now and i'm going to show you how to do
that on Windows Phone 8 ok so first off
i'm going to show you the app that I'm
going to use it's called Metro talk this
is Metro tech version 3.1 it's a little
update that is coming soon if you don't
see it already and I go into these
settings there's new option called voice
commands you have to go here after you
log into the app with your google voice
account and you got to turn on the voice
commands I already have it turned on us
and that's going to verify and what this
does is it looks with your contacts and
then creates its own little database to
make voice commands work more easily and
so I just you just have to turn it on
and it looks at the context sets
everything up so now let's just get out
of here I'll go to something else and I
got my Bluetooth button so I'm going to
press that and we'll show you how it
works Metro talk text eric schmidt
texting eric schmidt
Metro talk is awesome
heard you say metro talk is awesome you
can say send try again or cancel send
so there you go it's just sent a text
message using google voice now let's get
out of here again and we'll do a phone
call you'll notice that I have to say
the name of the app first in order for
the integrated speech you I to know
which app I want to use so let's do it
again Metro talk call Eric Schmidt how I
Eric Schmidt so that's going to launch
metro talk and here's where it kind of
breaks down a little bit windows phone
doesn't really allow third-party apps to
go making phone calls by themselves so
this is a little confirmation so I
really I have to go and look at the
screen and press the call button that's
kind of good because I don't really want
third party apps to do things that I
don't know about but it's kind of bad
because now I have to press a button one
more time let's press the Bluetooth
button and now i'm going to show you the
help so this is our integrated speech
you I if I go to apps we see some of the
apps that have speech commands and I'm
going to go metro talk and we could see
what the options are for voice
recognition now since I have google
voice setup to do forwarding call
incoming calls and text messages to my
regular cell phone number those will
also be read aloud because I have these
speech interface on Windows Phone 8 and
that is right here so when I have this
on incoming text messages will also be
read aloud and I can say reply and
use my voice recognition to reply to
those text messages and they'll also go
through google voice if they came from
google looks so you can have a google
voice instant messaging text messaging
conversation pretty easily without
touching the phone that's a quick look
at the metro talk voice command and
speech you I integration it's a pretty
nice that's coming in Metro talk version
3.1 should be released pretty soon be
sure to click the like button for this
video and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
