Note edge and you're trying to make some
sense out of that crazy strip of pixels
lighting up the side you my edgy friend
have come to the right place I'm Michael
Fisher and this is your edge screen
lesson from pocket now if you've seen
our Galaxy Note 4 versus Note edge
comparison video lots of this will seem
like a rehash if you don't know what I'm
talking about and wish I'd just get on
with it
okay then here goes even though the edge
display is integrated into the phone's
main panel the software treats it as
though it's an independent screen that
makes the edge a lot like 2011's Samsung
continuum but here the added display is
much more capable even when the main
screen is turned off one of the smallest
and also most useful enhancements is the
night clock when it's turned on the edge
screen will show date time and current
weather conditions at the lowest
brightness setting so dim it won't keep
you up at night if you leave the phone
on a bed stand to turn this on you use
the settings screen that we're going to
come back to a lot just flick up from
the bottom of the landing strip to
reveal the settings cog tap on it and
select night clock you can set the start
and end time so it only comes on during
sleeping hours and it won't work when
the battery is below 15% which is smart
sadly as a press time there's no way to
keep it on constantly when the screen is
on but the phone is locked the edge
display shows the express me panel a
customizable side screen that lets you
make the note edge your own through a
bit of digital flair to customise it
tap the express me option in the
settings menu and choose one of the
panels since the out-of-the-box default
phrase is pretty dry you can change it
up by tapping the pencil icon and
replacing the text you can even replace
it with handwriting change the animation
style layer to top it if a slogan is not
your style choose the stock animation or
any image on the phone to put in its
place
including photos you've taken yourself
the selection window shows you which
areas of the photo will be included on
the edge display and pro tip the express
may screen Scrolls as you tilt the phone
for an added touch of
fun keep in mind that the Express made
text is different from what Samsung
calls the personal message the Express
me text shows up when the phone is
locked and the personal message always
shows up when the edge display is on lit
so to change the text select personal
message from the settings menu and edit
accordingly sadly there doesn't seem to
be a way to change the typeface at this
time in regular unlocked usage the edge
screen transforms from ornament to
utility all the folders and icons you'd
normally put on the home screen can go
here instead freeing up slots for
widgets or just wide open space to keep
your wallpaper less crowded managing
what you want on the edge screen is a
little more involved than just dragging
icons there though instead we've got to
visit our old friend the settings
hamburger and hit manage panels this
time this lets you select which ones you
want available you can choose up to
seven and you can arrange them in
whatever order you want using the
overflow menu up top the favorites panel
is the first one by default and you
decide which apps you want on it by
hitting the Edit pencil and moving apps
from there it's a little cumbersome but
stick with it and soon you'll have a
nice collection of favorite apps to jump
to at the touch of a thumb in the future
if you want to edit these it's a little
simpler just hit the star button at the
top of the favorites panel the edge
screen normally hides itself if you're
inside an app but it's always just a
flick of a thumb away and keep on
flicking to see the other panels you've
selected some like the Yahoo News and
Twitter tickers let you pull down to
refresh headlines most let you tap on an
icon at the top to take you to the
full-screen version of the app and
getting more panels is simple just go to
the settings cog again select manage
panels and scroll all the way over to
the right to download more from the
galaxy app store if you get tired of any
one panel the uninstall option is in the
overflow menu above all the swiping and
scrolling here might distract you from
the pull tab up top but don't forget
about it because it can make your life a
lot easier if you need to find a
flashlight in the dark same goes if you
need a timer stopwatch or voice recorder
quickly and there's even a ruler with
inches and centimeters these quick tools
aren't editable at this time but they
are simple to use
and really handy once you train yourself
to remember that they're getting back to
the shortcuts panel just takes a simple
X tap and clearing the quick tools is
just an up swipe away for all the things
you can do with the edge display
sometimes it's best colors shine when
it's doing stuff for you phone calls on
the Note edge for example don't
interrupt a game or video as they do on
the note 4 they come in via the edge
screen so you can dismiss them without
leaving the action similarly when you're
playing music or a podcast you can
control play pause and track skipping
from the edge without leaving what
you're doing it's similar to the
functionality already built into Android
notification shade but it's got a little
more room to spread out on the edge
screen if you want to choose what
notifications are shown on the edge you
just head on in to manage panels again
and hit the Edit pencil on the briefing
panel it's not labeled but it's the one
with the example notifications on it
finally there's the option to flip the
screen 180 degrees though this is in the
edge screen settings it actually applies
to the whole display enable it and now
you can flip the phone on its head to
get the full edge screen experience even
if you're a lefty it looks pretty silly
but it works just as well in this
orientation and some South paws will
doubtless appreciate it really it's just
nice to see Samsung thinking about this
stuff the attention to detail that led
to the creation of this option also
touches most aspects of the edge screen
so if there's a setting you want changed
dig deep into the options menu and it's
probably there and let us know what tips
and tricks you've picked up down in the
comments below as for how useful some of
this stuff is well check out our full
