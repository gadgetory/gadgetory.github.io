at the American variant of the Samsung
Galaxy s4 at pocket now this week it is
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
quad-core processor but something else
just showed up at the Boston offices of
pocket now replete with a very
intimidating looking warning label
within this box is an eight-core
smartphone specifically the Samsung
Galaxy s4 with an octa-core processor so
we thought to close out the week it
would be a good idea to pop open this
box then open the box inside that box
and show you that eight core smart phone
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
let's take a look inside the box so one
of the nice things about getting the
American versions of the Galaxy s4 with
that we got them a bit early one of the
unfortunate disadvantages of that was
that we didn't get any retail packaging
because we got them so early so first of
all thanks to Samsung for getting us
those American variants early and thanks
also to Integra electronics for shipping
us this international version hopefully
with retail packaging yes indeed ok so
getting a little closer into the box you
can see this kind of faux wood grain on
the on the cardboard here oh that's kind
of an interesting choice I guess it's
I'm not exactly sure what's what's
motivating that since Samsung has not
been pushing the Polish Riverstone theme
that they started with the Galaxy s3
this time around but in any case it's a
nice looking box the presentation is
certainly enjoyable it's interesting not
sure if this is intentional but it is it
does have a separation here you can see
it doesn't doesn't really close all the
way but that's that's kind of cool if
that is intentional we like that so
let's go ahead and pop it open here
using the sticker as a hinge and there
is our device front and center just the
way we like it with a sticker calling
out its features right on the front so
let's see if we can get the device out
of here I'm gonna put this aside for one
second now some of you have asked us to
give a little more attention to what is
actually inside the box rather than just
immediately tossing it aside and since
this unboxing is closing out our week
and we have a little bit of time
because we're not exactly the first to
do this unboxing no why don't we do that
this is a Samsung handbook this is a
Samsung manual QuickStart guide and a
QuickStart guide in another language
we're not gonna flip through those books
because that would take a while and also
not a lot of people read the manual
maybe that'll be a feature in the future
headphones here one of the things I
wanted to talk about and which I think I
called out in the full review is that
these have been redesigned somewhat you
can see it's more like a linguini noodle
than a spaghetti noodle on the previous
set of Samsung gear buds that came with
the Galaxy s3 and the American versions
of the galaxy note 2 and also the
buttons on the throat controller here
have been enlarged and a bit and very
nice the corners here have been rounded
so that when it gets hung up on your
collar maybe it won't stick as badly
that will be very nice typical ear buds
here that's exactly the way they look if
you like those they go right into your
brain shut out all outside noise but
don't chew any chips while you have them
on or you will blow out an ear drum
probably a citation needed USB cable in
white despite our midnight black phone
here's our Samsung battery Samuel AM
power as on the American unit 2600
milliamp hours and us a power adapter
there what else is in here anything yes
extra buds for when you get wax all over
the included set it feels like I haven't
gotten to do this in a while one of my
favorite parts of any unboxing the film
peel let's go ahead and take this right
off oh yeah definitely nudged the mic
there but hopefully you got a little
sense of that that beautiful sound let's
try that again one more time on the back
we get to do yes that is the sound of
money well spent hopefully if you if you
bought this phone and you you really
wanted it and while we've popped the
battery into the unit I will reiterate
that the primary difference here is that
eight core process for that
headline-grabbing Exynos 5 octa core
running at I believe 1.6 gigahertz if my
cheat sheet is not lying to me
and there's our initial power on
the led the reformulated Samsung boot
jingle oh that's very nice no carrier
splash screen because this is the
unlocked global variant and we are
prompted immediately to enter our
preferred language and start the setup
process so with the display is powered
off here you can tell it is very very
difficult to tell the difference between
the international and the American
version of the Samsung Galaxy s4 the
principle difference being one is
emblazoned galaxy s4 the other
completely naked down below with only
the Samsung branding on the back
presumably you are supposed to know what
phone you're looking at and to close out
this unboxing we're just going to go
ahead and do a boot time comparison
because of the carrier splash screen on
the Sprint side just for people who like
to know how long they have to wait for
their phones to boot so three two one
press and hold on the power button on
each we have buzz on the left and no
buzz on the right GTI 9500 the model
number on our global unit there for
anybody curious about that Samsung
animation and music starting on the
right and we'll get some Sprint action
on the left here I predict shortly I
think this is going to be yeah not much
of a contest even though we haven't set
up the international version yet we're
already ready to go here we're still
learning what carriers on the left we're
gonna have a whole lot more coverage on
the octa-core version of the galaxy s4
at pocket now next week so make sure and
stay tuned for that and if you missed
our American galaxy s4 coverage this
week make sure and check that out both
here on YouTube and at pocketnow.com
folks as I mentioned we have no shortage
of additional coverage on the galaxy s4
already up at pocket now and coming in
the weeks ahead so follow us on social
media so you don't miss any of that make
sure and leave us a like here if you
enjoyed the video drop a comment down
below if you have something to say and
thank you for watching we'll see you
next week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
