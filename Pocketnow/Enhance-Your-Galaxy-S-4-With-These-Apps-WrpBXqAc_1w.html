which you can get just a little bit more
out of it I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and these are a few apps to help enhance
your experience with a samsung galaxy s4
the samsung galaxy s4 is finally
available and we've reviewed it twice
looking at it from every possible angle
the verdict was very much the same both
times it's a fantastic phone with very
few compromises
however the software while boasting many
unique and useful features is also one
of the few aspects of the s4 that can
actually negatively affect the
performance and user friendliness of the
phone and while it may seem Samsung left
no stone unturned the company did leave
out some much needed functionality
thanks to a few applications and
services you can greatly enhance your
experience for the s4 in no time one of
the features Samsung introduced last
year with the Galaxy s3 is s-voice it
was meant to rival Apple's voice
controlled assistant Siri and Google's
own automated digital assistant service
Google now but the initial take on s
voice was that it really wasn't much of
a match for either no less the service
remains and believe it or not it
negatively affects the responsiveness of
the software it's turned on by default
and accessed by double pressing the home
button this means when you press the
home button once the system doesn't
immediately jump back home it pauses and
waits to make sure you're not trying to
double press the button if you never use
s voice it's wise to disable it this is
done by opening s voice pressing menu
selecting settings and unchecking open
via the HOME key this eliminates the
hesitation after a HOME key press but
there's no reason a double press of the
physical home button should not still be
useful by downloading an application
called home - you can set Google search
or any application of your choosing to
open with a home key double press
download the free application and open
it set the desired application as a
start application in step one in step
two choose the double press interval and
for step three choose the actual
launcher you intend to use press the
HOME key set home 2 as the default
launcher and you're all set so for it is
worked flawlessly for us and we're
loving the hardware integration with
Google now
the Galaxy s4 comes with Dropbox sync
enabled out-of-the-box but how can you
make the most of Dropbox a seemingly
basic cloud storage service we use
Dropbox day in and day out and primarily
we use it to transfer pictures and other
files between multiple devices or even
multiple Dropbox users one of the most
important functions of the camera backup
though is the ability to almost
instantly access pictures taken from
another device without ever having to
lift a finger
enable camera upload in Dropbox settings
set it to upload over Wi-Fi only or also
over cellular data and take a couple
pictures if you have a tablet another
phone or a laptop nearby those pictures
will be available in no time from the
other devices this doesn't take rocket
science to figure out but it's an
irreplaceable feature of Dropbox on
virtually any mobile device Samsung is
renowned for always fitting its mobile
devices with notification LEDs this time
around Sammy added some control over set
LEDs and the Settings app but the
options for the user can do with the
notification lights or paltry compared
to some third-party applications such as
light flow priced at 249 light flow may
seem a bit pricey for nothing more than
adjusting the color or frequency of the
notification light but it's definitely a
neat tool that can greatly expand the
usefulness of the blinking LED for
example out of the box the colors are
limited and preset meaning you have to
learn through trial and error what each
color means with light flow you can set
each different notification to a
separate color so that you know what
type of notifications you have missed
without ever turning on the display this
one takes a bit of setting up as the
settings are seemingly endless but once
you get it just right is extremely
gratifying
a feature of the stock touch with
keyboard that gained some attention
after the announcement was Samsung's
choice to use the Swift key flow
technology sounds great right trust us
when we say that the TouchWiz keyboard
is nothing like Swift key even after
learning from Facebook Twitter Gmail and
other sources the prediction software
simply does not work as well as Swift
Keys native predictions the keyboard on
the s4 is arguably one of the most
frustrating soft keyboard experiences in
recent memory we suggest either picking
up the original SwiftKey keyboard from
play for 399 or giving the latest
non-beta swipe a chance for only 99
cents we've taken a keen liking to both
over the last few months
with Android 4.2 onboard the Galaxy s4
comes with the lockscreen widget
functionality this is probably the most
sock-like feature in the latest version
of TouchWiz the only difference is
Samsung included shortcuts to five of
your favorite applications at the bottom
of the lockscreen
we're not complaining but the standard
set of lock screen widgets are pretty
useless and drab if you're looking for a
plain and simple lockscreen widget that
packs a ton of information such as
missed calls I am text messages weather
information battery info calendar
appointments and lots more on your
lockscreen in a single widget we
definitely recommend downloading - clog
it's free and made by one of Google's
own best of all many applications come
with dashclock extensions built in and
dozens of other extensions are available
in the Play Store
lastly if you're already growing tired
of the cumbersome home screen and App
Store experience offered by TouchWiz you
might want to try downloading a launcher
replacement application Nova Launcher
offers a strikingly stock like
experience for free so if you want to
extend it functionality you may consider
paying four dollars for the prime
version a holo istic launcher we've
grown very fond of lately is action
launcher Pro the developer has taken a
new approach on the Android home screen
with shutters or widgets that are
accessed by an upwards gesture with your
finger over the app and covers which are
folders disguised as a single app icon
the application drawer couldn't be any
more simple either as it's an
alphabetical list of all apps on the
device that is opened by pulling the
leftmost home screen to the right that's
going to do it for this video so if you
enjoyed it and found it helpful be sure
to give it a thumbs up below and
