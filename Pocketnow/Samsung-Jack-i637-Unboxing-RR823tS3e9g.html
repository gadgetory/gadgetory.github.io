Daniel Webster here at packing.com if
you've recently seen the advertisements
with Ozzy Osbourne fiddling around with
his new personal assistant you have
probably heard about this device and
today we're going to do the unboxing of
the Samsung jack the successor to the
Black Jack in Black Jack - okay so we're
just gonna open up the box here that
looks pretty pretty generic for some
reason it was already open and it's the
eye
6:37 and it's just a the same AT&amp;amp;T
Samsung box that comes with most devices
so just open it up here we've got some
documentation that's a getting started
guide got it getting started CD looks
like we have some cert information in
separate languages looks like Spanish
and the coupon here it's pretty neat 50
free songs let's see here health and
safety information what's that huh I
guess there's no new warnings with a
cell phone elbow and all that great
stuff and parental controls for Medianet
great so just can move the device over
for a second we have the standard
charger with proprietary Jack we have a
USB connector with also a proprietary
Jack of course and that's one
unfortunate thing about the Samsung
products we also have an adapter with a
proprietary jack to a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so the battery for the
device is at fourteen hundred and eighty
milliamp hour battery so that's a pretty
big battery for a device like this
samsung say it states that it'll you can
talk for seven hours and have 12 days of
standby time with the battery the size
and now on to the device
so the first thing you'll notice is that
the Samsung jack is very shiny like many
devices that have come out in North
America this one is is quite shiny and
as you can see it's very fingerprint
prone so that's kind of a downside but
it is a very sleek and light device it
only measures out to four point four
inches long and two point four inches
wide and about a half an inch thick and
it only weighs about three point six
ounces so that's great it's very small I
could I could see myself carrying this
in my pocket without any trouble and
this is a windows mobile 6.1 standard
edition and there's not too many windows
mobile 6.1 standard editions that have a
Wi-Fi and this is one of those devices
that does it also has a tri-band hsdpa
at 850 1921 banned so this will work of
course on AT&amp;amp;T 3G network
the device has a 528 megahertz processor
but we'll go into hardware later let's
just compare it to some of the other
devices out there and this so if we
compare this device to the original
samsung black jack
we can see that it's a little bit
shorter about two millimeters shorter
than the samsung black jack and the jack
is also a little bit thinner as well as
being much more sleek the keyboard on
the other hand of course the Samsung
Black Jack the original one had these
oval-shaped keys and they were pretty
cumbersome to type with the square keys
with the offset is sort of a smiley face
design is a little bit easier to type
with almost like the Motorola q9 the
d-pad of course is different that's
opposed to a circular hue a d-pad this
one has a square v directional d-pad
compared to some other objects i've got
a credit card sight type object here as
you can see it's a little bit taller
than a credit card size object if we
compare it to a euro it's about the same
size as euro a little bit taller than a
little bit shorter than a euro and of
course on american US dollar it's much
shorter about an inch and a half shorter
than a US dollar but about the same
width so this is a samsung jack follow
us on twitter at
poking out tweets for up-to-the-minute
news and stay tuned for the hardware and
software tours coming soon thanks for
