improvements for the upcoming Galaxy
fold which still has no launch date no
renders hint to some colors we should
expect for the 2019 iPhone 11 ours and
the Sony Xperia 1 isn't available in the
market yet but we already got renders of
the experience who I'm hi Matt Rivera
and the man that after-party at one-plus
yesterday that was that was crazy but
the event was really good this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you've seen
Amazon suit for those we'll be looking
for a good deal on refurbished products
we continue with Apple products five
hundred and $20 off refurbished MacBook
Pros obviously it depends on whichever
variant you're looking for the link in
the description you can learn more there
definitely something I should consider
now let's talk about the BJ ossible
action which I have right here we've had
it for a couple of days actually if you
saw my recent video from Google i/o most
of it was filmed with this little camera
expect our full first impressions coming
very soon so far I have to tell you this
much I mean we've got a good 12
megapixel camera 4k at 60 but one of my
biggest complaints with action cams is
to things that are soft by this camera
the first one being that you have a
front-facing display for you in the
second audio audio you can't really tell
when I was using the action cam during
that Google i/o video if you haven't
watched that video it's in the link in
the description as well I highly
recommend it for its price obviously
I'll give you more of my first
impressions in the video soon now let's
move the spotlight over to Sony and the
Xperia - we still don't have the
experience
I actually can't wait to get my hands on
when we've got some leaked renders of
what to expect from the design of the -
with a qualcomm snapdragon 855 6 gigs of
ram and apparently that whole concept of
that 21 by 9 display it seems that
there's also an experience I had it
touched the xperia 10 other than my
hands on so yeah stay tuned for that one
as well and how about if we talk about
the iPhone 11 are obviously the selling
point for the iPhone 10 are is different
color options and as it turns out we
have some leaked images that show two
different color options that are coming
apparently there's a lavender option and
there's another one that we're gonna
happily dub more green not really a fan
of reading colors but yeah more on you
know Avengers is yeah we're gonna leave
it there
point is it seems that there are new
colors coming I wonder I mean
why green and lavender we'll see and
finally the hottest news today I have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy fold we have
an update but it's actually a report not
really official two things the first one
is that there are reports that the new
variant with the updated changes is
already being tested in Korea which is
great it's already being tested by
carriers that's a whole different
process but then the second part is what
things were changed apparently two
things one is that the hinge now has
something covering the gap in order to
not allow any lint to go into it and
then the second thing is that the screen
protector is apparently going to be
protected by the bezel in order to avoid
the consumers thinking that this is a
screen protector it's actually part of
the display and today's question let us
know I mean do you think that it's
enough or what else do you think Samsung
should do to raise a little bit of the
awareness they want back in the Galaxy
fold cuz in my case I mean if they deal
with the hardware that's great but man
if they would work on the price tag
that'd be even better leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
