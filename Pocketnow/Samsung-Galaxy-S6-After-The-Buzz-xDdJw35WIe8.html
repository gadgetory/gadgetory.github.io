over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's revisit the crown king of Android
phones and see of Aging is also
something it can do well I'm Jaime
Rivera with pocket now this is the
samsung galaxy s6 and here's to another
episode of after the buzz I don't think
there's ever been a more requested
episode of after the buzz than this one
and there are many reasons for that
this was Samsung's first stepping stone
into the new company at wants to be
providing users with a truly great phone
that lives up to all the marketing hype
the result of all this was great in our
review but for any phone at this price
point aging is what you'll mostly care
about as such almost a year later one
feature that's definitely future proof
is this gorgeous display the 5.1 inch
quad HD display continues to be the
standard to beat bettered only by newer
Samsung devices that follow the same
specifications but on different form
factors and then the Gorilla Glass 4
that protects the display also retains
most of its charm
so long as you don't approach it with
warm light because it will reveal some
of the minor scratches of regular use
now what surprises me most is how the
fit and finish of this device has
survived over all this time by now your
average plastic Galaxy S would already
be packed with broken plastic or peeled
chrome edges but the story here is
different
this galaxy s6 has spent time with both
michael fisher and adam doubt before
reaching my hands and most of it still
looks good the 7000 series aluminum was
strong enough to survive a direct drop
into concrete with just the few dings
and say for some scratches at the bottom
back the Gorilla Glass 4 has also held
up well the hardware buttons continue to
be just this clicky
even after so much use something that's
not very common with most smartphones
but then again the scratches that have
marred the camera chamfers in addition
to the plastic peeling of the microUSB
connector at the bottom do point to a
phone that's been tossed around a lot
yes we could have probably saved
ourselves the drama by slapping on a
case but that would completely defeat
the purpose of buying and carrying a
phone this beautiful because let's face
it after all this time this phone is
still gorgeous and still better-looking
than most of the phones that have
launched since then the only thing that
hasn't really changed from the Samsung
of before is its approach the software
never have we seen this company updated
scallop see flagships to the latest
version of android before its successor
launches and that sad story remains here
on the upside this continues to be one
of the best versions of TouchWiz that
we've ever used with various skins that
make it look however you want even if
the theme store hasn't really changed
much after its launch which doesn't
necessarily talk well about it the
annoying gimmicks that plagued the
software continue to be optional and we
do notice that some of the options like
extra camera modes are also available in
the Samsung store and also seem to the
deals included with this device like a
free 2 years of 100 gigabytes of
Microsoft One driver still available
today upon activation at least on this
t-mobile unit which is great
now if you move away from this still
being a lollipop phone it's hard to deny
that this is still a pleasant device to
come back to applications load very
quickly and basic services like the
camera with a double tap on the home
button continue to be just the snappy
even after all the applications that we
currently have loaded the books that
caused applications to crash during our
review period are gone and the RAM
management issues that plaque this
device when it launched have gone away
for the most part Samsung's choice for
internals is also H well given how the
company has chosen to also bring the
same power to its phablets say for some
extra RAM you can totally tell when
playing graphics intensive games the
Exynos 7420 continues to power this
device through the strongest stress
without a problem and we're heating is
still not a common issue overall the
only thing Samsung hasn't really been
able to fix is the terrible battery life
you'll be able to achieve even with
moderate cash through the day we still
haven't managed to go beyond three hours
of screen on time which is rather small
for the device you really don't want to
stop using and even if you would just
leave this device on the table and not
use it much the battery still dips even
on standby no matter if you're using it
on LTE or Wi-Fi and true you do have
fast charging options which do save the
day for the most part but it's still a
shame that this phone cannot be for the
average road warrior now all that being
said a feature that simply hasn't aged
than this phone is its camera Samsung's
Galaxy s6 camera combo has proven to be
so good that all of its successors have
followed and right they should this
phone takes amazing photographs
whether it's during the day or in
low-light scenarios the galaxy s6
continues to impress everyone with its
resulting color saturation in detail
this is also one of the day's best
selfie shooters with its wide-angle lens
in both day and night photo
opportunities even without the selfie
flash and the same experience can also
be noticed when recording video if
you're in the market for a good camera
phone this is still one of the best
choices for you but then again it might
also not be see the galaxy s6 is slated
for a refresh over the next few weeks it
might definitely be a good idea to hold
off until the next Galaxy gets announced
in order to make a choice yes most
rumors point to the successor sharing
almost every aspect of the current model
but it wouldn't be the first time that
Samson completely surprises us at last
minute even so it wouldn't be a bad boo
for Samsung to obtain the galaxy s6 for
another year as the budget option for
the newer model and if that's the case
you might be in for some savings on what
we consider to be one of the best phones
we've tested even after so many months
of use folks are revealed the galaxy s6
and even the galaxy s6 edge continue to
be live and there are more episodes of
after the buzz like this one to come so
