geun-hye calm and today I'm going to
show you mobile manager for Netflix and
what this will allow you to do is update
your netflix account directly from your
windows mobile device so after signing
in you'll come to this home screen and
as you can see there's my cue and search
so we'll go to my cue and these are the
movies that I've selected that will be
delivered to my house so let's say you
don't really want a movie to be
delivered to your house right away so
you can either remove it move it up move
it down or move it to the top so I'm
just going to move this one down so
there we go and let's say not too sure
exactly what the movie is about you can
click on it and get a description and
then actually on the windows mobile
versions opposed to other mobile devices
you can actually watch the preview so
we'll go there and it's pretty fast to
load as you can see so you can also
switch between full screen and this is
during the center of the earth so we'll
just put pause and go back okay and a
cool thing about this is you can just
flick from this movie to the next one so
here's Indiana Jones and you can also
flip back so these are the next movies
in your queue so we'll go back and you
can also go to your instant queue with
these are movies that you can watch
directly on your computer from the
netflix site and the ones that you have
at home so this is the movie that's
already at my place and then you're
saved q i don't have anything in there
right now or am i saved institute
nothing in there also so you can search
here real fast so let's search for oh I
don't know um independence day we'll
just spell it wrong
just to show you exactly how easy it is
to use the search feature and there it
came up so there's independence day okay
and it shows you the cached in the
bottom as well in the director so we can
go back and that is how easy it is to
use the mobile manager for netflix i'm
daniel webster and for pacquiao com
