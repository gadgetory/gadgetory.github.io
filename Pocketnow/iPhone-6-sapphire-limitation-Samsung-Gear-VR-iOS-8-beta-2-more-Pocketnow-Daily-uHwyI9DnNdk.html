fragmentation at launch Samsung's
virtual reality headset has finally
gained an official name it could be that
Nike now decides to throw bone at
Android users I'm high muttering that I
and if the coffee maker knew how
important it was to me it wouldn't have
died just recently this is parking out
daily there's a lot of official stuff
today some of it quite significant like
the launch of iOS 8 beta 2 for
developers obviously it's not public but
uh there are a ton of bugs on beta 1 it
took three weeks for apple to launch it
and as it turns out you're not going to
have crashing issues with third-party
applications and even the settings
application from Apple when resuming
from sleep mode aside from other
different bugs and FaceTime etc the list
is quite big Alexis return for full
details on everything you're getting if
you have a developer account obviously
and speaking of Apple there are some
sapphire limitations apparently the
company will not be able to build the
iphone 6 4.7 inch model with sapphire
apparently you'll get corning glass on
this model and you'll only get it on the
5.5 inch model because it will
apparently be more expensive there's a
lot more yield here but it's a crime
that apparently the company is also
dealing with power issues on the OLED
displays for the iWatch so stay tuned
hopefully they figure it out by q4 now
one of the biggest oddities in the
wearable market is that even though the
Nike FuelBand was probably one of the
most prominent and important products
out there before it was killed it wasn't
available for Android users and it was
just hilarious only iphone users could
take advantage of the product and even
though the FuelBand is now dead by Nike
it is now available for android users
lick to the circus for download you can
now switch to your official android
phone and not worry about your FuelBand
up even though there are some you know
wearable products out there that are far
superior now and speaking of accessories
I know a lot of you were hyped up about
the whole virtual reality headset that
Samsung was building for its galaxy
phones and tablets and we have a name
there is a filing for trademark for
Samsung gear VR and interesting even
though it's called the gear it won't be
running Tizen apparently Samsung is
teaming up with oculus a competitor in
order to use their operating system on
this virtual reality headset which kind
of makes senses and so
did the same with Android and now it's
launching Tyson let's see how that goes
and finally for the very interesting and
kind of disappointing news of the day we
have the Amazon event tomorrow where we
expect a smartphone to be launched
listen to our whole out weekly
from two weeks ago where you can hear
all the details of the ruiers and what
we spotted on the leaks and everything
but as it turns out rumors have been
from the wall street journal that the
amazon is planning to make this
smartphone exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T yeah
apparently it'll be a carrier exclusive
we don't know details just yet obviously
the event will happen tomorrow we'll
cover everything that we get to see your
live whenever we get something
interesting hopefully we will so don't
know exactly what Amazon wants to do
with this whole 3d camera thing but that
leads you to the question of the day how
happy or disappointed are you that
apparently this product will be an
exclusive because in my case of you know
guys there is Verizon there's t-mobile
or sprint amazon really exclusive
products for me are the dumbest thing
you can do on a launch but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is filming tree follow us on
pagano comment subscribe to our youtube
