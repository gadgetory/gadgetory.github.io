laser at the back of the iPhone 8 is now
on rumors we get the possible launch
dates for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and
Amazon is set to do some strong
competition to apples home pop with the
next echo I'm hiding that away meta and
Apple the last thing we need is the next
batch of 3d bathroom selfies this is
pocket out daily the official news today
have to do with deals if you're in the
market for an inexpensive but great
smartphone from last year the Huawei
honor 8 or honor 8 as the company wants
to call it now is one of our favorite
smartphones of last year definitely dual
camera technology beautiful phone and
that 64 gigabyte variant is currently
available at nuoc for just 270 dollars
you can learn more in like a description
now let's talk about silent product
launches if you want to get yourself a
new Samsung Galaxy s8 and you want to
get a new color option that nobody else
has well right now the crawl blue color
is available exclusively at Best Buy for
different US carriers you can learn more
about it in the description but yeah you
get the same Galaxy s8 with that color
that will make you look like you're
using a galaxy note 7 that's awesome now
let's talk about Amazon as we hear some
interesting sources claiming that the
company is working on a brand new Amazon
echo we know that the design of the
original echo is kind of dated and it's
not the best speaker in the world even
though it does an amazing job at
answering to your command relax and
everything but as for audio quality yet
there are some better options out there
and obviously Apple's home pod has
really focused more on audio quality and
audio experience apparently the next
echo is really planning to compete with
Apple that way with audio quality let's
see how that goes is apparently this is
going to launch in the fall before
Apple's home pot launches and how about
if we talk about the Samsung Galaxy Note
8 for those of you wondering exactly
when we're getting the smartphone we're
actually waiting for rumors as to when
the event is going to happen in New York
City right now all we hear is when we
should get it apparently August 27th
will be the launch date for this phone
it kind of doesn't really make sense
because we've got Aoife just you know
pretty fa'sho happens late august so it
kind of doesn't make sense for this
to launch so early and then for us to
have a batch of other phones like the B
30 being announced a couple of days
later but yeah it could just be that
that's the launch date and the event
could happen sometime early or mid
August we will keep you posted as soon
as we learn more and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
iPhone 8 and the fact that apparently 3d
facial recognition is not the only thing
that's coming to this phone in the
front-facing camera or whatever
combination we're getting here
apparently Apple is also adding 3d
spatial lasers to the back and the
purpose of these lasers has everything
to do with augmented reality we saw that
Apple made a big push over what AR is
going to be on the current iPhone it
actually works on existing iPhones but
apparently this will just make the
experience even better with the next
generation iPhone 8 and obviously it'll
do a better job when it comes to
focusing et cetera et cetera as we saw
that LG did in previous G smartphones
and we also saw from HTC the question
really is tell me something are you
willing to use augmented reality for
anything is this something that you're
looking forward to with your purchase of
any smartphone or the next iPhone for
example in my case I like augmented
reality a lot more than I like VR I just
can't wait to find the practical use
that goes beyond Pokemon go leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
