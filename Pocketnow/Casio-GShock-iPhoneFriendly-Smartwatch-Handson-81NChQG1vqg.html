pocketnow.com at CES 2013 we're taking a
look at one of many smartwatches that
are coming onto the scene in this case
it is the casio g-shock it's a Bluetooth
4.0 watch and we're gonna take a look at
it now so right now this works only with
the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4s and it
does a few things it doesn't do that
many things one of the cool things that
it does is that when you get an incoming
call it will tell you who's calling on
your phone you can't take the call from
your phone but it can allow you to kind
of screen calls and you don't have to
take the phone out of your pocket if
it's your mother and you don't want to
talk to her another cool thing that it
does is let's say it's still connected
via bluetooth and you've lost your phone
you don't know where it is maybe it fell
out somewhere in the car you can press
and hold this button here and watch the
screen on the phone it starts making a
sound pretty darn cool another thing
that it does is it automatically sets
the time based on the time on the phone
so in the cases when the time changes
for daylight savings it'll send the time
over which is a nice feature and then
there's another feature when the devices
get further apart let's say someone
might have stolen your phone you'll get
a notification on your watch the other
kind of a nice security feature there so
you may the kind of pretty pretty basic
functionality here that's the cash Casio
g-shock
SmartWatch 180 bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
