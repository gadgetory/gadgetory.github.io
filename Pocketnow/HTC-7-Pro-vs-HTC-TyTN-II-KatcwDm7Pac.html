pocketnow.com we're just gonna do a
quick comparison between the HTC 7 pro
from 2011 and the HTC keizer or also
known as to be tightened to from 2007 so
let's check them out so the Titan 2 from
2007 is the first smartphone with a
slide-out keyboard that tilts the screen
and this one is the latest one so we
have it slightly different here this one
spring loads into the tilting position
but this one does not however it does
have a spring-loaded sliding and let's
just look at the interface a little bit
we're a little bit slow on the rotation
but I can open start menu here's my
recently used tasks so I have a really
fast task switching well theoretically
it'll be fast and we can just scroll
through whatever get to that
and we've also got hardware buttons I
can do shortcut keys so real easy that I
can feel for this button and I know that
would launch my TomTom Maps or I can hit
that one and switch to the music player
really easily
I'll just by feeling the buns so that's
in portrait mode let's go back to the
keyboard and over here you don't really
have shortcuts for anything you got to
touch the screen it and do all your
navigation this way so we got a look at
the screen you know you don't have any
buttons over here nothing over there so
you can't feel any buttons you really
have to look at it to do any interaction
and even then if I'm looking at the
camera screen or you don't see it and
let's go back to keyboard so you're
noticing that the 7 Pro does not rotate
the screen so you you know it's kind of
difficult to use here and on the
keyboard we have arrows but they don't
do anything let's go into maybe email
so I can use the arrows and they still
don't do anything here so I'm now
scrolling you really have to touch the
screen and let's see if we can use the
arrows here yes that's the only place
that they'll work there's also a shift
key but holding it down doesn't let you
select type so not much you can do with
its keyboard even in the programs menu
no no keyboard shortcuts doesn't do
anything really and you got to turn your
head to to read this
search we can type stuff but not really
you have to touch the screen and now you
can type stuff okay now it gives me some
choices and I have some arrows on the
keyboard but if I press the button I
can't choose those those choices you
have to you have to take your hand off
the keyboard and touch the screen so not
really usable let's look at the old one
now so here's our keyboard from four
years ago we have a Start menu okay we
have arrows we have soft keys to access
menus so I could press Start I can use
the arrows I can just type a letter and
go straight to the thing that's
associated with that letter so those
programs I can hit letter M to go to
messaging I can scroll through with the
arrows
lots of stuff I can do here all from the
keyboard and everything is real because
it's oriented horizontally
let's open that one I can get two menus
refresh
up one get back here you can switch the
clock all really easily without moving
my fingers too much see they're all you
know still here just chillin nice
comfortable position for the hands and
really I can do just about anything
email really easy to do everything
without moving too much in a comfortable
position so that's the old Kaiser
compared to the new HTC 7 pro so a lot
of things have changed maybe not for the
better
hopefully we'll see better landscape
keyboards for in Windows Phone 7 that at
some point anyway that's it for now if
