i thought you might be interested to
know this since we do a lot of reviews
and have a lot of review units that we
come in and do we don't want to send
these devices back with all of our
personal information on it so today's
Android quick tip is how do you do a
factory reset on your Android powered
device let's go take a look
all right so this is the HTC Desire HD
which was graciously provided to us to
review by clove technologies out of the
UK we'll give you a link in the article
I'm about to send this device grudgingly
back to them but before I do that I need
to wipe out everything now here's how
you do that you go to your home screen
and you go to menu and settings and then
all the way down here in you might think
it's under security you might think it's
under privacy no generally speaking it's
under SD and phone storage you tap that
and right there you've got factory data
reset touch that it tells you everything
that it will do and more importantly
what it won't do this is not going to
delete any files on your SD card your
music your photos temporary stuff apps
that you've installed there nothing so
your SD card is still going to have
personal information on it you will want
to delete all of that manually and I
would highly recommend that you do that
in a desktop or laptop computer the
current system software and bubble of
applications will will still be there so
it goes back to the stock image but it
is going to get rid of your Google and
other accounts and then any apps that
you have installed to internal storage
so we'll go ahead and reset the phone
and here's the process that does double
check make sure you want to erase
everything what should we do and we get
this little reboot indicator now that's
kind of telling the way that it does a
factory reset is by rebooting the phone
into a modified recovery and it goes
through and wipes all of the partitions
and restores everything in that process
how secure is that I don't know if you
are working for some secret government
agency and want to make sure that all of
your confidential and top-secret
information is cleared off the device
you'll probably want to talk with your
security personnel to make sure that
this is secure enough and they are
likely going to tell you that you need
to run this through some kind of an
industrial grinder to completely
pulverize the device to make sure it is
all secure but I don't know we'll let
our FBI CIA NSA and the other secret
agency individuals respond to that in
the comments below so please do that
come
obviously if you like this kind of video
and like Android quick tips give us a
thumbs up subscribe to our video channel
and I know I normally say all of that at
the end of my videos but I figured I'd
fill some time here because as you can
see we are waiting on the erasure to
happen and this usually takes about the
same amount of time that it takes to
flash a ROM which can see here just
completed now a lot of times the phone
will automatically restart a lot of
times it won't in this case it did it's
going to depend on your device whether
they tell you to automatically reboot
after you've done a reset or not in this
case it is automatically booting back up
and I should be met with the initial
boot sequence but you can see here I am
now this is just the first step next
step that you've got to do is obviously
format all of your information off that
SD card and not that is not going to be
entirely secure so I would recommend if
you're selling your device take out the
SD card
don't hand that off to somebody else in
this case since it's going back to close
technologies I've gone ahead and erased
everything that I've put on the SD card
so it's all nice and and clean for them
when they get it back there's one other
thing to do that you might overlook and
we'll get to that as soon as this boots
up all the way so the device is booted
up I'm going to go ahead and unlock it
and again we're still met with the first
boot experience once we've done that
we're just going to power down the
device and I'll show you the next step
all right now we're met with our
language selector I am just going to
hold the power button press and hold and
it asks me if I want to power off which
I do go ahead and touch that and it will
shut down wait for these lights to turn
off and you should be good now this is
the part people forget take off your
compartment take out your SD card now
I'm gonna leave this in like I said but
normally you would keep that with you
but make sure you take out your SIM your
sim is your phone
take that out and keep it for your next
phone because you can't make phone calls
without it and vice versa
anyone else who has your SIM card can
make phone calls send texts and whatnot
as if they were you now putting this
back on we put pressure here and snap it
back together now we're not done what I
have done is I have kept all of the
packing material and you can't see that
very well that is a little battery cover
so what I'm gonna do is take this off
this is fully charged which I always
recommend you do somebody sends you
something or if you're selling it make
sure you send home a fully charged
battery it's just polite the way you
make sure it doesn't discharge is you
put it back in its sleeve so that's what
I have done here just put the sleeve
over it's got this nice little tab and
what I'm gonna do now is just slip the
battery back in place this is the way
that it came and of course I keep all of
my packing material getting this back in
may be a little bit tricky just go ahead
and monkey around with it just a little
bit and after some monkeying off-camera
I've got it all in place we'll just
slide it in just like that and we will
replace the cover which I will do the
right way instead of upside down now
this is the HTC Desire HD and it is a
little bit complicated to get this in
and closed and you just have to futz
with it for a while
tip that side in first that's usually
the best way to do it but it is a pain
in the neck to to get it closed which is
I've said it before I'll say it again
that's actually a good thing because
once you do that it's gonna stay nice
and tight so there you go now I've got
fingerprints all over this screen I'm
gonna take my soft cloth I'm gonna clean
it off really quick and I'll do that
off-camera
once you've done that in this case it
came with this nice little protective
sleeve that goes over the front and
we'll just wrap that around
put it all together and we've put
everything back in the box organized it
as neatly as we can making sure we're
not forgetting anything we've got the
power adapter we've got the prongs USB
we've got the headphones we've got all
the material that came with it now why
do we include all that stuff
well I wouldn't include the headphones
if I were sending it to someone else if
I've used them because that's got my
earwax on it and I don't want them to
have to experience my earwax but you
want them to have the best unboxing
experience that they can and we just
slide it back together and there you go
it looks like brand-new it's great you
can now sell this on eBay give it to a
friend or whatnot or in this case we're
going to return it back to close out
there in the United Kingdom again with a
big thanks out to them so that's how you
want to go ahead and return or prep your
device for selling or for returning to
where you got it from or whatever
factory resetting removing the SD card
and repackaging it one of those things
that you may not do all that often but
if you're moving up from say this device
to the next device or like I did with my
g1 up to my g2 you want to make sure
that the person who's receiving this has
the best experience that they can and a
little bit of work goes a long way and
keeps your data nice and safe and it's
better than accidentally embarrassingly
including your SD card and your micro
sim or your regular sim and then having
to ask for it back so just make sure you
do that so neat little Android quick tip
for you for today if you like this kind
of stuff give it a thumbs up I already
mentioned that but of course subscribe
