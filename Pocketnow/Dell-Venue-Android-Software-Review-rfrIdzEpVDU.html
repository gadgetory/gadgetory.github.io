pocket now calm and this is the software
review of the dell venue this is like
the dell venue pro but without a
keyboard and of course it's running on
android so let's take a look at what
dell has done to the android interface
here on the venue let's get to it
now if you've ever used the dell streak
which is another Android tablet /
smartphone you know that they have
something called the stage UI which sort
of brings these widgets that sit on a
stage they've done the same thing with
the venue if you like widgets you're
going to love this if you don't like
widgets you're probably never going to
use any of these fancy widgets so let's
talk about the stage you I we're also
going to go through some benchmark tests
compare the speed of this device to the
nexus s and do some other cool stuff so
let's unlock the device here and zoom in
a little bit and we're going to go
through all these different stage
widgets so what we have here is a
relatively plain installation of android
2.2 with the exception of several
different things that dell has done to
spruce up the interface let's talk about
it so we got the Android launcher down
here the froyo launcher then we've got a
variety of widgets and this is called
the home widget quite simply chose you
your six or actually nine if you do them
at the right most recently used apps
shows your local your location and the
weather and the temperature if you tap
on the temperature it's going to take
you to accuweather com which is a little
bit silly should take you into a
dedicated weather application so this
app is relatively useful it basically
serves as your application launcher
let's go to the side and see some other
things that we have here this is the
internet stage widget and from here we
can add a variety of favorites so I've
got pocket now here picasa yahoo or you
can tap up here to the google search and
you're taken into the standard Google
Search application that you would get if
you were to use just the standard Google
widget in stock Android and of course we
can tap on any of these that will launch
the browser and bring up the web page in
question and we're back home it keeps
bringing you back home we're to swipe
over here and actually going to go to
the other side where the other widgets
are this is the people widget quite
simply it's just pulling from your
Android starred contacts and as
populating it with pictures here which
is quite nice and so if you tap on any
of these items it'll ask you you want to
call this person text them you want to
email them or view the contact so pretty
handy to have here the trouble with all
of these widgets really is that they
take up the entire screen so again I
said if you like widgets you're going to
like this because you get to scroll
around from screen
screen the screen but if you like kind
of a minimal look without all of these
widgets you're probably going to take
them off the screen and stick with
program shortcuts or revert to launcher
pro or ADW launcher or something like
that to simplify things a little bit
because this does tend to get a little
bit slow when you add tons of widgets so
over here is just a email widget which
you can flip through kind of reminds me
of an HTC Sense widget so it's pulling
from my main email account here swiping
to the right this is the social widget
and you can filter out between Facebook
and Twitter you can even update your
status from here you can check off if
you want to go to Facebook or Twitter or
both but again I think some people are
going to stick with the dedicated
twitter app the dedicated facebook app
but it's nice that they included this so
in case you don't want to dive into the
application you can use the home screen
widget and there's also a couple that I
i want to show you but first I'm gonna
show you something down here if you tap
and hold on the bottom you're going to
actually flip through your widgets this
is kind of a quick way to jump through
your widgets now you get little icons if
you're using one of the dell stage
widgets but if you get to a home screen
like the two on the left where I don't
have a dull stage widget you get this
standard little android kind of place
holder thing so over here there's just a
google voice widget let's swipe over
here to the left to a blank screen so i
can show you the other stage widgets so
again you tap and hold and you get this
new section here that says stage widgets
you've seen contact you seen e-mail
gallery is different so it's going to
bring up pictures that you have loaded
onto your device although I don't know
where these are pulling from you don't
get to kind of adjust the options for
each widget you just what you see is
what you get I'm not sure what this is
it looks to be a little video talking
about the stage you I here okay let's
get out of that and you can jump right
into the camera application by tapping
on that let's delete that and go back
into the stage widgets so we have home
you've seen that you've also seen social
and web let's see music so this is what
you would use to organized your your
albums you can pin certain albums to
this screen or this widget and also you
can have playlists arranged then
so that is a look at the stage you I
again if you like widgets you're going
to love this if not you're probably
going to revert to something else okay
let's move on and talk about the
on-screen keyboard as mentioned in the
hardware review the dell venue and the
venue pro have extremely sensitive
screens which is great so let's make a
new text message here and by the way i
wanted to show you that when you go into
the application tray the dell venue will
organize it into screens instead of one
scrollable list you can't turn off this
fancy pants and animation you also
should be able to flip up from the
bottom i believe as you can see to sort
of move through the widgets if you start
your finger at the application launcher
you're taken into this there aren't any
settings that you can change here in
this application launcher it's just two
screens you can't make it scroll
vertically so again let's go into text
messages and make a new message and you
can see what the on-screen keyboard
looks like because it is different than
what you get in stock android so here it
is it's kind of got a little bit of a
black shine to it so this is a test very
good keyboard if you're using it from
the appropriate angle of course with a
good level of on-screen sensitivity of
course you can change its keyboard to be
swipe or swiftkey or any really other
android keyboard that your heart desires
this is just what they include right on
the device so let's jump back and let's
go into the settings talk about some of
the stuff in there we're going to go
back to about this is running android
2.2 we're going to run a benchmark on
this in a second as you've probably seen
it's pretty fast it's not the fastest
and we're going to see that in the
benchmark also want to show you
something here in status as you can see
we are getting HSPA which is the faster
data speed that you can get on tmobile
capable of in some cases 6 to 10
megabits per second possibly much more
in the future so if t-mobile were to
release this on their network they would
call it a 4g phone because they like to
associate hspa+ with 4g so just
something to think about if you're
thinking about getting this phone you
can take advantage
those speeds in the future no word on
whether the dell venue is going to get
android 2.3 we're going to say probably
not but maybe we'll have to look into
that okay so let's run quadrant and see
how this device ranks compared to other
devices we're going to run the full
benchmark here so you don't have to sit
through this I'm going to cut back in in
a minute and go right to the results all
right we're done here let's see what we
get so they are the results they're not
terribly impressive you can see that it
ranked below a galaxy s far above a
nexus one but nowhere near a nexus one
running on froyo and of course it's not
even close to the Nexus S which we're
going to compare it to which is a notch
above the nexus one here it it's
obviously the fastest android phone out
there one of them but we're a little bit
slow there in day-to-day usage the venue
feels snappy it doesn't feel extremely
fast but definitely there's good
performance there I'm going to guess if
you were to remove this launcher and use
something like launcher pro or ADW
launcher have like one or two home
screens instead of seven with very
graphic intense widgets you may find
your device to be a little bit faster
there so before we get into a web speed
comparison just want to jump into the
applications and talk about anything
that came on here that's not usual we
have backup and restore which is a nero
program which will allow you to back up
the settings on your on your your phone
here and pretty much everything else is
the same we've got del sink which is a
little bit different and again this is a
licensed from from nero i'm going to go
back the camera is 8 megapixels and we
get the standard Android camera
interface here we don't have a front
facing camera which is really
unfortunate let's see if we can change
the resolution here I've got a lot of
settings so here we go 8 megapixels HD
1080 that's an interesting resolution to
see there let's switch it to video and
see what the resolutions are for that be
nice to see full there it is 720p video
very nice to see
certainly it's capable with 8 megapixel
so you can take HD video here on the
dell venue which is always nice to have
if you're out and about me want to take
some videos so now let's talk about web
performance so we're going to compare
this with the Nexus S running android
2.3 perhaps an unfair comparison because
the Nexus S is one of the fastest
benchmarking devices but just want to
give you an idea of how this device
compares alright so we've got the nexus
s set up here at Google we've got no
open tabs got pocket now over here hit
the back button accidentally let's just
jump right into google and we'll we're
over the same Wi-Fi network so you're
going to be able to see what that's like
I've got to say that the screen on the
dell venue looks brighter but the blacks
the contrast on the on on the Nexus S
there's just so much greater so let's
make sure just double check that we're
not running multiple windows running a
lot glad we went to that screen so here
we are on Google and so let's go to
pocket now on both of these and see how
fast they get there so we've got got it
already entered there let's do it okay
the nexus s was there faster let's see
how they handle the graphic heavy
desktop version Nexus S is blazing fast
it's ripping through this they're stuck
on the same area let's see who will be
the winner here suspense is killing us
all right nexus s 1 and the dell venue
is kind of struggling a little bit to
get that last element i think it's
pretty clear which one is faster we're
going to do a landscape of rotation
speed test in a second whenever the Dell
Venue finishes all right they finished
finally or sort of I've actually got the
plug-in settings probably a little bit
different just want to double check real
quick it should be on on demand so let's
go to able plugins always on on demand
that's probably why I'm going to refresh
the page and give them another shot it's
refreshed there we go of course we're
loading the wrong version of the site so
we'll test it out
the permalink just to get the speed
comparison as exact as possible stop it
there and see how pinching and zooming
is in terms of smoothness so a little
bit choppy on both devices actually this
is a very heavy website for a for
smartphone so let's try to open this
link at the exact same time now that
they both have the same settings for
plugins let's try boom same time good
see which gets there first and by the
way della has modded Android to be more
blue as you can see the progress bar is
blue the cellular reception bar is blue
by the way the Nexus S finished first so
a lot of little touches and you'd see
that throughout the settings and other
stock Android areas there so loading up
a lot slower than the nexus s let's see
how they fare in terms of screen
rotation speed so we're gonna kind of
move the camera back okay the dell dell
venue was actually faster there don't
think I got enough distance there so
let's try again hmm one more time to try
to give it enough lift here hmm so it
looks like the dell venue is actually
faster and screen rotation speed which
is always nice so overall we like Dells
attempt to bring forth the stage UI for
their latest and greatest Android device
again some people are going to remove
this and try to get something that feels
faster perhaps doesn't use as much RAM
to squeeze out some more performance
overall it's a fast device it doesn't
keep up with the Nexus S but it's
running an earlier version of Android
that isn't as perfectly tuned as we
would expect so overall the software on
the dell venue is a great start and it
feels great in terms of the hardware and
the screen sensitivity and the on-screen
keyboard so over overall a really good
package well the full review on
pocketnow.com coming up soon to talk
about more benchmarks and battery life
and all those kinds of things that you
want to know about so be sure to check
that out you like this video please give
it a thumbs up and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
