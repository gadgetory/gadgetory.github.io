pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to show you Regina 3d a launcher
that's free for Android let's get to it
okay so there's really a lot to talk
about here so let's get started
starting off on the front panel this is
just the main panel we've got a
background that sort of matches this
background we've got a weather clock and
if you tap on where the where the the
cloudiness is you'll get actually a four
day forecast and that can actually
collapse which is quite nice kind of
like an HTC style weather clock but a
little bit different if we want to go to
another home screen we can swipe and you
get this really cool 3d view it just
zooms you out and lets you sort of see
all of your screens in one view or
another way you can get from home screen
to home screen is to actually move the
dock on the bottom which it becomes a
slider so that's kind of cool so you can
slide that to the right slide that to
the left you can also add titles to your
home screen so over here we've got the
home screen and over here this is the
pocket now rules I don't know why it's
called that home screen with just a
background now these widgets are pretty
cool this is actually the appointment
widget which is not showing anything
right now because there are no
appointments on this particular device
but you can hit the button in the upper
right corner to have it rotate right now
we're on the settings part and if we
rotate it again it will just go to the
listing of the number of appointments
that you have so let's go to the screen
on the right right here I've just got a
stock Android widget I can tap and hold
and delete it and you get some pretty
cool animations when you do everything
in this particular interface which is
one of the coolest parts about it over
here we've got the to-do list which is
the same thing as the appointment list
really but set up for your tasks if you
have any and it will do that cool 3d
rotation and we've got some program
shortcuts over there and over here we've
just got a notification indicator to let
you know if you have missed calls or a
new text message now if we tap and hold
on the screen we get some cool options
we can choose reginae widgets and there
are five of them here's one that's kind
of nice the app manager and so from
right here you can kill tasks if you
want to if you tap on one of them in
particular it'll take you to the
application info screen you can for stop
an app go back to the home screen from
there and you just saw another feature
here you can do the leap like feature
that was a cool little animation and
from here you can delete home screens
you can add new ones or you can even
move them around through this cool
little interface another way you can get
to this interface is by tapping the home
button while you're on one of the panels
so really cool let's go back to that
other panel we were on so here's that
manager I mentioned I'm going to tap and
hold and throw this in the trash to see
the other widgets that come with Regina
so we also have appointment with you
which you saw to do what you saw miss
notification which is the one on the
screen right now and Regina clock which
is that cool HTC Sense like weather
clock now you might have seen that you
can also add all of your stock Android
widgets you can add folders and
shortcuts so this works with sort of
what you're used to using in Android and
if you tap on the second item here you
can change the name of the workspace so
you can have it say games or you know
internet shortcuts or whatever you can
also change the wallpaper and if you
download the free theme pack from the
Android Market for Regina you get all
these really awesome backgrounds so I'm
gonna set this as wallpaper and you can
have every home screen have its own
wallpaper which is very unique for
Android especially noticeable when you
go out to this cool 3d like view now
let's go into the the launcher which has
been done up a little bit so what
happens is the icons zoom in and the
panels sort of zoom out you can sort of
see them in the background and we can
sideswipe to get to our apps it's kind
of basic and we can also tap and hold
and drag and drop to put our icons on
the home screen something else that's
really cool about this launcher is that
your icons do not have to be arranged to
a grid you might have noticed that this
people icon is kind of between maps and
contacts if you want it to align to a
grid you'll get a little grid indicator
which is always really nice or you can
just stick it wherever you want and it
doesn't really matter you can have it
customize the way that you want not many
home screen replacements allow you to go
outside of a grid on your home screens
another cool thing that you can do here
is
access a secret homescreen and you have
to get the password right and I think
it's tap here and tap there let's see if
that works sometimes you got to do it a
little bit faster order for it to work
there it says entering secret workspace
so this is a workspace that isn't
available unless you know the password
kind of a cool concept not sure many
people are going to use it I mean what
are you going to try to hide on your
home screens but anyhow this gives you a
whole new set of home screens that you
can only get to if you know the password
so let's go back to the regular
workspace and it says exiting secret
workspace another thing you can do here
is go to preferences so Regina settings
you can change some things like change
the password for your secret workspace
endless rotation change the names for
your particular workspaces
change the 3d effect so kind of minimal
amount of settings here which all help
you to customize the way that this home
screen interface works so again this is
free we'll put a link up it's called
Regina 3d there are a few add-ons that
you need to get to for example to get
the weather clock working and also to
get all of the wallpaper all of which
are free which is great so give it a try
let us know what you think and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
