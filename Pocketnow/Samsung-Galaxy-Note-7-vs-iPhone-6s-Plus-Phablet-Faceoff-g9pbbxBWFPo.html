of the lineup that created the phablet
category and on the other we have the
iPhone that grew up to compete deciding
which one is a better buy is actually
less complicated than you think
so let's begin I'm he might leave a tie
with pocket now when this is Galaxy Note
7 versus iPhone 6s plus
brought to you by deep brand pocket aus
galaxy note 7 coverage is made possible
by D brand manufacturer of precision cut
vinyl skins for smartphones tablets and
other gadgets go to D brand.com slash
galaxy to pimp out your new galaxy note
7 this is one of those comparisons were
defining a winner is very subjective
while one phone was designed to do
substantially more than the other the
added features aren't really the things
that the average consumer is looking for
the Galaxy Note lineup was born from day
one as a Productivity tool it isn't just
the bloated Galaxy S but a device
designed to be large with the idea of
giving you a larger canvas to work on
the iPhone 6s plus follows a completely
different mentality where here you're
pretty much just getting a bloated
iPhone to serve a niche of users wanting
one my point on the iPhone isn't just an
oversimplification hold it with one hand
to note as a power button that's not
easy to reach because it simply scales
the success design in a top and bottom
bezel that pushes finger travel again
just to scale the success stack the
galaxy note 7 beside it and you get the
point that I'm trying to make believe it
or not the note is five millimeters
shorter four millimeters narrower 0.6
millimeters thinner and a staggering 23
grams lighter and even if smaller the
note sports a larger 5.7 inch display
compared to 5.5 with better resolution
at quad HD compared to 1080p and
superior quality with AMOLED compared to
IPS LCD about the only point in favor of
the iPhone and hardware is the aluminum
which handles fingerprints better than
gorilla
five now comparing internals would be a
waste of time given the efficiency of
iOS but on the things that matter the
note seven starts at 64 gigs of storage
that's expandable compared to 16 gigs
with fixed ears for $100 apiece the note
7 is ip68 water and dust resistance
impaired to none on Cupertino and the
note has fast and wireless charging
compared to none on the iPhone the note
7 also sports better cameras resolution
might be the same at 12 megapixels but
the note 7 has larger pixels at 1.4
compared to 1.2 it has a larger field of
view as well at 26 millimeters compared
to 29 and a brighter aperture at F 1.7
compared to f-22 now the differences
aren't always apparent during the day as
both devices provide great color
saturation deep contrast in detail but
once you compare these phones at night
then oh seven just annihilates the
iPhone 6s plus in almost every shot
selfie shooters also share 5 megapixels
in specifications but at 22 millimetres
and f 1.7 aperture the note 7 offers a
better experience than the F 2.2 at 31
millimeters of the iPhone and as for
video recording even with comparable
stabilization the note always provided
punch your color and then to add even
more points in favor of the note 7 you
have a Wacom digitizer and an S Pen to
provide you with added productivity
tools and an Irish scanner that's fit
for more secure biometrics we have
separate videos detailing each of these
and even if we know that you don't
really need these features they are
definitely a great added value the
iPhones only added value is 3d touch
which is also another feature that you
don't really need but can also be nice
sure it mimics long press on Android but
the pressure-sensitive display offers
added brains for the iPhone to provide
different options depending on how hard
you press
now we're not even going to waste time
comparing iOS with Android because that
ship has sailed
each platform has enough points to love
or hate between them and the things that
matter we could say that both devices
are just the snappy and practical on
both of their respective operating
systems sampson provides just this much
bloat as apple and unique features like
night shift mode on iOS compared to the
blue light filter on samsung's ux i do
prefer the note 7s approach to
multitasking where the large canvas
serves to fit two apps at the same time
or the edge shortcuts that save you the
need to leave the application to launch
another or even the always-on display
i'm not going to sit here and just tell
you that the note is a better phone
because of these features but if you
think of it it serves a point for you to
have such a large canvas and be able to
take advantage of it game play is also a
delight on each given apple's use of
metal and samsung's use of vulcan and
i'd say that the phablet size is
actually perfect for this particular
usage scenario but that being said the
only reason you'll enjoy games more on
the iphone 6s plus is because it
completely destroys the galaxy note 7
and endurance you'd think that having
such a large battery on the note would
pay off but you'll have to top it off by
the end of the day or sometimes earlier
depending on your usage by contrast
killing the iPhone 6s plus battery is
not that easy sometimes yielding a
second day of heavy use without a
problem
so at the end of the day deciding on
each of these phones highly depends on
what type of user you are neither one of
these phones is affordable so defining
what you need is essential if what you
want is a tablet replacement meaning a
large phone with great battery life
that's also great at gameplay and has a
solid ecosystem then look no further the
iPhone 6s plus is the phone for you now
if you want a phone that's just this
large but doesn't feel that way that's
also a great productivity tool which
actually fits better in your hand has
awesome cameras uncompromised security
features an S Pen for whenever you need
it an expandable storage
well then pretty much don't even think
about it get the galaxy note 7 as a
power user I will admit that the added
battery life makes me consider the
iPhone 6s plus but I ended up inclining
towards the features and ergonomics of
the galaxy note 7 hands-down this video
was made possible by deep brand the boss
of vinyl skins for your smartphone
tablet game console and more whether
it's carbon fibre leather wood or
concrete there are dozens of
combinations to choose from for the most
