unlocked version of the iphone 4s in the
US iOS 5.1 gets released but don't
expect these news to be in the cool
section an apple doesn't seem to have
plans to port Siri on all the devices
and we tell you why all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi everyone and welcome to the pocket
nail I review the show we go through all
this week school and the not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's talk this week off with the cool
apple continues to expand their grip in
the United States and this time they're
offering their iphone 4s as a factory
unlock device on Apple stores and online
what this means is that you could
actually travel abroad with your device
and use it with another prepaid sim card
in any of the countries that you travel
too if you find that roaming is too
expensive and it is too expensive in my
case that's what I use so this carrier
unlocked version of the iphone for us is
really interesting though it's not going
to work on every carrier sadly you can
only use it on AT&amp;amp;T and obviously yes
this device das work on tmobile but it
won't work on verizon or sprint even
though it's pretty much the same world
phone but still you can pay 600 bucks
for the iphone for a 16 gigabyte model
700 bucks for the iphone 4s 32 gigabyte
model and 800 bucks for the 64 gigabyte
model obviously this is expensive but
it's only for those people that really
need it you can still go for the same
plan device for 200 bucks or probably a
little more on any carrier with a two
year contract if you don't like the
factory unlock burnings speed of Apple
Store Zeppelin is just debuted a new
service called EC pay which allows you
to bring your iOS device to any store
and buy anything you want without
needing to use a cashier you get to
actually just pay for your device or
whatever you want with your iOS device
right there and then just pick it up at
the store or buy it from home and then
pick it up eventually it's kind of a
neat service that it seems that Apple's
bringing to the table because you don't
have to wait in line to buy your device
when other lines get really big free to
buy your new iPad or iPhone when it
comes out in the future now it does seem
to be interesting that Apple's figuring
out ways to make consumer experience
more convenience when using stores
really good idea
hacking has been quite busy lately on
iOS because first of all a famous hacker
and developer Charlie Miller just showed
us how to run unassigned code on your
iPhone with a couple of really
interesting leaks and exploits that he
found out there now interesting enough
you can expect the guy loss of developer
account once Apple figured out what he
did aside from that does seem that
somebody figured out how to pull this
really neat band on top of the keyboard
that allows you to bring those
suggestions that are actually
controlling the keyboard for new
suggestive text whenever you're typing
the wrong word just like you do a
nandroid now it's a really interesting
heck that does not need for you to
jailbreak your device so hit the link of
the description as we show you how to
get it done and while it also seems if
somebody figured out how to bring
panoramic photos for iOS devices does
this require jailbreak so hit the link
in the description for details on how to
get it done also and low consumer
reports is at it again initially they
wouldn't recommending the iphone 4
because it antennagate but now they are
telling everybody that the iphone 4s has
no problems with the antenna kind of
ironic because they end up their article
telling everybody to buy an android
phone and not an iphone but still in my
personal experience the iphone 4 that i
bought initially did not buy any antenna
gate issues but after i dropped the
phone for the first time it started
having antennagate problems so make sure
you buy a bumper still because it does
seem to have to do with handling and not
necessarily manufacturing what's next
well the question is would blend that is
the question
that bizarre for the coolest continue on
with the not-so-cool iOS 5.0 point 1 was
released the masses but why is this is a
nice oh cool section well first of all I
phone for us customers are not having
any better battery life and hey even I
phone for customers are now complaining
of problems with battery so if this
seemed that people are having problems
with the battery problems with facetime
some people are having problems with
iMessage caller ID these and just about
everything so you think that apple would
have figured it out but it seems that
they haven't they need to go back to the
drawing board and while the saddest news
this week is that it seems that Apple
won't be offering their Serie service to
other iOS applications in the past and
ironic enough it does include the ipad 2
which has pretty much the same specs
only in larger housing so now we're sure
what Apple saying that they won't
support it now I fix it came on record
recently to tell everybody that the
iphone 4s brings a new proximity sensor
that actually turns on a little more
than allows the phone to the tech when
it gets on your ear for you to be able
to talk to Siri now interesting enough I
mean what's wrong with the fact that you
could actually bring Siri to older
devices and just not have that feature
when you raise your phone up to your ear
and be able to talk to Siri that's all
Apple has to do so if this seem that
this is the crown jewel for the iphone
4s is pretty much the only selling point
so sad news for us old customers that's
it for today's show thank you very much
for watching I'm high Meadow iveta
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
