look feel or act like much of a match
for Apple's top-selling iPhone well you
know what they say what a difference a
year makes I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is Samsung Galaxy s6
vs Apple iPhone 6 brought to you by
Squarespace
everybody's thinking it so let's just
say it the galaxy s6 is visually very
similar to the iPhone 6 from the
position of the power and volume keys to
the home buttons with integrated
fingerprint scanners to the arrangement
of ports and speakers on the bottom
edges the similarity is undeniable
helped even the SIM card slots are in
the same place does this mean that
Samsung stole Apple's design well no
more than Apple's stole HTC's antenna
implementation or oneplus stole the idea
of wooden smartphones from Motorola the
point is idea appropriation is rampant
in the smartphone world and in this case
the results are positive for both phones
whoever copied whom all these ports and
trays feature excellent precision
machining and the buttons offer terrific
travel and feedback when we flip around
to the back side the similarities
quickly fade away the galaxy's rear
cover is dominated by its protruding 16
megapixel optically stabilized camera
module and accompanying biosensors while
Apple puts its non stabilised 8
megapixel camera up in the corner also
the iPhones ventral surface is
wraparound aluminium while the galaxies
is Gorilla Glass 4 so while both are
very smooth and comfortable to hold the
Samsung device is much more susceptible
to fingerprints speaking of fingerprints
unlock these phones with the press of a
thumb and you'll get a pleasant surprise
gone is the cumbersome swiping of last
year sensors the galaxy's new reader is
just as quick accurate and comfortable
as the iPhones ever since the first
Galaxy S Samsung has made it a point to
keep a head of Apple in screen size and
nothing's changed in that regard the s6
is displays almost a half inch larger on
the day I can
and packs over two and a half million
more pixels for a much sharper picture
whether you'll notice this added
sharpness depends on how much 4k video
you're watching on your phone and
whether or not you're using the galaxy
s6 as part of a gear VR headset you will
almost certainly notice the galaxies
deeper blacks and more saturated colors
though the result of Samsung using its
own Super AMOLED technology versus the
IPS LCD of the iPhone and that same tech
gulf makes for a more versatile display
on the Samsung it can get brighter in
direct sunlight and dimmer in the dark
as we discussed last week
comparing the iPhone 6 and new HTC One
iOS and Android are pretty evenly
matched from an ecosystem standpoint if
you can find an app in the App Store
odds are you'll be able to find it in
Google Play and vice versa
responsiveness and app launch times are
comparable here as well while Android
still has some annoying pauses and often
accessed corners like the multitasking
view the differences are minor enough
that most people probably won't notice
the important disparity is in the
interface design commenters chafe when I
say it but it's true
out-of-the-box iOS is the simpler
interface its grid of icons and folders
is simplicity itself to get back to that
grid you press the phone's only
front-mounted button to mute the ringer
you flip the phone's only switch now you
can set Android to emulate apples simple
look and feel if you want to but that's
not how the Galaxy S six comes out of
the box instead its homescreen is
dominated by a big clock widget flanked
on the left by a newsreader and on the
right by well a ton of carrier bloat on
the t-mobile version apps are stored in
a separate drawer and in addition to the
HOME key you've got a dedicated back
button and an app switching key oh and
good luck figuring out the ringer
settings now that Android lollipop has
screwed them up completely but Android
is also smarter in some ways it's
dedicated back key makes it easier to
use with one hand because iOS still
insists on putting its back buttons on
the upper left corner of most apps also
Android is the more customizable OS by
especially with samsung's latest
improvements to its custom interface if
you don't like the look of your iphone
you can change the wallpaper and that's
about it
you can't even decide where you want
individual icons to be because iOS will
always stack them from upper left to
lower right meanwhile the galaxy lets
you change nearly every corner of the
software layout icons widgets shortcuts
all of it is fair game
if you want to load custom ringtones or
images you've got direct access to the
file system if that sounds too
complicated you can change the look and
feel on maus with a click of a button
thanks to the new theme store
it's about philosophy Android lets you
make your phone your own iOS seems to
expect that you'll just be grateful to
own an iPhone of course a lot of people
are grateful to own the iPhone and iOS
is a big part of that it's not adaptable
at all but in my experience it is more
reliable in just a week of using the
galaxy s6 I've had apps crash several
times popular ones like Instagram or
Inbox
I've had background apps shut down even
when I was actively using them to track
exercise meanwhile I can't remember the
last time an app hard crashed on my
iPhone 6
considering how completely the galaxy s6
outclasses the iPhone 6 in terms of
specs that's ludicrous
simplicity isn't all bad
optical performance is something the
iPhone has been known for for years but
Samsung has rapidly been closing the gap
the results are maddening if you're
trying to crown a winner but encouraging
if you want a solid camera because each
of these qualifies you'll find that
Apple sometimes delivers richer colors
and better contrast in lower light
change up the scenery a little bit and
you start to see Samsung's warmer
leanings in this example the iPhone
delivers richer Blues while the galaxy
really amps up the Reds turn on HDR and
the Samsung like nearly every other
phone beats the iPhone in terms of the
amount of light it can extract from a
scene also Samsung's real-time HDR shows
you what it's going to look like before
you snap it which is great
it's strange to see Apple which
pioneered the HDR effect on smartphones
now falling a bit behind in this regard
you don't even need the HDR mode to get
a lot of detail from darker areas with
the galaxy as this photo shows Apple
once again is content to allow more
darkness if it means a more dramatic
result zooming in we also get to see
Samsung's higher resolution sensor at
work the 16 megapixel Galaxy image is
naturally sharper than the iPhones 8
megapixel output with less digital noise
in the sky as well heading indoors
each phone gets its chance to shine but
I tend to slightly favor Samsung's
pictures in some the iPhone almost seems
a bit washed out while the Galaxy brings
dramatic contrasts and more saturation
Samsung's warmer bias sometimes works in
its favour in real life this Red Room is
closer to this orange red than the
pinkish hue Apple renders yet the
galaxy's tendency to highlight greens
and yellows doesn't always make for a
better shot as can be seen in these
close-ups here the iPhone is probably
closer to reality and that only gets
more true in extreme low-light where the
galaxy's color reproduction gets even
further from the mark you sacrifice a
lot to shoot in 60fps on the galaxy but
as you can see the sacrifice is worth it
the Samsung video is smooth as can be
despite the rapid action
but you can say the same for the iPhones
60fps footage as well despite its lack
of optical stabilization it's just as
fluid and as for selfies well Samsung's
got the wider angle but Apple's better
at brightening faces so let's just call
it a draw
they're both excellent smartphone
cameras and the iPhone carries the added
benefit of coming with iMovie right out
of the box so you can easily clip
together a quick highlight reel to share
with friends but for my money the galaxy
s6 camera is the better one overall
double the resolution optically
stabilized and with a lightning-fast
dead-simple trigger action plus bonuses
like tracking autofocus 4k video and
that live HDR preview it's beyond merely
capable it's excellent
time for the home stretch what are these
like in the day to day strikingly
similar in a lot of ways with speakers
this close and exterior design it's no
surprise that volume is comparable the
s6 might have a slightly flatter sound
but they're both plenty loud same goes
for the earpieces and the construction
around them is so similar that what do
you know each one still pulls out the
occasional hair if you wear it a little
long so get a haircut I guess we're not
ready to comment too much on endurance
in this comparison our first s6 didn't
do well against the one m9 but it's
since been swapped for a different unit
and a software update has landed as well
so we're reserving judgment until our
full review I can tell you that charging
is a very different experience on the s6
rather than Apple's tiny lightning cable
you've got the far more common but
decidedly non-reversible microUSB you've
also got wireless charging on the s6
which ups the cool factor at least
tenfold and there's ultra power saving
mode if things get really hairy and
lastly there's the little stuff the IR
port on the Samsung lets you control
your TV or home entertainment system
s-health is a lot like Apple health but
on the galaxy it's backed up by the
dedicated heart rate monitor
and if for some reason you don't want to
use any of these intense new features
easy mode is here to turn the Galaxy S
six into a $700 dumb phone as usual
there's no one-size-fits-all
recommendation here
they're both great phones for their
respective platforms and most people
will decide which of these is the better
fit based on ecosystem iOS or Android I
called the iPhone 6 excellence
exemplified in our full review and I
stand behind it it's a great phone but
if you're on the cusp of buying your
first smartphone or you've been waiting
for a good reason
to make a jump from Apple to Android
there's almost no better device to do it
with than the galaxy s6 some other
phones are just as beautiful others have
pure builds of Android still others come
in more flavors and many others are less
expensive but none of those have the
particular blend of wins that the galaxy
s6 does it is once again the iPhones
biggest threat and this year it's for
good reasons this comparison was brought
