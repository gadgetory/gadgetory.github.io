pocketnow.com and today we've got the
unboxing of the HTC Flyer from t-mobile
so sit back relax and enjoy the show now
the HTC Flyer has been available for
some time now it's just been recently
that the t-mobile version this version
we have here has been available made
available as of sep tember 13th of 2011
let's go ahead and open up the box and
take a look at see what's inside here as
far as accessories go here's the unit
itself which we'll come back to in just
a minute nothing else inside that tray
there and here we have the wall wart and
it's got a proprietary kind of it almost
looks like a micro USB connector but
it's a bent and little air in the middle
and then the USB cable also has that
same configuration sim cards and these
regulatory guide and the quick guide
also included this box another accessory
that you can get with the HTC Flyer is
the HTC scribe pin which will show in
the further hardware review once we get
going with this particular device so
let's go ahead and power up the device
get it plugged in and we'll take a
closer look at that so starting with the
back cover you can see here I've already
pulled off the cover that goes over the
top of the sim card slot which is right
here and also the expandable microSD
card slot maximum card size is 32 gigs
here and it's got 32 gigs of built-in
memory as well this is a real pain to
get on and off so I figured I'd start
with it off for the sake of the timing
this of the review and as you can see
here it just kind of like snaps into
place back on top of there a couple of
speaker holes here on the back this is
got a little bump here a little nub
right here that's a little bit this is
kind of Luminum unibody here and this
plastic has a little more
stickiness to it then you would normally
expect we'll see how that works out
holding it in the hand down here on the
bottom is the charging port and data
port volume rocker key and microphone on
this side nothing here but clean
aluminum here power button up on the top
the HTC Flyer does work on the GSM
obviously considering it's running
through t-mobile service it weighs about
four and twenty grams that's about 14
point eight ounces the dimensions are
7.69 by 4.8 by point 5 2 so it's it's
not a lightweight device for the form
factor especially if you are comparing
this against like the color look or
against the let's say candle absolutely
much heavier in that case screen is a
1024 x 600 pixels if i can find the
power button here it is a LCD display it
has the i believe it's called the N trig
capacitive or avatar back capacitive but
the end-rig touch technology which is
used for the pin technology which will
cover later for are not really for we
have three capacitive touch buttons and
then you have a special button here
which is specifically for the pin which
again we'll cover more in the hardware
section screen looks pretty nice and the
device seems pretty quick to start with
this review unit came to us already pre
started so that's why you don't see any
other configuration options to start
here we'll play around with it some more
and cover some of those other items in
the software review it's got a little
bit of a lip that goes around here
around the edges it's got a small
megapixel front facing camera I believe
it's by 1.3 megapixel camera on the
front and a 5 megapixel camera on the
back
it's running Gingerbread it's not
running a tablet OS at this time but
it's anticipated to be coming very
shortly otherwise seems to be very nice
in the hand that I can feel so far off
to do some more testing on it but we'll
cover that in for the reviews if you
have more questions about the actual
specs will have those on the website
pocketnow.com the battery itself is
4,000 milliamp hours it's supposed to
have a standby time about 1,400 1,400
and 70 hours which is should be a pretty
good clip the processor on this is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 15 mattered
megahertz it's got a gig of ram which
should be more than sufficient for this
device will see how it really runs with
some games that it's got a seller ometer
and a compass in this as well no
gyroscopes that we've been able to find
that wraps up our unboxing of the HTC
Flyer from t-mobile if you have any
questions or comments want us to test
one particular item or see a particular
feature of the device leave a message in
the comments below will try to address
them thanks for watching
