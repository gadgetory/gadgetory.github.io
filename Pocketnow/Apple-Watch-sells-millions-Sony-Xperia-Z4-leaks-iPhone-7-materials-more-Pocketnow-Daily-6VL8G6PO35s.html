already sold more than all smartwatches
combined sony xperia z4 leaks point to
an all-new design and new features and
ipad pro rumors return and this time
with some USB type-c i'm high net iveta
and guys thanks a lot for all your
feedback regarding the audio it's not a
microphone issue it's actually a final
cut issue and we're trying to figure out
this is pocket out daily the official
news today do with Microsoft and mainly
it's Windows 10 preview phones
apparently people are not just not
liking it for its looks but also
complaining about issues falling back to
Windows Phone 8.1 particularly in Lumias
like the 5 25 25 and 5 26 microsoft is
just confirmed that they're halting the
preview at least for these Lumias for
now until they figure that one out and
hopefully others you're not having the
same issue where is it for my lumia 930
guys now let us talk about Sony the
company may not be enjoying success when
it comes to smartphones but we kept
hearing rumors of the Sony Xperia z3
Neil of a sony xperia z5 now we're going
back to the Xperia z4 rumors and this
time we hear two things number one
apparently will getting an all metal
chassis on this z4 and second apparently
we're getting a fingerprint scanner
instead of that button that we always
get on the side that looks really good
even more interesting is that apparently
the company is planning to launch it on
april twentieth to steal some thunder
from the LG g4 nice plan let's see what
happens now moved the spotlight over to
Apple particularly the iPad pro or iPad
plus we're tired of these rumors we've
been talking about them for the last
year but it seems that more case makers
show us what's coming and yeah the
previous leaks were kind of true meaning
we're getting dual speakers in addition
to a 12 point nine inch display but even
more interesting is a hole for another
connector and we've seen these leaks
before but back then USB type-c wasn't
part of the new macbook now it is so
yeah it could be that apple is giving us
a lightning connector in addition to USB
3.1 which is type C but then again isn't
it funny for the new macbook that just
have one connector and the new iPad to
have more now let's talk about the
iphone 7 or 6
or whatever it's going to be called
reports claim that Apple is going to be
using the same type of aluminum alloy
that use for the Apple watch sport to be
the material that used for the next
iPhone the 7000 class aluminum alloy
uses as an extra bombing of sync so this
makes it stronger apparently more prone
to scratches and that could be something
really great for the next generation
iphone we just wonder how Apple's going
to handle the whole weight issue giving
the Apple watch is not a light product
at all but then again we'll see until we
test it we have to wait a couple of
months for that and finally for the hot
news of the day KGI securities is famous
for accurate predictions when it comes
to apple and this time they're
predicting that the company sold 2.3
million Apple watches on the first few
days close to 1 million units on the
first pre-ordered date alone and just to
give you some perspective that's more
than all smart watches in the market
sold over the last few years which is
crazy that is a crazy amount of products
being sold and apparently according to
them eighty-five percent made apple
watch sport then the regular apple watch
was fifteen percent and yeah there are
no percentages left and that's because
apparently the apple watch edition
barely sold below one percent which
makes all the sense in the world people
are not that stupid but that leads me to
the question of the day do you believe
in this productions do you believe that
Apple's sold that many smart watches
because in my case yeah I do i just
don't think they'll sell that many
SmartWatch is going forward what people
start testing them but blame is a
