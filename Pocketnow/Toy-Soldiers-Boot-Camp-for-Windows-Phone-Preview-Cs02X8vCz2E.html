and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for this phone
let's check it out alright the last must
have xbox live game from windows phone
for februari is called toy soldiers boot
camp and here's the menu screen and
looks very familiar if you've ever
played toy soldiers Cold War on the xbox
360 this opening screen is very very
almost the same as that game which is
very popular and so let's just go into
play and what we have here are three of
the toy soldier Cold War mini games they
can choose from so let's try this one
and use swype to to aim let's tap the
beginning here's the trigger button over
there let's get it and I hold it down
and I can launch the rocket at the
target whoops so the slider is going to
make it go faster if I slide it up miss
that one
there we go and the mini game only lasts
for 60 seconds so our time is going to
be up pretty soon we're going to get
some of these oops
there we go
next time limit you can see over here
the leaderboard so you can tell where
your rank so that's one of the minigames
next let's do fly swatter have some cool
graphics during the loading screen tap
the beginning and I'm going to kill the
flies here
come on get the golden ones
so I'm holding my trigger button down
over here and this is also a timed game
so I have 60 seconds here come on
and it's going to show my score and
again we can see my the leaderboard how
I rank I'm on everybody and a cool thing
is the on the xbox you'll also have a
leaderboard of the mobile games okay so
that's the flyswatter one more thread
the needle
so you got to get through the holes
oh let's try that one more time and my
thumb on left controls a slider you can
make the rocket go slower or faster
I'm sick I'm gonna make it okay the
object is to get it through as many of
these rains as possible and again we got
the scoreboard over there so that's it
just three mini-games but they are
pretty much very accurately reproduced
from the xbox game it's just that we all
have as much depth of gameplay as cold
so cold war rather there's your
leaderboards achievements I've actually
you know gotten the first six
achievements within about me 20 minutes
of playing this so it's a little bit
easy helping options or something cool
in here you can do screenshots you saw
this little camera button in the corner
person that I'll give a screenshot and
save it to my photo album controls we
can change as well if you want to be
lefty you can use the tilt to control
the angle not sure if you want to do
that or there's also the d-pad and
that's about it there's just three
mini-games I was a little bit
disappointed there wasn't you know more
depth to this game and the game the
minigames are all pretty much the same
so they get kind of repetitive you know
you can still you can keep playing to be
your friend scores and you know increase
your score but they are pretty much the
same every time you play it so not sure
how long do you'll find this
entertaining so that's toy soldiers boot
camp it'll be available in the Windows
Phone Marketplace on Wednesday februari
29th for 299 so be sure to check it out
of course a free trial will be available
