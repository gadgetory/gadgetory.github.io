performance chat comparing different
photography solutions the oneplus three
release marks a nice little moment
before we start moving into the major
phone releases set for the end of the
year we'll be doing a proper wrap-up
when new notes and iPhones are released
but for now we can sum up the collection
of phones that we've produced real
camera reviews for many we're hoping the
g5 was going to be something like a v10
Mini but LG tackled new territory with a
modular battery chin arrangement the
camera also sprouted a whole second
sensor with a wide angle almost fisheye
lens the things we liked from the g4
remain this app is nicely laid out with
options for the most basic control to
full manual options which include
excellent tools for reporting exposure
still photo performance is excellent and
LG offers up terrific saturation colors
pop but we don't descend into
oversaturated output the second sensor
is nicely tied into the experience and
it becomes a standard part of the camera
zoom range video isn't this cameras
strong soup however with zero controls
to adjust other than where you focus and
while the imaging and processing
features are terrific
the main camera lens is maybe the
poorest performer on this list most
prone to aberration and distortion and
although the LG g5 is certainly the most
flexible camera package of 2016 now LG
wasn't the only company to release a
dual sensor camera this year but
Huawei's approach is about as different
as you can get here the two sensors work
in tandem to simulate how the rods and
cones work in the human eye delivering
incredible color and dynamic range these
sensors were influenced by Leica and the
P nine achieved some of the best photos
we've ever seen from a phone camera you
almost never need to use HDR here as the
camera naturally maximizes light in
almost every shooting scenario
unfortunately dual sensors are extremely
difficult to sync for image
stabilization so there is no Hardware
stabilization here it hasn't proven
necessary for photos but videos suffer
when shooting at max quality and that
max quality tops out at 60 frames per
second 1080p many people might not feel
they need higher resolution
but the mark of a flagship now means
tackling UHD and this is an area the p9
falls behind still this like it design
can't be denied for folks focused on
producing the best photos they can from
a phone HTC has had a rough couple of
years when it comes to cameras the HTC
10 marks a course change we're all happy
to see this camera isn't nearly as
compromised as previous HTC flagships
now it honestly doesn't win many major
categories dynamic range is good color
saturation is good HDR is a bit
inconsistent but is better than most
androids and taming highlights and the
app is very well laid out for adjusting
settings though some of these sliders
can be hard to read in bright light we
can point to audio capture is a
substantial victory over competitors as
this phone has terrific microphones and
saves lossless audio though HTC uses
optical image stabilization and the
largest ultra pickles' of the bunch we
still see some issues with low-light
photos they tend to be grainy ER and
handshake can still blur detail more
than other options here even the Huawei
we lack a few features like high frame
rate video but HTC's back to basics
approach here delivers a well rounded
shooter that HTC fans will be happy to
use Samsung delivered something really
special this year on the s7 camera
starting a trend on walking away from
increasing resolution to focus on better
low-light performance the experiment is
successful the galaxy s7 offers up a
terrific app with almost every setting
we would want and the most complete set
of options for post-processing
though we do wish we had shutter speed
and ISO control for video performance is
generally excellent dual pixel
technology is no gimmick and focusing
speed here is lightning quick Samsung
still produces saturated and sharpened
images but is toned down some of the
more aggressive processing they've been
known for in the past and video
performances top notch we've got a dig a
little deeper for problems for example
the s Evan has the closest minimum
focusing distance for macro shots but
having the widest aperture makes it a
bit more difficult to keep your subject
in focus before depth of field blur
creeps in see that's really not much of
a bummer the galaxy s7 folks it's a
killer camera
but what if you could get like 85% of a
great camera for like 60% of the price
we think that would appeal to a lot of
folks in our audience and that's what
oneplus has to offer it's a very good
all-rounder for photos once you figure
out a few of the quirks solid exposure
and saturation with full manual controls
the low-light performance is kind of a
mess that is until you try out the HDR
style denoise mode and then your night
photos of stationary objects look a lot
better UHD video is on tap but even with
image stabilization it's still shaky er
than all but the Huawei and the
aggressive noise reduction is a
disappointment for the sound in your
videos the one plus three will make
constant noise sound like it's
underwater the thing is we're okay being
a little less critical here it's really
fine that this phone doesn't outright
win many fights as it gets us pretty
close to significantly more expensive
phones and there you have it folks you
can dive really deep on all five of
these cameras each phone has its own
examination video linked in the
description below our real camera review
series is still pretty new for this
channel but we've been getting great
feedback from our viewers and we're
looking forward to running more phones
