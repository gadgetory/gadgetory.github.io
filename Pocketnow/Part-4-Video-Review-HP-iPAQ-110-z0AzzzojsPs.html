parking now
common this is part four of the video
review for the HP ipaq 110 in this
edition will go a little more at the
detail into the connectivity options the
iPad has to offer and a couple of extra
stuff I looked into wild toying with the
device if I had to put Wi-Fi to the test
i would consider the I packs wireless
package to be decent definitely Wi-Fi is
a i would consider better in comparison
to other mobile devices for example I
deliberately left my router two rooms
away just to check signal strength and
you'll notice I get two bars on my
router here at the top then you'll
notice in my laptop I get a three bars
over here at the end but if I would try
to compare this to my Harold my Harold
barely gives me one bar of my router and
in some cases it just simply loses it as
opposed to the ipaq which always shows
it to be available and connects pretty
quick to it another thing I do consider
nice about the ipad is the HP ipaq
wireless I consider it quicker to get
connected it's actually much better as
available here on the honor today screen
in comparison to the comm managers I've
used from other devices like HTC
bluetooth is really nothing out of the
ordinary as I mentioned in the past
probably one of the things I don't like
about the Bluetooth stack that's
included is the fact that if you send
your device to stand by it'll turn
bluetooth off and not leave it on so
it's not really good for example if you
want to try connecting through the BT
phone manager through a phone and then
keep it active while on standby for
messengers or stuff like that
differences are probably since it's a
different Bluetooth stack and you could
probably go into here into settings
you'll notice it has different profiles
that you choose what kind of
accessibility you want all the different
services that are probably available and
obviously about what's interesting
though is for example if you go in here
and to my to the manager and then you'll
see all paired devices here that I have
one of the things I like is that it has
like a wizard interface which
reminds me of the old ipaq 1940 I used
to have with different wizards for
connections to explore Bluetooth device
hi Claudia high-quality audio setup
connect to the internet via phone
hands-free we got p IM synchronization
and then if you click on any of these it
will take you to a wizard to get
connected let's bring it over here again
we have active zinc via bluetooth the
file browser connect to a network joint
personal network you can exchange
business cards you can use it as a pc
remote control which is something i
would have i've tried to look into yet
but i haven't really gotten it to work
and connect to a keyboard which is
something i have exploded as of yet
pretty much in bluetooth these are the
innovations as i mentioned it's not
perfect i would consider the microsoft
bluetooth stack to be a bit better but
it's it has its advantages since this
isn't a phone device you don't have a
obviously the option to connect to edge
or 3g or GPRS but HP was kind enough to
include the bt phone manager for this
from BB RP it is really good for HP to
include this the only thing i don't like
about this is its it was designed to be
the device oriented and service specific
so if you go into settings and then you
try to set up a communications device
you actually have to try to detect it
and you'll really have a hard time at
the beginning trying to get this done
because of the fact that of the device
that you have is not included in the
list it'll take a long time for the
device to detect it but anyways
afterwards even even though i had these
problems i was able to get at least the
the HTC s620 which is the same t-mobile
dash and use it as practically an
equivalent for my Herald because my
Herald is it included and obviously my
network here is not included because i'm
currently not at the US but in the end
it didn't work which is the most
important part if you were trying to
connect for example if you have another
windows mobile standard pro device the
way you'd have to connect the procedure
would be is a practically bring your
device in the internet sharing put it on
pam-4 bluetooth and then hit connect and
then once you get that after you pair
your devices obviously you later hit
connect here on the BT phone manager and
once you do set for whatever device you
have set it it'll actually give you the
instructions and it'll tell you click on
this and tap on that to get connected
and then you later hit next then it'll
try to connect it won't actually connect
right now because I'm having a bit of a
network problem but this is pretty much
the procedure which I consider after you
get paired to be simple it's a really
good application it really helps out get
an extra way to get connected to the
Internet well I hope you enjoyed part 4
of the video review for the HP ipaq 110
