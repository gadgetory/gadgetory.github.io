now calm and yesterday you saw son boxty
droid pro in that video would give you a
quick look at what to expect when you
first boot the device up and it's a very
brief look at the hardware itself well
now it's time to get into depth and this
is going to be our hardware overview so
let's get started
and we're back to jump right into the
Droid Pro specs and the first thing
you're going to actually notice is of
course the physical QWERTY keyboard here
which is actual keys and these keys are
very similar to that of a blackberry
will actually bring a little closer so
you can get a better look here these
keys are very similar almost the same
slant same styling everything as a
blackberry which if you're going after
the business user may be a safe bet now
of course because it has that
front-facing physical keyboard it's a
smaller screen it's a three point one
inch capacitive display with a
resolution of 320 x 480 so it's a
slightly lower resolution capacitive
display at the heart of the Droid Pro is
a 1 gigahertz omap processor omap 3620
to be exact you're also going to have
512 megabytes of RAM this is no joke in
2048 megabytes of RAM or 2048 let's call
it roughly two gigs here of course going
to have the four capacitive buttons the
android buttons your menu your home your
back in your search key and you're going
to see some of the motorola and verizon
logo as well as styling on the front and
the back of this device so let's go
ahead and give you a quick tour once
again we do have that physical keyboard
of the front as well of those capacitive
keys moving on to the left side of the
device we're going to have a silver
accent or a silver trim relatively plane
here however we're going to have one
user programmable key you can actually
set any application you want to open at
the command of that key we've actually
gone ahead and used that many times
we've actually set it now to Twitter
which will actually see and our software
overviews will actually give you a demo
of that working the top of the device
will of course have your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and your power as well as
lock and unlock button the left side is
going to have you are up and down volume
rockers which of course is pretty
straightforward there and then you're
going to have your micro USB charging
port now one cool thing about this port
will bring it very close you can get a
good look here is it's actually
surrounded by rubber so the chances of
wrecking both of the port as well as the
actual charger itself are much slimmer
and one
very cool aspect of that is actually
during nighttime charging it will glow
will actually show you on camera here
we're going to go ahead and turn off
this lights that you can see it and then
once you plug your micro USB directly in
you're going to see that it actually
glows which is very cool at night when
you're in a very dark room it's a nice
little subtle effect you'll see on your
nightstand and at the bottom of the
device we will have the microphone port
in the left corner moving on to the back
of the device you're going to see once
again the motorola as well as the
verizon logo in effect plus you'll see
the with google now we're going to have
a 5 megapixel camera here with a dual
LED flash and then lastly you're going
to have the actual speaker port down
here at the bottom it's tough to see but
there's actually a girl right there now
we did comment on this on our unboxing
video but this back pattern is actually
very cool looking it's a nice little
silver wave effect never go ahead and
actually take this battery cover off
we're going to see the 1420 our milliamp
battery will zoom in a little bit
further here and you're going to be
greeted by a unique surprise which is a
sim car which is definitely new to see
on a verizon device however this is a
world phone so i should go ahead and pop
this battery out this is a world phone
so this sim card will grant you cell
phone reception throughout the world now
basically when you're in the united
states going to be using the cdma
network and it will actually be the
frequencies of eight hundred and
nineteen hundred however when you leave
the country whether it be canada europe
pretty much you name it it's going to
open up an entirely new aspect of
reception that's going to be gsm and
UMTS and actually the frequencies that
the gsm spectrum is going to cover will
be 850 900 eighteen hundred and nineteen
hundred and then finally for UMTS which
will be the 3g on the gsm band you're
going to have 850 nineteen hundred and
twenty one hundred so once again
wherever you go you will have coverage
now you're going to also have a
pre-installed two gig micro SD
card from sandisk here this is
expandable up to 32 gigs so you'll have
that nice luxury like you do currently
with most Android or other smartphones
one great note about the camera is that
it actually capable of recording 720p I
want Motorola claims to be 30 frames per
second we're actually going to give you
a video camera test video in the future
so make sure you stay tuned to see that
lastly in terms of the connectivity
options you're going to have Wi-Fi BG
and M which is good to see that n
included there and of course you're
going to have the bluetooth 2.1
capability if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up and if you have any
questions at all feel free to post them
on the YouTube video page for this
actual video or on the pocketnow.com
article and we'll be sure to answer them
if we can thanks for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
