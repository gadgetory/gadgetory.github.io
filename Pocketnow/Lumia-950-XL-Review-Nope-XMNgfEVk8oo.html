design and capable Hardware marred by
unfinished software you call it a
Windows 10 mobile phone I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and I can't
recommend this phone to almost anyone
this is the lumia 950xl we got this
review device as a loaner from clove
folks so if you want a 950xl of your own
and there are a few reasons why you
might you should pay them a visit at
clove code at UK and tell them PocketNow
sent you so why would you want a 950xl
some reasons are straightforward with a
big user replaceable battery and
wireless charging a Snapdragon 810
processor backed up by expandable memory
a big beautiful quad HD display and a
big beautiful 20 megapixel camera
there's a lot to love here echos of
Nokia's former dominance remain little
details like the 2 stage camera button
and the 4 microphone rich audio
recording and futuristic novelties like
Windows hello a feature that lets you
scan into the phone with your iris
instead of a thumb and the 950xl works
just like the 950 when it comes to
continuum plug it into the display dock
or stream over miracast to turn your TV
or monitor into an approximation of
Windows 10 the XL still has all the
shortcomings of the 950 despite its
beefier processor like sluggish browsing
and pretty anemic app compatibility but
that doesn't make its potential any less
compelling those features almost make up
for the 950 XL s fit and finish which is
generic at best and chintzy at worst
with a tinny rear firing speaker and a
back cover that creaks and pops with
even light handling
there are even reasons to want this
phone on the software side Windows 10
mobile is very slick looking with a very
flexible homescreen design we've been
through a few iterations of Start screen
and we've finally settled on something
that gives us a lot of info at a glance
without feeling too cluttered if you
disagree you can make Windows 10 mobile
look pretty much like anything you want
and thanks to Universal interface
concepts like hamburger menus the top
mounted action center and the reach
ability clone it's pretty easy to get
used to windows on the phone
if you're coming from iOS or Android
though we still miss the more elegant
more innovative interface paradigm of
earlier versions of Windows Phone and
when you fire up that big camera on the
back you get the same sweet rich capture
mode is on the 950 there's a lot of wow
factor here you can take a photo with
the new triple tone LED flash and then
decide after the fact how much of that
flash you want in there which is just
amazing or if you want bust out the
manual controls to define ISO exposure
and focus levels with sliders this is a
better camera if you have a little time
to set up the shot but the camera is
still one of the best assets this phone
has in this respect the 950 XL does the
Lumia line proud
with all the excels got going for it why
the negative tone at the top because
Windows 10 mobile is a hot mess people
like to make excuses for this platform
for a few reasons first as I said before
it's beautiful and its UI often makes
the competition look downright
unsophisticated second it's very
futuristic with assets like continuum
and hello the third Microsoft's long
game is very seductive if there are over
a hundred million Windows 10 devices out
there and a common code base across
mobile and desktop so yeah it's easy to
imagine a future where developers bring
their apps to mobile because it's so
easy to do and fourth people like to say
that Windows 10 mobile is in beta so
it's bugs can be forgiven guys we can
give you the first three points because
they're valid but you need to stop
saying Windows 10 mobile is in beta it's
not the 950xl isn't part of a demo
program or a pre-release device it's on
sale to real people right now and
nowhere does Microsoft even intimate
that its mobile platform might be
lacking but it is nowhere is this more
plain than in the Windows Store which is
basically broken you can't download apps
more than half the time can't really
download apps in the background on top
of that some apps refuse to run even
though the phone says they're installed
and there are incompatibility errors
when trying to download or update many
titles in the store other Lumia users
have been complaining of similar
problems for weeks and it's persisted on
our unit despite both an update to the
store and an OS upgrade and many of the
problems we noted on the 950 are also
present on the XL issues like the Start
screen
straight up vanishing after one of those
app update errors problems like Outlook
being very slow to download and send
email voice dictation cutting us off
after just a few words and getting many
of those words wrong the speaker has
hang out five seconds of white noise
after every sound the phone makes the
phone occasionally exhausting its
battery in hours instead of the day plus
we can usually squeeze out of it why
some speculate it's a problem with the
new Skype integration in messaging but
there's so much wrong with this platform
that it's tough to say for sure to all
this the window's loyalists refrain is
always wait for the next update people
are saying that the 0.36 upgrade solves
these issues but we're still waiting on
that package to hit our device and you
know what people also said to wait for
the update when we ran into that 4k
recording bug on our first 950 which
then reappeared on our second 950 and
followed us all the way to the 950 XL
even though we're recording to local
storage and not a memory card again this
isn't insider preview software this is
what Microsoft is selling in stores to
normal people for the record Microsoft
did not respond to a request for comment
on these issues is there hope for the
future
sure some developers who left the
platform in the past are now building
apps for the new Windows 10 a trend we
hope continues the software while not in
beta is still quite young so updates
will fix some of the problems eventually
the hardware is powerful enough to run
most high demand games in the store when
they don't crash and if you're the kind
of superfan who wants a Windows Phone no
matter what you may not think twice
about dropping the dough on this thing
which after all has a pretty great
camera and some very fun features but
every time I feel like cutting this
thing some slack another bug pops up or
I try to shoot a video and the phone
watches it it's this kind of bush-league
stuff that convinces me that this is a
terrible buy for anyone but the most
die-hard Microsoft fan if you're
literally anyone else you'll save a lot
of money and a lot of hassle springing
for an Android or iOS device for which
even Microsoft itself has built better
apps while those platforms aren't
without their bugs and shortcomings at
least they feel like finished product
today the 950 XL feels like anything but
it's more like reference hardware for a
platform that might be ready sometime in
2016 not a complete smartphone that
earns its $650 price tag
