and today we're going to take a quick
look at an alternative browser for the g
one this is steel it's available from
the android market while it is still in
its infancy it still offers a few
features at the native android browser
it's lacking at this time the interface
is basically to ribbons one at the top
this one I kind of have trouble with
it's your address bar basically refresh
button and that's also a stop button and
then a ribbon at the bottom which has
add bookmark back zoom in zoom out
bookmarks and as well as the forward
pressing the menu key will take you to
the options device settings browser
settings privacy and data management
know what's cool about these device
settings is right here you can see auto
rotate with keyboard show you how that
works right now we have a profile mode
just simply turn it around and it goes
into landscape mode and right back
automatically so you don't even need to
open up the keyboard buzz on key touch
when you come up here to this ribbon up
here and you're going to enter in
something let's get that dough and earn
something there's an on-screen keyboard
it's pretty cool it kind of hard to
kind of works like some of the ones you
might be used to a little bit different
but it buzzes when you touch it so touch
the keys it's not the the best keyboard
on in the world but Google is working on
an on-screen keyboard for future
releases and hopefully it'll work better
than this one another cool setting is
the user agent right now it's
identifying itself as Android so that
brings up the mobile version of all
shadow com the desktop user agent brings
up a full desktop version of all shadow
com an iphone will bring up the iphone
version of all shadow com let's take a
look at the iphone 4 so this is what
iphone users see when they look at all
shadow com how much of a difference but
good enough can also change the layout
from normal to narrow column single
column as well change your cash choose
whether or not you want to say form data
passwords and allow cookies or clear out
that data well it works just fine there
are still some basic features missing
that will hopefully show up in future
releases it's good to seek up some
competition for browsers on the android
platform that's all for this mini review
be sure to check out all shadow coms
main page forums and wiki for more tips
tricks tax mods and reviews for t mobile
smart phones until next time I'm Mike
Benton for all shadow com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
