her office and it's time to get this
thing out of the box I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and this is a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014
edition unboxing samsung has made some
seriously seriously powerful smartphones
over the last year and we've been
waiting for them to make a comparable
tablet and this is it this is the Galaxy
Note 10.1 2014 edition and on the inside
it has almost all the same
specifications as the Galaxy Note 3 this
is the octa-core version this is the
Wi-Fi model which comes with a 1.9
gigahertz quad core and 1.3 gigahertz
quad core processors inside that work
together an 8 megapixel camera this has
full HD so 1080p playback which none of
their other tablets with the exception
of the Nexus 10 have had 1080p
capabilities 3 gigabytes of RAM it has
your S Pen of course because it is a
note it has an IR blaster and an 8200 or
80 to 20 milliamp hour battery so let's
get this thing out of the box and see
what it's all about very simple there of
tools required and let's put this thing
to the side just for a minute so this is
the Wi-Fi model no LTE on board and on
the inside we have the power adapter so
your AC adapter and your USB cord so
unlike the note 3 this one actually
doesn't have USB 3.0 it only has your
standard microUSB port which you can see
there on the bottom edge so no USB 3.0
which you'd think it'd be a little more
fitting on a tablet than on a smartphone
but I digress and these are your
replacement tips for your S Pen and
that's all we have inside the box of
course some reading information a lot a
very thick pamphlet as comically thick
let's put this away and take a look at
the tablet because that's what we all
care about box is cool and all but uh no
headphones nothing special inside the
box so let's put this to the side and
forget about it
take a look this thing owning a Galaxy
has its rewards you can go to Samsung's
Boy
say and see what the perks of having a
galaxy are so this is a 10.1 inch wqxga
display so it's the same size and
resolution as we see on the Nexus 10 so
it's a 2560 by 1600 pixel resolution
display and that is insane because it
10.1 inches that gives you 229 No 299
pixels per inch so that is insane where
others are still in the 100's this one
is pushing 300 pixels per inch so that
is awesome let's just take a quick tour
of the hardware if we can get this
plastic off really quickly oh yeah this
is gonna give us a good nice sound yes
it's been forever since uh since any of
the plastic has given me a nice sound
nothing on the front sorry there but on
the back this has the same leather like
texture that you see on the note so it's
it's like Michael said with the white
Note 3 this one is not nearly as tacky
as the black cover and it's the same
here it's still plastic you can
definitely tell it's plastic but it
feels sort of like leather and I have to
say immediately this is the first I've
touched a white faux leather device from
Samsung the black feels much much nicer
more premium and this one is it's not
bad but it you can definitely tell it's
a lot more plastic feeling than the
black cover there's your 8 megapixel
camera here and on the side you've got
the same or at least a very similar
s-pen as what you can find on the note 3
and you will compare those later on it
does look and feel about the same on the
top here we've got your IR blaster
volume rocker power button side we've
got your side mounted speakers your
micro SD card slot micro USB port on the
bottom edge and your headphone jack and
speaker on the right so it's a very
similar configuration to the Galaxy Tab
10.1 that we reviewed earlier this month
or earlier this year but you do have the
advantages like the s-pen on the top
here and it has your same button
configuration menu back home and your 2
megapixel front-facing camera
that really the only thing is the the 80
to 20 million power battery on the
inside and before we jump off here and
go play with this thing for a little bit
let's turn it on yeah of course they had
to pick the worst background possible
let's switch this out what's that
something nicer yeah this is one I've
been using on the note three since I got
it and it is super crisp super sharp and
that panel looks amazing
it seems pretty snappy so far but
Michael did have some trouble with the
octave with his note 3 so we'll see how
it works out with this one on the note
10.1 so stay tuned for the full review
and some comparisons and all kinds of
other stuff with the note 10.1 2014
