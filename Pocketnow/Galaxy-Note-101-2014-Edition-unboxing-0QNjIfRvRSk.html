her office and it's time to get this
thing out of the box I'm Taylor Martin
this is pocket now and this is a galaxy
note 10.1 2014 edition unboxing Samsung
has made some seriously seriously
powerful smartphones over the last year
and we've been waiting for them to make
a comparable tablet and this is it this
is the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition and
on the inside it has almost all the same
specifications as the Galaxy Note 3 this
is the octa-core version this is the
Wi-Fi model which comes with a 1.9
gigahertz quad-core and one point three
gigahertz quad-core processors inside
that work together an 8 megapixel camera
this has full HD so 1080p playback which
none of their other tablets with the
exception of the Nexus 10 have had 1080p
capabilities 3 gigabytes of RAM it has
your S Pen of course because it is a
note it has an IR blaster and an 80 200
or 80 to 20 million power battery so
let's get this thing out of the box and
see what it's all about very simple
there of tools required and let's put
this thing to the side just for a minute
so this is the Wi-Fi model no LT onboard
and on the inside we have the power
adapter so your AC adapter and your USB
cord so unlike the note 3 this one
actually doesn't have USB 3.0 it only
has your standard microUSB port which
you can see there on the bottom edge so
no USB 3.0 which you think it'd be a
little more fitting on a tablet than on
a smartphone but I digress and these are
your replacement tips for your S Pen and
that's all we have inside the box of
course some reading information a lot a
very thick pamphlet is comically thick
let's put this away and take a look at
the tablet because that's what we all
care about this box is cool and all but
uh no headphones nothing special inside
the box so let's put this to the side
and forget about it take a look this
thing owning a galaxy has its rewards
you can go to
Samsung's wide web site and see what the
perks of having a galaxy are so this is
a 10.1 inch wqxga display so it's the
same size and resolution as we see on
the Nexus 10 so it's a 2560 by 1600
pixel resolution display and that is
insane because at 10.1 inches that gives
you 229 no 299 pixels per inch so that
is insane where others are still in the
100's this one is pushing 300 pixels per
inch so that is awesome let's just take
a quick tour of the hardware if we can
get this plastic off really quickly oh
yeah this is going to give us a good
nice sound yes it's been forever since
uh since any of the plastic has given me
a nice sound nothing on the front so
sorry there but on the back this has the
same leather like texture that you see
on the note so it's like Michael said
with the white note 3 this one is not
nearly as tacky as the black cover and
it's the same here it's still plastic
you can definitely tell it's plastic but
it feels sort of like leather and i have
to say immediately this is the first
i've touched a white faux leather device
from Samsung the black feels much much
nicer more premium and this one is it's
not bad but it you can definitely tell
it's a lot more plastic feeling than the
black cover there's your 8 megapixel
camera here and on the side you've got
the same or at least a very similar
s-pen as which you can find on the note
3 and you will compare those later on it
does look and feel about the same on the
top here we've got your IR blaster
volume rocker power button side we've
got your side mounted speakers or micro
SD card slot micro USB port on the
bottom edge and your headphone jack and
speaker on the right so it's a very
similar configuration to the galaxy tab
10.1 that we reviewed earlier this month
or earlier this year but you do have the
advantages like the S Pen on the top
here and it has your same button
configuration menu back home and your
2-megapixel front-facing camera a
than that really the only thing is the
the 80 to 20 million power battery on
the inside and Before we jump off here
and go play with this thing for a little
bit let's turn it on yeah of course they
had to pick the worst background
possible let's switch this out what's
that something nicer burgers yeah this
is 1 i've been using on the note 3 since
i got it and it is super crisp super
sharp and that panel looks amazing it
seems pretty snappy so far but Michael
did have some trouble with the octave
with his note 3 so we'll see how it
works out with this one on the note 10.1
so stay tuned for the full review and
some comparisons and all kinds of other
stuff with the note 10.1 2014 edition
