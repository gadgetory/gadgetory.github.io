forgive the casual attire but I was
asleep I was almost asleep when my
colleague Adam Daode sent me a text
message said you know what tomorrow is I
said no I don't he said it's the fourth
anniversary of the launch of the Palm
Pre the official start of the all too
short webOS era but there wasn't any
time in June sixth scheduled at
PocketNow to get an extra video in we
have too much to do we have a you review
we've pocket our weekly we have all this
stuff so I thought at 1:00 in the
morning it would be a great time to film
a throwback unboxing just to pay a
little bit of tribute to the Palm Pre
and to one of the great lost operating
systems of our time so without further
ado and thanks to the prudent calendar
monitoring skills of Adam Dowd pocket
now brings you a throwback unboxing of
the Palm Pre I was in line on this day
exactly four years ago waiting outside
Boston's Boylston streets print store
yes webOS had enough buzz in 2009 to
generate lines all to get this box the
packaging was made of premium materials
that let you know that what was inside
was valuable layers of high-density
plastic that still hold up well to this
day
and finally nestled in its own
protective tray behind the legend
designed in and inspired by California
the device itself the first-generation
Palm Pre and then as you dug deeper into
the box who hid packet after packet of
literature all of it emblazoned with
branding Sprint and Palm I remind her
that at one time these two companies had
teamed up proudly to try to sell
something great to try to build
something new
the attention to detail extended all the
way to the welcome pamphlets with their
folded over tabs and orange bindings to
the little chrome embed in the power
cable and while the screen protector has
long vanished from my own pre which
bears the scars of solid year of use the
protector is still on the stock battery
cover which didn't see much use since it
wasn't compatible with the touchstone
how about a little peel off then for old
times sake
slapping the old battery cover back on
and putting the preface down you can
almost imagine it's 2009 again the pre
still a shining beacon of hope for those
who want to have their breath taken away
by a smartphone that isn't called an
iPhone or an Android sitting with the
pre I'm reminded that phones once were
reasonably sized before they got so big
as to seem ludicrous the pre sat
beautifully in the hand because of its
rounded design it wasn't trying to win
any slimness contests because it didn't
have to it was designed for humans
before that slogan was even dreamed up
by another company and then there was
that keyboard slightly gummy slightly
tacky and nowhere near as responsive as
it should have been but still a
slide-out keyboard from one of the
companies that made them a standard on
mobile devices a keyboard that worked
together with a touch screen using a
gesture area that was an entirely new
idea the flimsy USB port cover actually
stayed with my pre for the entirety of
my year of using it as my daily driver
but sadly the battery did not not
remembering whether webOS devices needed
batteries to boot or not I decided to
try my luck cross my fingers and plug in
the pre is inquisitive where's my
battery I don't have the heart to tell
it i bundled that battery in as a
value-add to sweeten the pot when I sold
the pre 2 on eBay after the crash I
would have to settle for popping an old
sim into the pre 3 that our multimedia
manager Jaime Rivera had graciously
gifted me knowing my love for the dead
platform and so that's what I did
the pries more recent more capable but
ultimately just as doomed sibling came
to life beside it and for a few minutes
flicking cards around and universal
searching to my heart's content
I remembered the joy of a new platform
it felt like and yes this is mawkish but
it's true coming home
I've moved on since then of course not
just because I entered the technology
field but because like everyone else I
had to I was forced to and while I'm
glad things have progressed I still
think it's only proper to stop every
once in a while and pay tribute to a
great platform that helped push modern
smartphones to their current heights
because while we should always keep our
eye on the future we shouldn't forget
those who propelled us there thank you
