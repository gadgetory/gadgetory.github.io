pocketnow.com and today we're doing the
unboxing for the sprint Nexus S 4G so
sit back relax and enjoy the show
now the Nexus S 4G from Sprint is a
Google specific phone it is co-developed
with Google it's taking kind of the
replacement for the original Nexus S
it's got a WiMAX the 4G data network
through Sprint it's got a 4-inch contour
display one gigahertz hummingbird
processor a front and rear facing camera
it's got 16 gigs of internal memory
which is really great and it's got a
near-field communications chip which
we're anxious to try out it does have
the ability through sprint to even port
the number but that's available rather
support the number from Google Voice
that's available from just about any
sprint device now as well that said we
can see the device here it's very very
thin and light it's got a lot of plastic
on it right now but we'll strip that off
in just a minute and boot it up
underneath the holder here we find the
getting started guide and the various
manuals and beyond that we've got the
standard micro USB cable a charging
adapter USB of course and a pair of
headphones that's it for the box let's
take a look at the phone as we mentioned
before it's got a 1 gigahertz
hummingbird processor and if we peel off
the plastic here we can see that it's
got kind of a it's hard to see from here
but it's got this rounded display just a
little tiny bit of a rounded edge it's
got a little curve here on the bottom a
little lump on the back it's not as bad
as the pictures would make you think
it's good and peel this up here as well
it's got some instructions on where to
pop the back cover off of we've got the
5 megapixel camera flash speaker black
and under here is our 1500 million power
battery it's a different shape than the
original galaxy s is which is
unfortunate because I've got two of the
others and then your standard
information underneath here
clicks together very nicely feels nice
in the hand
we got the volume rocker over here and
on this side we've just got a power
button no dedicated camera key
unfortunately on the bottom is our
headphone jack and our charging port and
our microphone hole right there compared
to the Sprint epic if we pop the
keyboard open we can see that the
keyboard tray is similarly sized as the
Nexus S but the hole of the device is
quite a bit larger than this new phone
let's go ahead and boot it up
while it's hard to see in this video the
screen is really got a good contrast
with the black in the background and the
color is just fantastic go ahead and
skip this we will say yes for now since
it's a borrowed phone and here we are
with Gingerbread which we'll do a deeper
review later it's got this nice
scrolling icon piece up and down I've
already got a voicemail battery
indicator swipe back and forth moves
pretty screen through the screens pretty
quickly which is not surprising with the
hummingbird processor which we've seen
before on other devices
with a device actually on you can see
the backlit standard Android buttons
here back menu search and home strangely
in completely different places or not
maybe not strangely then the epic which
is going to take some getting used to
the backlighting is quite a bit brighter
on the epic than it is on the Nexus 4
the Nexus S rather 4G but we'll try to
find out where that setting is and
probably can increase that very easily
that wraps up the unboxing for the Nexus
S 4G from Sprint if you have any
comments or questions leave them in the
comments section below or on the website
