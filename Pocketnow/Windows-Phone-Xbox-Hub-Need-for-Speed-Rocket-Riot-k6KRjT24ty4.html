you've locked in with your windows live
ID your avatar actually pops up within
the top and then you'll see any
notifications that you've got from
friends to play games that will actually
show up on the tile as well and that's
that's new back in mobile of Congress we
didn't have a lot
right
it's like I've announced I go straight
into the game set we land right on your
friend requests so these are turn based
games that your friends can request to
play play with you
the next screen over this is all of your
games
Xbox or not any game that you download
on the dose 17 would show up here
we'd also have some trials demos from us
that we would recommend with
spotlight is any xbox live news so any
new titles that we're releasing for that
week tips and tricks on how to play a
game better how to dress your avatar
that kind of stuff that all shows up I
have a question on the previous year
what are the prices the average price on
a game like the sins so we're not
actually announcing pricing just yet
it'll be a it'll be a range of prices
and then the next screen over is your
your gamer profile so you've got your
avatar your gamers your gamertag and
you're all up gamerscore so any xbox
live game that you play on your phone
will go to your olive gamerscore on your
comes as well
and then this is any achievement that
I've unlocked recently
it's not my it's Joby who just is a demo
for so that's the add a box experience
one really cool thing I wanted to show
you guys this is a it's an application
you can download and once you downloaded
it upgrades the games have experienced
so it becomes part of the games have for
you there's a couple of big things that
this app does one it takes your avatar
from 2d to 3d and you can customize your
avatar so you can go into the closet and
change them up he's a lot more animated
I can actually
shaken come on and he falls down
it was back up can poke him
play with them a little bit I can go
into the closet
can change either my features or my
style this is very much like the console
experience this is like an extension of
the xbox huh yes is it is it free that's
great and is there a way to get directly
to it instead of having them today Xbox
up first can you put into your charger
you absolutely can once you download
this this just becomes the game stuff
but you could so it'll be so once you
click on the xbox tile it'll take you
right to this but you went to the
regular xbox huh and then you went
only because it was an application that
you needed
so we wanted to be able to demo both our
shoes the best ways so this is a stub
demo just pour this for this particular
be a little bit different it'll be a
little bit different so once you
download it it would just be the games
come experience
so for example
this changes sure just to show you guys
what it was
I like that shirt
she looks great we're going to go ahead
and save that I also think why don't I
try and change some of my shoes like
these work the boots
shows me that I say yep I like it I get
out of the Style section
and I save him he doesn't happiness for
me this will be saved to my console as
well so integrated experience with your
avatar your gamerscore and your gamertag
at all is seamless to the xbox live
experience the other cool thing the app
does
it shows me all of my latest
achievements
this is my most recent achievement that
I've unlocked these are all of my games
that I have
I go in the hexa crush for example will
show me any achievement that I when
locked or that I haven't unlocked yet so
for example if i go into one that i have
unlocked my avatar is happy I go into
something that I haven't unlocked say
something a little bit harder down here
so you're able to really track all of
your achievements
the other thing it does is show you all
of your friends so online or offline
with their statuses and then if you
wanted to
check out what your friends are doing
check out their profile check out their
avatar that shows up there as well you
can also send investors
you can also compare
your scores to theirs so
you can see all of the games you guys
have in common
I go into extra brush for example
that kind one
they have an unlocked but I have unhappy
and he said
so a lot of interaction within the Xbox
Live community
and then one other big thing that the
app does is it allows you to check all
of your messages and send anybody within
the Xbox Live community a message
need for speed on there I do
toys games
need for speed this is an EA game
I actually have the EA rep here too he
wanted to just get more background or
around the around the game
the games are coming toward us what's up
yeah
so the titles we're announcing today
monopoly Need for Speed sim 3 and Tetris
basics covered basics covered absolutely
but it's got the Xbox LIVE edition on
top of it so any any wins that you have
here would be part of your favorite
sport
so select my car
show you this
beautiful graphics pick our route
this walks you through the scenario that
you're about to do kind of sets up the
plot
skip
it's short though
you
alright so worth the race so this really
takes advantage of the accelerometer
that's how you maneuver your car
to the game support for a gyroscope
we don't have any at launch
can an OEM pwnage iris within our
windows for example
not at this point
graphics look as good as iphone I play
this game all the time
do you want to play a little bit just
with your pretty
level we can make it harder for you
and you can make them faster by
push it yeah
yeah I mean it looks good yeah looks
good
yes
and the sense
I actually think he's that one uploaded
the one that's on here because we'd have
to do a whole bunch of setup on it
so I'll let him walk you through that
but there's also some microsoft game
studio games you want to show something
see something else
sorry for cool if their goal proper try
it's pretty cool that one so this is an
xbox live arcade game that we've now
ported over to mobile it's been hugely
successful author calls
so the idea here is that your
environment is completely destroyable
but it does build up pretty quickly and
you'll have different campaigns love
either enemies let's do let's do a quick
play or they give you some sort of test
I love the old school rap
so of course we're setting up the plot
block beard is sakis and captured
he's now going to take revenge he's
escaping
through a tunnel
trying to get to the game for you guys
you always got to set up the story
I know I know so here I've got 10
enemies that I need to kill
it's kind of giving you before you start
it gives you a little bit of the lay of
the land
how it works is I move here to move my
guy so I'll start so I need to move them
this way and then I can shoot this
I need to find my enemies
this little little arrows down below
we'll kind of direct you I can choose
through all of this
Oh
you get hit the whole phone starts to
shake too
and then you can pick up additional
little boosters those are the little
boxes that are flying through the air
30 who I need to pick that up
give me some extra power
haha
get out of here
ok
over here
did oh yes
Adam
pick up zach phillips
two more enemies where are they
oh I get it back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
