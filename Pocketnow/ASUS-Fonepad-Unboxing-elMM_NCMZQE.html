doomed to having at all times two
devices with me a phone and a tablet and
for a long time I've been desperate for
a solution which would allow me to at
least leave the phone at home now there
are several solutions out there and
today's is one of them i'm anton denied
this is pocket now and you're watching
the asuste fonepad unboxing let's go
check it out at the end of the day there
are only two types of people those who
dismiss the idea of a tablet having an
earpiece right from the start and those
who will are like me and prefer this
this is the box of the assumes fonepad
really nice image on the front and the
issues branding on the bottom nothing
else special we have a picture of the
devices side and that's really it there
are two color options we have the gray
one and on the back we have some coal
outs which are pretty much the only
cutouts for for the specs as we can see
here this is powered by an Intel Atom
z2420 processor which is the Intel
Lexington platform it's got 1 gig of ram
16 gigs of storage of course wireless
Bluetooth and all the usual stuff but
let's go ahead and unbox it with the
obligatory not Caesars this time but the
knife so let's jump in and pop up on the
box it should slide out nice and easy
and put the top to the side we are
greeted with the phone pad itself on the
top as you'd expect we'll put that to
the side too and see what we have here
as usual we have lots of literature
which is black and white not really
interesting more literature then we have
a micro USB to USB syncing and charging
cable very very interesting alongside
with a World War a charger which is as
you can see with a european plug
everything is awesome let's put
everything to the side and take a look
at
fonepad itself this is it let's take a
quick look around the device real quick
right on top we have what's probably the
main biggest selling point of the device
it's the earpiece because this tablet
acts as a phone right next to it there's
the 1.3 megapixel camera and the biggest
part on the front is the screen which is
a 7-inch screen with a 800 x 1280
resolution and on the bottom you can see
the suits logo and nothing else and of
course there's nothing else on the right
side but the left side has a power
button and your volume rockers and while
we're at the back you'll notice that
there's no camera on the back the back
is completely aluminum and being cold
out right here is the Intel Inside
because this tablet is powered by an
Intel Atom z2420 processor which is also
known as the Lexington platform well
we're going to line up these devices for
a quick comparison against the Nexus 7
and the ipad mini I should tell you that
the the film pad rocks 1 gigabyte of RAM
and it is powered by a 40 to 70 million
power battery the processor is single
core but we'll see how well this will
perform because intel says that it is
built for android now comparing it to
the Nexus 7 you can see that these two
are not only siblings they are twins and
that's because a suits made the Nexus 7
and the Zeus is also making the film pad
in terms of thickness they are not
positionally approximately the same but
they are exactly the same and while the
Nexus 7 has a plastic back the has an
aluminum back pretty much like apples
mini iPad Mini which is also aluminum
but the differences stop there because
the iPad Mini is much much much thinner
as you can see now let's put it down and
start our first boot to finish up this
video power button
huge vibration feedback right there and
as you can see the assist logo backed up
by the intel inside logo on the bottom
nice issues animation and this should
bring us right to the setup screen there
we go that's it for today everyone make
sure to continue watching pocket now
because there's more coming up the asus
fonepad including comparisons and the
full review follow pocket now on all the
usual social media channels abon
antonina and you can follow me on
facebook and twitter and if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
thank you very much for watching till
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
