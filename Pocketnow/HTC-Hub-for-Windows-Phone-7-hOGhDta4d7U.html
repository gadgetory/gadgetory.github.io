I'm going to show you what HTC has done
to customize this HTC surround Windows 7
phone so here we go first up just go
over here in the programs listing we
have HTC hub now let's take a look at
this flying through clouds we land on a
clock zoom in a little more for you okay
so we've got a few featured apps right
now it's updating I believe that is
fully weather and you got a photo
enhancer stocks notes get more and this
is a refresh button some settings oh
where are we going okay that was our new
weather let's tap our weather lots of
flying around so here we got some
weather information the plus symbol will
add a new city this button right there I
can show you the list that's going to
give you locations and that's refresh so
if I do locations these are the cities
that are listed there so I could go to
that one and it's going to fly to Tokyo
I can also flick like that and get the
different different locations
lots of animation but it's still pretty
smooth you just kind of wait for it to
finish kind of cool demo mode this is in
case you really want to see what the
animation is gonna be if you are raining
yeah you got sound effects too
okay that's enough of that that's gonna
out of here let's just see how response
this is yeah if I press back it goes
back through another intermission okay
so this little arrow bring us to the HTC
hub for applications so these are
special programs that you can get on HTC
devices except for this that's a game
and let's try a foot on the answer okay
this is where you can buy it well it's
free to beat this is where you can
download it okay
now all these come already pre-installed
just the HTC hub so let's go and lunch
some of these will try the photo
enhancer now the thing about the photo
answer you can get to it from the
programs listing or the picture saga so
let's go to the picture sup instead and
let me choose a picture put this one and
check this out so I'm looking at
pictures and I say I want to do
something to this look at there's extras
there's photo and answer so that's going
to load that picture right into the
photo enhancer program and now I can do
all sorts of cool stuff to it that's
automatic enhance cinnamon high contrast
if I press it
sepia overexposed glimmer Twilight
lively warm
cool basic frame frame around that leak
it's kind of weird
vintage is interesting and antique so
you get a bunch of different filters and
then we can save it and it's going to go
save and these safe pictures folder and
then can post a Facebook or email it or
send it through picture message any of
that so that's a really cool little
program what else have we got
stocks there you go
so pretty basic stop your graph no
swiping you can change the date range
but we do have when it's good so that's
nice
all right you got your plus for adding
ones see what's in Settings download on
Mac the every hour okay cool
the sound enhancer is another good one
especially for the surround because we
have these great speakers and you can
choose no effects still be mobile or srs
enhancement for the audio or for the
video okay the equalizer appears to
require out the headphones all right we
got notes that's another one
ooh animation looks like
nope this is portrait
hi
first of all to move notes
that's pretty cool
see what the settings are in each period
one week sound effects yes
that's a lot of fun
converter this is also an HTC program so
you can convert a temperature or any of
these units
pretty good
let's have landscape nope okay
let's go back to the HTC hub see if we
missed anything
it looks like that's it for now well
it's also connections set up I didn't
download that because this is on a teen
teen it's already set up so what that
would do if you had an unlocked phone
and would help you automatically
configure the network settings so that's
it for the HTC software customizations
the hub appears by default as the live
tile when you buy the device but I
turned it off because looks better but a
free pool interesting add-ons and that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
