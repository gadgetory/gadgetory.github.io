watching a phone review and when the
reviewer gets to the camera section all
day poster a couple of terrible shots
while writing that camera off because
it's not on their favorite phone let's
do something about this we live in an
age where the only camera a person might
own is the one bolted to the back of
their phone so we're giving it the same
attention we might give a standalone
camera there's more smartphone
photography than just ultra pickles and
selfies shooting in real-world
conditions were going to cover color
saturation exposure optics image
stabilization bulk a low-light focusing
video and any other fun features the
manufacturer might have packed on I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now and
here's our real camera review of the HTC
ten buckle up folks we have a lot of
ground to cover and I'm gonna move
pretty quick first a little housekeeping
the HTC ten is utilizing a one over 2.3
inch 12 megapixel image sensor with a
native 4 by 3 aspect ratio the lens has
a wide 26 millimeter equivalent field of
view and a fast F 1.8 aperture paired
with optical image stabilization and
laser focus assistance I shot samples at
full res and this video is being
uploaded at UHD resolution to match the
highest quality output from the camera
any adjustments made to the images here
will be detailed in the upper left
corner of the frame we held off on this
review to check out the differences in
the newest software update at the time
this review was produced the HTC 10 was
still available for pre-order but hadn't
yet started shipping right off the bat
early criticisms pointed to washed out
images where we wanted to see a bit more
contrast and saturation applied to
photos and this new camera update seems
to be addressing many of those concerns
blues and greens are well represented
Browns and earth tones avoids shifting
into orangish territory and bright light
warmer colors like yellows are well
captured and even though the saturation
has been bumped up we do a respectable
job of preventing clipped details in
bright parts of these pedals now Reds
are always difficult for digital sensors
to expose for properly the 10 manages to
retain fine detail but the JPEG
processing here is taking a bit of a
guess as to what this color should look
like and looking at some blossoms in
bright light the reds and Pink's here
are sizzling we lose a little more
detail as this pushes more magenta than
these flowers really look
though this is a pretty common issue
across most cameras white objects in
direct Sun are extremely hard to meter
for and shooting in auto the 10 Clips
this white flower pretty bad there's not
much info left to recover here in high
contrast situations the 10 is able to
hold on to info and shadows without
completely blowing out the texture of
the wall opening up the raw image we can
easily pull more info out of this rough
exterior now purposely overexposing a
shot by two stops as the camera meters
we can't quite recover the shot by
dialing back exposure and post but these
RAW files handily survive some fairly
extreme edits for a phone camera average
JPEG sizes are between two and five
megabytes per image RAW files are close
to 24 megabytes per exposures so saving
both means eating up close to 30
megabytes per shot definitely a
situation where photography heavy users
will probably want to invest in a memory
card now the 10 doesn't have the best
minimum focusing distance for macro fans
unfortunately locking somewhere around 4
inches from the lens it's more than an
inch off from competitors like the
galaxy s7 and LG g5 a close-up shots
will look nice but getting closer would
have been appreciated as there's a
little less resolution to play with for
cropping and closed and the sensor
paired with an F 1.8 aperture gives us a
really pleasantly shallow depth-of-field
backgrounds blur nicely objects behind
your subject will be less distracting
and we get fun little bouquet balls on
reflections or light filtering through
leaves adding lasers to this focusing
system helps quite a bit in improving
accuracy now this is not the fastest
system we've tested but miss focus
situations are rare until you push into
macro territory or extreme low-light and
this camera does a very good job in
landing accurate white balance we get
really warm afternoon light in Los
Angeles and before the update colors
were washed out but happily now we're
seeing a bit more of the glow we would
want to see from a juicy JPEG a shaded
shots also avoid the bluish over
corrections we might see on some
competitors I'm checking out high
dynamic range our early testing on HDR
photos was disappointing but playing
with a few more setups I have to change
my tune the HTC 10 is doing a better job
than most androids and reining in
highlights all too often HDR photos are
just shadow brightening modes remember
the white flour with blown out
highlights the TENS HDR mode manages to
pull back some of that clipping this
isn't as consistent a performer as
Apple's HDR processing and there are
plenty of situations where it still
blows out the shot but I'm very happy to
see some attempt made at controlling
brightness for shooting ultra wide
panorama performance here is mid-pack
stitching performance has improved from
the last update but we still see a few
more stitching failures or errors than I
would like on busy setups like the
street scene and the overall exposure
tends to favor the darkest part of your
scan so the whole finished shot often
washes out or feels too bright I'm not a
huge fan of selfies but adding optical
image stabilization to the front shooter
makes the front camera a more
competitive option indoor shots come out
a little brighter and a little clearer
and video is much improved over most of
the CSEC results competitors produce
most phones exposed a touch brighter
than I think they need to at night and
the 10 is no exception on well-lit
street scenes happily this doesn't
result in excessive degradation due to
noise reduction those dialing back the
exposure touch brings in a nicely
balanced shot with less fine detail
smearing when shooting in darker
locations like our creepy tunnel this
JPEG rendering can't contain the high
ISO noise and the result is both grainy
er and smudgy err a minor exposure
correction helps a little to alleviate
that issue on this shot we can also
easily see that the lens HTC is using is
quite nice for such a wide field of view
and a large aperture we're only seeing
minor fringing in aberration moving to
our creepy gate HTC's camera app is
focused on finding the true white of
this gate almost completely ignoring the
ugly yellow orange security lighting in
the scene also peeking in on the raw
file in producing a brighter jpg we're
blurring out a lot of detail in this
gate a situation where a little less
brightness and a little more contrast
might help pull more detail out of the
shot our walkway test shows off great
color accuracy between these two bulbs
and we've got very good dynamic range
here as the hot spots under each lamp
are fairly well contained looking at
some small pink flowers lit by a porch
lamp even with image stabilization the
HTC has difficulty landing a sharp image
our best single exposure of five
handheld shots is still fairly blurry in
almost no light the 10 is able to find
this flower on full auto which is
impressive but
tapping on the screen to focus instantly
confuses the camera and focus never
recovers until we go back to full auto a
situation where the lg laser focusing
system still excels throwing the flash
lands really well exposed shots with
very good color in dim indoor lighting
situations there seems to be a two-stage
action which helps fill in shadowed and
darker objects which might be otherwise
underexposed we have a full selection of
manual options to play with white
balance exposure compensation ISO
shutter speed and manual focus these are
very helpful for folks looking to dial
in the specific settings needed for a
photo these sliders can be difficult to
read in daylight however is this white
text is really small and we don't have
any other metering info like a histogram
to help inform our shots this is
compounded when shooting videos we have
tiny text counting down from 6 minutes
which is the limit for UHD video it's an
unfamiliar brain twist to be told how
much time you have remaining as opposed
to how long you've been shooting also
the maximum shutter we can play with is
only 2 seconds so folks who enjoy long
exposure shots might be disappointed if
this app is really well organized and
happily adjusting any menu setting HTC
never completely removes you from your
composition window while making an
adjustment you still have some
relationship to what you're trying to
shoot moving the video we're saving a
very high quality file here around a 60
megabit per second bit rate which can
eat up storage pretty quickly it's over
400 megabytes per minute of video a
happily we move to spot metering when
shooting video back to that white flower
instead of trying to expose for the
background the 10 adjusts brightness for
the exact spot I focus on this can make
night shots a little tricky sometimes
but more often than not you'll probably
want the object you focus on to be
properly exposed for while we get a nice
high-quality UHD mode at 30 frames per
second we don't get a 60 frame per
second mode for 1080p video which is
disappointing for those who want to
capture crisp action looking at the zoom
HTC restricts the range here a bit more
than other manufacturers have this
reduces the amount of reach but we
aren't blowing up the image as much and
it preserves video quality a little bit
better one of the trade-offs of a lower
resolution sensor but the 10 nicely
balances the need to
against saving a video you might
actually want to look at on video we can
also take a closer look at image
stabilization and it's just okay there's
a very narrow range of correction at
play here when trying to hold this still
as possible we see subtle shifts to rein
in slight hand shake but introducing any
movement into the shot like walking
easily overpowers the amount of
Correction this lens can provide while
competing manufacturers can sometimes be
accused of producing jello II or seasick
inducing video HCC seems to have swung
far in the opposite direction this might
be a contributing factor in some of the
poor low-light photography we
encountered examining audio playback on
an HTC is always a joy and listening to
the audio recorded on an HTC is always
excellent opening up the mkv files
produced here we see the HTC is storing
F lack lossless audio paired with
terrific microphones and even-handed
noise reduction filtering we have
best-in-class performance for an Android
and one of the closest competitors we've
ever heard against Lumia smartphones
onto an exposure test moving from dark
to bright and back the ten blooms nicely
as the scene gets brighter but white
balance is extremely slow to respond to
changing light conditions the
transitions are very abrupt moving back
to a darker part of the frame and the
camera in adjusting these conditions
seems to be dropping a few frames during
this lateral pan post update low-light
video still pushes a touch brighter than
it might need to and this results in a
bit more noise than we'd like to see but
overall we get a good image out of this
phone reflections and fringing are
easier to see while the camera is moving
but they aren't substantially different
from other large aperture phone cameras
and looking at slow motion video it's a
fun feature to play with though output
doesn't quite reach the quality or the
smoothness of competitors like the
iPhone or galaxy s7 we seem to be locked
in at a 120 frames per second 720p or we
might be limited to only a 4x speed
reduction but we can't find any options
for altering this mode to go slower so
let's wrap this up where does that leave
us with the camera on the HTC 10 this
phone is still a work in progress but
this recent update improved on many of
the criticisms we had with the camera
output early on this is a very good
camera and competes well against other
phones in this tier for covering
photography and UHD video HTC's ethic of
getting back to basics delivers
something more competitive than what
we've seen from the last two generations
of HTC flagships the core experience is
well in place and where we lose out are
on some of the fun features and controls
like 60 frames per second video it's
rare that we see manufacturers add
significantly new features or options to
their devices after launch but at least
here following the early updates HTC is
in a far improved position for
satisfying folks who want a solid camera
on their phone even if nothing major
changes from this point on HTC is in
much better shape as always thanks so
