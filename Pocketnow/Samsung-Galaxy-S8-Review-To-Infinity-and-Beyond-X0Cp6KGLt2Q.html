approached by at least 10 people for the
same two questions that always came
together the first one was oh is that
the new galaxy and the second one is
well but does it explode this proves
just how much of a footprint Samsung
owns in the smartphone market where
people associate the name galaxy more
with a phone than with the Milky Way and
where one mistake has only made the
brand even more viral the result is
record sales across the globe but the
question is if all of the marketing
accounts to a smart buy for you
I'm hi Natalie that I would pocket now
and this is our Samsung Galaxy S beat
review brought to you by D brand folks
for thoughts on the larger Galaxy s8
plus make sure you watch one separate
impressions link at the end of this
video I've actually just that both but
have decided to spend most of my time
with a smaller variant for a couple of
important reasons the first one is
ergonomic products like the LG G 6 did a
great job in getting me to sip on the
taller display kool-aid I find the idea
of a larger display over a smaller
chassis to be genius sure it is
relatively the same surface area as
other phablets but a narrower body is
easier to hold and operate with one hand
the second reason is because with the
exception of the smaller battery you're
pretty much getting the same phone what
was exclusive to the edge galaxies is
now standard no matter what variant you
pick and that is actually great because
no longer do you have to grab a larger
phone just to get added features the
metal trim is now protected by a glossy
coating that remains intact even after
three drops onto tile and that's a real
feeling of holding a large phone that
feels small in the hand is here more
than ever you have to thank Samsung's
infinity display for that effect this is
probably one of the best displays of the
year given its blend of rounded corners
curved edges and AMOLED technology
that's now capable of HDR at five point
eight inches diagonal it nearly kills
the bezel thanks to a crazy 83
percent screen to body ratio and with
palm rejection being addressed fully in
this new model the screen is capable of
watt HD plus resolution at eighteen
point five by nine but it is versatile
enough to scale to just 1080p plus to
help with power efficiency and you know
what I really can't tell the difference
so I decided to stick to 1080p for the
full length of this review and then
buried inside we've got some of the best
specifications in the market thanks to
either a snapdragon 835 or an Exynos
88-90 5 in addition to 4 gigs of ram and
base storage of 64 gigabytes that's also
expandable you can also continue to
enjoy the benefits of ip68 water in this
resistance and fast and wireless
charging also make a return to blend
with the elegance of the hardware we
have Samsung experience UX 8.1 those of
you who fell in love with the software
of the galaxy note 7 will be delighted
here the company continues its trend of
minimalism and absolutely every detail
and as much as I'm not a fan of Android
skins this one falls under my short list
of exceptions my 24 hours video linked
at the end also goes through the details
of what this software can do my final
thoughts after using it for two weeks is
that I'm really liking Samsung's
attention to detail in the basics if you
need a quick shortcut to anything it's
just the swipe from the edge away and
I'm shocked at how much I've been using
this feature on this phone I'm also a
big fan of the hidden home button and
little things like being able to swap
the order of the navigation buttons one
of my favorite continues to be the
secure folder because I really like to
protect my information 1 &amp;amp; 2 the
addition of having a second copy of
applications in case you have multiple
accounts
concerns for a taller display we're also
considered I continuously rely in the
slide from the bottom for enhance
one-handed use and ask for application
scaling I am surprised at how fast
third-party apps are adapting with
important services like YouTube already
enhanced for it even if the content is
not really enhanced for obvious reasons
other features like performance can be
delightful
for the most part given the power of
this 10 nanometer processor games are
surely benefited by this with no lag or
stutter to be seen no matter what title
I play but the only thing is that I
can't really call this phone the fastest
performer out there see once you load it
up with all your stuff and you start
using it like a normal power user would
you'll notice that the UI is quite the
RAM hog the results are mixed
performance with minor stutters when
moving around certain menu elements I'm
not even going to lie I'm glad that
bixby is not ready for primetime as even
pressing the button to get the cards can
take forever I would honestly say that
this phone can really use Android 7.1 as
soon as possible and not just for the
performance but also for power
efficiency a 3000 milliamp hour battery
is small for a display this large with
cases where I can rarely reach a full
day of moderate use and where 7.1
enhancements could really come in handy
now there are a ton of cool things
though like the insane amount of ways
you can unlock this phone with the iris
scanner topping my list of favorites
given its speed and the fact that it
works even through sunglasses if the Sun
is too bright you have the oddly placed
fingerprint scanner to assist over time
I've become used to its placement but I
do recommend that you use a case for the
hump to assist you in finding it
and then another welcome improvement
comes at the hand of audio yes you will
hate the placement of the speakers but I
fully agree with Juan's real audio
review and that this phone has made a
dramatic improvement for headphone audio
and I even notice an added kick and
loudness when using it for phone calls
and when it comes to the camera let's
just say that we all know that a galaxy
is a galaxy once real Canon review is
one of the most expensive he's ever done
and for great reasons this continues to
be one of the cameras that beat even if
most of the enhancements are in the
image processing compared to last year's
model
double-click on the power button and
enjoy some of the best photos a
smartphone can take with amazing colour
saturation and detail just like I did
last year my advice to you remains the
same just take the shot and let the
phone do its job in the background see
most of the time you will notice the
viewfinder looking a little grainy but
I'm always surprised by the final result
once I see the photo but it was also one
of the phones high points with its
stabilization being one of the best in
the market and yes the selfie shooter
got a bump in megapixels which is great
for those of you who are fans of it but
I'm honestly annoyed at the crop that
Samsung has adopted for video the field
of view has become just as bad as on the
iPhone and one of the things that I
really wish the company would fix going
forward to conclude there is a lot of
good to be said about the new galaxy as
everybody calls it those of you that
were left nostalgic by the beauty of the
note 7 will be happy to see even more
beauty shown off here there is a lot of
genius being placed in this design so
much so that I highly suggest that you
go to a store hold one for yourself to
fully understand what I mean the only
challenge continues to be the same one
we've always dealt with with Samsung
beautiful software should not be the
excuse for stutters or for the slow
speed at which galaxy phones get updated
to newer versions of Android I'm not
calling these deal breakers but
really just problems that are getting
old for phones that are this expensive
what I recommend the Galaxy s8 sure of
course I would my minor list of
complaints can be fixed with a software
update this design and form factor are
clearly the feature for smartphones and
it's really cool that the feature is
already available to you if you would
like to consider it if you're looking to
protect the glass on your new Galaxy s8
add grip or prevent those ugly
fingerprint smudges head on over to deep
brand there are tons of options to
customize the look in the feel of your
new device we thank thee bran for
