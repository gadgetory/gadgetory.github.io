Paul calm and this is a hardware tour
the sprint HTC touch pro2 so I'm just
going to go into this right now and the
first thing you'll notice on this device
is we have a three point six inch wvga
screen and that's the LCD TFT screen
below that we have a zoom slider which
allows you to zoom in or zoom out on
either text documents pictures or the
web browser using opera mobile below
that we have a call start button we have
the Windows Start button right here a
back button and a call end button on the
top we have a light meter a speaker an
earphone speaker as well as the status
indicator light which shows that it's
either charging are about to die or not
on the top of the device we have the
power button on this side we have a one
one of the stereo speaker microphones
you can see that right there again
stereo speaker microphone below that we
have the stylus and this is a pretty
mean stylus it's a non-magnetic stylus
but when you do pull it out it actually
turns on the device so that's a great
feature to have on the bottom of the
device we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which is the this is
actually the first touch pro2 to have a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack
unfortunately the device doesn't come
with any headphones so you're gonna have
to your own we also have the proprietary
HTC mini USB jack which allows for TV
out and other applications we have one
of our other microphones on the bottom
right here on this side we have the
volume rocker so it's just a simple up
and down on the back of the device we
have a 3.2 megapixel camera as well as
our speaker button one thing that's
lacking on this device though is a flash
I don't understand why HTC decided to
not include a flash on this device we
also have this weird grape pattern on
the back which actually covers up the
speaker the stereo speakers and I kind
of think it looks like a treadmill I
don't know it looks like a the mountain
setting on the treadmill but to each his
own okay it will open up the battery
cover
and underneath here we have a our stereo
speakers so as you can see we have this
one speaker right here and another
speaker right there can also take off
the battery and it is a 1500 milliamp
battery so that's a good size battery
for a device like this we also have a
sim card this device in particular
allows for CDMA and GSM so to take out
the sim card is actually pretty simple
you just take the stylus and underneath
and just pop it out and it comes right
out so that's a great feature to have on
a device that has cdma is that this is a
worldwide device so you can also use a
sim card in it ok so if we slide open
the device it's very nice it's a spring
assisted slider with a tilting action so
it will actually tilt up to about 45
degrees and when you close it it makes a
clicking sound so that's great feature
to have the keyboard is very nice I'm
actually surprised of how high quality
this keyboard is on this particular the
phone it does have accents of orange and
beneath that is an inlay a textured
checkerboard so if i compare this device
is some other devices we have the
original touch pro which is an also a
very nice phone to have it's a little
bit thinner it's about a millimeter
thinner than the touch pro much taller
about a centimeter taller and let's see
about four millimeters wider than the
touch pro look at the Xperia the screen
is a little bit bigger it's about point
six inches larger about the same
thickness and the omnia to the omnia too
much thinner but this one of course
doesn't have a keyboard much thinner but
device screen size on the touch pro 2 is
a little bit small or not by much maybe
like a millimeter but that's about it
and if I compare it to a credit card
sized object it's about the same
thickness as a credit card or width is a
credit card as I should say about a
couple millimeters thinner and about ooh
about two centimeter
taller than a credit card so this is a
hardware tour of the sprint touch pro2
