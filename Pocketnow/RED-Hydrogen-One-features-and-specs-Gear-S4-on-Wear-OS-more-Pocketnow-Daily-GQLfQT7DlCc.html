hydrogen one that reveals some
specifications in pricing the iPhone 10
is still making big numbers even with
all the hot releases happening
and Samsung might be using where OS
finally with the gear s4 I'm high in
metal Iveta back in studio 2 making my
son's life easier
by delivering footage instantly this is
PocketNow azalea the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for the LG G 7th in queue which pretty
much just came official expect our
review coming very soon by the way this
week well it is currently available buy
one get one free on t-mobile
there are the usual catches you
apparently have to grab the $30 plan
which amounts to 750 bucks but it's
actually not such a bad deal if you
follow all the procedures learn more in
the description now let's talk about the
huawei mate book X Pro one of my
favorite devices of the year so far if
you haven't caught my review I will link
you back to it living it and it's
finally available in the United States
and stores like Microsoft Amazon etc the
lists in the description price tag is a
little higher than I expected starting
at 1200 going all the way up to 1500 but
that's the sweet spot because that $1500
model is a lot less expensive than other
competitors and you're getting a ton of
stuff here you learn more about it in
the description as well now let's talk
about the Samsung gear s for or at least
one of the variants being codenamed
galileo apparently the news here is that
apparently it will bring where OS bear
in mind Samsung was one of the first
Android wear partners back in 2014 with
the Samsung gear live I think it was I
had one but I've already forgotten about
it it's been a long time still where OS
coming back to Samsung that's great we
wonder what's gonna happen to Tizen
going forward now let's move the
spotlight over to global smartphone
sales believe it or not the iPhone
continues topping the list for the month
of March I find it unbelievable again
after all the fanfare from analysts but
yes iPhone sent us at the top followed
by the s9 s 9 plus there are also
devices from Xiaomi and Oppo but you
know
the most interesting part is that there
are also other iPhones on that list
including the iPhone success I think I
might be confused but apparently that's
another phone that's selling well well
you can learn more about it in the
description as well and finally the hot
news today have to do with the red
hydrogen one everyone prepare your
Benjamins if you're interested in this
smartphone we still don't have internal
specifications we've heard more about
the 5.7 inch holographic display the
fact that you will be able to attach
modules but the interesting part is that
apparently these are not red hydrogen
one modules verily the ones that work
with the rest of the red camera
ecosystem will work on this phone and
obviously you can expect that the price
tag goes all the way up to red hydrogen
ego system not necessarily it starts at
1200 apparently there will be a variant
up to 1600 but let me know in today's
question would you be willing to invest
on a red hydrogen one in my case hey I
you know we use cameras for everything
that we film the more professional the
better but the biggest problem is not
just the 12m about a price tag I'm not
saying it's not worth it but I can't
imagine how much the phone will be plus
the accessories to actually be able to
get pro video let us know anything in
the comments down below

news earlier follow us on poking out on
comment suscribe to our channel by
