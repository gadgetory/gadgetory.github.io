this here is the long awaited oneplus 2
yes the successor to last year's oneplus
one and it is a beautiful phone so let
me walk you quickly through some of the
new features and what really
differentiates this phone from the
competition as you can see it's got a
gorgeous 5.5 inch IPS panel but it is
only 1080p and yes that is probably for
the price point which is three hundred
and eighty nine dollars for the 64
gigabyte model so that's a pretty
impressive price point considering some
of the features that I'll be walking you
through in a second so 5.5 inch 1080p
full-hd display no quad HD here but it's
a gorgeous display very very bright
outside and it has great viewing angles
looks really quite beautiful as you can
see here now the other thing to keep in
mind is that there is as you can see a
bunch of new features like this
fingerprint scanner down here which I've
set up and is actually faster and more
accurate than any other fingerprint
scanner reviews and I've used the one on
the iPhone and the one on the galaxy s6
and it's just you know hold it down like
that it does its job really really well
done there's a 5 megapixel camera here
in the top corner with the earpiece on
top and you have a choice of capacitive
buttons as you can see you can
reconfigure to either be near the back
button on one side and the recent apps
on the other side or vice versa or you
can go full software and have on-screen
buttons on a nexus if you prefer so
that's something you can configure and
do whatever you want with as you could
on the old one plus one now inside
there's a Snapdragon 810 it's the next
generation of Snapdragon it has the
improved power management so it is a bit
better on battery and a bit better in
terms of heat generation and so that's a
big improvement it comes together with 4
gigs of RAM
and now as you can see here in the back
is a new camera it's a 13 megapixel
camera with laser autofocus you can see
the laser sensor right below the camera
lens and a dual LED flash it's it's
still only 13 megapixels but it's a
really big improvement in performance it
actually has a new omni vision sensor
and I've taken a few pictures and I'm
pretty happy with it the only thing a
little disappointing about this camera
right now is that the software doesn't
even live up to the competition there is
no manual controls or raw support and
while you can download third-party
cameras you know you don't get up to
30-second manual shutter speed like on
you get on the g4 for example out of the
box of this phone they say it's coming
for sure rise coming soon so keep that
in mind on the bottom here you'll find a
kind of a new feature and it's USB
type-c with a mono speaker and a
microphone port and that is a really big
deal type-c is going to really change
things and really add functionality to
phones and give the ability to plug in
all kinds of interesting accessories and
of course it's a bi-directional
connector which is great here's the
power/lock key the volume rocker as you
can see and then on top here you've got
the standard headphone jack and a
secondary mic and then here this is a
really awesome addition this slider here
lets you slide between let me show you
on the screen as I slide it so you start
with noir lurtz priority only and then
all notifications so this is the
equivalent of the setting on a nexus in
the volume slider it's really really
cool I love this feature I think it's a
great great idea to have implemented
this and there you go and as you can see
all the way around is a beautiful metal
band that is real metal machined metal
this year none of this fake chrome
plastic like we had in the back in the
old phone last year now there is no SD
card slot on this phone
it's got a dual-sim setup if I peel this
cover off you can get to the SIM cards
but you cannot get to the battery or to
the SD card slot because there's no SD
card slot so this is what it looks like
here
you've got this little drawer you can
slide out and this is where the Sims
live and there's no other ways things
you can change and know these pins are
not for a while is charging there is no
G wireless charging support despite
these pins so keep that in mind this is
a I think a major omission and I think
we're mentioning is that the battery is
3300 milliamp hour which is should be
sufficient despite the lack of wireless
charging and so far I've used the phone
quite a bit and the battery doesn't seem
to be draining too fast so everything's
cool on that front so those are the
limitation no micro sd no removable
battery no cheat charging and just the
1080p display but everything else about
this phone is really flagship worthy and
really really awesome you've got there
oxygen OS here which is you know typical
of what we've seen on 1+1 since a dump
cyanogen and you know here gives you an
idea what this looks like in terms of
performance so really just a standard
very standard Android experience is
really nothing new here and unusual so
anyway that's a quick look at the
oneplus 2 the newest flagship phone from
the oneplus folks and it's a really
beautiful night for the money 389 for a
64 gigabyte it's a really really good
deal I just really hope now that they
can make the camera software as good as
what the hardware can do and yeah we'll
be in business definitely a worthy
contender if you're looking for an
unlocked high-end phone at a reasonable
price
this is mihrab for pocket now and stay
tuned for more coverage from the oneplus
2 event Cheers
you
