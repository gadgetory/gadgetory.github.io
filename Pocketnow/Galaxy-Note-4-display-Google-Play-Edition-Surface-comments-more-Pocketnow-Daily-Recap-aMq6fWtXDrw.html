thanks to it I'm sure yours is too damn
we can never pronounce his name like how
he did and if that's your real face on
the avatar then we could probably
arrange something the f you're looking
at keep scrolling down and yeah that's
right it's that time of the week I am
Hein that'll be better this is pocket
now and there's our pocket now daily
recap for last week so on Monday asked
you what do you think about the samsung
galaxy alpha and the league says the
phone was not announced yet and we had
the first photos and we had 104 comments
out of which Robert ban who says why
does everyone hate plastic plastic is
light durable and easy to manufacturing
you have an interesting point there if
it's not polycarbonate even is more
resilient than aluminum in most cases so
yeah last thing is not really a bad
option the problem is samsung phones all
look the same sergio man says yes it
looks exactly like every effing galaxy
phone samsung needs a redesign and yeah
that's the point that I was trying to
make then whale says we want more
battery not a metal band on an S 5 that
will look ugly sorry Samson but you're
taking things the wrong way and Samson
does need a new design and I guess we're
all agreeing on the same topic metal is
great it's a great material and it looks
quite elegant it's not as resilient as
some others but it is good now I will
agree with things like battery life as
the Galaxy Note lineup is great on that
then on Tuesday I asked you what do you
think google play phones keep
disappearing as the news where the
galaxy s4 is no longer available there
is no galaxy s5 google play edition and
we're left with just two phones out of
so many we have 3 54 comments out of
which door para says i think it was a
total fail but the way google was doing
it seemed like if they weren't trying so
i'm waiting for whatever is happening
with silver and you having a very
interesting point bear we don't really
believe that google was trying hard with
google play edition phones indeed i mean
they just launched it out there they set
the prices that they wanted but they
weren't really trying as hard as they
did with nexus phone so i think they
were d away and the guy with the odd as
user name ever says i think google is
preparing for something big them dumping
those barges and now with google play
edition phones is appearing something is
coming and soon and we are hoping for
that to be the case and given the fact
that we are reaching the fall this is
the perfect time for them to launch
things so let's wait and see what we get
and Johnny testing 94 says cool Play
edition phones are just more expensive
you just install cool Play edition rom
on your Galaxy s4 for example without
buying will play edition phone and that
is right that is probably the biggest
reason why this never took off then on
once they asked you if you think
Microsoft should continue with the
surface lineup as the new is where the
company's lost two billion dollars ever
since the launch of the first surface
and we have 591 comments out of which
crazy 625 6 says such as pro 3 needs to
be priced between seven hundred dollars
and eight hundred dollars it will sell
like hot cakes in destroy competition
and out of the 591 comments I think
ninety percent of the commenter said the
same thing that they felt that the
surface lineup was too expensive which
is interesting because here in pocket
now we thought the other way around
given the fact that the ipad lineup is
so expensive if you want more storage so
do you really think that the surface
lineup is too expensive i think the
surface pro 3 is very aggressively
priced but then they're forcing you to
buy the more expensive models first so i
do agree in certain aspects but you
can't really compare an ipad with the
surface pro 3 then Kirk but amanda says
them right they should continue
especially after all the money they
spend on it all the surface pro lineup
needs is a solid keyboard dock and this
is a very interesting point here not
everybody likes these touch covers and I
don't understand why Microsoft is
holding back on bringing more
accessories as other OEMs or not doing
so then Reza says i will be buying a
surface pro 3 in 2 weeks it's the best
pc out there right now and it actually
is one of the best pieces out there i
have to agree with that then on Thursday
I asked you if you think wraparound
displays are a smart idea as Samsung is
rumored to be manufacturing these for
the galaxy note 4 the reasons we still
don't understand then we have 519
comments out of which j across 6 says
curve displays are done period keep
bones flat curves only make sense on TV
and even on TV it depends on the curves
i kind of agree with that then Jared
Davidson says definitely a gimmick it
adds very little extra functionality of
the product if it's just another place
of glass to break and well the LG G flex
was not breakable it could be that this
flexible wraparound display has a
purpose let's see what it is then
commentator says
I think the wraparound displays is going
to be like HD displays or phablets at
first it really seemed weird and many
people say nobody needs that but a year
later nobody wants to buy a phone
without these features great point until
we see these products in the market it's
really hard for you to judge them and I
think that this is a great comment let's
see what we get and finally on Friday I
asks you hardware buttons are physical
what do you think about Microsoft's plan
as we saw this video of microsoft
research showing us some haptic feedback
being built into the display in order to
give you texture centric sensation and I
know this is hard to understand but
anyways we have 240 one's comments out
of which Diego Almeida says oh Microsoft
in third place in mobile OS run and
already getting new ways to drain our
batteries even faster what can we do and
yeah probably this will be an issue this
is just a prototype they're giving it a
triangle take some time for this to
marinate so let's see where it leads the
mr. chaotic so three says if Microsoft
wants to get into the gimmick game
samsung will beat them Microsoft should
try to be competitors in fundamentals
like battery life reliability build
quality and ease of use all things which
we actually find are best handled by
Microsoft lately nokia phones have the
best built quality they have great
reliability they have great battery life
and well they also have great ease of
use that's one of the things that we
like the most about Windows Phone so
it's kind of an ironic comment but yeah
i do understand your point the gimmicks
game is not really the good thing to do
and then sky-high says well no need for
capacitive buttons but capacitive
touchscreen would be amazing if it
worked right and that is the point to
everything if whatever works right it
will make sense so let's see what
Microsoft brings to the table as
apparently we will have a prototype by
next year thats it for our pocket now
daily recap thank you very much for
