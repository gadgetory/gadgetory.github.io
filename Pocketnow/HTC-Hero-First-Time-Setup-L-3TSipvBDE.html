pocket now calm and we're about to turn
on the HTC hero for the very first time
I've just put in the sim card and I've
never actually started up an Android
device for the first time I've used the
platform before but you're going to see
with me what it's like to turn on the
hero for the first time so let's get a
little bit closer it's fully charged
it's ready to go so let's turn it on and
see what happens here oh okay in the HTC
font okay put a little android guy
popped up in the Oh up there is again
HTC sound got some glowing going on here
on the buttons screen locked drag down
to a mock okay whoa assuming there's
maybe some kind of first time setup
screen looks really crisp by the way
select your language english if that's
me next using the on-screen keyboard
learn how to quickly and accurately
enter text using auto correction and
symbol shortcuts don't worry about
pressing the right key every time kind
of like the iphone keyboard tap here to
start typing okay touch inside the S
circle to enter s okay s I it's kind of
guiding me around s IM a simple simple
this is what you just typed this is what
we suggest tapping the space key accepts
the suggestion like the iphone and many
other windows mobile devices simpler has
been corrected to simple now you can
type quickly and let the keyboard do the
corrections okay next learn how to
quickly enter accented characters press
and hold this is just like the on-screen
keyboards on the HTC devices like the
diamond two and the touch pro two press
hold the a key ok I just did now it says
drag to this is pressing all the FF key
dollar sign tap the close button to exit
hideaway the keyboard connecting to
Wi-Fi may improve the speed of the setup
process which would like to connect now
sure and here is my network going to
type in the password alright so I'm
connected to the Wi-Fi network very nice
next see what's next you can
automatically sync mail contacts and
calendar events by setting up one or
more following exchange types account
types awesome it has microsoft exchange
which is terrific because i use that
religiously so i'm going to enter in my
exchange information alright so
connected to the exchange server and
it's asking me do I want to sync mail
contacts and calendar and of course I do
it doesn't look like task is on on here
which is kind of interesting let's go to
next processing ok set up accounts you
can automatically and we're back to this
screen so we can set up a gmail account
if if you use gmail in addition but
we're going to go to next since I
already set up Microsoft Exchange looks
like the trackball lights up set up
social networks set up your favorite
social networks to send and receive
updates using the built-in features of
your people and album well i'm
definitely going to put in twitter i'm
not sure about facebook and flickr just
yet so if i do twitter i'm going to put
my twitter handle in
and let me put the password in there
okay put the password in and login to
twitter cool logged into Twitter click
Next connect location service provider
applications with your approximate
location without using GPS allow Google
location services to collect anonymous
and aggregate location data collection
will occur regardless of whether any
yeah sure or whatever to learn more
about doing the following go to HTC com
/ hero and click finish and I think we
are going to be taken into the sense UI
interface awesome so here we are in the
sense UI and after I've gotten some time
to play with it and learn more about it
you'll see the next video which is
coming soon so overall a pretty great
first time setup experience I like how
it walks you through creating a new
account and adding your Twitter account
in facebook I like how it walked you
through how to actually use the keyboard
I think some people may misunderstand
the keyboard and think you have to be
extremely precise when typing when
that's not the case you can hit
approximate areas and it will still
understand what you're trying to say
we'll be back soon with more on the HTC
hero that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
