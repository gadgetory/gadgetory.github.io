pocketnow.com
and we're about to turn on the HTC Hero
for the very first time I've just put in
the SIM card and I've never actually
started up an Android device for the
first time I've used the platform before
but you're gonna see with me what it's
like to turn on the hero for the first
time so let's get a little bit closer
it's fully charged it's ready to go so
let's turn out and see what happens here
oh okay in the HTC font okay little
little Android guy popped up in the Oh
up there is again HTC sound I've got
some glowing going on here on the
buttons screen locked drag down to
unlock okay
I'm assuming there's gonna be some kind
of first time set up screen looks really
crisp by the way select your language
English yep that's me next using the
on-screen keyboard learn how to quickly
and accurately enter text using auto
correction and symbol shortcuts don't
worry about pressing the right key every
time
kind of like the iPhone keyboard tap
here to start typing okay touch inside
the S circle to enter s okay s eye is
kind of guiding me around s I am it's a
simple simple this is what you just
typed this is what we suggest tapping
the space key accept the suggestion like
the iPhone and many other windows mobile
devices simpler has been corrected too
simple now you can type quickly and let
the keyboard do the corrections okay
next learn how to quickly enter accented
characters press and hold this is just
like the on-screen keyboards on the HTC
devices like the diamond - and the touch
pro2 press and hold the a key okay I
just did now it says drag - it says
personal the F to keep F key dollar sign
tap the close button to exit hide away
the keyboard connecting to Wi-Fi may
improve the speed of the setup process
would you like to connect now sure and
here is my network gonna type in the
password all right so I'm connected to
the Wi-Fi network very nice next see
what's next you can automatically sync
mail contacts and calendar events by
setting up one or more following
exchange types account types awesome it
has
Microsoft Exchange which is terrific
because I use that religiously so I'm
going to enter in my exchange
information alright so it connected to
the exchange server and it's asking me
do I want to sync mail contacts and
calendar and of course I do
it doesn't look like task is on here
which is kind of interesting let's go to
next processing okay set up accounts you
can automatically and we're back to this
screen so we can set up a gmail account
if if you use Gmail in addition but
we're gonna go to next since I already
set up Microsoft Exchange looks like the
trackball lights up set up social
networks
your favorite social networks to send
and receive updates using the built-in
features of your people and album well
I'm definitely going to put in Twitter
I'm not sure about Facebook and Flickr
just yet so if I do Twitter I'm going to
put my Twitter handle in and let me put
the password in there okay put the
password in and log into Twitter cool
logged into Twitter click next connect
location service provider applications
with your approximate location without
using GPS allow Google location services
to collect anonymous and aggregate
location data collection will occur
regardless of whether any yeah sure
whatever
to learn more first about doing the
following go to HTC comm slash hero and
click finish and I think we are going to
be taken into the Sense UI interface
awesome so here we are in the sense UI
and after I've gotten some time to play
with it and learn more about it
you'll see the next video which is
coming soon so overall a pretty great
first time setup experience I like how
it walks you through creating a new
account and adding your Twitter account
and Facebook I like how it walks you
through how to actually use the keyboard
I think some people may misunderstand
the keyboard and think you have to be
extremely precise when typing when
that's not the case you can hit
approximate areas and it will still
understand what you're trying to say
we'll be back soon with more on the HTC
hero that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
