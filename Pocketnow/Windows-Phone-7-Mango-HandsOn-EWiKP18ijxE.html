com here we've got there tonight or
sooner product manager presentation
today for Mango Derek's gonna tell us
about Windows Phone 7 and I think Adams
going to get around back here too sure
yeah so with mango we wanted to focus in
three key areas communication apps in
the Internet we think that there was a
ton of work that can be done there
beyond what the comments do today two
accumulations we added a bunch of new
thing since the people club where now
you can connect and share with people
across different groups so the ability
to group together all of your friends
for instance here I've got my new york
city friends that show up and I put them
all together I can see what's new for
this group of people I can see all the
photos that i posted and had tagged for
all these people you know what's hang
out so it's kind of a nice thing to see
and I else can do group communication
and we do this by integrating the most
popular social networking and chat
experiences facebook chat windows live
messenger so you can send off group
messages just like that and it's just a
really easy thing for people to do if
they already are using those services we
do that with a new feature called
threads which basically brings together
all the different ways that you
connected share across all these
different services so here you'll notice
the text which I thought was a text that
came in from Andrew but in fact it was a
facebook message and on the fly you can
actually switch over to texture of a
messenger whatever the person's of el
balad so you can keep the conversation
all together so instead of going to
separate apps you have it all together
with apps we wanted to make sure that
we're improving all of our appt
experiences for instance the xbox live
hub has a full avatar support in it you
have now woody issues lines on the side
and it slipped through holy sir foods
when it first votes uh putting time I
went there
yeah that was a scroll I think it's a
scroll bar that was showing up initially
and then going away pre-release software
you know it's your feedback is important
though and so you'll notice things here
we even have notifications that come in
we have you know messages the avatar in
Iraq so you can do interesting things
with him your little avatar collectibles
come in you have all of our
notifications all that stuff comes in so
we wanted to take all the stuff that was
an xbox live extras improve it and then
build it into the core of experience
yeah the old one is uh was really good
for senior games and when you see things
like your avatar is a little bit more
static here you notice it's very
interactive it's showing new I have
messages come and all that yeah and on
Windows Phone 7 you launch into a
separate experience so we thought we
could do a little better we can see all
those messages come in we can do a
spotlight area where people get all
sorts of new notifications and we
actually improved the caliber of games
that we're going to have in mango by
offering some new ways for us to do
multi player and you'll see more updates
about that later a bit I don't you hear
the browser do a speed test version
short bo is very few yeah sure but I'm
going to use this phone actually I love
yeah what did you want to do we might as
well go to pocket now but uh scroll down
to the bottom and working fast enough
you okay you want me to go to stop you
okay hurry internet connection great
pretty weak over car is it's that's
obviously very important okay we'll see
so be kind of seems like it's okay
alright so we want to go desktop version
yeah like less than bar and it's got a
big load it up we try to fix the simple
yeah those ads ma'am yeah the killer
that she take this as a sign is so
browser bar on the bottom now which we
really yeah we move to the bomb so we
can optimize the amount of real estate
for everything else and you can just
pull it up with a familiar drawer that
we have everywhere else so here I'm
getting the same ad that you're getting
fantastic Oh terrific maybe this is not
the best thing the good thing is that
because it is the same rendering engine
is the the desktop it's actually seen it
exactly the same so it's presenting the
ad as you would expect you can move
around we do so that yeah it's moving it
so I can escape the ad click on a
headline quick yeah you are I guess I
guess I'm forced to go here all right
why don't we do this huh I you let's
look at something like Boston calm right
so Boston is actually a cool website
because this new site that actually
takes advantage of html5 videos all that
stuff every you would expect it gives
you interesting news as well that's
coming through so the page loads up you
get all that available right here you'll
notice that it brings in html5 video all
that stuff's available right here so I
can see it and play it so it really is
the exact same browsing experience you
expect on your PC loads all that up
right here
talk to flash sport no talk of flash
support we think that was html5 uh this
one I'd rather not just because we got a
few more demos today and so I'm just
trying to oh you're doing some columnist
for you know non-primary calendar is
delegate kinda messy so now we have
different calendars within the cricketer
yes are you supporting multitude of our
success with not within where you can
have multiple calendars by just adding
more and more of them so you can have
moment we'll see that's amusing multiple
gene out of the house there is not one
in the same source they'd have to be
with different counts okay yeah so which
one becomes how do you see who's on
message our personal yeah so if you want
to see who's online you can actually use
threads for that so if i go into
messaging here you'll see that i'm
signed in and i can pan over right
inside of the messaging experience and
see who's online that's for facebook and
it's just as yet exactly this is mixing
together facebook and live messenger so
i can go start a conversation with my
friend jess here and i could go much
that goes for so it's good yeah just how
it is now mango that's correct yes it's
true it's a very important change
building yeah exactly room is so you can
see things here brian's available and
then i can go ahead and switch to
facebook or i can switch to text
available yeah if I my messenger
absolutely we can attach a picture he's
gonna love this I'm going to just use
those my demo donkey so just like that
you can send a picture send that off the
voice clip
you know this is this is actually voice
dictation yeah and so I showed him the
demo some voice dictation of the thing I
did not show is that it's actually
really easy to start a voice dictation
so you can actually just press and hold
the start button you can do all sorts of
things so if you press an old start you
have the ability Microsoft stock define
that name in years hold on this one
actually has Wi-Fi connected up as you
can this one Microsoft stock ambient
noise in here I think it's too loud yeah
but anyways you can do all sorts of
things you could say you know call
Brandon minimum you can call get
Microsoft stock boat here it's giving me
a list of from the call it's getting
more specific please you can play a song
you can also tell it to to text Andrew
Maroney and it will create a new text
and then you can't dictate the taxi no
no email just for messaging yep is there
invest application is there a way to
force close the program yet in the real
ways yeah actually the way it works is
we don't want consumers to have to think
about task management at all actually so
we do is we basically have the back
button be the thing so if you whenever
you go back to the start it loads that
app into memory and so if you just sit
there and you just keep backing out
those clothes then it's just it's good
don't leave it it's closing as much as
this this hydration and dehydration
because we wanted to have these
background agents that we run so that
the app continue to get information get
location can push things to tiles but at
the same time did not have any
deleterious effect on your battery by
her performance yeah great so we think
it's it's simple that way and people
and for the things you want to do like
you're in attacks you want to go back
and check a home number real quick or
something like that you can totally do
that that's great you see this actually
is my real working now so she won't take
this one off the table before you see
other things that are coming in mango or
something like that yeah but yeah that's
that's basically it i think you know
inside of the search stuff that's really
the most interesting in vista terms what
we're doing to reorganize the last
decoction all of the log out stuff that
goes together any local scout for
Tribeca for instance and having all the
places to eat and drink see and do and
everything else around this area happy
and all that just come in all my
favorites we're bringing more and more
metadata together so people don't have
to decide and go out by our figure out
different web pages to get all that
different information in case when you
were doing the map and shopping officer
of the different areas not at that
Italian of here sent from from the web
yeah that comes from the web so if veins
big thing is to scrape the web for
information so you don't have to go into
all these two places I mean the
canonical example is like you have to go
to a website to find the contact us page
just get a phone number can get pulled
out now we do we that but we give you
the things they actually want which in
this case is you know what are the
upcoming shows the Madison Square Garden
what are the you know what are the
stores as they appear inside the
Manhattan ball and it's really cool i
mean the problem new york city is that
you don't have a lot of malls and so if
you're in a more suburban area you
actually you find a lot of these public
places that have these types of indoor
maps mr. zooming you just get to see all
those right there sounds like a street
view yeah i mean it's one we have that
thing in Windows Phone 7 where if you
back out you know you have basically the
the normal Road view and I'm a closer
aerial yeah we don't have a show you
mean a street view street view now we
don't have that in this release
you can get in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
