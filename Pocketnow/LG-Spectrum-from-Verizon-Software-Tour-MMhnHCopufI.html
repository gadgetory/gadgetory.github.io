pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the software on
the LG spectrum for verizon so sit back
relax enjoy the show as we mentioned in
the unboxing the LG spectrum from
verizon is running Android 235 we got
the lock screen here and I kind of like
this this glass effect here that this
slide to unlock effect especially with
my galaxy s2 that's kind of got the
picture unlock this looks a little more
impressive to the eyes but as soon as
you go to the unlock piece you notice
that you've got a skinned version of
Android 235 which is gingerbread and
it's LG's skin and it looks a lot like
TouchWiz except it feels like TouchWiz
without a whole lot of the optimizations
that come with the touch which devices
if we start here with the main screen
you can scroll back and forth and see a
little red dead at the top that tells us
what page we are but as you can see I'm
swiping through here pretty quickly and
it has a tendency to lag up as
especially goes by widgets and in the
full review will try out using a
different launcher and see if that makes
much of a difference but what I found is
that overall the device is just pretty
laggy as software wise especially
scrolling back and forth but you can add
and remove items from this device for
the pages as you would expect and when
you move icons around it shows a little
shadow version of the icon in the
background to show you where you're
going to drop that particular icon if
you look at the task bar tray up here at
the top I've got the standard buttons
again it still takes a lot of space for
what it really could for this type of
screen I mean you've got some pretty big
eigen especially right here the
connected to and it shows the wireless
network and then it shows a big banner
here for Verizon Wireless it does
absolutely nothing and then this portion
of the screen is dedicated to the
notifications so to me that's a little
bit of ways to space and colors why that
doesn't look all that hot not terribly
impressed with it I'm not terribly
disappointed if you don't have the
wireless turned on or connected to
something and you run into a wireless
network and it brings up this annoying
box oh
and over and over again every time you
pop into a never k just noticed this
then you can tell it to turn off the you
know ignore it for now but it'll nevitt
ibly come back there's a option to
change it but ran out of the box it's a
little annoying as I mentioned before so
then if we go into the app tray right
here this is the default view that you
get except I've expanded some of these
options you see you can collapse these
these categories here and it's again I'm
tapping here and it's a little bit slow
to open up these items and additionally
there is a do the way that they use the
scrolling effect you start scrolling
then you tap and you tap on an icon it
has a tendency to to pause the the
screen a little bit so you have to kind
of stop when you scroll you have to stop
the scrolling and then tap on the icon
in order for it to immediately launch
it's not really a bug it's more of a
feature but it is a an annoyance if you
don't recognize that that's what's
happening at first you can change the
layout to list or category there is no
standard view that you would get on
India the other Android devices these
days of course launching right into
things there and then you can grab on
the bar here and scroll up and down
quickly through your applications it's
going to go back to the category list
here and then you can manage your apps
and change the category here as well
there is some bloat on here I should say
there's a lot of bloat on here while I
like the Amazon Kindle app as a software
application it doesn't necessarily
install especially the one like
blockbuster it have no interest in using
blockbuster on Android device especially
when it comes with netflix on it
scorecentre some people may like this
but it's not really a bonus for me and
then you've got some demos like need for
speed hot pursuit and let's golf which
require you to download additional
pieces there's the mobile hotspot which
is I've used to tether to this device
and it works just like you would expect
it to as well
verizon navigated we'll come back to in
just one moment and then we scroll down
here we've got some of the default apps
at least the navigation ones was
installed by default that was a thankful
touch and then it shows down here at the
bottom what applications that I've
installed to do some testing and and to
use the devices i use in my daily
functionality so going back up here to
the verizon navigator this is going to
lock the device up really quick so you
have to watch the little carefully as I
tap verizon navigator I've never been
able to get this to actually launch
successfully so here we go launch and
black down here at the bottom you can
see that the icons have lit up and if I
power off the device power back on I get
the lock screen but as soon as i slide
the lock screen up and out see the
verizon navigator application open the
background lights lit up again but
nothing happened the only way out of
this is to toggle it on and off and
before you swipe here is tech press and
hold the power button that tell it to
shut off it's the only way that I found
it kicked back out of the verizon
navigator application hopefully there
really is a fix for that soon but that's
a big big bad crash I've also had other
crashes with this device today on the
phone about midway through the phone
call it popped up a notification that
the phone had wanted to force close I
had the option to wait and I told her to
wait once and then it popped up that
notification again and it promptly then
disconnected me from the person on the
other end of the line without giving me
any notification that happened and then
I couldn't use the phone again until I
rebooted the device so it's this device
and the software has been plagued with
these sort of issues since I've received
it not it just have not been impressed
with LG's implementation of Android to
35 on the LG spectrum let's go ahead and
go into settings here a couple of
interesting options there's a lot of
defaults here but if we go in here to
mobile network so we can see that
there's global data roaming access
that's kind of a neat option here for
this particular device with the LTE
roaming capabilities and then also
another interesting item that we have
here is the gestures which can allow you
to do different things like previous and
next item by just tapping on the edge of
the screen rather than swiping back and
forth to flip the device over just to go
into snooze on your alarm or even to
pause the video by flipping the device
over so those are some kind of neat
functionality but unless you remember to
turn them on you probably never know
that they're there without some deep
dive investigation because it certainly
doesn't give you any tutorials like the
Samsung devices do with their gestures
so let's go ahead and launch the browser
and go to pocket now calm and it's going
to launch right in the mobile version
first we'll switch that in just a moment
and we'll scroll down desktop version
there we go finally loaded now I'm
scrolling up and down and things are a
little better scrolling back and forth i
zoom way in you can see the the screen
looks very nice with this you know high
resolution display but if I'm screw
pinching out it's just kind of slowly
chunking out there's another example of
this slowness effect here if I go back
into the settings and display and
brightness I turn off the automatic
brightness and then I scroll up to the
top takes a few seconds for it to catch
up I scroll all the way down same effect
takes a few seconds for it to actually
go all the way up or all the way down in
brightness compared to other devices
that's kind of slow now that may be
something they're doing on purpose or
maybe the construction of this
particular display but it is something
that's noticeable on this device
switching over to the camera application
see it's just got a very basic interface
the toggle here for switching back and
forth between the video camera and the
standard camera I can switch the camera
direction around I can zoom in I could
toggle the flash and there are some
other settings like peer color effect
and white balance is 0 the focus mode
whether auto or phase tracking
and then you just press the and hold the
button to take the shot as you would
expect we'll cover more of the actual
pictures in the Florida photo
functionality and the detail of that in
the hardware / view or tour that wraps
up our software to wear for the LG
spectrum from verizon if you have any
comments or questions or would like to
see us cover something specific in the
hardware review please leave a comment
below give us a thumbs up if you do like
the video and thanks for watching
