glimpse of which units sold most
blackberry goes official with its
android-powered fringe and it seems that
the Moto 360 has surprised many with its
battery performance I'm high Meadow
iveta hoping that you all enjoy your
Friday as much as I'm planning to enjoy
mine this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with
blackberry as the company CEO has
finally come clear on its
android-powered Venice which is
apparently going to be called the truth
we're not sure if they're going to call
it pride or prive but this is going to
be the final name for the product this
is definitely gonna be an
android-powered device with a lot of
blackberry stuff to show how secure it
can be so it's really interesting to
test the how blackberry plants to make
Android better and we should learn more
as apparently the phone will be
available later this year for those of
you complaining about your new Moto 360
not having an AMOLED display well it
seems that that's not necessarily a bad
thing around test with our review unit
conducted by Michael Fisher have
revealed a ton of things particularly
the fact that he last night tested the
watch and always on mode on its display
and the battery pretty much just dropped
three percent in eight hours that he
slept and I'm surprised he was able to
sleep that much but anyways that means
that this always on option for this LCD
is actually not that bad at all expect
our full review coming very soon I'm not
even sure budget Stoke everyone with
Lumia 950 950 XL news because we've been
waiting for these phones since the turn
of the year it's been crazy how long
it's taking Microsoft to launch these
flexors but we've got some leaked
specifications on slides that shows
products that are pretty much ready to
launch we've got some very powerful
units here quad HD display Snapdragon
808 an 8 10 32 gigs of storage three
gigs of RAM these are very very powerful
flagships the slides even show is
Microsoft's continuum service working
with the phones and how it will work
it's extremely cool to see what will get
you just want to get the phones now
Samsung news today are extremely
interesting number one because the
company has got this crazy marketing
campaign for its current galaxies during
the iphone launch for their serving
pillows
and just done everything for everybody
that's in line crazy but even more
interesting is that we've got some
trusted sources claiming that the Galaxy
s7 is actually going to be announced
earlier instead of mwc it seems that
samsung wants to return to CES and do
the event at CES and then have the phone
ready by februari which are the dates of
mwc it would be extremely cool of
Samsung does this particularly because
they want to make a big splash in the US
market let's just see if it ends up
happening in the end and finally for the
extremely hot news of the day yesterday
is iphone 6s day and people are doing
the same thing they always do making
crazy lines to get their phones other
people are getting in their doorsteps
the crazy lines go to the point of a
person with an ipad a mechanical ipad
making a line which is just crazy but
hey the product is arriving two things
it seems that one of the phones that
most sold the variance is the rose gold
variant apparently analysts are
predicting up to thirty to forty percent
of units being the rose gold variant
interesting number two is that
apparently analysts are already
predicting 13 million phones being sold
over the weekend and that apparently
Apple will break its record of up to 77
million units by the end of the quarter
which is a good for Apple but it leads
me to the question of the day are you
getting the iphone success or success
plus if so which one and why in my case
i haven't ordered it yet for many
reasons but i am considering getting the
6s plus in space grey probably 128 gigs
again but leave us a comment down below
what is your case frenzy s as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
Rose earlier before this video was so
machine follow us on parking out our
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel

thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
