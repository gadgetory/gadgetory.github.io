our full review is quite a ways away but
after a few hours with Sony's latest
flagship Android tablet we have a few
early thoughts and we'd like to share
them with you I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our first
impressions pass of the sony xperia
tablet z the very first concern I wanted
to address on first powerup was the
screen we know the Xperia Z smartphone
doesn't have the best display as far as
viewing angles go but Sony looks like
its combating that issue here by using
the Mobile BRAVIA Engine to really ramp
up the saturation on this so-called HD
Reality Display panel and using bright
and colorful images throughout the UI
that's one way to go and the effect is
that I'm not thinking too much about the
viewing angles when I use it I'm too
busy thinking wow all this color in a
light thin tablet this is amazing the
initial setup process is simple and gets
you on your feet with Google Twitter and
Facebook and before long the tablet is
synced and ready to go it's always
interesting to see how an OEM tweaks
Android and the layout of Sony's skin is
interesting with shortcuts and widgets
staying on the small side despite the
ample screen size of this 224 PPI panel
there's kind of a mix of bloatware and
stock titles loaded on these home
screens and Sony's taking the
opportunity to pimp out its own
offerings here with Walkman Sony select
and social life but there's also chrome
and calendar and email and so on and a
weather app here with some subtle
animation that's pretty cool it's been a
while since I've used Android on a
10-inch screen and while stock apps look
great others continue to look stretched
scaled and well rough it's really
awesome that Sony has kept the
notifications and quick shortcuts in the
lower right which is much more handy
than guerrilla arming up to the upper
left to deal with notifications as in
stock Android this tablet is running
4.1.2 by the way and it's the 16
gigabyte version about nine and a half
of those gigs are usable out of the box
there's also a pair of custom soft keys
down here one of them leading to a rack
of customizable shortcuts and the other
to a remote control application and
presumably to take advantage of the IR
port that's almost invisible along the
top edge as you might expect the screen
is a total smudge factory after just an
hour of use there was a
respectable film of filth on the glass
but on the flip side that soft touch
back feels amazing to hold that coating
also inspires confidence that you're not
going to scratch the thing to pieces the
first time you casually drop it onto a
table and the ip55 and ip57 immersion
ratings I mean the tablet Z can even
take a dunk in the sink but you'll have
to wait for the full review to see that
that's what we call little T's right
there we can already tell the design of
this hardware is probably going to be
one of the bright spots of our review
keep in mind this is just a first look
but at this point it's absolutely one of
the more comfortable 10 inch tablets
we've handled ever in part thanks to its
low mass compared to other tablets in
its weight class
the 495 grams isn't light but it's not
heavy either the thing feels great and
our preliminary and informal flex test
gives us a good feeling about its
durability battery life benchmarks
daylight performance water resistance
portrait usage and so much more there's
a lot left to explore in the tablet sea
and we've just barely scratched the
surface here on day one keep it locked
to pocket now for comparisons follow-ups
and our full review coming soon and if
you just can't wait to buy your own
Xperia Z and you want one right now do
what we did visit Negri electronics in
the link down in the description and
while you're waiting for more on the
sony xperia tablet z follow us on social
media so you don't miss a thing drop us
a like if you did enjoy the video leave
a comment if you have something to add
or a question to ask us to cover in the
final review and as always thank you for
watching we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
