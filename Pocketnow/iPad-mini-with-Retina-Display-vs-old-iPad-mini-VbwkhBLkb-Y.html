new iPad Mini or save some and get the
old one I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the old iPad Mini
versus the iPad Mini with Retina display
last year Apple released the first
edition of the 7.9 inch iPad lineup
dubbed the iPad Mini compared to its
full sized iPad sibling the Mini was
seemingly a bit of a trade-off a cut in
power and quality in favor of additional
portability thanks to a reduction in
both size and weight that trade-off or
what many perceived as a compromise was
the pitfall of the iPad Mini but Apple
is at it again and this time it's no
holds barred is the iPad Mini with
Retina display the reboot the iPad Mini
lineup needed or does it still leave
much to be desired
let's take a look we're not going to
bore you with the intricate details when
it comes to hardware just know this the
old iPad Mini and iPad Mini with Retina
display feature virtually identical
designs and build quality they bear the
same chassis x' or almost the same
chassis x' some adjustments were made to
account for the Retina display and
additional battery at 200 millimeters
tall 134 point 7 millimeters wide and
7.5 millimeters thick the new iPad Mini
is just 0.3 millimeters thicker than
last year's model the Wi-Fi only model
of the original Mini was 308 grams while
the LTE model the one we have on hand is
312 just a tad heavier is the new iPad
Mini with Retina display 331 grams the
only other notable difference is the
addition of another mic near the top
edge on the new iPad Mini and of course
the LTE antenna cover which are new
Wi-Fi only iPad Mini does not have aside
from that the major differences are all
on the inside
last year's mini came in three storage
capacities 16 32 and 64 gigabytes with
512 megabytes of RAM it's powered by an
a5 chip composed of a one gigahertz
dual-core CPU and a dual-core CPU it's
fitted with a five megapixel rear camera
and a 1.2 megapixel front camera and
keeping things running is the 16 point 3
watt hour battery the iPad Mini with
Retina display offers one additional
storage option 128 gigabytes it comes
with 1 gigabyte of ddr3 ram and is
powered by the new a7 chip set a 1.3
gigahertz dual-core si
you in a quad-core GPU it too has a 5
megapixel camera around back and 1.2
megapixel camera up front but it's
battery is rated at 20 3.8 watt hours as
indicated by the name the biggest
difference however is the display both
are 7.9 inch IPS LCD panels but the
original iPad Mini came with a
resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels a
density of 162 pixels per inch the
Retina display I've had many bears a
resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels and a
density of 324 pixels per inch and the
difference can't be understated color
seems slightly more saturated on the
original iPad Mini but differences in
contrast brightness and black levels are
indistinguishable to the naked eye the
retina display appears more neutral and
temperature whereas the original airs on
the warm side and the difference in
clarity is incredible details are simply
lost on the original iPad Mini display
yet the finer details are accentuated on
the retina display it's an impressive
difference and if you're a pixel junkie
like many of us here at pocket now this
is all you need to see to justify the
difference in price edges of icons are
smooth and text is sharp the original
meaning offers jagged edges on just
about everything individual pixels are
visible and this is not an issue on the
new model and hardware alone these two
devices look virtually identical but
turn on the display and it's clear which
takes the cake in this battle not to
mention the upgraded internals are much
needed and welcomed software between
these two tablets is identical feature
for feature essentially iOS 7 looks more
fresh and cleaner with a handful of new
features such as control center airdrop
and improved test switching if you'd
like to see more on iOS 7 we've
extensively covered it and walk through
videos and previous reviews the other
important difference between last year's
iPad Mini and the new Mini is
performance the difference in the a5 and
a7 chips is staggering apart you may not
immediately see a difference the a5 is
decent at running everyday tasks and
simple applications however its
performance in gaming sometimes suffers
thanks to the two additional GPU cores
double the RAM and a more efficient CPU
the a7 doesn't show any signs of lag or
stutter even in graphic intensive gaming
both open applications and switch
applications quickly but then your iPad
Mini is a half beat ahead of the older
Mini at just about everything it does
the difference in benchmark performance
may help put it into perspective a bit
if that's your sort of thing the new
iPad Mini finishes the SunSpider
JavaScript test while the old Mini is
just getting warmed up and it finishes
nearly three times faster the speakers
you would expect to be virtually
identical but they have their
differences located in the same place
one on each side of the Lightning port
along the bottom edge the older iPad
Mini speakers have a little more punch
behind them providing more volume yet
the iPad Mini with Retina display
speakers sound more full after extensive
time with the old iPad Mini its battery
life was always pretty impressive only
needing to be charged every other day
with heavier usage it's possible to run
the battery down entirely in a single
day but it takes some determination so
far the newer iPad Mini is much of the
same story the Retina display and a7
warranted a larger battery but Apple has
seemingly maintained the 10-hour
standard will provide more detail in the
full review finally cameras they're
fairly comparable between the two
generations sometimes the new iPad would
provide a washed-out image with a poor
focus the next time the old iPad Mini
would and the newer iPad will take a
better shot every time it was back and
forth and the only consensus we can come
to is both are decent at taking pictures
not bad not great and still just as
awkward to hold and shoot with the
answer to the hundred dollar question
which is the better vibe is quite
obvious the iPad Mini with Retina
display offers the same great design and
only adds 0.3 millimeters to the
thickness and 23 grams to its heft while
also improving the specs across the
board it has a significantly better
display performance is noticeably more
smooth and it comes with an additional
storage option and twice the RAM we'd be
hard-pressed to recommend the older iPad
Mini to anyone who values performance
and display quality that said you can
get more bang for your buck with last
year's model it's $100 cheaper than the
current model and at $300 it's not a bad
deal
simply put however the iPad Mini with
Retina display is just a better deal at
$400 if you're even considering the iPad
Mini with a Retina display go for it
you'll be much happier in the end that's
