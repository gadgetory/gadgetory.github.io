reasons to take a lot of photos with an
HTC smartphone even if you don't dig the
company's unique approach to mobile
photography that's because with Zoe's
video highlights function you could
always mix down those mediocre stills
and videos into a short peppy highlight
reel made almost automatically which
gave the whole thing new life now HTC is
taking Zoe to the next level opening it
up for download to non HTC devices and
building it into its own social network
i'm michael fisher with pocket now here
with your first look at the new zoe the
first thing you'll notice that's
different about the new zoe is that it's
a standalone app accessible on many
devices running android for dot 4 and
above it sense 6 and above if it's an
HTC phone it's technically pre-release
not yet feature complete with version 1
point 0 plan for the fall users can send
feedback to beta at Zoe calm through a
feedback hub within the app jumping on
the Zoe for the first time takes you to
your own Zoe feed and here's where the
apps new incarnation stands out just
like a stream of posts on Twitter or
Facebook or more appropriately vine or
Instagram you immediately see Zoe's from
friends highlight reels of selected
pictures and videos augmented with music
and automatically cut together by HTC
software if you don't have any friends
the discover tab makes it easy to find
something posting your own Zoe is much
the same as it has been in the past
select what content you want included
both photos and videos then choose what
theme music you're looking for the Zoe
comes with some and you can also use
locally stored music but be mindful of
copyright concerns and choose what style
you want the zoe edited in you do have
the option for more granular control as
in cutting music to length and choosing
your start and end clips but we find the
software is surprisingly intelligent in
this regard leaving it to its own
devices usually results in a nice
concoction
when you're down editing you can keep it
private or send it out to the masses for
the kind of communal remix ngui was
built for you can recut zoe's from other
people friends or just randos who've
left there's always open to public
editing in our short time with the app
we're mainly using this feature to Zoe
bomb our friends but HTC envisions a
world where many people attending the
same event say a concert or a party
could cooperatively assemble a video
showing multiple perspectives of the
same thing there's a good mix of new and
old in the Zoe beta and maybe its most
exciting aspect is that it marks a
transition of sorts for HTC formerly
just a hardware manufacturer that
dabbles in software now a company
looking toward the future of software
and services to us the new Zoe looks
like a promising step in that direction
and if you have a newer Android phone
you can chime in yourself Zoe is
available for download in the google
play store right now for more on HTC see
our reviews and related content and be
sure to subscribe to pocket now if you
did enjoy this video until next time

watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
