sounds scary right but we live in a 24/7
information age where we use technology
for both work and play for the insanely
cool pocket computers we all rely on
every single one of the services on our
phones now plays on at least one
psychological trope to reinforce our
participation with that a per service
beeps chirps and vibrations stimulus
which trains us to react and we get that
dopamine hit in our brains whenever a
message like or reply arrives we're also
seeing research suggesting that night
time use of blue light might be
interrupting our body's natural sleep
rhythms tricking our brains into
thinking it's daylight but one of the
more anecdotal links between smartphone
use and potentially addictive behavior
might come down to just the colors that
your smartphone screen can produce a lot
of research has gone into the psychology
between colors and emotions how our
brains react to say the color red for
example now it could be something primal
baked into our DNA or it could just be a
result of living in a society which uses
that color to get your attention maybe
we're just trained to respond to the
color red but regardless our phones are
insane little colored generating
machines in addition to everything else
going on on our phones could a color
display be adding to that psychological
whammy of getting sucked into internet
apps and services well to test this I've
been using myself as a guinea pig for
the last week and I've switched my
galaxy s7 over into black and white mode
there are really easy settings to enable
on both iOS and Android to activate this
non color mode on Android for example
you're going to have to enable developer
settings first but once you have that
open you're going to slide down to an
option called simulate color space
you're going to activate a mode called
monochromacy Mahna crema c and phantom
you now have a device that displays all
of your content in grayscale the initial
switch was extremely jarring I didn't
realize how dependent I was on color to
locate my favorite apps and services
iconography means very little to me as
I'm navigating around my phone screens I
was just used to little blue splotch
well that's where onedrive lives and
ugly tie-dye splash that's where
Instagram is now but it only took about
a day
for me to react limit and then start
basing more of my phone navigation off
of brute force of muscle memory as
opposed to the visual eye candy I'm used
to on these really pretty AMOLED
displays now proponents of going
monochrome claim that by eliminating
color our brains won't be seeking the
exact same kind of chained responses
chain the gratification that when we
open our phones to do one thing we don't
find ourselves exhausting reddit two
hours later curving all of these
flashing colors all of these pretty
lights should help reduce to a small but
important degree the amount of
distractions we face when interacting
with mobile technology only using my
phone this way for a week it's difficult
for me to ascertain how my usage might
have been altered though anecdotally I
do find that my casual interactions with
my phone tend to be a little bit shorter
I seem to be more inclined to interact
with one notification and then just turn
my phone back off as opposed to looking
for other things to do again anecdotally
and that scientific body any stretch but
I also seem to be ending each day in
monochrome mode with a little bit more
battery than I was used to I really
don't think that monochrome mode uses
less power on a phone like the galaxy s7
I really do think this could be because
of shorter interactions with every time
I turn the screen on now why you should
take this with a huge lump rock of salt
is I am fully aware of what it is that
I'm testing and trying to achieve in
altering my own behavior as a test
subject in a psychological experiment of
one sample person I honestly can't say
whether I'm willing myself to use my
phone less or if I actually am seeing an
impact of no color on my screen subtly
influencing my brain chemistry to tone
down the gratification response of
operating smartphone that brain
chemistry is pretty tricky stuff and
what I can say is I do seem to be
experiencing the limit on the
entertainment aspects of using my
smartphone looking through Instagram for
example black and white is stunning for
photography but I don't have the same
urge to go through deep dives of looking
back through days of cataloged photos
like I used to Instagram was an app that
I very easily got lost in removing the
color from my phone screen just seems to
make it a little less fun and I
absolutely don't have any interest in
gaming on a monochrome display now as I
mentioned before a one-week study with a
sample size of one participant is hardly
conclusive woefully inadequate to draw
any kinds of answers from me doing this
but it was a fascinating experiment
especially just learning a little bit
about my own behavior especially on that
first day in turning the collar off and
it's an experiment that you can easily
conduct yourselves just to see how it
might impact your behavior when using
your phone when I'm in between review
devices here at pocket now I think I'm
gonna stick to this monochrome maseeh
mode on my smart phones to see how it
might affect my usage long term and I am
reaching out to several colleges to see
if I can get a proper psychiatrist on
maybe we can have an interview a brief
discussion about the the role of color
and stimulus response and gratification
on affecting our brain chemistry and
dumping that dopamine because that stuff
gets you high but seriously I think it
would be fun to follow up with an actual
expert in a couple months see if we can
hammer out some of the differences
between real science and then just sort
of internet placebo discussion and stay
tuned next month cuz we're gonna have
another challenge for the month of July
and I'm gonna be bringing high made
Iveta on board for a little contest a
photography contest and we're going to
need our viewers and subscribers to vote
on who wins as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for more videos like these
sharing is always greatly appreciated
and hit that thumbs up button for a
little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag mail you
can chat me up on Twitter and Instagram
has some gadget guy and I will catch you
all on the next video that brain
chemistry's
my brain chemistry's are pretty that
brain chemistry is that that brain
chemistry is pretty tricky stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
