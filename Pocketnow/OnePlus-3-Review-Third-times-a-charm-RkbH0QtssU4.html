first iteration of a product but we
really don't seem to start taking a
company seriously until we've seen them
in the market for three product releases
this is a big year for oneplus not only
reaching a third smartphone but also
growing up in dumping the invite
purchasing system used in the past now
any review of this phone can take one of
two courses focusing on the performance
of this device as it relates to the
price or treating this phone is more of
a competitor to higher priced flagships
for the sake of expediency we'll be
focusing on the former more than the
latter we can just take it for granted
that all value judgments and opinions
should end with the phrase for the price
so I don't have to repeat that
particular phrase at nauseam starting
with this design it's an attractive
handset the aluminum frame these clean
simple lines we're not breaking any new
style ground here but we're clearly
refining the brand's look which is
progress there is an evolution of sorts
moving from the oneplus 2 to this phone
even if we can't point to some
inspirations from companies like huawei
in HTC though the thinness is a bit
marred by this camera bulge on the back
overall it's a clean looking device it
might not turn heads when used in public
but it certainly won't be derided we do
miss the bolder design choices from
previous phones like the sandstone back
on the oneplus 2 I'm not particularly
won over by thinness so most of the time
spent reviewing it has lived in the
sandstone snap-on case a nice throwback
to the feel of the op2 but not quite as
elegant as having this material built
into the back of the phone on paper the
oneplus 3 has a respectable balance of
specs the 5.5 inch display is a 1080p
AMOLED panel more on the screen a bit
later in this review and below the
screen we've got a snappy always-on
fingerprint sensor which doubles as the
home button we have a Snapdragon 820 on
tap to power the device nice seeing the
current top-of-the-line chipset from
Qualcomm here the oneplus 3 has 6
gigabytes of RAM which you can't quite
really use all of and 64 gigabytes of
built-in storage there's a dual SIM card
tray but no microSD card expansion the
rear camera bolt holds a 16 megapixel
shooter with optical image stabilization
which is backed up by an 8 megapixel
front-facing
amaura and like the frame the battery
also shrinks to a 3000 milliamp hour
pack down from last year's 3300 but
still keeps pace with most flagships
produced this year
oneplus was early to the USB type-c game
and now adds their own flavor of fast
charging to the mechs yeah for $399 it's
a solid list of hardware features though
the display has already generated a
little controversy moving from an LCD
last year to AMOLED this year would
normally be a move we'd praised but the
screen on this phone really isn't one of
the 1+3 strong points I still stand by
my comment from our first impressions
video that it's generally fine at arm's
length
but it's dimmer than last year's oneplus
2 making it more difficult to see
outdoors another issue comes down to
this sub pixel arrangement on the
oneplus 2 LCD we see a proper RGB stripe
every pixel has corresponding red blue
and green sub pixels moving to AMOLED
means we lose some of those sub pixels
in a pentile arrangement this diamond
layout means we have fewer red and blue
dots than we do green short story long
this means text and fine detail just
won't be as crisp on this phone as it
was on last year's the problem isn't
1080p resolution on this screen size
it's how many dots make up that 1080p
resolution we still wouldn't call this a
deal-breaker but seeing is how looking
at a phone screen is kind of a major
thing that people do throughout the day
we can totally understand why this might
sour some folks on the oneplus 3 moving
to software another sign of this
company's maturity oxygen OS has
developed into a strong competitor
against the TouchWiz ha's and senses out
there as Android has gotten prettier
it's taken a lot of the pressure off of
manufacturers to skin it like crazy the
oneplus 3 UI is largely stocked with a
few elements to tweak the experience
there's a handy little side panel where
you can customize a vertical pane of
widgets and shortcuts we've got a
handful of gestures to weight the screen
or launch the camera there's a simple
alphabetized app drawer major kudos
there and the dark theme comes in handy
especially when using the phone at night
the main gripe we can point to might be
this home screen arrangement there's a
ton of wasted space at the top where a
whole extra row of icons could live we
can change the app drawer grid spacing
but not the home screen tiles but how
does this software run we're happy to
report that in app performance is
terrific no surprise as this is the same
processor you'll find in most flagship
phones sliding through the UI is slick
and smooth looking at apps which will
tax this Hardware games play great
implosion ran like buttah and while we
saw some stutters on Marvel's future
fight the lower screen resolution seems
to help here over phones like the galaxy
s7 and we're happy to report that after
a handful of missions the phone runs
cooler than metal back to devices
running last year's welcome 810
processor circling back to my earlier
jab about the RAM 1 plus considers this
a feature and not a bug this phone will
aggressively dump background apps from
memory to preserve battery life if
you're just swapping back and forth
between a handful of apps you're
unlikely to encounter issues but then
why have 6 gigabytes of RAM we really
hope oneplus loosens the restrictions on
this behavior like Samsung ultimately
did with similar RAM management last
year on the galaxy s6 but if you can't
wait the groovy dudes over at XDA have
already found a workaround to get a bit
more kick out of this hardware network
performance on AT&amp;amp;T was solid around
town though reception often lagged a
couple decibels behind the galaxy s7 and
indoors I would sometimes find the phone
had completely disconnected from the
network another issue we hope is
addressed in a future update and Wi-Fi
performance is similarly mid-pack your
connection to a router will fall off a
bit faster than when using more
expensive phones moving to the camera we
have the most in-depth review of the
oneplus threes capabilities available
online as a separate video linked below
this review you won't find a deeper dive
covering all aspects of this camera's
performance but as a brief overview this
phone camera is a solid performer with a
handful of compromises photos are
largely well exposed if a bit on the
juicy saturated side spot metering helps
make sure the camera is exposing for
what you focus on and the phase detect
fussing system is reliable enough for us
low-light performance is kind of
grainy mess though and there's a
separate HDR style the noise setting to
help clean up output but it's not well
communicated to consumers what this
setting does the app is clean simple and
well laid out but it could do with a
little bit better conveyance for
explaining how it all works
even though the phone produces UHD video
video performance is a bit weak
whether it's twitchy image stabilization
noise reduction wrecking the audio or
compression artifact ting wigging out
the sky we can't say this is one of our
favorite video shooters the slow motion
does come out smooth though so that's
kind of fun but seriously if you really
want to know what this thing can do hit
our real camera review to see over
thirteen minutes worth of samples in
glorious UHD resolution
shifting gears let's have a chat about
the audio it's one of the most glorious
moments as a reviewer when a phone truly
takes you by surprise initial
impressions were very positive clean
punchy balanced output from the
headphone jack this amp is more powerful
than the hardware found on the galaxy s7
or LG g5 and running this phone through
some analyzer tools it handily beat
those two flagships and trailed closely
behind some of our absolute favorite
music phones like the HTC 10 and LG v10
just nipping at the heels of the iPhone
6s this was shocking in the best way
possible the one plus three is a very
good option for the audiophile on a
budget and that bottom firing speaker is
no slouch either
not the loudest we've tested for alerts
and notifications but it provides
detailed and crisp playback
so what good is all this technology if
your battery can't hang a Qualcomm 820
paragrah the 3000 milliamp hour battery
is pretty well understood territory here
and we easily got all day runtime with
some juice to spare after dinner
looking at our media test streaming 30
minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 50
percent brightness the oneplus 3 drained
5 percent of its battery which is top to
your performance and if you need to top
off during the day you won't have much
of a wait plugging the phone in for 30
minutes delivered a 53% charge a word of
warning though as this fast charging
system is a proprietary solution from
oneplus not related to Qualcomm quick
charging system so you might not get
this speed if you aren't using the
supplied charger in cables so let's wrap
this up where does that leave us
with the oneplus 3 ignoring marketing
slogans for a second this is a superb
phone at 399 dollars and represents an
excellent bang for buck it's been an
exciting year for mid Rangers watching
companies push more top-tier hardware
into lower price tiers we have a proper
competitor to the iPhone se here and it
trades blows really well with many
phones from last year which have fallen
in price taking a swipe at one plus PR
though we do have a little settling to
do the dimmer grainy screen some camera
compromises proprietary fast charging
and twitchy RAM management and some
folks may be concerned about support and
software updates given the company's
history another area where cost needs to
be built into the price of a device
oneplus doesn't talk about killing
flagships anymore which is good as this
thing can't quite kill flagships it's
not really fair to this phone to compare
it against substantially more expensive
offerings even if the processors are the
same but what the oneplus 3 gets us is
pretty darn close to a true-blue
top-tier flagship experience but for a
lot less cash judged by that criteria
it's a successful experiment from a
company we're happy to see grow up as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full 1+3 coverage and
we mentioned the camera review because
you should really watch that camera
review for pocket now I'm Quan Carlos
bag now some gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
