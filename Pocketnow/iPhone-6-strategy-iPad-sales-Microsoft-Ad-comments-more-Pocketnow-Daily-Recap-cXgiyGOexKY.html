probably a little too yellow for me
people bitch about the stupidest things
tell me about it dude Jaime Jaime I
understand then what I don't understand
is why your name is Victoria Vieira you
can't speak Spanish that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi Natalie
better this is pocket now and this is
our pocket now daily recap for last week
so when Monday asked you how important
our notification LEDs for you as the
rumors are that Apple is getting a
glowing logo in the back of the iphone 6
with the purpose of it being a
notification LED we have 754 comments
out of which Phil culper says
notification LEDs are so 2006 my pebble
smartwatch is all I need for
notifications and with the iWatch coming
soon under the vacation LED would be
pointless that is the new trend that is
what's happening but smartwatches aren't
really taking off so let's wait and see
how that goes and chat on Coleman says
notification logo on the back of a phone
how convenient sarcasm I still have to
do an extra step turning the phone back
around to look at the screen and you
have a good point of accessibility of
the iphone you can actually turn on the
flash the servers in a notification LED
you can do that with galaxy phones as
well so it's not something that doesn't
exist that not something that hasn't
existed and I don't see the point in it
I agree with you then Steve D says
iphone fanboys say notification light is
a gimmick on Android phones and now they
will love it you know that all depends
Apple has done an amazing job with
notification LEDs on their previous
macbook lineup where you wouldn't even
see where the LED was and it would shine
for the battery indicator which was
really cool and also the other
notification LED that the company had
for the macbook so if they would pull
that often find but having it on the
apple logo is pointless then on Tuesday
I asked you if you were planning to buy
an iphone 6 this year as Apple's
preparing for tremendous demand from the
phone they're asking for staggering
number of units from its suppliers we
have 943 comments a lot of comments this
week thanks a lot guys starting with one
of the commenters that says it will be
impossible to buy an iphone 6 here in
Brazil the 5s costs 1200 bucks and
six will cost as much as a house yes
that is actually true in every country
outside the United States and outside of
your buying an iphone is extremely
expensive so yeah a lot of the struggle
with that out here but that being said
that's not the reality for everybody so
I do know that there is a market that
won't be so happy about it but you know
the way this works the mr. chaotic so
three says I'm planning to get one in
each of the iphone sizes and men you've
got a lot of cash dude at another
commoner says I've got the HTC One m8
and I'm very impressed I have zero
interest in the iphone this is a very
tough year for Apple there are a lot of
really great bones out there the one
inmate the LG g3 the gs5 yeah why not so
the Xperia z3 is one of the ones that
we're waiting for the most so it's
really tough for Apple to compete this
year hopefully they can Wow everybody
and if so then fine but a lot of people
are like this they're not even
considering it anymore then Wednesday
asked you what do you think iPads are
selling less unless the news were that
Apple squirrel results are in and the
iphone is selling more but the iPad has
been selling less for the past couple of
quarters we have 643 comments out of
which David lawmen welcome back to the
pocket now daily recap ipad sales are
down because everybody's got one that is
a tremendous point a lot of people have
noticed the difference between the ipad
air and the iPad 4 is really almost
nothing but design so what is the point
on upgrading if it's only a lighter
product that can do the same things the
JPC audience says ipad sales are down to
better android tablet options than in
the past especially Sam Singh and their
endless options and you are actually
wrong there or I'm going to defer with
your comment and the reason why is
because tablet sales are stagnant
everywhere not just on iPads everybody's
having trouble selling tablets mainly
because they already bought a tablet and
they haven't found the justification for
spending so much money for a product
that's not really a computer then mr.
mau5 says face it the ipad is an iphone
with a bigger screen and everything is
the same so why buy something you
already have even the ipod touch 5th
generation is like an iPhone Apple needs
to bring more feature specific devices
this is probably the best comment of the
week it's long by
specifically because of that because yes
the prom with tablet says this is just
the bigger iPhone this is just a bigger
smartphone and a lot of people are not
willing to pay so much money for a
tablet when they need extra
functionality why not just by a computer
instead tablets were supposed to solve
that but they haven't really solved it
and a lot of people have realized that
and that's probably the reason why a lot
of people are just staying with what
they have that on Thursday I asked you
if you think it's smart for apple to
launch its iPhone separately this year
as the rumors are this is part of the
company's strategy as number one they
can't actually have the bigger iPhone
ready and number two apparently they
want to launch it with the iWatch in
December and we have 267 comments out of
which wootton says one single iphone is
enough for a year I'd hate to have to
change every six months you don't have
to change every six months but you do
have a point it's really troublesome to
have something cooler out there than
what you bought two months earlier then
Mike will be welcomed back to the
comments again they should release both
at the same time like you said I don't
want to have a new iphone be outdated
six months after i get it and yes we
were talking about six months cycles in
the video and six months cycles are cool
for certain products but Sony's not
really having a good time revamping the
z1 z2 z3 six months after the other they
haven't really found the success they're
looking for because people don't want to
feel that their products are obsolete
and so you hope that from buying because
now does III SL you're going to wait for
the z4 coming out in January lives you a
lot of problems then another commoner
says one phone a year is the best cycle
a lot of people defer that especially
samsung but you know it does work one
phony here is more than enough from
every category I think that's the way it
should be that's my opinion then I'm
Friday ask you what do you think about
the Microsoft parody video of the
surface pro 3 and one note as the
company released this sort of add on
YouTube that is probably one of the most
ridiculous videos I've ever seen we have
269 comments out of which mr. joe says
my ex popped out when i watch the ad
lord have mercy on windows and yes lord
have mercy on Microsoft and have mercy
and you as well
okay let me say a lot of those says I
love Microsoft Microsoft products
Windows Windows Phone etc but this is
utterly disgusting and you know
Microsoft has had some very good ads
like the really campaign but it
completely deterred from the purpose of
selling a phone so it's like if their ad
agency doesn't really get it sometimes I
don't understand then the sting carmel
says this is not an ad made by an ad
agency it was a fun project made by the
OneNote team hence why there doesn't
look like they're professionals they
aren't they are engineers having fun
don't be jerks we are not Church number
one number two the video production
requires a professional crew so even if
they were having fun there was
production involved 12 if you are going
to be showing this on youtube to the
whole world you better make sure that
what you're doing is good it's like us
doing a crappy video and expecting you
guys to like it so the problem really is
whether it was made by an ad agency or
not does it give you the right message
to buy a product and the problem is the
video didn't it was actually marking its
own products so the biggest problem is
even if this wasn't an ad that aired in
the Super Bowl it's really not something
that makes you want to buy their
products and that's really the reason
why if it's not that cool and why
publish it thats it for our pocket now
