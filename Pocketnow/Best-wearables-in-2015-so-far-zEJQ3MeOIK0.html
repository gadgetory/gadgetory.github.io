attention as smartphones and tablets do
so it can be hard to keep up with the
latest devices even if you're in the
market for them I'm hiya to Houston with
pocket now and let's explore some of the
best wearables in the first half of 2015
starting off our list is the Alcatel
OneTouch watch it's one of the cheapest
round screen smart watches and though it
carries over the flat tire design of the
Moto 360 it brings much better battery
life than most of its competition the
non removable watch band integrates NFC
for easy pairing and there's even a
built-in USB connector to charge the
watch without the need for a special
cradle or a custom port the interface is
extremely minimal mostly using single
touch toggles and while the software is
proprietary it's compatible with both
Android and iOS making it a great
low-cost SmartWatch that almost anyone
can enjoy then there's the pebble time
we were already fond of the original
pebble and pebble steel but the time
introduced pebbles timeline you I a new
SmartWatch interface that puts focus on
your daily schedule also new to the
pebble time or voice input and a colored
ePaper display both of which instantly
make the older models feel antiquated by
comparison it isn't the prettiest watch
around and in fact most would argue that
the time regreses in design for last
year's pebble steel but if you don't
mind waiting a little longer the pebble
time steel is just on its way up next
the Apple watch is one of the best
smartwatches currently on the market and
if you already have an iphone it's one
of only two SmartWatch options the other
being pebble like all other smartwatches
the Apple watch pulls in notifications
and augments your smartphone but there
are a few extra features tucked in as
well like the ability to use Apple pay
you can choose from a number of sizes
materials and watch bands to best suit
your style and while it's far from cheap
and honestly probably not a very good
bye in its first iteration there's no
better companion accessory for the
iphone now we would have just picked one
enjoyed where SmartWatch for this list
but the fact of the matter is everyone
has different tastes and what they want
to wear on their wrist so we're leaving
this one open-ended you can pick up an
LG G watch for as cheap as fifty dollars
or go all out on a watch urbane for
about five times that but no matter
which you buy you'll be getting a
an experience that's tightly integrated
with your android phone the recent five
dot one update brought performance
upgrades and additional features to the
platform and its utility and voice
commands and Google now make Android
wear worth buying finally coming in at
number one is the HTC re vive no it's
not a SmartWatch and in fact it's not
even available to buy yet but the vibe
is arguably the best virtual reality
headset to date and a hands-on demo left
our own Michael Fisher at a loss for
words but you're like when when I put on
this thing and part of the demo is
you're like a mile underwater and this
this whale swims pattern your face I
swear to God my knees trembled and my
breath my breath increased my and then
the guy giving me the demo said listen
you don't have to worry it's not an
aggressive whale if you've been itching
to try out a VR kit the HTC vive should
be at the very top of your list all of
our pics are of course subjective and if
your list looks a little different from
ours let us know what you would have
highlighted down in the comments below
