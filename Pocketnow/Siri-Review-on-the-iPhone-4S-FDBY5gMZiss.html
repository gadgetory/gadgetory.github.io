pocketnow.com is Siri on the iPhone 4s
useful well let's ask her
Siri are you useful she doesn't know
what I mean let's talk about Syria so
this is gonna be kind of an editorial
video where I'm going to talk about how
Siri works in my life and how it really
doesn't work in my life whether Siri
will work for you will be determined by
what kind of environments you find
yourself in and what kinds of things you
do with your phone so to start I should
say that I don't like talking to a phone
when I use an Android phone I seldom use
the voice to text feature because I'm
either in a loud environment I don't
want people to around me to know what
I'm saying
it's rude for me to talk to my phone
when I'm around other people or the
technology isn't that good because I
can't speak naturally sometimes I have
to speak like a robot the same applies
to Siri there are very limited use case
scenarios when I can actually use it
when I'm by myself at the office I can
use it when I'm at home I can use it but
if I'm in any social social situation
when I want to use it most when I want
to remind myself of something or when I
want to make an appointment I can't use
it because I'm in a loud environment or
I don't want to seem kind of rude in
front of all my friends or whomever I'm
with now Siri holds a lot of promise and
there's some really cool use case
scenarios that I think we're going to
see in the future when the technology
gets better but for now let's talk about
what Siri can do and I'll come back and
tell you about some of those really cool
things where I think Siri is going in
the future okay so let's talk about some
of the really cool ways you can use Siri
I think number one coolest way you can
use Siri Siri is with geofence 'it's so
Siri knows that I'm brand the minimun it
knows where I live and knows where I
work so I can tell it to remind me to do
something when I get home or when I get
to work let's check it out
remind me to call my wife when I get
home here's your reminder for when you
get home
as you can see be quite sorry as you can
see it says call my wife and it says a
rival home and it will literally when
you get within the area of your home as
specified by the content that you've
associated with Siri it will alert you
to call your wife I mean that is such
cool technology another great use for
Siri is making calendar appointments so
let's try that schedule a call with Bob
tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. okay here's your
meeting note that you already have an
all-day meeting about my seals birthday
for tomorrow 7:00 so it knows what's on
your calendar already and it looks for
conflicts on your calendar which is
really cool you can move meetings if you
want you can you can delete a meeting
even if you want so let's do some other
things with Siri Siri can really
understand human ways of asking for
things like should I wear my raincoat
tonight and it gives you the hourly
forecast which is super cool it knows
where you are it's pulling the weather
very cool use of Siri let's ask it
something else some some general source
of a piece of information how tall is
the Empire State Building it could be
faster that's one problems for you there
we go Empire State Building this is from
Wolfram Alpha down there you can see
that or let's ask it what time is it in
Beijing now of course you can go to
Google and you can type this stuff into
Google it's a little bit faster asking
Siri now it is awkward if you're doing
this while you're at a restaurant and
you're really trying to find out what
time it is in China you can under the
table you know type what time is it in
China and Google you can't open up your
phone take
your phone in front of everybody and say
what time is it in China it's just sort
of a use case scenario thing you have to
be in the right setting to be able to
use Siri there's a lot of other stuff
that Siri does in fact if you tap and
hold you click the I here are the things
you can do you can call people you can
play music you can send a text message
it taps into the native SMS application
but it doesn't tap into say Twitter or
Google Voice or anything like that you
can set up meetings you can set
reminders probably one of the coolest
usages usages it's not a word probably
not
you can get directions on how to get
home it taps into the email app the
weather app the stocks up all the
default built in Apple made applications
again there are no there's no
third-party app support yet but that's
probably coming you can make notes which
is really cool you could do a web search
and you can use Wolfram Alfre to come up
with statistical information one of the
coolest uses beyond reminders is this
notes so let's let's do one of those
note that my wife's birthday is April
14th hopefully you don't forget that
noted okay so it noted it now let's go
into the notes application and see what
we have there it is 108 p.m. a note so
you can dictate notes imagine you're
driving by yourself and people aren't
around you and you have a brilliant idea
well you can use Siri to tap into the
notes application to take a note or to
remind you to do something so a lot of
personal information management
functions can be carried out with Siri
and and that's pretty much it right now
great in a lot of situations but in some
situations just not very useful and the
technology isn't really that good to
where it's incredible and and hopefully
it's going that way now that we've
talked about things that Siri can do
today let's talk about the things that
Siri might and probably should be able
to do in the future really cool uses of
artificial intelligence a mention Siri
being smart enough to have a
conversation with a human a real
real-time conversation that's not you
know you have to wait a minute and then
it converts it sends it up to the cloud
it sends it down
gives you an answer real-time
conversation where it can actually
understand logic throughout not just one
or two exchanges but three four or five
exchanges great example it cell Siri to
make you a restaurant reservation PF
Changs 7:00 p.m. tonight Siri knows
where you live so it knows that the F
trend should go - it knows how many
people you have in your party and it
calls PF Changs for you has a
conversation with the hostess and makes
the reservation this stuff is totally
possible maybe not with today's
technology but technology that's not too
far off or what if Siri could tap into
third-party apps and this is something
that is most likely coming so for
example you have an amazon.com app and
Siri taps into that so you say Siri buy
the Microsoft quiet key keyboard have it
sent to my office and Siri knows your
credit card information it knows your
login it ties into Amazon and boom it
places the order for you or even Twitter
or Facebook you can send updates to
Twitter or Facebook it knows how to
integrate with Twitter and Facebook or
maybe even Kindle applications so your
iBooks in the case of an iOS device so
you can say Siri download me super
freakonomics and boom moments later it's
paid for it it's ready to read on your
home screen a lot of great uses coming
for Siri in the future we hope that's
probably the vision for Apple it will
understand you're buying preferences
where you live what you like it will be
able to have a conversation a real human
conversation and the possibilities are
really endless
so right now Siri is a kind of useful in
some situations but generally not useful
in my opinion but in the future it's
going to get really interesting so tell
us what you think series should be used
for and where you hope the technology is
going if you like this video please give
it a thumbs up and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
