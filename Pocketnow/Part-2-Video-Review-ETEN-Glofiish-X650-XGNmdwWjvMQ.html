park
our common this is part two of the video
review for the eaten Blowfish X
d in this edition will look into saw
where as I mentioned there are 24
built-in applications as you see here
which will cover out of the box from the
device let's begin with our today's
screen as I mentioned in the unboxing
video you get spb mobile shell though
beware this is a lite version you don't
get the total version you need to pay
1495 to get the complete one and this is
1.5 in the wireless manager which we
have here which is pretty much standard
though pixelate a bit so it's qvga i
guess a gsm bluetooth Wi-Fi and then you
turn around are off from here and then
just as you see here then these are the
application selectors at the right which
allow for settings so for example if
we're going into phone settings one of
the things i like about this device is
that you get different ringtones as
opposed to what you get typical in
windows mobile devices something really
welcomed in this device another thing i
like is that you're able to choose the
skin since i'm not fond of this e 10
screen you can just choose to keep the
windows mobile screen instead something
nice zoom SMS is an application that
will pull in SMS messages and make them
bigger for you to see which is nice we
have a call filter which i'll look into
later on the rest is pretty much
standard one of the things you'll notice
about this device is that the bluetooth
the stack is different it's not really
the one included for microsoft we have
different options here we have a we're
not going to pair anything so let's
leave that for later we have a white
w-lan utility or Wi-Fi stack is also
different from the microsoft included i
haven't had any problems with that i
could say it's good i could say it's
livable you'll notice there is also a
battery bar at the top which is
different and you can choose to turn
this all on or all off well nothing out
of the ordinary speed dial is an
application that will allow you for
example if you have a lot of numbers
that you frequently dial there though
they are going to be here and then index
tell for example emergency which is the
only number i have there is a
pretty much available if you type in the
name of somebody or something else
really nice though nothing out of the
ordinary office 6.1 office mobile 6.1 is
included which is also welcomed let's
continue on here Oh something I forgot
to mention we have a really neat task
manager which you can activate from here
or you can also activate using the home
button which will bring this application
launcher for landscape scenarios
flashlight for the flash the task
manager s in this file explorer
calculator wireless manager or FM tuner
and there it goes again starting in it
programs the GPS viewer you see here is
not really something real big it'll just
tell you where you're going longitude
latitude speed nothing really out of the
ordinary you don't get any mapping
software so you need to purchase that a
site if you're interested location s and
that's what it'll do is it'll send the
test message of your exact XY
coordinates to somebody else and let
them know where you are if they have a
gps-enabled device in multimedia we have
a camera application which is not
nothing out of the ordinary you have an
FM tuner and there are editions of the
glofish which this is not my case which
included FM transmitter to transmit your
media to your car stereo sadly this this
edition that I have doesn't included but
I have noticed some other videos where
it is included multiple you manager is
simply to view pictures and videos and
the name card manager will allow you to
take pictures of name cards and pull the
information into your contacts something
really really nice that's included in
the device phone we have a ringtone just
simply to add other ringtones a call
filter which is one of the things I've
enjoyed most about the device I can
block the incoming calls and also block
incoming SMS messages which can't come
in handy in tight situations scenarios
will allow us to define if we want
profiles for ringtones or stuff like
that so we have different notes here and
this is something real good that we
don't see in a professional devices only
in standard ones the other things we've
already seen and covered then we have in
utilities practically application
recovery one of the things I like about
this device is if we go to remove
programs the 24 built-in applications
can be uninstalled which is something I
like though beware because since I
mentioned the the Wi-Fi stack and the
Bluetooth stack are different one of the
things you'll notice is if you want
install them some of the things won't
work in the device so be careful what
you do or what you wish for backup
utility is honestly something I haven't
liked much it's it isn't really good
because you don't get to define
everything you'd like to back up it only
backs absurd stuff not everything you'd
like like some things including and
Sprite backup oven or an SVP backup so
it's just a novelty there nothing really
i'll use default settings will hard
reset your device erase everything em
desk is an application launcher which I
haven't liked much it stabbed but it's
not really the design to be operated
with a d-pad so it's not really
something I find functional yeah bars
and everything but then again you have
other applications which could do a
better job and that's pretty much for
what's included hearing utilities voice
command there is a instead of voice
command for Microsoft ecat voice
commander which is different it's really
good all right it's really nice that you
can I won't say come in it's really nice
that you can train it and also it'll
also listen and understand your commands
if they're predefined after that
everything is pretty much standard you
get internet sharing other different
applications nothing really out of the
ordinary this is pretty much it for part
two of our video review in certain
applications I'll continue on with a
part 3 and the other built-in
applications included in the device
so this is pretty much it for now for
parking now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
