when two behemoth smartphones go
toe-to-toe I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the sony xperia z
ultra versus a samsung galaxy note 2 it
never fails there's always that one
commenter who is up in arms over the
fact that we sometimes pit old hardware
against new devices like the new Nexus 7
comparison against the iPad Mini from
last year the fact of the matter is
these are often the best comparisons
with the biggest contrasts that just so
happened to show how far technology has
come in a short while sometimes they
also prove the opposite of what you
might initially assume and that's
exactly why we're comparing the most
recent oversized phone with what many
consider to be the gold standard in the
category the Xperia Z ultra versus the
Galaxy Note 2 which one of these
gigantic phones comes out the victor
let's find out before we get too far
into this however we'd like to thank our
friends at Negri electronics for lending
us an Xperia Z ultra for a review period
be sure to check out the site at Negra
electronics comm for mobile devices and
accessories as far as hardware concerns
go there is only one major similarity
between the Z ultra and galaxy note 2
they're both significantly larger than
your average smartphone the Z ultra
measures one hundred and seventy nine
point four millimeters tall and ninety
two point two millimeters wide meaning
it's a full twenty eight point three
millimeters taller and eleven point
seven millimeters wider than the note
two on the other hand at six point five
millimeters thick it's nearly three
millimeters thinner than a nine point
four millimeter thick note - and being
composed mostly of glass on the front
and back it weighs much more than
Samsung smartphone tablet combo device
212 grams - the note 2 is more
respectable 183 grams all of this means
something quite significant size is
everything when you compare the size of
the Z ultra to the size of your hand to
the size of your pockets and the size of
everywhere you would normally stash your
phone it poses a problem the Galaxy Note
2 was once considered to be too large by
many but over time and has become
accepted as the norm it fits in our
pockets with room to spare with a little
practice in the aid of the curved back
we can use the device one-handed and the
button configuration is quite economic
we have to struggle to fit the Z ultra
in our pockets and we're forced to
readjust often especially when sitting
down there's no hope of using the device
one-handed and the rectangular design
lends no help in that respect either the
button configuration similar to the much
smaller Xperia Z is quite odd as well
the difference is substantial the Galaxy
Note 2 is two parts phone - one part
tablet the Xperia Z ultra is the exact
opposite two parts tablet and one part
phone and we can't necessarily fault it
for that it's great at what it's
designed for but there's no denying that
it's designed severely limits the number
of potential buyers composition is quite
different as well the Z ultra like its
Xperia brethren is covered with two
slabs of glass one on the front and one
on the back and the edges are made up of
a matte finished plastic for extra grip
the result is a superb build quality
likewise the note 2 is just like its
closest galaxy siblings it's made mostly
of plastic and coated in a hyper glaze
finish its edges unlike the Z ultra are
rounded making it much more comfortable
to hold size aside and the end result is
a device that doesn't necessarily feel
spectacular in the hand but other
features more than make up for it such
as the s-pen both are also fingerprint
magnets which we're not exactly fond of
but there is one area where the Z ultra
is the clear winner specifications it
comes with a Snapdragon 800 chipset
composed of a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
Krait CPU and Adreno 330 GPU 2 gigabytes
of RAM 16 gigabytes of built-in storage
with a micro SD card slot ip55 and ip57
camera 2 megapixel front-facing camera a
3050 million power battery and Wi-Fi
b/g/n AC the Galaxy Note 2 has a 1.6
gigahertz quad core Exynos chip said
comes in either 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of
storage expandable by way of microSD
card 2 gigabytes of RAM an 8 megapixel
camera 1.9 megapixel front camera 3100
million power battery and only Wi-Fi
b/g/n and then there's the displays
measuring 5.5 diagonal inches at a
resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels the
Galaxy Note 2 offers a pixel density of
276 pixels per inch the six point four
inches
display on the Z ultra comes with a
1080p resolution and offers 344 pixels
per inch the display on the Z ultra is
markedly more crisp with no visual signs
of pixelation however the AMOLED panel
on the note 2 offers deeper blacks with
more saturation both are quite bright
though we give the edge to the Z ultra
and in the Z ultras defense the Mobile
BRAVIA Engine 2 helps boost saturation
when viewing photos and videos we have
to give it to the Galaxy Note 2 for
overall usability and practicality
however the display of the Z ultra and
the superior design and build quality
make it a very close match though the
software offered on both of these
smartphones doesn't look all that
similar the features beneath the surface
put them on a fairly level playing field
at its core the Z ultra is running
Android version 4.2.2 beneath Sony's
expansive customizations if you've used
an Android powered Sony device in last
year or so you'll be able to find your
way around fairly easily not a lot has
changed the same icons of widgets are
present as found on the Xperia Z ZL and
tablet Z and the ever so slight changes
to stock Android are scattered about the
system and lest we forget Sony's skin
comes with various themes that allows
the user to change the look and system
accent color between corpse amber
emerald sapphire silk xperia amethyst
and Ruby the Galaxy Note 2 running an
older version of TouchWiz is two point
versions behind the latest version of
Android it's running Android version
4.1.2 meaning it's missing some of the
latest features like lock screen widgets
and daydream mode but like any version
of TouchWiz it will be familiar to
anyone who has used it in the last two
years as the same icons widgets
wallpapers and pre installed
applications between the two the
offerings are quite the same pull down
the notification shade and you have a
set of quick setting toggles you can
adjust which toggles appear and their
order on both devices you can customize
the number of home screens both also
have battery saving software the Z
ultras is called stamina and the note
two's is simply called power saving mode
taking advantage of their larger
displays they both offer unique ways of
multitasking as well the Z ultra offers
Sony's small apps hit the recent apps
button in the various small apps are
accessible at the bottom of the display
the note 2 has the multi window feature
which splits the display in half and
allows two applications to run Simon
Dainius Lee you can also hold the button
on the s-pen and DoubleTap on the
display to open an S note and atop any
application there's hardly anything
between these two on the software side
but we have to hand it to the Xperia Z
ultra for the lower dpi setting
out-of-the-box which squeezes more
information on the display plus it has
dual shock 3 wireless controller support
built-in to boot in daily performance
the two devices offer enough horsepower
for standard activities emailing web
browsing text messaging taking and
sharing photos and other typical stuff
when you get into heavy multitasking or
gaming there's a great divide the
Snapdragon 800 delivers significantly
more power to the Z ultra than the
Exynos chip does to the note 2 this is
evident in both synthetic benchmarks and
to the naked eye we've experienced no
lag on the Z ultra the same can be said
for the note 2 however we must note that
we have been experiencing some
touchscreen issues with the Z ultra even
after several factory resets battery
life is still up in the air the Galaxy
Note 2 is most notably known for its
exceptional battery life at least by
today's standards it's a full day plus
kind of device we're not so sure about
the Z ultra just yet I've had to factory
data reset does the ultra a handful of
times now and has gotten in the way of
testing the battery data at least on
paper though these two offer similar
capacities 3050 milliamp hours in the Z
ultra and 3100 million powers in the
note 2 it's difficult to say how the 6.4
inch 1080p display and the snapdragon
800 will affect the sort of capacity
just yet so keep an eye out for the full
review next week
finally the cameras both devices come
with eight megapixel cameras in terms of
hardware the biggest difference is the
lack of an LED flash on the Z ultra and
software they both compact the brim with
effects filter shooting modes and other
settings to tweak but at the end of the
day the note 2 has a marginally better
camera mainly because it's easier to
wield when shooting the note 2 offers
truer to life colors but was quick to
overexpose and was subject to blurry
images the Z ultra often aired on the
very cool side and offered no more
detail or stunning images than the note
2 where one fell short the other picked
up the slack and vice-versa
there's no denying the Xperia Z ultra is
a phenomenal piece of work and the sales
and popular
of the galaxy note2 should speak to its
quality as well so which of these
smartphones do you fill is the best
overall we choose the Galaxy Note 2 as
great as the Xperia Z ultra maybe it's
impractical Sony basically took all the
great things about the Xperia tablet Z
and crammed it down into a tighter
neater package and decided to market it
as a foam and that's where the problems
with this device begin to start it's
simply too big for comfort that's
partially subjective but we feel those
who disagree with the statement will be
few and far between
it doesn't comfortably fit in our
pockets and it isn't ergonomic at all we
felt the Galaxy mega 6.3 was borderline
too big and we were right six point
three inches is too big to still be
considered a smart phone the phone has a
dpi setting more along the lines of a
tablet and as a result it often runs
tablet applications instead of phone
apps so if you're willing to carry
around a small tablet everywhere with
you the Z ultra may be the best device
for you period
otherwise we suggest sticking with the
Galaxy Note 2 for a more foam-like
experience that's all we have time for
so if you enjoyed it let us know by
clicking the thumbs up button below and
stay tuned for the full Xperia Z ultra
review next week follow us in all the
usual channels Facebook Google+ and
