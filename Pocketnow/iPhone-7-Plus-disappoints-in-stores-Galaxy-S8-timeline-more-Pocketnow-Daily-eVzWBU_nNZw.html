before reaching retail stores the
Samsung Galaxy s8 is now slated for a
possible launch earlier than expected
and be ready to power down your Galaxy
Note 7 even on the subway
I'm Jaime Rivera and according to Batman
aka my beloved 7 year old son under this
this is an approved shirt this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals if you are in the
market for Galaxy s7 edge which is
pretty much the option you've got left
right now if you want to go curved on
Samsung well the UK is now bundling the
gear VR again it was a really good deal
at the beginning I really can't say that
I've ever used my gear VR but I do know
a lot of people that enjoy the are for
more than gaming and you know that's
kind of shady but hey that's an option
for you can learn more and looking for
discretion now some very interesting
developments have surrounded the HTC
Bold the phone that's being rumored to
be the company's and next flagship it's
been covered recently though we couldn't
cover it because we're ready phone
Berlin but the rumors are that this
phone will be available next month and
Sprint and for those of you that are
wondering why the name both just
remember the HTC Thunderbolt which was
one of my favorite variants of a phone
of it was in fridge terrible battery
life but obviously it innovated LT could
be innovation for this phone as well now
things just continue getting ridiculous
for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 as the MTA
in New York has already issued on
Twitter a statement asking people to
turn off their Galaxy Note 7 it makes
all the sense in the world imagine you
being a subway and that thing catching
fire it is really sad I still continue
to feel really sad for Samsung in the
way this is currently developing my
advice to everyone just please return
the phone get a replacement let's not
risk anything else and speaking of this
whole Galaxy Note 7 debacle analysts
already claiming that samsung might be
ready to pull a Galaxy s8 before
expected obviously the company is going
to struggle with everything that's
happening with the note 7 we even saw an
s7 catch fire recently apparently so
yeah the company really needs to get its
name back and it's just so sad the
company has made some tremendous changes
that are positive with this new
administration it sad to see everything
that's happening with the galaxy note 70
and finally the very disappointing news
of the day have to do with any jet-black
iPhone and the iPhone 7 plus Apple has
already issued a statement telling
people that they are going to waste
their time at the store trying to get
any of these because none will be
available no tax no seven pluses at any
store on launch date and this is really
sad Apple has clearly not figured out a
way to meet the men on launch day this
happened this well with the iPhone 6
plus in its original launch and we just
don't really understand what the whole
point is of telling people that this
phone will be available at stores on day
one if it won't be and it makes you
wonder wouldn't we just rather wait a
couple of extra weeks for the official
launch and for Apple to be able to meet
the demand that's claiming it leads me
to the question of the day are you
disappointed with the news are you still
going to settle for an iPhone 7 or are
you gonna wait it out
in my case well I was there on pre-order
time I cannot wait to get my 7 plus for
review but then again hey I am
disappointed with this whole thing that
Apple is pulling a lot of people already
in line and they are for that dual
camera module etc but leave us a comment

opinion friends you know the way it goes
