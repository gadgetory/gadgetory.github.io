in the Google Play Store you're faced
with a sea of choices from chic to super
minimal but only one stands out as a
watch that would survive an extended
dose of real world use and abuse if that
kind of thing is important to you the
LGG watch our might just be your
SmartWatch of choice
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our g watch our video review at
$299 the G watch R is the most expensive
SmartWatch in the Google Play Store and
you could be forgiven for having a
little deja vu here the last time a new
G watch hit the Play Store it came in at
a higher price point than the superior
gear live from Samsung this time around
the LG product is doing battle with a
Motorola competitor and once again the
LG offering bears a less premium look
and feel despite a higher price tag but
the G watch are like most Android wear
devices is sold out as a press time so
for some price is obviously no object
and what you'll get for your money is a
watch that feels right at home on the
boat or the beach somewhat less so in
the ballroom it's almost 10 millimeters
thick and made entirely of stainless
steel with a changeable leather band
attached to big shoulder like brackets
that combined with the sunken screen and
big side button to give the whole thing
a very masculine very rugged look and
feel the P OLED screen is on the small
side at one point three inches but it's
also the best quality we've seen on an
Android wear watch it's absolutely
gorgeous in both active mode and the
power saving ambient display that's all
well and good but we can't help thinking
the G watch our would have benefited
from a few more design revisions overall
and in particular a different typeface
on the accent numbers which really serve
no purpose other than to break up the
thick bezel as it is you really can't
tell how well-built this watch is until
you strap it on once you do you're left
with the feeling that the G watch are
can handle all kinds of abuse and with
ip67 dust and water resistance it can
like all Google smartwatches the G watch
are uses the Android wear platform to
keep you abreast of everything from new
emails to weather and social updates to
calendar appointments and beyond all of
it via a Bluetooth connection to an app
on your smart phone it tracks your heart
rate and step count to let you know how
healthy your being and it lets you talk
to it if you really don't want to take
your phone out of your pocket or purse
LG has made some improvements to the
software experience in about the only
area Google allows manufacturers to do
so watch faces the G watch are ships
with faces showing everything from
simple date and time to moon phase to
health and wellness to the one that
seems best suited to the hardware's
brawny build a hiking watch face with a
compass altimeter and pedometer cool
combine all these with the hundreds of
custom faces and apps you can download
from the Play Store and you can make the
G watch R into basically whatever you
want it to be on the face anyway as a
platform Android wear itself has
remained largely unchanged since we
reviewed it this summer and that will be
the case until the recently leaked
lollipop build goes official presumably
sometime soon you can find the link to
that story at pocket now and to our full
Android wear review in the description
below that consistency means that
everything we loved about Android wear
we loved just as much on the G watch our
for our three week review period it's
convenient to get notifications on the
wrist in beautiful color for essentially
any app you can think of it's still
impossibly futuristic to navigate to a
destination by wrist it's great to be
able to check the weather just by
looking at the watch face or to reply to
messages by voice and presumably thanks
to the Snapdragon 400 processor
responsiveness is consistently smooth
and quick and then there's the flipside
it's still frustrating to dictate all
but the simplest shortest replies by
voice just testing out Android wear to
see if it's improved at all no it hasn't
because I paused and I shouldn't paused
and come on dudes
it's still irritating that just as you
start getting used to the notion of
using your watch for more it forces you
to pick up your phone for something it
could easily do itself and it's annoying
that the watch often misinterprets arm
movements lighting up when you're not
looking at it protip when you want to
dim the screen with the palm gesture
you'll find the G watches sunken panel
makes that tougher a two finger tap
works much better back on the bright
side with battery life the G watch are
more than lives up to the admittedly low
bar of Android wear endurance two to
three days even with ambient display
turned on so you can see the watch face
at all times replenishment is a very
quick operation with the high quality
charging dock which provides a full
charge from zero in a little over an
hour and finally if you want you can use
the four gigs of on-board storage to
turn the watch into a simple mp3 player
for a workout we didn't test this too
thoroughly but it is nice to have that
capability we still don't understand why
the G watch r is as expensive as it is
sure it offers a good Android wear
experience but not so much better than
the competition to warrant the extra
cost and given the kind of half-finished
state of Android wear and wearable
platforms in general it's tough to
aggressively get behind anything on the
market at this point but if you're an
Android user already sold on
smartwatches you don't care about
dropping a few dollars and you're
looking for something solid the G watch
r is just that lurking beneath its
clunky case is one of the best Android
wear devices you can buy today with the
best screen we've seen on any SmartWatch
and a platform that's due for some big
upgrades coming soon if you're
definitely buying an Android wearable
this holiday season you could certainly
do a lot worse than this
if you want to know how the gee watch
are stacks up against that other round
