possibly bringing Minaj yeah you heard
that right while was having trouble
shipping phone to the United States and
they're still selling well and I will
keep losing market share this year even
if the company sticks to its own way of
doing business I'm Jaime Rivera and I do
have to agree the p20 Pro has me like a
kid in a candy store but wait for our
video review there are a ton of things I
need to tell you about that phone
this is pocket out daily the official
you say begin with product launches
because there aren't any deals available
right now
the Fitbit versed now goes live globally
for those of you interested in an Apple
watch competitor at least when it comes
to the looks the functionality is not
really there there's no GPS
functionality for example and with the
launch special features will not be
available until later through a software
update so yeah still 200 bucks it's a
good deal and how about if we talk about
Apple for those of you that think that
Cupertino is having a great time
particularly with the iPhone 10 not
selling much as it turns out China has
proven to be really difficult the
company has lost six points in market
share down to 19% is of something that
has happened for the first time ever I
mean Apple has been extremely popular in
China yet I still see iPhone sense
everywhere so I wonder exactly you know
why now let's talk about Huawei yes
there are some terrible news with the
fact that the company is really
struggling to be able to figure things
out in the United States when it comes
to the government but as it turns out
the company actually has been selling
phones devices like the Knights empro
addition to the p20 Pro have already
pretty much sold almost 20 million units
that is something crazy obviously not
necessarily just in the United States
but it's clear that these phones are
popular I've been using them for a bit
and I am extremely surprised
and speaking of Vannes a company that
has is really shark 2zt I mean the
company is pretty much the partner for
carriers like AT&amp;amp;T and others and their
ban right now in the United States is
kind of crazy by the US Department of
Commerce up to the point where the
company pretty much can't even make
deals with can troy'd because of the
whole fact that they were discovered
with transactions between us parts and
Iran and this is already starting to
sound like CNN so I'm not gonna dig any
further you can learn more about it in
the link in the description
hopefully the company figures it out and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10
because we already have rumors we're not
necessarily sure that the patent leaks
that we've just found are focusing on
the Galaxy S 10 but according to the
source apparently they are we noticed
differences in the back and that's the
reason why I'm kind of a I don't know
skeptical we see antenna bands and we
don't expect the Galaxy S tend to be
made of aluminium again but hey one of
the most interesting parts about this
design is the fact that the notch is
being included the company obviously
wants to focus on bringing us all
display designs
I just god I wish that the notch wasn't
the exception and you know in today's
question let us know would you be
satisfied if Samsung would do this as
well as the company has stuck to its
roots has focused on being Samsung and
not copying Apple and now we see this
let us know what you think in the
comments down below
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier fluorocarbons disrupt our
channel by hitting this button up here

daily up here in our review of the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus down here you'll
