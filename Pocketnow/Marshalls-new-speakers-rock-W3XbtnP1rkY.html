Bluetooth speakers and sadly most of
these have the worse things in common
like the fact that they don't sound
great or look great for the living room
for example Marshall has been trying to
change that for the last couple of years
as design is one thing this company gets
right back at Eva the company launched
the bevy of smart speakers that weren't
just good-looking but also provided
fantastic sound and smart enough to
connect to Alexa today they're showing
off some new offerings for those of you
looking for a fancy speaker - the smart
part along with a new pair of fancy
headphones I'm high metal even with
pocket now and let's go hands-on
let's begin with their new line of
Bluetooth speakers Marshall continues
with their iconic design provided by the
salt-and-pepper fret the Marshall logo
now in a metered down gold that
resembles copper along with a single bar
at the bottom providing style and
silicone wraps along the knobs to match
the brass and now the cool part is you
can choose from either black or white
color options those of you looking for
power in a small package the act on 2 is
the one you're looking for with 30 watts
of power Bluetooth 5 capabilities a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack for input and
a price to match at $249 the mid-sized
speaker is the Stanmore 2 capable of 50
watts of power the same design elements
Bluetooth 5 a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack for input and priced at 350 dollars
and then for those of you looking to go
all out there is the Woodburn 2 this is
a mammoth speaker at a hundred watts of
power the same Bluetooth 5 capabilities
the same 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
for input but the advantage of RCA input
for those of you looking to go vinyl
this one is priced at $499 and it is
significantly large the company also
showed us their new pair of minor to
bluetooth headphones they follow on
marshall stylus design with adaptive
wires to serve as wings for your ears
for comfort sort of like the pixel buds
we're talking bluetooth 5 with
Qualcomm's aptX
12 plus hours of battery life quick
charge through micro USB with 20 minutes
of charge giving you around 2 hours of
battery life
they're also magnetic in case you want
to stop using them and wear them around
your neck and probably my favorite
stylish feature is this joystick that
serves to control music and audio
these come in black brown and white
color options and are retailing for $129
which I find to be crazy and yes I know
I wish that I had the good news that
Marshall is doing another smart phone
because I really love the previous one
but sadly that doesn't happened
I will tell you this much I really do
like these speakers they're stylish
enough to fit in your living room and I
think that they chose the perfect venue
