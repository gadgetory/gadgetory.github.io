pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to unbox the HTC s 743 this is the
device that has two key pads this is
actually the US version that will work
with 3g on AT&amp;amp;T in the US or if you're
on t-mobile you can use it to its old as
an unlock device and right now you can
get it at expanses hyping usa.com it's
actually selling for under five hundred
dollars which is pretty good for a
smartphone so we're really excited to
unbox this because I think it's going to
be a good union of one-handed usability
and really nice HTC designs so let's get
started and because this is an early
unit you're not going to have this
standard white box you will actually
have a nicer box if you choose to buy
this so let's get inside and see what we
have all right let's take a look at the
device in a second we have a sinking
cable which uses HTC's EXT USB port
which will also work with mini USB
cables if you have them laying around
and then we have some headphones alright
we have the charger brick it's not much
of a brick anymore they're quite small
and finally we have the jack that allows
you to use it in the US alright great so
let's take a look at the device I can
immediately feel how high quality it is
in the hand and I really haven't even
held it yet Wow super slim very narrow
it's a very interesting feel to it and
of course it has the slide-out keyboard
very very smooth action on the slide out
keyboard I really like that wow stunning
looking device very shiny on the front
will be a fingerprint magnet of course
this device does not have a touchscreen
and you're probably wondering why would
you ever want a device without a touch
screen while those of you that use
Windows Mobile know that the touchscreen
version has really really really good
one-handed usability and especially with
the keypad up front I think this is
going to be one of the best devices in
terms of one-handed usability and it's
got the versatility of the slide-out
keyboard if you want to do a full email
or a longer text message or that sort of
thing and it's got the diamond faceting
on the back alright so let's look at
this compared to other devices a lot of
people are considering this kind of the
HTC touch pro without a without a touch
screen and I kind of agree it's got
similar lines and curves the keyboards
are a little bit similar although the
the keyboard on the s7 43 is a lot wider
and it has two fewer rows in terms of
thickness the HTC touch pro is
definitely thicker although the s7 43 is
still pretty thick but because it's so
narrow in the hand it really doesn't
feel that thick let's take a look at it
next to the HTC touch HD obviously the
screen is much much smaller on the s7 43
and it's thicker too and how about a
standard Windows Mobile non touch screen
device like the blackjack two well here
it is compared the s7 43 is taller it's
much much an hour we're obviously and
the keyboard is totally different than
the bubbly letters that you find on the
blackjack two so we've got a lot more
coverage coming up on the htcs 743 I'm
really looking forward to using this
device it's a really well designed sleek
looking piece of hardware so back soon
with lot more follow us on Twitter to
find out when our new videos hit its
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
