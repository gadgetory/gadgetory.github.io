PocketNow weekly this week
LG appoints a new president for their
mobile division Andy Rubin steps down
from his position at essential and does
Samsung have the balls to make a
graphene battery I have to give Jules
props for that that was a pretty good as
a triple entendre we've got a lot to
talk about so make sure you're charged
and ready for episode two eight one of
the PocketNow weekly recorded December
1st at noon pacific this weekly podcast
is where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid I'm Juan Carlos bag now
senior editor at pocketnow.com joined as
always by plucky podcast producer mr.
Jules Wong out on the East Coast how's
it going buddy boy
I mean graphene battery is there a very
complicated issue so that triple
entendre will be explained it will do so
in short time verily we here today yeah
I mean I we've been talking about
battery technology since like the
earliest days of cellphones and so this
could be a potentially exciting
development you know you read stories on
reddit about improvements to batteries
and then it's always like and then maybe
this could come to consumers 20 years in
the future where finally it sounds like
we're already at that stage because
we've been talking about that's that'll
be a nice transition from there you know
like the future tech kinds of stories
that we we talk about you know it's only
then that we start talking about flying
car so I mean it's just this barrier and
then on our way I'm still hardcore
against flying cars until humanity is no
longer navigating or piloting their
vehicles I'm serious I like I look I
look at Back to the Future 2 and I think
what a hellscape one of those things
falls out of the sky it could kill so
many people
III do not want the responsibility of
piloting an aerial vehicle III don't
learn that I'm not at Tron and that has
a lot of navigational elements to that I
just kept crashing into walls and those
at the line so
yeah I was a big fan of the Tron you
know especially playing like old-school
snake I liked I liked my little light
speed racer' battle plan but that's not
what this podcast is about this week uh
we've got a pretty heavy news a week
this this show we've got a lot to talk
about just in terms of the happenings
surrounding the mobile industry will
definitely be fielding your questions
during the broadcast and we'll be saving
your emails for our end of the month
viewer mail bag but definitely keep
sending those in because we've already
got a couple that I've highlighted and
flagged some stuff I want to talk about
when we get to the end of December
especially because that'll be an
end-of-the-year show we'll definitely
want your feedback and your input there
and Jules how might someone get in
contact with us if they want to join the
conversation simple and straightforward
you'd go on to twitter and you put the
hash tag key and weekly into whatever
you want to comment about and we'll be
able to see it and respond to it live
during the show so hash tag being weekly
on Twitter and we'll just talk to you
like that
sounds good alright uh Jules let's jump
right into this news block do you want
to just run down the headlines and then
we can go back and talk about the story
that's just super over ends this week so
for the week of November 25th 2017 this
is all the news that the podcast LG has
a new president for its chronically
money-losing
mobile division Juno Cho is moving
within the company Wow quand Yong Quan a
relative unknown takes over we do know
that he was involved in R&amp;amp;D for one of
the tables first smartphones back in
2009 but that's really about it even
with acclaimed flagship phones and a
breath of midranges the company has
hired a financial challenges for poor
sales performance for the past in the
tidal wave of sexual harassment claims
in the United States essential products
founder Andy Rubin has taken lead from
the company following a report from the
information that found his former
employer Google had internally
investigated him for an inappropriate
work relationship the co-creator of
Android apparently left shortly she had
finished apple and Qualcomm are
entangled in patent lawsuits on not just
modems but
also battery management qualcomm is
looking for a sales injection on iphones
over these patents well it's rumored
that Apple is looking to design and
manufacture its own power controller
chip the chip could displace one small
supplier in favor of its choice chipset
provider TSMC with installations on
iPhones iPads and Apple watch is
starting by 2018 but Apple Black Friday
weekend sales where the iPhone 10 were
really healthy Rosenblatt Securities
estimates that of the 15 million iPhones
sold in those days six million have been
shipped costing 999 dollars or more all
this going towards a total goal of at
least 80 million units shipped this
holiday season Verizon is itching to
launch 5g service next year but I'm for
your phones next internet service aka
home broadband will be coming to at
least three markets in 2018 perhaps up
to five all to see if Wireless will
provide the same quality connection as
wireline the big cellular industry
associations have yet to finalize 5g
specifications subtract is relaunching
its interface in the next few days it
will move stories from friends over to
the left side swipe from the main camera
panel where direct messages can already
be accessed on the right side remains
content from big publishers CEO Evan
Spiegel says this is an attempt to truly
separate the social from the media
algorithms will also be implemented to
sort up and content to the tops of those
pages motorola started publicly testing
android million on the Moto X pure
edition in late March in announced that
the update was official in late
September and it was up until late last
month that the majority of users have
finally seen Bob date moved on to their
device and installed apparently Sprint
users net first dibs over the past
couple of months well last couple of
weeks saw off Rison and the GSM networks
get into the update
Samsung is in in conjunction with Seoul
National University has reached into a
research paper into how he was able to
stabilize the highly
but somewhat fragile material graphene
in two ball forms for use in batteries
compared with lithium-ion technology a
full charge can be done in a fifth of
the time it was 45% more capacity for
the space held for in South Korea and in
the United States and finally one year
on Johnny I was just not loving the
design for that iPhone 7 he made it sold
millions and millions of units just like
many other iPhones before and yet he
called its design disconnected when
comparing it to the iPhone 10 Apple's
chief design officer made that remark
while being interviewed by Smithsonian
magazine for having been given its
American ingenuity award so let's take
things back to the top and talk about
how LG has continued to fail over the
years I understand that you had a little
rants going on on your child to give the
digest of what oh yeah so you know where
things are not like sort of appropriate
for the kind of polished presentation
that we put up on pocket now I've been
doing some just like little vlogs like
I've been doing travel vlogs and things
on my own personal channel youtube.com
slash long back now
but but this last week I really wanted
to see if I could take a look at every
major manufacturer that we reviewed and
see if I could pinpoint what I thought
their biggest mistake of the year was
and so I've already got videos up on
Samsung Motorola LG I'm gonna put up
Google's this evening the day that this
podcast is streaming live and LG it's
it's been a consistent issue with with
LG's mobile division over the last
couple years that they've started
putting on some really interesting
pressure with their V Series phones
I think they've finally figured out what
they want to do with the G Series moving
forward but it doesn't matter if the
company is starting to execute on
producing better products if they're not
advertising those products if they're
not really trying to get on get it get
boots on the ground to interact with
consumers and so hearing this move this
management decision scrapping
the person who's currently in charge of
the mobile division and bringing in some
fresh new blood as you mentioned in the
rundown he's he's a relative unknown in
this ecosystem I'm I have higher hopes
that maybe this this individual will try
to work towards doing something a bit
more subversive or a bit more disruptive
to the way that LG has been doing
business in the past so we've seen a
sort of split and strategy with the
flagship gmv series coming along and the
V has been always that video that
multimedia crazy kind of thing with the
Jessup garden but it's a hit record
undoing all the crowd-sourced
and you have not always been the fan of
those whereas the G Sirius has been more
whimsical has been more of an all-round
sort of image that has not been well
understood I mean the one that I
received yeah what was the one with the
clown's of whoever the heck was Daniel
day-lewis or something know is uh-oh
Jason Statham yeah decent drag riding on
the back of a motorcycle that he is also
driving like so now in the hipster car
wash car wash shark leaping hoofer LG
also now when we look at what they're
trying to accomplish in their messaging
I'm having a really hard time trying to
nail down who is it that they're trying
to appeal to what emotional triggers are
they trying to employ and what does this
say about the tone of their company and
the tone of the products that they
produce and when I pick up an LG V
Series
I don't think light-hearted whimsical
fun millennial phone I think durable
rugged productivity and content creation
you know so you can overlap with some
youtubers and do some fun stuff there
too but where's that commercial that
just showcases or highlights that not
only does LG have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack still in their phone
built into their phone but that it is it
is by far the highest quality piece of
audio equipment that any manufacturer
has turned out for a mobile device
you know that is a talking point that's
worth mentioning and yet we have near
radio silence when it comes to their
their messaging in their marketing and
you combine that with sort of an awkward
launch for both the v20 and the v30
announcing a product and then it taking
weeks before you can get pricing and
availability for different regions
around the world absolutely sucks all
the momentum all of the wind out of the
sails and it's a really difficult way to
try and have a conversation with
potential consumers when this industry
iterates really quickly every major
manufacturer has beginning of year and
end of year announcements to make
hardware deliveries and LLG consistently
feels like they're always playing
catch-up when they're often one of the
first to make an announcement
you know the g6 arriving before the
galaxy s 8 the the V 30 being announced
before before the end of most of the
end-of-the-year competition and we still
really didn't have proper final retail
grade hardware in our hands until we
were already well into reviewing other
devices it's not a good look for a
company that with some serious missteps
and we can always point to the g4 and
v10 era of blooping devices I had
terrible experiences with the g5 but on
the whole this is a company that can
turn out some great products that
doesn't matter if consumers don't know
they exist know it doesn't
so hopefully this I know this I guess
the protege of LG's smart phone legacy
okay hopefully turn that around and
meantime one of the prodigies of our
smartphone ecosystem to this day oh
actually before before moving on sorry
Jules I just pulled our Twitter feed
back up we are getting some chatter
using the p-n weekly hash tag I do just
want to throw this one in from Andrew
Wallace a friend of the show he was a
guest a couple weeks back I'd help us
talk about some mobile news I'm gonna
throw this one to you Jules do you think
Andrew Wallace writes at hashtag p.m.
weekly do you feel that LG needs to make
changes to the hardware side in addition
to the advertising side what do you
think about the quality of product that
LG
putting out as compared to my rant about
how they advertise their product well I
mean we're already seeing a lot of
convergence between the big brands Apple
LG Samsung in their design language for
their products its shame that the
v-series had to go along with that but i
guess i understand by the compact form
as well as just holding them to device
itself is kind of one of the big
triggers at a smart phone at the carrier
but it was of just a harvard design and
making sure that every base is covered
i'm going to see more more models not
necessarily of the you know like o wide
range of specs but just different upper
level tiers we want to see more use of
that snapshot in six thirty or sixty
sixty or whatever that is just so that
because a a little bit more not
modularity but a little different look I
want I want to see more looks and with
comparable performance with something
that can just no I agree some some kind
of I think a well structured diversity
of their lineup would definitely be
appreciated because I think LG carries a
reputation for making to flagships and
then a whole in the United States
obviously this is gonna be a little bit
different in Europe where I think
they're what is it the X power and the
different lineups there that I think
they've got a little bit more saturation
over when you cross the Atlantic but
here in the United States it's like LG
carries that reputation for $200 phones
and 600 plus dollar phones that then
very quickly drop in price so I would
definitely love to see LG make a
targeted and considered mid-range option
I would love to see them take the
venture they're clone of a galaxy active
a rugged phone and put a 630 or a 660 in
that device and really make sure that
that is a proper 4 to $500 option and
then they can focus on not diluting the
g-series make
the g-series a premier flagship not like
sort of beginning of your follow-up from
the end of last year kind of device kind
of like what we got with the g6 this
year that I would definitely love to see
I think in terms of design and style
though I'm not too concerned about where
LG's at right now
I think they've arrived at a design
language that makes sense for them I
think their next biggest challenge is
really gonna be whether or not they can
get after their QA gremlins again
consistency becomes a big issue and
while their phones aren't boot looping
if you're gonna work in OLED against
Samsung you need to have a really high
quality and consistent display being
delivered to consumers mm-hmm so I mean
LG has its problems to sort out and
we'll let them be hopefully we'll see
what happens in 2018 if that kind of
rain can will be affected by then but
really not luck to you another pioneer
as I said of our smartphone ecosystem
but has coming on what weakens consider
well just this upsurge in sexual
harassment attention towards these cases
and towards the victims of them towards
survivors and it's here that we find
that Andy Rubin has been caught up in
all this and has to basically he's been
serving as the distraction for what his
firm has been doing with essential
products and idea of this ecosystem
where everything just works out where
multiple services come together as one
and he's always been the failure end of
this company is we cannot like stress
enough that this guy is the person who
founded was them the most influential
smartphone platform to the state but
like what do you what do you think like
does it help us or hurt us in the first
place to even continue to invoke his
name throughout all this stuff and like
because
I mean the thing is he's never he's
never gonna be completely excised from
the conversation
he's Andy Rubin and he has I mean if we
could dedicate an entire podcast to all
of the things that Andy Rubin has helped
create and helped sort of birth in
addition to Android his his footprint on
the mobile computing landscape is pretty
large I it's a disappointing aspect of
where we're at right now where so many
public figures are being called out for
potential abuse or potential misdeeds
but this is this is something that I
think needs to happen
culturally where an individual's ability
to raise their voice and speak in
opposition to a powerful figure and to
speak in opposition to abuse is a really
new concept and so we're just now as a
society figuring out how we want or how
we should be coping with allegations of
abuse investigating what might have
transpired between someone in a position
of power against an underling and it's
gonna be rough for a while these kinds
of cultural evolutionary moments don't
shouldn't happen quickly but right now
the novelty of having a platform and
having the ability to broadcast a
message and not you know be vetted by a
TV news network or some sort of
political organization or a major
corporation is so fresh that this
conversation is happening publicly
faster than we can cope with how we
should be what what would like proper
justice should look like so it you know
Andy Rubin is getting caught up in that
and you know I'm disappointed but this
is something that needs to happen not
just in terms of sexual misconduct
sexual harassment or you know a forced
abuse rape anything like that but also
just so much of our our business so much
of our politics is built on systemic
abuse you know working employees in in
difficult conditions for low pay in in
the entertainment industry where I come
from I used to work at a talent agency
you
I was technically paid under minimum
wage because they had a loophole that
they could exploit because of all the
overtime I was going to be working while
angry agents would like throw staplers
at walls and stuff like that when a deal
didn't go their way you would think that
someone who was born out of that mail
room mentality when they're finally in a
position of power they would think you
know what you know I I don't need to
continue this cycle of abuse but instead
the agents who actually make it through
that process tend to be even harder on
the people coming up then then their
situation was when they were coming up
so this this this whole culture this
whole conversation and I think most
people in their respective industries
can point to aspects of their career
which you know the hazing process or the
abuse process or the you know like suck
it up and you just got to deal with it
process of getting to a decent
respectable management or mid-level to
your position someplace where you have a
little agency over your own life I think
most people could point to aspects of
their job that they don't appreciate or
they they don't like and which frankly
are not necessary to do good business in
the 21st century I hope that this
conversation can expand into those
realms as well not only do we have a
severe clear and present issue with
misconduct sexual misconduct and sexual
abuse but hopefully that can spread to
all other areas where we could make this
a lot nicer for everybody we could make
this a lot easier for everybody and
unfortunately if that means having to
tear down a few of our idols then I
think that's that's worth the cost to
get to a place where we're not doing
business like this we shouldn't be doing
business like this and we can do better
yeah yeah wholeheartedly agreed there I
personally don't have anything to add
since I've never really been part of a
traditional workplace type of situation
but I mean I I know that I've stood up
for a couple of people I'm not gonna say
who
to tell their story for them you know
they they got harassed in the you know
it's I think everyone has a role to play
in terms of just doing it in taking
their own initiative wherever they
happen to be whether it be a workplace
or there's something else but not going
to straight too far into that we do have
more news to me and I'm sure you know
folks watching if you have thoughts on
this definitely drop us a tweet drop us
a comment it's it's a it's a sticky
situation and it's something that I
think a lot of people are going to be
emotional about but it's one of those
we're only one of those appreciated
conversations that has in it's well past
time to have so definitely yeah let's
talk about Apple and Qualcomm the the
brew continues to go haha I don't know
where that came from but Powermat new
problem Enderman chips is just one of
the chips that Qualcomm has in terms of
wanting to get a sales ban imports
injunction against Apple and it doesn't
seem like crass like Travis is gonna
close up anytime soon it's probably not
in fact it'll probably grow wider you
know so I mean what does this what does
this we're now moving into a period
where Apple is trying to get more and
more of its components under its own
design we see we saw that with graphics
with imagination technologies having to
take a big fall having moved away from
its supplier and now we're seeing a
centralized control in tsfc
because they also they make their Apple
a processors and now they're going to
make a power controller ship that's
going to go on all through all three
major form factors for Apple's mobile
products so that's oh and this is also
with you know we we know apples trying
to make the move of using Intel for
radio management for
her motives I mean this is an escalating
arms race between these two ginormous
players um real quick just as a tangent
to this did I make up reading a story
that the Qualcomm Broadcom acquisition
was gonna fall through or that that was
being pulled off the table or did I did
I imagine that no I well Qualcomm
rejected broad comms bid okay so that
that's those that actually works in
Apple's favor I am oh where you know
Apple can still rely on Broadcom
controllers and their phones and they
don't have to worry about increased
leverage for model wants compound very
badly and they're there's a investor
battle going on to see how much more
yeah how much more of an offer
Broadcom is willing to make Broadcom is
down to bargain hard so yeah 500 billion
dollar market cap I would imagine so
yeah and Qualcomm has just not been
performing at all really it's been very
stale and it's topped out but at what
like maybe just over 80 $80 a share at
some point in the past might need so um
you know for them investors want that
$80 for sure as a premium and it's
interesting interesting to see but it
sounds like if both sides keep on
insisting on this then a one-player
going ahead with all the silicon in
their hands which is but just getting
back to the story and getting back to
Apple this is this is one of those
situations where again Apple has the
clout and Apple has the resources to
actually take a couple hits you know I
it can it can weather negative stories
about Intel radios for two or three
generations of phone with almost no
perceptible you know impact on sales as
they're sorting out how it is that
they're going to go about making this
transition and so if any company can
sort of separate themselves from the
Qualcomm ecosystem in a meaningful
fashion and find alternatives for the
products and services that Qualcomm
I mean it's literally only Apple at this
point that I think could could do that
and so what we're seeing here is I think
the smartest play Apple has while
they're going through these escalating
lawsuits about who's using what IEP and
who's not licensing what products
properly this is probably Apple's
smartest play I don't know that I'm I'm
really invested in one side or the other
I feel like kind of a shake-up in the
market needs to happen regardless of
what these giant players of who these
giant players might be but you know we
know Qualcomm definitely exerts a
significant amount of leverage based on
their current market position and we
know Apple engages in business practices
which aren't always the nicest because
of their market position and if two
companies are gonna do battle I mean
they're well joined these two companies
are about the best that you could point
to for doing this kind of legal battle I
mean they have all the big guns there as
well just throw it around
whoever gets left out in the in the
crossfire is well they're toast I mean I
can't imagine the Bill of the legal
billable hours I mean it's it's what
this is like I should have been a tech
lawyer I just can't imagine the just
insane amount of money that's being
dumped into you know courtroom
appearances and negotiating so I mean
the yeah be gone from that talking about
that iPhone 10 and those six million
sales that are going towards the eighty
million goal it's apparently hope that's
we're going to see somewhere in the
neighborhood of 20 million iPhone 10
sales throughout the quarter so that
Black Friday boost was definitely needed
in terms of that but I was wondering how
we're going to make the rest of it up
with the iPhone the case because we're
still seeing depress demand for iPhone 8
iPhone 8 plus just not the new shiny
thing that
apparently Jony ive wants us to levitate
towards so well what do you think so the
the iPhone 8 launch was necessary in
that it delivered us an iPhone 7s grade
device and it fit a hole a potential
hole in Apple's lineup while they were
getting their manufacturing and their
distribution in place for the iPhone 10
but I can also appreciate again I'm not
the biggest fan of iOS devices I still
I'm still recommending the iPhone se to
people because I love this phone this is
my this is my favorite iPhone I want
this exact same form factor with iPhone
8 specs inside of it just give me
another estimate I never dear perhaps
that might be the case I'm hoping yeah
there have been rumors that we'll
finally see a follow-up to the SE and I
don't want them to change a damn thing
about the form factor sorry um when
we're looking at the iPhone 8 I can
totally understand why a number of
consumers are stuck in a holding pattern
when it comes to Apple if you're I was
on set for Newegg now and the the the
director of photography our DP was using
an iPhone 5 not an iPhone 5s he is still
happy with what he needs to get done
with that phone and he's but he was
saying I was looking at an iPhone 8 I
don't think I really want that I'm just
gonna wait and see if they make a
smaller version of the iPhone 10 I think
a lot of people are kind of stuck in
this holding pattern right now where
they do want something fresh and the
iPhone 8 doesn't feel fresh it's a very
good phone but it doesn't feel new like
the iPhone 10 but they don't want to
spend $1000 on a phone so let's wait and
see a little bit longer let's see if I
can hold on to my iPhone 5s my iPhone 6
is just unfair see if I can keep them
running and that's a difficult place for
Apple to be we set this in years past
apples apples greatest success was
making
Tech an emotional lifestyle purchase but
if you can't if you can't warm up those
emotions if you can't get people lit up
if you can't get them excited it can
work just as hard against you as they've
been successful with the strategy in
years past I mean we're talking about
anywhere from 40 to 50 at best million
for the new models so if we're if we're
assuming that they get to their goal
30 million iPhone 7s it's not just about
warming emotions up its microwaving them
after they've been in the fridge for a
while like isn't that kind of
antithetical to what's Apple wants to do
I you okay um yes and no it's just
antithetical is a strong word but I you
know you're you're not wrong we're
talking about like nuking emotions again
like really trying to get them hot and
passionate which I'm sure shareholders
have an expectation that Apple can do
that but as a tech pundit myself
personally I don't think any company
even Apple in this current climate can
make one move which will get people as
excited as they've been in years past
you know think about the iPhone 4 era
think about that change from the iPhone
3 and the the polished pebble plastic
back to the iPhone 4 and it's metal and
glass aesthetic and just how exciting
that was as a move for one smartphone
manufacturer to make and that was
another you know you were just getting
off of the iPhone 3 era so you had all
those people into your contracts
flipping over to the iPhone 4 it was
just amazing synergy in the market and
that was such a huge move for Apple you
can't do that now and you can't do that
now when you also have five different
models of iPhone that people can
currently buy I think you've confused
your own market I think you've you've
diluted it and now we're waiting to see
if they can get back to the kind of
focus that I think consumers turn to
Apple for they don't turn to Apple for
myriad numbers of iterative
choice they turn to Apple because they
want the best so just tell me what the
best is and I'll buy that and I'll be
happy what the no one to spend a
thousand dollars so they're stuck
properly stuck right now for every
iPhone 7 that II sell that is not an
iPhone 8 that's $100 I found successor
another hundred dollars iPhone se two
hundred seven dollars and that's all in
the gap for them they don't have any new
MacBooks that might they have the men
here updates that may I get Black Friday
or the holiday season discounts so we're
left in a position that it's only the I
Apple watch that is drawing sales at
what services are still showing growth
but Apple doesn't leverage their
services as as as well as Google does
you know Apple music that's making money
and it's and it's finding an increasing
user base i but that's not gonna make up
the difference on what the $400 worth of
margin on an iphone 10 you know like
you're not gonna make that up with a
hundred you know you know hundreds of
people every week flipping over to Apple
music and it's more than hundreds you
know what I mean though the economy of
scale is huge but like a subscription
music service right now is not gonna
make up the difference on the the
amazing margins that Apple builds into
their products if those products aren't
selling that's a dangerous place for
Apple to be and right now if a person
can go in buy an iPhone 7 because they
feel it's kind of like a consolation
prize but they didn't want to spend a
ton of money and then they get the phone
and they like it
that's bad for Apple because emotionally
now that person's gonna weigh the
rational practical benefits of a $600
phone and that they they're having a
perfectly fine experience using that
$600 phone against what they could have
spent to get the iPhone 10 and did they
really need it no the more you start
rationally considering your purchases
the worse of position you are the worst
position Apple is with their current fan
base
yeah let's scroll over to Verizon which
is still trying to get its 5g
terminology up and it's starting with
home internet service as the we don't
see a vision for mobile for at least the
next couple of years so this is the next
best thing I'm not sure where else so
wireless I should have looked this up
but Wireless fixed internets
ATT I know does some sort of rule us
Brent was doing something to I don't
think they are anymore but they were
they were using WiMAX
yeah WiMAX for clear that's right and
and I don't think that's really a viable
solution anymore but yeah this
millimeter wave fire doesn't make a
difference
oh no I'm just saying does it II think
you're supposed to get I mean we're
talking about gigabit gigabit gigabit
that's qual comes kind of big selling it
definitely does but again it's like you
know I've got this you can go out and
buy an amazing you know like $400
business grade gigabit router and then
plug it into a 10 megabit connection you
know it's not like you know that's not
really gonna give you what you so so
having some sort of proto 5g tower in
place is definitely something Verizon
should be looking at doing they got so
far ahead of the competition on LTE by
again investing in in what would become
the LTE standard they called the market
right they their timing was perfect and
they got so far ahead of their
competition that they catapulted
themselves to the number one cell
carrier position so it's vital that for
for Verizon to maintain their sort of
market dominance that they do the same
thing with 5g but if you're talking
about home use this is the big
disappointment that Verizon didn't
continue to try and roll out FiOS so you
can go to these rural markets and say
hey we're gonna hook you up with this
like 5g wireless millimeter wave
spectrum point-to-point connection I've
actually heard really good things about
utilization of similar technologies
there was a
post a couple weeks ago where someone
was basically just buying all of this
equipment to outfit this town of like 30
people with broadband internet and it
sounded like it was going to be a
wonderfully easy solution to patch them
directly into some some node that they
could get online they just had no
internet service before this guy went
out and bought all this equipment
himself to install him do it yourself
yeah no kidding I so Verizon I think
it's the right play but if you don't
have the backhaul if you don't have the
servers if you're not actually lighting
up dark fiber to fulfill the the
bandwidth here then what's the benefit
you've slapped a fast router on a
mediocre connection and you're gonna
charge more because that 5g rollout is
expensive supposedly and consumers are
gonna get it because they don't have any
other options but you didn't really make
anything better you're just charging
more for kind of the same mediocre
service that those customers probably
had access to already so does this if
this proves successful at all does this
give you an excuse to roll back on a
public fiber and just maybe do some more
dilling around the background it's
unfortunately just one of those
situations where people who haven't had
access to respectably fast broadband
internet I don't think fully understand
what the benefits of that bandwidth
would be for those who are trying to
fight for it in their local communities
I think this will become another you
know again we'll probably see this
escalate even more in the 2018 as
numerous states are re-examining the
laws they have on the books for how
competition is supposed to happen and
it's not necessarily even
community-funded broadband initiatives
but just getting around some of the
legislation that makes it really easy
for consolidation or for monopolistic
business practices to take hold over a
community that I think will probably be
become another part of this discussion
once we're through the net neutrality
shenanigans happening in two weeks is if
no choice sir if there's no option then
there's no incentive to improve
connection and businesses will write-off
Verizon will write-off whole communities
whole rural areas because it's just not
profitable enough to go in and give them
Internet access and it's the sort of
hole in being a capitalist like those
people matter and those people also need
to be competitive in the 21st century
even if there are farmers or if they're
you know auto manufacturers or plant
workers or what-have-you
if they don't have access to those
services they are a generation behind
when it comes to education when it comes
to health care when it comes to small
business that that's going to be crucial
to the conversation moving forward I
think Verizon solution here could be one
potential talking point to help elevate
the discussion but I think that'll also
go hand-in-hand with exactly what you
were talking about just state and local
initiatives need to lead the way here
I'm not sure if cost skills would just
go through the roof if not for
partnerships because maybe that could
also be in our part of it because 18t
and Verizon are now
Curly's in towers for new areas as well
so maybe more of that in the future
Sprint t-mobile maybe even that could
happen in some of the companies to work
together but I fear they will work
together at significant savings for
their own rollout but then the branding
and the marketing on five g's is gonna
allow them to charge excessively more
than what they really need to do to not
only recoup would make a profit I mean
that that's the danger that we're in
right now is we're in a very mega
corporation friendly environment where
these kinds of business moves can border
on predatory and they're sort of
sanctioned by the regulatory agencies
that we currently have in place that
that I'm very concerned about I don't
want 5g to roll out to rural areas if
it's going to be twice as much as a
cable connection which could offer
similar or even better connectivity yeah
yeah well connecting all that towards
the Internet
when the services that he is social
media and we turn it over to snapchat
what are you thinking about just the
idea because we you know it's not just
the machinations of oh what is left and
what is right but also just the idea of
just separating of social content versus
publishers content because Facebook has
traveled all around all of snapchats
moves right now I think are too little
too late III think sure well I I and in
general like for the sake of their user
base for the sake of their shareholders
for the sake of the company I think
we're looking at a company that is
currently on life-support thanks to the
momentum of the more passionate users
that are are sticking with this platform
but I don't think I've seen anything
from snap that makes me think that they
can not only turn this ship think one
that they can sustain but they won't
hemorrhage users and hemorrhage data and
hemorrhage coolness but that they can
actually turn the ship around in a
meaningful fashion over the next fiscal
year what do you think this is
establishing a sense of trust where
there has not been before and with all
the fake news discussion that's been
going out and what Facebook and
Instagram they're trying to do to go you
know attack that directly I feel like
this could be more of a counter like
just a complete I don't disagree with
you there but what I what I mean is in
terms of practical application real
change you know so they get out there
and they they they make this big that
make this big news they make a big story
out of oh well you know we're finally
gonna start working on a legit from the
ground up Android app and the reaction
to that story from from the more tech
enthusiasts ik people you know like it's
a forehead slap in an eye roll like it's
taken you long enough and a lot of us
never adopted your platform because the
Android experience was terrible and we
found other solutions solutions for
engaging in very similar styles of
conversation and when they opted
to get bought out
was it the Facebook offered them I
forget how much to buy them out well you
know we're not surprised that basically
every other competing platform now
offers a similar set of services even
YouTube is rolling out a stories style
interaction for social media and content
creators to engage with nothing they can
do in the next year can't be
appropriated copied and rolled out on a
competing platform even faster than what
snap can actually accomplish there I'm
really upset that they haven't doubled
down on a hardware strategy a branded or
lifestyle accessory strategy cuz specs
were a great first idea that if they had
iterated on I think they could be
finding more success in building out the
snap lifestyle brand but what I see is
just missed opportunity after miss
opportunity and now they're in a
position where they're trying to play
catch-up on the very services that they
helped to popularize and that's not a
good look three billion dollars back in
2013 was the offer from Facebook take
the money okay sorry um we have a we
have a couple comments
oh just real quick rolling back to our
last story Jules I just you real quick
on this one like a first phone that
comes to the top of your head this is
from Andrew black knee a black knee on
Twitter hashtag P and weekly which phone
will be the first 5g phone
honestly I I don't have the faintest
because just pick a phone what phone do
you think it's gonna be first phone well
it's it's the chipset it's the chipset
then that makes that happen and until
the carbs you know the first time not
only use the chipset but then also you
know actually pay for all the licensing
to properly activate that cuz I mean I'm
sure Qualcomm will put out a chipset
that is 5g capable but if a company
doesn't pay for the licensing to use
that 5g part of the product and they
won't so who do you think is gonna be
the first to actually take the dive if
we're looking at a typical calendar year
maybe Samsung but
if the release if the Qualcomm if Cal
come kind of sticks its head in the sand
for a little bit because of some issues
I maybe they're not oneplus not LG who
else
HTC maybe if they're still around I i
I'm I'm willing to bet good money
it'll be Samsung eating up a majority of
the early chipsets of 2019 they always
do welcome will will launch on that and
I bet I bet it's a galaxy s 10 which is
probably gonna be the first truly
certified real world consumer accessible
in the United States this could also
move way faster in Asian markets but I
I'm willing to bet it'll be a galaxy s
10 there are already up to four point
five GU whatever that means or if a team
has its way
5g evolution and getting back to snap
from at Renato Laporte for a while young
people used snap for pics and text for
text they got back to whatsapp for pics
they got all the cool snap features on
Instagram I just don't see like in their
current incarnation in their current
iteration what snap can offer that their
competitors can't just immediately copy
and keep their user base tied up I don't
I don't see it either I mean I can
occasionally you know chat but I've been
finding Instagram story as being a more
compelling experience where we just
being able to see the static photos as
well as the the curated stories of their
days and whatnot so great let's move on
to Motorola I think there's a question
here that I want to get to answering but
um yeah so Moto X pure nation finally
getting that Android units guys point
first of all one is student you know is
better as we said last week it's two but
at least they got they got this update
the 2015 people got this upgrade right
[Laughter]
I you know it this is something that's
that's been incredibly critically
frustrating in the world of smartphones
right now are these kinds of stories
like you you go out of your way to
support a company like Motorola they've
been making promises about how they're
going to support their products it's a
phone called the pure edition gonna be
fast man expectation of support but
increasingly it just seems that once you
reach a certain critical mass and once a
company has your money any expectation
of good support from that should be kept
wildly in check I you know sitting next
to galaxy Si and my Galaxy Note 8 and I
just finished a comparison we're gonna
put that up this evening on the May 10
versus the note 8 and like using the May
10 and using Oreo out of the box or
picking up my sony xperia x z1 compact
and using Oreo out of the box and
knowing May I don't even know how many
months it's gonna take before my Galaxy
phones start getting some of these
features and they those Galaxy phones
are so much more expensive like that's
just ridiculous like that should not be
how this industry works where you're
spending eight nine hundred dollars on a
phone and you can count on the company
to be one of the last to properly update
and support their products that's that's
not good I'm mad yeah there's reason to
be mad especially as Google has pushed
its official support window out to three
years instead of two they're not I never
really got a freaking idea of what it
was like was it typical security updates
or three incomes for two or so I'm
trying to look that up right now but in
terms of the future
so how Sahaj Sahni a key and weekly what
do you think about the future of
Motorola flagships what changes should
they
make well for one and number two the
experiment still alive is modularity
still cool yeah
but we know they're still investing it
into it what I what I have a concern
with is how much longer are we gonna run
on the current implementation of moto
mods because when that industry shifts
because you you do have there is an
argument to be made for how much more
expensive accessories are when you turn
them into a moto mod like a battery pack
that slaps onto the back of your phone
is a convenience conversation and you
pay more for that convenience and I
think a number of consumers out there
might appreciate knowing I bought a
phone and these accessories are built
specifically to work the in the best way
possible with my phone and so that's
kind of what you're paying for however
you now also have an ecosystem of
products which might be end-of-life in
one generation of phone because we don't
know how that moto mod compatibility is
going to work over the next two years
and I think we have an expectation that
we'll probably get about three solid
generations of phones that support moto
mods but that means if you buy in on
year three you're you're you only get
the one year you know like so it's it's
just a sticky place to be the other
point is it's so many other companies
are facing issues like this you know
branding marketing naming and I really
think that one of Moto's biggest
mistakes this year which I produced a
video on this for my vlog series was
just miss was was misunderstanding what
consumers were looking for in their
products so like the Moto Z force was
the big fat phone with the bigger
battery but the Moto z2 Force is really
a follow up to the Moto Z and so that
confused
reviewers enough and it confused
consumers enough that it felt like you
were getting a downgrade if you got a
moto z2 force from where we were with
the Moto Z those kinds of missteps are
obnoxious like they should be small
things but that can
actually have an impact on a company
that's still struggling to increase
their mind share on flagship phones I
don't think they have any problems on
their mid-range er and their entry-level
stuff it's this flagship discussion that
they keep just making these small little
stumbles and how they can't talk to
their customers not make enough D about
how much work they put into getting
these relationships going again with
carriers because the OCC force was the
first with even US Cellular and in
addition to the other four carriers
picking up and also all the men Rangers
as you've said working on all the
carriers as well so I mean it's just
it's not fair to the good work that they
do it's little things like those z2
force it said the z2 just does it I
don't know who to really blame here
whether it's little an oversight or that
Motorola not just in a sense of them of
like heart unlike hard decisions made at
this printer of that branch but just as
personality he speaking because you know
there you have these ways of integrating
business into each and every little
division of the company but still it's
like if if the Moto mod experiment ends
or if the Moto modoch spearmint changes
significantly you know next year or the
year after that's gonna be bad so this
is exactly one of those one of those
situations where I think Motorola really
needs to get out ahead of the
conversation on what future
compatibility on what these lifestyle
life cycles are going to look like if
there's an upgrade path because the
phones themselves like I think Motorola
nails what they set out to do I haven't
had any major issues with their products
you know when judged against the claims
that they're making is the manufacturer
I think Motorola's phones have been on
point but I have a little unease about
some of the recommendations when you
know what you pay for in a Motorola
flagship right now is buying into a
modular ecosystem so your phone there's
an idea that your phone is in a way
incomplete and you're going to be adding
things too
to make it the best phone for you or the
best experience for you and I want to
recommend that because I think there is
merit to that argument but I don't want
to recommend that one year and then find
that the very next year all of that goes
right out the window so that's the risk
you take as a consumer I mean you should
not take it but companies do as they
will to ensure that they continue to
survive and pass along you know benefits
to their shareholders just to clarify
pixal team generation is getting OS
updates for three years not two now so
and again there is that thing like I
wanna i want more companies to come out
and explicitly make a commitment to
their customers hundreds of dollars
pretty pretty deeply in the tech specs
well yeah like if I'm gonna spend $900
on the Galaxy Note 8 I think a part of
what I'm paying for
i I should be able to ask Samsung what
is the timeframe on security updates
how many operating system updates will I
get and how long will you properly
support this product for bug fixes and
security patches and I should be able to
hold you to that in some meaningful
fashion we these things are now too
important to everybody's daily lives
they just gotta know oh you know
whatever you know you're just buying new
one you know like that's not really
acceptable that that that can't be
allowed to stand mmm too important to
our daily lives huh I wonder what powers
those things that make up our daily
lives and batteries and it seems like
after all this time about two decades
where they think of lithium-ion
technology we've been dealing with now's
the time finally for graphene we've been
playing with it for as I've said decades
and decades and who we found that it has
a great potential for power but
it's it just has it's too fragile so
carbon it's straight-up carbon and it's
also the same carbon basically as pencil
graphite it's just in a different form
instead of crystals you have a single
layer of atoms and they're arranged in
hexagonal shapes and those are pretty
tough to keep in shape
especially when you have heat what's
like all these volatile situations
so now what Samsung is doing is they're
shaping them it's a little balls of
silicon silica like actual like low
packets that you have your crisps that
you shouldn't eat by the way and we're
getting all the typical mumbo-jumbo of
oh it's going to charge five times
faster and get and we're gonna have all
these things that's going to be in solar
panels and everything else and more
importantly it should be able to operate
it up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit without
deteriorating so great and it's not you
know it's stuff that we've been able to
talk about before what's what now is the
question because now they're dealing
with the patents now they're trying to
actually commercialize the technology or
I don't know when what stage they're
trying to do that because this is still
R&amp;amp;D in terms of making it viable for
commercial use we're not sure where
that's happening but they have it they
have a monopoly on this they're the
largest patent holder of this kind of
thing oh geez and they're just it'll be
weird to see Samsung batteries are like
justjust all these you know like Samsung
painted little cells going around into
everything so I'm wondering how
licensing what work out especially well
and and you know this this I think will
be one of those situations where the
switch that flips on this
I don't think this is gonna be a fast
transition in the market I think whoever
kind of gets there first like if Samsung
solution here is really only a couple
years away in terms of commercialization
we've seen this patent move is because
there's a process that they can apply
more directly and actually start moving
towards a commercial product that's
probably because of an investment that
likely only Samsung could have invested
in you know like it'll be probably a
five year window post Samsung's first
commercial application before another
company can replicate the manufacturing
process at a scale that it makes it
profitable and it will you know mean
Samsung batteries will be a de facto
monopoly for five years something like
that
I mean kind of just thinking in very
general timeframes but that that number
seems to make sense in my brain that if
they can get ahead of this and they can
be first then they will own and occupy a
certain position in the market for a
significant period of time even with
Frane terms for a fair reasonable price
in terms well because it's not even
gonna be you know like you can you can
set a fair price for licensing this
process who will have invested in the
manufacturing capabilities to take that
license and make a competitive consumer
product it's still gonna take time
before another company can approach I
mean look at OLED manufacturing you know
only two companies manufacture a vast
majority of OLED panel I'm sure another
player could license this tech from
Samsung or from LG and start looking at
what they could do to set up their own
manufacturing lines that's a year's long
process before anyone would be able to
manufacture a commercial competitor even
with fair and reasonable licensing on on
that panel Tech and I think the same
thing will happen with batteries it'll
probably end up whittling down the
number of players in the market who
actually fulfil fulfill this tech and
it's already not a huge market to begin
with
but there's also it's one of those
things like I'm just more excited for
the prospect of seeing some of these
improvements in place
my fear is we're gonna get this well you
can hold 45% more capacity so we can
make your battery 45% smaller the same
runtime but you know they use up less
space on the inside of the phone get
ready for the 3.5 milimeter phone yeah I
totally believe that that'll be one of
the first like it won't lead to I don't
know what like but it'll be like a two
millimeter device and then we'll see one
of Microsoft's patents for like like a
expandable membrane that can fit in the
tip ring snake and then and then
Motorola will make it you know moto mod
and then he can slap it on the back of
your one it's gonna be right but I mean
if we can if you can get graphene from
just I know scrubbing a pencil on scotch
tape which has been a research - method
of getting graphene I've joked you've
joked about this before but it's
actually true and it's silica I mean
it's cheap as anything out there
it's sand then I don't know how much the
machines and the computers will cost
beyond that so I mean maybe in a part of
licensing that technology it comes with
a greater understanding of the
manufacturing and yield and maybe that
can be replicated and iterated it on
iterated on more efficiently it's just
so few companies are looking to take on
any kind of risk right now no one's
really looking to be a market disrupter
and this is one of those areas that
isn't very visibly sexy and by contrast
if there's a problem with a battery
there's every opportunity for a ton of
negative press
I don't know I'm I'm super conservative
on that wall I'm super excited about the
potential for graphene batteries so I I
hope I'm wrong there I hope more players
are actually able to make use of
licensing this tech and can do something
exciting with it but I want to get down
get onto this last story here Johnny
I've kind
being a jerk a jerk to not only himself
but Apple consumers and Apple fans this
is this is I this is like my phrase for
the podcast not a good look not a good
look Jack yeah I've holed on give me a
second here because I want to get into
the mood and I have the iphone 7 design
Vinny other Apple did for its keynote
I'm gonna try and see if I can compare
things it's buffering but it's not
really doing anything up there we go so
in crescendo of orchestral greatness
with a little bit of a tingling of
science on the phone we have created a
product that is the most delivery
evolution of our founding design an
aluminium body a form sheet of glass
angular shape and it goes on and on for
two and a half minutes okay here's the
passage that I want you to take away
from the Smithsonian article I've places
his space gray iPhone X on the table
next to my iPhone 7 plus who's white
bezel frames it's a rectangle of glass
display that's outside that's gonna
again because I want to get this right
who's white bezel framed glass display
mine is only a year old but it looks
clunky in comparison I've picked up my
iPhone and gives it a pointed appraisal
of his own earlier handiwork quote it
now seems to me a rather disconnected
component housed in an enclosure you
jerk face I like this makes me bristling
angry again in Apple trying to move the
needle on their products interactions
like this make me feel that so many of
these decisions really have been the
cynical corporate monetization decisions
that Apple is regularly accused of
making
that like not that Apple is trying to
convince general consumers to pick up
their products and trying to really
convert Android users on a fair and
level playing field that a significant
product strategy of theirs is just to
make you feel bad about the product you
currently own to try and convince you to
spend more money on the product that
they're currently releasing and that
next year they're gonna do the same
thing again like off iPhone 10 who could
ever use a phone with that awkward
unibrow cut out on the screen you really
want to get the iPhone 11 where that's
even more seamlessly hidden into the top
bezel frame of the phone obviously who
could who could use such a an improperly
designed product it feels to me it's it
would be a disconnected component housed
in a way that would distract me from my
display that face ID you and a brow bar
that's terrible any like and we're gonna
we're probably gonna see that it's just
so galling to see a discussed that way
from the person who actually designed
the product it's I want to give head
stupid I want to give a little empathy
towards his frame of mind here because
he grew up designing little pieces of
work and like anything like most
designers do the toy cars and spaceships
and one time and and I I get it he that
for him I feel like the act
he's more attached to the act of
designing as opposed to what he designs
which for him is just that's the
catharsis he puts down on when paper and
when you know you're coming during your
own worst critic especially with as time
goes on you get 20/20 hindsight and in
doing it when you're looking forward to
the next project to that iPhone to that
iPhone 10 and you're just you just don't
see how it actually feels and actually
works out just quite yet
um it doesn't it yeah I mean that's the
best thing that you could put out in
2016 and you just have to go with it and
I guess you know we're from the
corporate perspective the iPhone 7 was
that was the phone that broke their
tik-tok strategy so again this is also
like really unfair I commentary from
I've on on the iPhone 7 or he's
basically just broadcasting yeah it was
it was a compromised product like we put
out something that we knew wasn't the
best that we could do is essentially
what he's saying because we went i phone
six iphone 6s where was the new iphone
number phone you gave us an iPhone 6
with slightly redesigned antenna bands
like that's on you but you know if
you're suddenly now remarking we've been
criticizing Apple bezels for a long time
now
Apple for head and Chin's on the this
isn't new to the discussion and then to
act like oh just you know really looking
back on it just oh this seems so
terrible we were all saying there you
could make better use of the real estate
on the front of your phone even before
we went to to buy one aspect ratio
displays it makes it even more laughable
that the following the next quote that
we that you listed in the article and we
have listed in the article on
pocketnow.com who was gonna say jobs
loved the iPad which he called an
intimate device because it was immersive
like a good book a window into whatever
world's you chose to explore quote in so
many ways I've says we're trying to get
the object out of the way except for the
fact that you built the face ID directly
into the screen distracting you from the
immersive qualities of having a larger
display phone in a smaller form factor
to use the app and experience the app
the phone is literally in your way and
again once they figure out a design way
around that they're gonna go back and
say oh in the iPhone 10 that you spend a
thousand dollars on what ridiculous and
terrible engineering you need to buy the
new
it's only $1200 is this is this is it I
don't know that I could be more
frustrated with the current state of
Apple as a corporate entity right now
and this is just making me even more
like twitchy and pissy about between
doesn't magic was a word that Apple was
not afraid to use this year from 10 and
what it wants to do with objects and
objectifying them like to own up to
something you have to open up to not
only the actual design but what entails
ends that those security risks that you
involved in terms of face IDE all the
stuff they like when you tear it apart
it's magic for the masses and kind of
complicated dissolution mints when you
get to not only the people that are
interested in it but also the people the
regular average people that go to
YouTube saying hey we found this latest
way you can trick priests ID so yes
ma'am it's it's it's really frustrating
it's frustrating because I think we also
just as a as a tech community need to
start having questions about things like
corporate responsibility about you know
how companies fulfill their obligations
to different countries in different
states and it's gonna be tough
conversations because we're fans of this
equipment we're fans of this tech we
like gadgets but like this is getting
really ridiculous now and it's all
coming at a time where I think we're all
waiting for what the next big new thing
is gonna be you're not gonna impress me
with a thousand-dollar phone with a
cutout screen and specs that are only
marginally better than the phone that
you can buy for like $300 less I'm I'm
it makes this less fun to talk about and
I want it I want to see these companies
do better but we we should probably wrap
up with we've got a number of tweets
here that I want to kind of cycle
through some quick questions here and
some good
stuff hold on I miss scroll back because
one of the first questions we got was
before we even started the show well I
mean we're not all important and I think
sums up his feelings with joining live
by posting a gif of the person in a
panda costume smashing the keyboard in
front of shot office workers oh yeah
kinda a little bit I'm getting there and
I don't want to be there because I want
to have more fun talking about this
stuff that's why I started talking about
this stuff is because it was super fun
so I'm gonna have fun guys
don't make me and it's not even an
Android versus iOS thing because we know
the market will sort of follow wherever
the money goes and just like I'm pissed
off with some of my favorite games for
things like loot boxes and
microtransactions I'm getting real not
happy with hardware manufacturers - okay
so this this question comes from at
Panzer Z he asks which phone is the best
for the run-and-gun photographer who is
80% auto and wants a fast consistent
camera but also wants the flexibility
for more Pro adjustments when needed so
Jules you've been wracking the pixel
would you would you recommend that for
for a photography solution um sure
machine for me I've always had shaky
hands so I can ruin any smartphone photo
that I might take so I mean I'm not
really the best judge for that but in
terms of getting the best audio
efficient and it just it turns on and it
turns off when you need it so I would
agree yeah I would probably still say
you know again a lot of this comes down
to what you shoot what you like to shoot
how you like to shoot but if you're
saying a majority of your use is this
sort of quick interaction out of the
pocket Auto mode processing then the
pixel is the best game in town and then
you would just want to supplement that
with a third-party app for any
situations where you might want more
granular manual controls and I don't
have a ton of good recommendations on
those you can start with manual
and just see if you like something like
that I use cinema 4k for video on phones
that aren't the LGV 30 the only other
one that I would maybe put out a maybe
two I don't think the V 30 would be a
good fit for what you're describing just
because there is there always seems to
be just that split second extra loading
time when you fire up the camera app
when you compare a a V V 30 against a
pixel but I would maybe also consider a
wall way if you can get your hands on
one to play with one my wife has been
nailing shots like right now she's she's
borrowing my p10 because the pixel
didn't work out for her and she's she
really likes her blackberry but she
wanted a better camera so we were she
was taking shots with the p10 that I
I've never seen her pull off with a
Samsung or even with the pixel it was
just something about the vibe of the p10
camera that clicked with her and she
really likes the quality of the photos
that come out of
wha-wha-wha ways like a designed camera
so that would be my dark horse distant
lower on the list maybe option but I
think the pixel is probably the best
recommendation for the auto mode camera
app yeah yeah and I mean I haven't had
much of a chance to play with other
phones I'm not sure if I would recommend
the what plus 5t or anyone postponed
because they've always made just that
little bit of and it's photo community
but shout out oneplus community so just
by having a black they gives a little
credit to what they want to do what they
aspire to you but in their Delta me
experience I think would I don't have to
ask Jaime for that but I mean like
oneplus is I think you start looking at
some of those players oneplus is a great
example of the cameras fine it's a good
camera when we're talking about getting
into like literally the bestest of the
bestest you know you are also having a
conversation about diminishing returns
you know I I can pull off great shots
with a one plus three
you know like we're good we've gotten to
a point where even a bad camera this
year is still in much better shape than
where we were even two years ago and
kind of following on that we got another
question here this is from Daniel
Mladenov hashtag peon weekly here's an
odd question probably not I've gotten
this question a number of times if you
had to go out and take pictures and
video would you choose an s8 or a u11
and why having held I've held si a
little bit more than I've never had the
human eye would go for the SI just
because of its form factor that's
thinner and it's better to hold I would
presume but I don't know in terms of the
actual interface that we have to deal
with I've always preferred HTC's over
Samsung's but you know what's what's
really silly is like the more I played
with all of these phones if it were a
fight between HTC and Samsung I would
probably say the s7 really I it the SI
is like it's fine it's a fine phone I
don't like how they sort of reorganized
parts of the camera app to focus on
things like stickers or Bixby vision
then you gotta have those stickers you
gotta create your story you have to
really getting to the end and not
pulling my punches anymore I really
think Samsung's camera peaked on the s7
that was a nearly perfect interface to
focus on auto mode photography with the
ability to switch over into really great
manual options and controls and adding
gimmicky crap to the main interface that
you interact with I think was a bad play
but a broadcast live oh yeah I probably
should um but know it between the two I
probably also side with an s8 i I think
it's it's a tough look if you don't love
Samsung's sharpening and application of
additional saturation
for their photos but the overall
mechanic the dual pixel focusing even
though the u11 is a snappy performer to
Samsung's is really well refined at this
point and I just remember having easier
and easier time using the s8 to get the
shots that I wanted than the U 11 not
that the U 11 was bad it's not a poor
performer it's a very good performer but
I am probably a bit more familiar with
and I like the s8 experience a little
bit better but we're talking you know
very minimal differences between the two
and and how much I liked them well I
mean it's it's that old rivalry that
we've always had going on with HTC being
always the second fetta we never really
even consider an LG to be that second
place it's just HTC and Samsung and you
know those fortunes have definitely
turned in the in a hurry and in those
questions I mean like there's a reason
why I'm not trying to push the v30 on
people you know it's my favorite phone
of the year I will happily tell you it's
my personal this is my daily driver
phone this is a phone that was made for
me but I'm also not going out of my way
to try and convince other people that
they should pick one up it I want them
to know that if there are certain things
that might appeal to them about using a
V 30 then there literally is no other
phone that works like the V 30 but I
don't know how many people really care
about those options this is coming from
Kyle Ruggles in reply to Andrew Wallace
he asks p-n weekly why does oneplus
release a phone with last year's OS only
then to promise two years worth of
upgrades Oreo in the next year the next
and then P that you're following and
then he does decline sticking out
emoticon and I think that's exactly why
it's also if you released a phone this
year so if you release a phone with Oreo
out of the box you are obligated to
support Google's project treble if you
release a phone any time in the future
with Android 7 and then you quickly
upgrade to Android Android 8
you are not obligated to support project
trouble and I really think that's the
big decision that these companies are
making is whether or not they want to
get on board Google's future for how
their products should be supported and
updated so I think that's probably the
critical deciding factor for a lot of
manufacturers this this will be a
non-issue
once Android P is out but for right now
if you want that Google is making harder
and harder demands of their
manufacturing partners you have to
support this you have to use this for
power management you can't have this
running in the background and it seems
like Android 7 is kind of the last
Android operating system that you can
slap on a phone right now that's still
technically current in the world of
smartphones but then gives the
manufacturer more leeway to customize or
to run stuff in the background it's the
last bastion of slow updates and then
let's wrap up with this last one because
I'm not super positive on this trend
this is from Ryan Landers P and weekly
when are we going to get those flexible
screens Samsung was showing years ago
the flip smartphone in the future
I just don't think flipping folding out
screens are that big a deal so I don't
know I don't know when they're gonna
show up uh I would I wouldn't be
surprised if CES were the showcase this
time around so now do you think we'll
see an actual consumer facing product or
you think we're just gonna see another
like prototype I have to think it's the
galaxy as we've seen documentation say
that it's we can support it now but it
still doesn't exist technically so so
here's here's my prediction here's my
prediction you think you think we'll see
a folding screen for the next Galaxy S
that's that's your prediction oh no it's
a Galaxy S a device it's just the Gossie
X that's the thing that oh I thought you
were saying you know like next year CES
there was going to be okay so my
prediction is Galaxy S 9 finger
print sensor under the display not on
the back and they'll remove the
headphone jack and then try and convince
you to get gear icon X buds then around
the note time frame will have a separate
note note 9 and some kind of new like
you were saying the galaxy x the galaxy
flip the galaxy fold something like that
lunch is a companion device for that so
you'll have a Galaxy S 9 Galaxy S 9 plus
at the beginning of the year Galaxy Note
and Galaxy X at this at the second half
of the year I'm imagining a four product
launch a four phone launch at the
flagship tier for Samsung next year
that's you know that's my prediction
yeah it sounds like we're gonna have an
early here anyways because the s9 and g7
are supposedly at least getting
previewed in January I still believe
that the s9 will get a March official
launch but it's uh it's gonna be amazing
to see that where the CES is gonna have
like a first preview of what's to come
it's gonna be excited for my percy of us
I yeah you're gonna be you're gonna be
joining the joining us out there I'm
gonna be double teaming that sounds
wrong I don't want to use that phrase
I'm gonna be double dipping CES for both
pocket now and a new egg so oh this will
be my first CES covering like gaming
hardware years so I'm stoked cuz like
there's some really cool chipset stuff
that I want to check out and graphics
card work that I really want to see and
I'm taking notes on all of this cuz I've
got to rebuild my workstation soon and
like oh I want to get this water block
kit no I want to get RGB everything so
I'm pretty stoked about that too but we
should probably wrap this up Jules it
was a good show man I know it was news
heavy and I appreciate all the people
that there that were you know dropping
his comments and joining the
conversation we got some great questions
and we love it when you guys join the
discussion let me get my notes back up
here so folks there you have it another
episode of the PocketNow weekly has come
and gone this show is over but the
conversation continues on twitter where
Jules is at point Jules give them a
follow
and I'm humbly at some gadget guy pocket
now is around the web on Twitter
Instagram Facebook Google+ YouTube and
our home site pocketnow.com for Spanish
speakers definitely check out es
pocketnow.com were basically everywhere
a shows like this cannot exist without
your support sharing the weekly with
your friends who love mobile technology
and by dropping reviews on iTunes
stitcher Google Play and wherever
podcast reviews can be left because
ultimately there wouldn't be a show if
it weren't for our listeners and
subscribers who have kept us on the air
since 2012 the PocketNow weekly we'll be
back next week with all kinds of
delicious technology goodness - make
