pocket now my first rugged phablet my
first asus and now my first Huawei this
Chinese multinational is trying to bring
a little class to the budget-busting
entry-level phone market but before we
can take this baby for a test drive we
have to get it out of the box I'm Juan
Carlos bag now for pocket nap and here
are my first impressions of the Huawei
honor 5x for the brave that's the phone
slogan I don't just go around saying
things like that opening this pretty
teal box I'm pretty sure this review
unit has already seen some action the
phone greets you after taking the lid
off and underneath we've got a USB cable
and AC adapter but even cracking open
the folder there aren't any papers or
warranty info for us to not read we do
have some plastic on the screen though
so at least I get to peel that off this
device gives off a tremendous first
impression this aluminium shell is
really pretty at arm's length
the right side mounted power button and
volume rocker are easily reached pin
tool doors hide the sim and micro sd
card and overall dimensions are almost
identical to one of my favorite budget
Buster's the idol 3 there's a bit of a
chin bezel but overall the 5.5 inch
1080p IPS display occupies over 70% of
the front face so I can't get too cranky
there we've got a lot of nice design
elements the ergonomic placement of the
fingerprint scanner on the back and I'm
digging these retention screws flanking
the micro USB port even if it does make
the phone look a little like a panicked
robot we have two sets of vented holes
on the bottom but as far as I can tell
audio playback is just mono out of the
right sides
it's when we get closer that we can see
some of the compromises necessary to
produce a phone at this price seems
which don't quite lay flush where pieces
join the chrome trim around this camera
looks like it was snapped off the
plastic retainers of a model airplane
kit and I'm worried this phone might
have been dropped as we have a blemish
and small dent on the corner but this
also could just be lacks QA during
manufacturing first boot was
refreshingly quick and happily there
aren't a lot of customer additional
setup steps to get you signed into your
accounts and then we get to the launcher
I won't be the first nor will I be the
last to point out the number of iPhone
inspirations found throughout this
device I honestly don't understand the
appeal of merging home screens and app
drawers I find the whole affair to be
cluttered and can I purchase this device
myself I'd likely have already installed
Google now or Nova Launcher I do like
the Timeline layout for notifications
though I wish shortcuts were just docked
at the top instead of moved to a
separate side page
my initial swiping through the device
home screens and settings the UI slides
quick and fluidly for the most part
though I did get a chuckle out of the
camera as it's another app ahem inspired
by another phone manufacturer at least
they added a dedicated food mode to
shake things up a bit maybe most
exciting though is the addition of a
fingerprint scanner at this price point
this is maybe the least amount of grief
I've ever experienced training a
fingerprint and even though we're on
budget Hardware it's one of the
snappiest performers I've yet
encountered it's terrifically tolerant
to different angles even recognizing the
side of my finger
upside down from how I train the phone
unlike home button and power button
mounted scanners this works in an
always-on fashion and wakes your device
up on contact with the sensor just like
bigger brother foie Way phones Huawei is
bringing an ambitious feature set to a
product which sells for $1.99 unlocked
on Amazon but there's still a lot of
testing which needs to happen before we
can decide if the honor 5x is worthy of
your cash battery life from this 3000
milliamp hour cell multimedia
performance from the Qualcomm 6-1-6 and
how competitive is the camera in this
tier of smartphone budget phones are hot
right now
so make sure you subscribe to this
channel for our future coverage of the
Huawei honor 5x as always thanks so much
for watching and hit that thumbs up
button to help us out with
little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now you
can chat me up on Instagram and Twitter
as some gadget guy and I will catch you
all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
