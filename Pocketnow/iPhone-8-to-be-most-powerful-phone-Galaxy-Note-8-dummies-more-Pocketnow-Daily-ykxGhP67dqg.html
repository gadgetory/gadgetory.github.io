claim that there will be nothing quite
as powerful hmd global has just teeth at
the Nokia 8 is just one of two flash
chips to come and set your calendars as
we finally have a date of when to expect
Android Oh I'm Jaime Rivera and I
thought that this Friday was supposed to
be a bit of relax for Saturday and I get
three packages in my doorstep this is
PocketNow daily stay tuned for videos to
come as well the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for new phones buy one get one free
deals are the way to go and t-mobile has
just launched some really compelling
ones for example if you go for lg
devices and it doesn't really matter if
we go for a g6 and a b---twenty but you
have to get two phones you get a $500
MasterCard back but then if we go for
Galaxy devices s 8's a plus you'll be
getting an $800 card back and if I read
things correctly you actually don't need
a new plan you can actually just add a
line and get these phones so that's
actually great you can learn more in the
description I'll start about Android oh
we have been wondering exactly when
we're getting the new operating system
at least officially obviously the betas
have been out but I think that what
we're getting is the final name on a
live stream on Monday August 21st so set
your calendars we will definitely be
covering everything I hope they come up
with a compelling name that's not a I
don't know a cake or something
but you know the way Google behaves
let's see what we get and for those of
you that we're wondering exactly why the
Nokia eight did n't bring the tall
display or the curves etc or the AMOLED
display apparently it's because this is
not the only phone HND global has pretty
much teased that there is another Nokia
flagship in the work and we're just
going to dub this one the no Kid 9
apparently this phone will be taller and
will bring other features that we're
expecting that the Nokia H should bring
hmd even claimed that Nokia is not a
company that's going to follow the
trends of others that's kind of true and
we're not really complaining about that
let's see what we get and if you buy now
we're not clear over what the side of
the galaxy s a it is even though we've
been covering it constantly every day
for the past couple of weeks we've got
some leaked dummy units that show us
what the phone looks like in the flesh
and yes everything that we've seen
renders pretty much gets confirmed by
these dummies what we do also here is
price tags particularly in China apparel
you're going to pay the equivalent to
940 dollars for the Galaxy Note 8 of not
saying that this is cheap or inexpensive
either it's just the price that we've
also been hearing everywhere else so if
they do and finally the very interesting
rumors today come from Weibo apparently
we get details on the 8:11 chip of the
iPhone 8 according to the source this a
11 chip is going to be so powerful it's
10 nanometer process that it will take
competitors at least a year to catch up
with these speeds now bear in mind we've
already seen cases like this with the
case of the care 916 we've already begun
hearing about the keren 970 and that's
really where it gets really interesting
is this going to be the case what we do
know is that the a 10x fusion ship that
comes on the iPad pros is significantly
more powerful than almost anything else
out there in benchmark so truly this
means that the al-eman should only get
better but you know it leads me to the
question today I mean let's assume that
this iPhone 8 does bring the most
powerful processor in the world would
this change your perspective on iPhones
because what people usually say is that
iPhones are slouches that Android phones
have the better specification set cetera
et cetera in my case I have been using
iPhones for a while and I have been able
to confirm these phones they'll
necessarily need all the whole
horsepower but anyways leave us a
comment down below we would love to know
your opinion and friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get the news
earlier before the video was filmed
follow us I'm talking about our comment
subscribe to our channel as well for
more videos like this one and also
follow me on Twitter hi bounder score
Evette on instagram at high memory data
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am high in
betting that I thanks so much for
watching we'll see you on Monday 9 p.m.
