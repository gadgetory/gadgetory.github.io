in-house processor for the Galaxy s7
iphone 6s users continue to bring
complaints to the table and if you want
a new Lumia in the United States you
better prepare for some bad news I am
Hyneman iveta and isn't it sad your
friends are out because it's a holiday
in your country and you get to work yeah
i know this is pocket a daily even the
websites and even internet speeds have
gotten better over the last couple of
years there are still some out there
that aren't great and google wants to
fix that they've just announced a new
accelerant mobile pages project with the
idea of boosting mobile website and the
mobile Internet in general the idea here
is that developers can use the tools and
ideas in order to better their websites
though we don't know exactly how long it
will take for this project actually tape
shape we will be reporting on this
further disclaimer we haven't really
snow de steny issues with our iphone
success review units but users continue
to complain about the fact that the
phone randomly shuts off Apple has
finally acknowledged this problem
actually does exist in the iphone 6s i
can assume Lee could walk into an apple
store and actually get a swap unit if
something is going on but users are
already working on workarounds to be
able to fix this the problem is that
you'll have to reset your device in case
you actually can't go to an apple store
so licks in the description for that
apparently they're probably is a way to
get that done and guys I will not deny
it I am really stoked about these new
Lumias the 950 and then I 50 Excel not
necessarily just because of all these
specifications but first of all you'll
just apparently be able to run android
apps one and two obviously the whole
continuum thing but for those of you
that are looking to get these Lumias in
the united states t-mobile has just
shared some bad news apparently the
Lumia 950 will not be available outside
AT&amp;amp;T apparently it will be an AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive and we don't know exactly
what'll happen with the excel but this
is really sad news I thought that
Microsoft was going to learn from the
mistakes of previous lunes that became
exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T but hopefully there
are other variants to fix that in the
future and yes another alternative for
you if you want to use Windows
is for you to have an existing Lumia and
upgrade but we've also got some sad news
in that department we thought that
existing Lumias were going to get the
update soon and as it turns out we're
currently on October and the the update
is not coming until December and there
are no specific dates all we get is a
full December calendar to tease the
updates so as long as your device is
currently running Windows Phone 8.1 you
have more than eight gigs of RAM and
well it's a current phone you apparently
are eligible for the update just stay
tuned we could hear bad news going
forward and finally to end today's video
the hottest news of today have to do
with the Galaxy s7 we have been covering
these leaks continuously because we're
actually just a few months away from the
probable announcement we heard that it
probably could happen at CES and we've
heard Samsung testing a new variant of
the Snapdragon 820 processor in addition
to an X and O's variant but the same we
discover that there is a third device
being tested apparently this will be
using that X and O's and one processor
that was teased this is codenamed
Mongoose we're not sure if that's going
to be the final name but reports claim
that there is extreme performance from
this processor even though we're not
sure if this will leave Korea or not it
leads me to the question of the day are
you looking out for the galaxy s7 or are
you settling for the current black ships
that are available today we've got the
LG v10 the node barians from samsung
obviously new iPhones or are you
sticking to whatever product you have
right now and waiting for the s7 early
next year in my case I would prefer to
grab a note the note lineup is great of
the g4 is performing great for me but
leave us a comment down below we would
love to hear what you think and friends
as always if you want to read all these
news earlier they got published at
pocketnow.com hours ago so make sure you
follow us on social media is the
scrubber youtube channel as well get
follow me on twitter hein underscore any
better on instagram at hi never leave it
