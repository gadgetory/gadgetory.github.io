pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the video review of the samsung SGH I
620 also known as the Black Jack slider
now if you watch the unboxing video you
may have noticed that the device came
with two batteries and I was wondering
why well one is the standard battery and
one is the extended battery the standard
battery which is very thin i should add
take a look at this very thin is 850
milliamp hours whereas the extended
battery which is not much thicker is
about fifteen hundred million bowers now
if only samsung would get good at
optimizing battery life they wouldn't
have to include two batteries but until
they do we have an extended battery to
use so let's put the battery in the
device the SIM card goes on the bottom
right corner there snaps in and there we
go now on the front there are six heat
sensitive buttons and their heat
sensitive like the LG chocolate so you
can't press a button with a pen you
actually to actually use a finger and
the sensitivity is pretty good on these
I'll talk about that later also in the
front is this rotary scroll wheel which
takes the place of a side scroll wheel
and also doubles as a d-pad so you can
do up down in the side to side and ok is
in the center turn the device over to
the side here we have the micro SD slot
which is hidden by a little flap and
then we have the volume up and down
button going over to the top we have a
power button and a nice chrome strip
along the top and on the other side is a
profile switcher button and usually if
you have a smartphone you know that the
power button usually opens up the
profile switcher but in this case
there's a button dedicated to that and
then there is the charging port also
syncing port and audio port it doesn't
have a standard headphone jack going
over to the bottom we have the
microphone and flipping over to the back
we have stereo speakers and I can
confirm that the stereo speakers
actually makes music sound more clear
though not loud for example the the
speaker
one on the on the I 620 isn't as loud as
it is on the blackjack even though it
has two speakers not sure why that is
and something that bugs me is that
there's an advertisement sir for
samsung's website on the bottom I
thought it was enough to have their name
here not there to come on samsung now I
mentioned that the keyboard on the I 620
was the same as the Black Jack and it is
it looks exactly the same the slight
difference is that the keys on the
blackjack are raised more if you can see
a profile there compared to the I 620
which are pretty shallow and I find that
the shallow keys are actually more
difficult to type on than the blackjack
finally I should mention that on the
front in the upper right corner is a
front-facing video camera should you
have access to a network that allows for
video calls I do not so I will not be
using that feature so that's part one of
the video review of the samsung SGH I
620</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
