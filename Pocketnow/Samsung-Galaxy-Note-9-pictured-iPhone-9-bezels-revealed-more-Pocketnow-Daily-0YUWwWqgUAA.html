couple of days ago and render started
emerging from very trusted sources we
get leaks of new iPhones and it looks
like the LCD iPhone bezel won't be that
bad and Microsoft is really trying to
revamp their Andromeda project very soon
I'm Jaime Mehta Rivera and just a
reminder thank you so much for your
support with the Spanish pocket now of
the audio there is a link up here if you
want to watch the video as well this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals the LG G 7 Thank You
continues to be one of those really good
phones that I found to be a little
pricey so it's currently 120 dollars off
on B&amp;amp;H meaning 630 bucks what I buy the
g7 thank you at that price I'd
definitely would right now color options
are only silver at B&amp;amp;H more colors
coming soon now let's talk about Oppo
the company is huge in China and other
countries around Asia but everybody asks
like one can we get that find X for
example and well the UK has just seen
more than 20 phone brand names from Oppo
being trademarked so it seems that it's
very imminent that Oppo is going to
launch its own sales in the UK which is
awesome we're just not sure when but
we'll keep you posted and we also don't
know if the find X is gonna make it to
that launch now let's talk about
Andromeda that whole Microsoft courier
sort of foldable tablet design that
never really made it weird that
Microsoft ditched the project now there
are rumors that the company is planning
to launch it probably next year the
reason why they ditch the project in the
past is because the company felt that
the technology just wasn't there and
they didn't want to tarnish the surface
branding with a product that was
mediocre
so yes they tune for next year hopefully
somebody figures out tablets differently
now let's talk about iPhones
particularly the design of the display
we heard rumors that the bezels on the
LCD iPhone we're gonna be terribly large
now we've got leaks of the three panels
iPhone 10 2018 iPhone with the LCD
screen will call the iPhone 9 and the
iPhone 10 plus and to be fully honest
with you it seems like if the bezels of
the OLED iPhones are getting smaller and
then this LCD iPhone is just gonna have
the same bezels of the current iPhone 10
that makes a lot of sense I think that
would be cool I wouldn't
bezels that size already deal with them
at the iPhone 10 and they're you know
they're an existent for me but we'll see
if that ends up happening over time and
finally the hot news today have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 there
were leaked images of the company's
mobile CEO sporting the phone in the
wild it makes sense I mean we're a
couple of weeks from the launch so yes
but now we've got Evan Blass chiming in
with renders of the phone yes it seems
the s-pen is going to have a different
color it's gonna be yellow the design
looks interesting and everything but one
thing and it leads me to today's
question what do you think about the
placement of that fingerprint scanner if
anything not the placement but the size
of it looks kind of awkward to me I hope
it doesn't hinder the user experience
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion and I'm hoping
those camera lenses don't look like
somebody's winking at you
