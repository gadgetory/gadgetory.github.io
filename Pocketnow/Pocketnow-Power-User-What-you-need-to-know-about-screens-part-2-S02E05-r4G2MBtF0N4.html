we talked about what goes into the glass
that makes up the displays on our
smartphones and tablets but what about
the display technology itself I'm Joe
Levi for pocket now that's what we're
going to talk about on today's episode
of pocket now power user look at now
power user is a series of videos that's
aimed at taking the average consumer and
turning them over time into a power user
that's what we're going to do today when
talking about display types first up
capacitive vs. resistive touchscreens
resistive is a little bit older at least
in the smartphone and tablet arena than
is capacitive so we'll talk about it
first essentially when you touch a
screen you've got to register that as a
touch otherwise it's just a normal
screen right a non-touchscreen resistive
was essentially a way where you would
complete a circuit and that circuit
would then translate into x and y
coordinates generally speaking you could
have one touch point on those at a time
though technologies varied in something
to add multi-touch and whatnot on them
was very nice when you had a stylus and
you could make precise touches on the
screen but it wasn't very friendly four
fingers and really if you wanted to use
your finger you needed to use your
fingernail that's where we came around
two capacitive touchscreens capacitive
touchscreens are really really
interesting they're much faster you can
have multi-point you can have all kinds
of cool things and they work very nicely
with fingers as we get past the touch
technology to the screen technology
things get a little bit more interesting
first up is LCD or liquid crystal
display now what we use in the majority
of our devices today if not all of them
are TFT displays or thin film transistor
technology and yeah I had to look that
up because we refer to everything my
acronyms anymore it's LCD LCD is just
like the old liquid crystal watches that
you had way back in the day you know the
kind that we're pretty much monochrome
and had various areas that lit up and
really blocky numbers on them yeah
that's LCD
liquid crystal display as it sounds
they're liquid crystals you running
electrical current through this display
and it either turns on or off or in
today's color screens it turns to a
specific color or another kind of what
happens is you then have a colored
screen but you can't really see much
because it's just a colored screen most
of the time you have to have light
coming through that screen or at least
through the crystals to be able to see
what whatever that is you can think of
lcds it's kind of like a stained-glass
window it looks great it's pretty but
man it really shines when you're getting
a light transmitted through it there are
two ways that you can go about doing
that one is you can have the display
backlit so you have lights at the top
the bottom the sides somewhere that
reflect down through and are directed
back at your eyes and then you see the
light that's filtered through these
crystals if that sounds inefficient it
kind of is but you can still get
relatively good screened the other way
that you can get light through them is
by reflection switching from traditional
TFT to IPS LCD screens we see a bump up
in several things one of which is price
TFT LCD is relatively inexpensive when
compared to some of the others but IPS
or in place switching gives a little bit
better viewing angles a little bit more
expensive still takes up a little bit
more battery than some of the other
technologies that will get to later on
next up we've got LED or light-emitting
diodes unlike lcds which are just
essentially colored swatches l.e.d.s
actually transmit light or emit light is
the the more physically correct way to
say things now if you look at a very
large screen like at a football stadium
that's probably an LED array with very
very big LEDs that are very very bright
the concept is the same when you talk
about smartphones and tablets that have
led displays but the LEDs are much much
smaller
unlike LCDs that require light to be
transmitted through them LEDs emit their
own light so you can get rid of the
backlight requirement and hopefully a
lot of the power requirement as well
let's talk about OLED organic LED an
organic light-emitting diode essentially
this is a really cool technology it's a
carbon based technology rather than a
silicon-based technology like most
diodes and other types of electrical
component tree is made up of essentially
you've got this carbon layer sandwiched
between an anode and a cathode and you
run power through and just the right
configuration and tada you've got
electroluminescent light being projected
out towards somebody's eyeballs ok all
of you physics guys out there are just
going crazy over this I know it but
that's as simple as I can make it for
everyone else all right the kind of OLED
displays that we have in our screens are
called am OLED that's active matrix
organic light emitting diode just in
case you're keeping track of the
acronyms here the very lightweight very
bright has an awful lot of utility and
it's very nice on batteries which is
something that we want when we're
talking about smartphones and tablets
from there we have various different
types of ammo led they're super amoled
and others that are made by specific
manufacturers Samsung's got their own
type of thing what we're doing now is
we're trying to take the touchscreen
technologies and the display
technologies and put them all into one
combine that with what we talked about
before on our last episode the glass
types and put all three of the
components together and now you can have
one unified panel that has not only
protective qualities touch input but it
also has your light as well as your
colors so everything all together in one
glass panel it really comes down to
personal preference if you want a device
that's going to last a very very long
time battery life speaking here you
probably want to lean to something
that's got an AMOLED if you want
something that's got very vivid vibrant
colors you're probably going to want
something that's running on an LCD
if you want something that has dark
blacks you're probably going to want to
lean over to amyloid if you don't really
care about that and you want vibrant
colors over dark blacks go ahead and go
with the LCD last you've got price LCD
based technologies are generally less
expensive than their AMOLED counterparts
ultimately whichever display you like
best is the one that you like best and
that's the way that it should be they
have their pros and their cons and we've
gone through them ad nauseam use what
looks best to you and you'll be just
fine we mentioned earlier pocket now
power user is a series of videos that
are aimed to make the average user a
little bit more intelligent and a little
bit more knowledgeable about the
technologies that go into our
smartphones and our tablets hopefully
making you a power user if you like the
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
and if you want to see some of the other
videos in the series make sure you
subscribe to our channel so you don't
miss out on not only these but all of
the other series that we have at pocket
now thank you very much for watching I'm
Joe Levi I'll get you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
