as iphone 4 productions are ordered to
slow down rumors have the next
generation gsm and cdma iphones being
released the same day in august together
and third-party app developers are now
getting sued over Apple services all to
send more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm high metal yvette and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show we go through all this week school
and the not so cool inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices let's start this
week off with the cool now the iphone 4s
or five rumor mill keeps coming up
strong this time the times is reporting
that the iphone 4 production has been
slowed down because the iphone 4s will
begin production as soon as August to be
released in September for the ipod
itunes event that we get every year not
really good news for WWDC but can't do
really much about it but aside from that
will the specs remain the same a 5 dual
core processor edge-to-edge glass
display cases are out there confirming
it and also confirming that we will get
the flash and the camera move from one
side to the next I really sure why but
as long as we get changes we can't
really complain but the only bad news
there is that we're hearing that there
will be no LTE for this device hspa+ has
been rumored to be released and aside
from that we are expecting a wolf phone
for the verizon iphone being produced
through the qualcomm chips that will
probably also make the gsm device sadly
well carriers are considering hspa+ to
be considered 4g so can't really do much
about that either LT will probably be
rolled out until next year so we'll see
what happens in the end it's done WWDC
is just a couple of weeks around the
corner and Apple has already signed
deals with EMI Universal Music Sony
Music &amp;amp; Warner to bring iTunes streaming
services to the cloud supposedly this is
the same service that we've been waiting
for mobileme to evolve through where
music will be stored in the cloud now
pants have already been showing up where
we see that Apple plans to bring just
the portion of every song you download
to your device and then the rest of the
music will be held in the cloud as a
song begins playing the
the song will be buffered to your device
over the cloud now not really sure how
Apple plans to do that when you know
1810 the rest of the carriers have
pretty much eliminated unlimited data
plans but anything can happen now I
wonder what Apple has against having
thick devices because they're always
working on making devices thinner this
time there are rumors that Apple is
working with carriers on bringing
smaller sim cards than the current micro
sim that's already hard for many of us
to hold now rumors are that well the gal
maddow show that was happening where
Apple was going to bring an invented SIM
card to devices then work so the next
work is to see how to make the sim card
smaller if we could get any smaller I'll
really sure what to make of it but as
long as it still works who cares and
while on the significant updates to iOS
applications be sure to update infinity
blade which now brings a multiplayer
arena action aside from the fact that
you also get a really nice price
discount if you haven't already bought
it so really nice time to get all those
swords clanging aside from that well the
comcast xfinity TV service now bring
streaming service than your iPhone
device so be sure to get that too
because that was only offered to ipad
owners in the past one of those really
quick catches the quickly got pulled
from the web was Apple posting a job
offering looking for a field test
engineer for mobile devices in the
Kansas City Missouri area we all know
that's where currently Sprint has their
headquarters so well the job offering
quickly got pulled and now it's in
cupertino but it's clear that Apple is
working for the iphone 4s or five to
work on t-mobile and Sprint even though
the t-mobile girl didn't really like the
iPhone in the first place but it's
really cool news for those Sprint and
t-mobile customers out there that have
been waiting to get the device
well that this is for the coolest
continuing on with the not so cool and
trust me bear with me here we tried we
dug we looked everywhere looking for not
so cool news this week in sadly we could
only find one Laxus is a company that's
currently suing third-party app
developers for having in app purchases
in their applications on the apple's ios
app store now the question is why are
they being sued over an idea that was
apples apple was the one that came up
with the idea that you can have in-app
purchases so why does it lots of sue
apple instead of third-party developers
for using this but lots of says that
Apple is not being sued because they
well are not making money and developers
are to which we defer because Apple gets
a thirty percent cut and while we just
think that lots of things they could
probably make money from small companies
because Apple is pretty much a new
winner there but anyways lotses first of
all even if that was your idea let's
just talk about the same Facebook
Winklevoss thing I mean if Facebook was
their idea why didn't they bring it up
and well if Apple brought the in app
purchases but it was your idea why don't
you bring it up and why didn't you bring
up an iphone and an ipad and ipod touch
and just about everything else anyways
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high Meadow
be better remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
