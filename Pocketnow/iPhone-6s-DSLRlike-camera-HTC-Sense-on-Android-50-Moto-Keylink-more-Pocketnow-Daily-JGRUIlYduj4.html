iPhone will sport a giant leap in camera
quality HDC sends six running on top of
Android 5.0 lollipop gets leaked and
since I just had second thoughts about
making less phones it seems I'm hiding
that'll be better and the cool thing
about Wednesday's is that you're already
thinking about what you're gonna do in
the weekend
I already thought about it this is
 out daily let's begin today with
some official news motorola has just
launched a new gadget called key link
they keep branching out into accessories
that are actually useful we've seen the
nokia treasure tag we've seen the HTC
alternative as well key link is sort of
the same thing you connect your
smartphone to it it gives you a certain
amount of range and that way you can
find your products wherever they are or
keep track of them luggage for example
the cool thing about the Motorola
product is it'll only cost you twenty
five bucks and you get a hundred feet of
range which is significantly better than
any of its competitors into this for
details now let's move the spotlight
over to HCC and t-mobile those of you
wanting to get the HTC One m8 for
Windows now I have another carrier
t-mobile is now offering the phone as of
today for almost $600 without contract
which is okay and then twenty four
dollars a month if you want a two year
contract
the HTC want to mate for Windows is one
of our favorite phones this year it's
definitely one of the best Windows Phone
alternatives in the market leave us a
comment down below and let us know if
you're getting one and speaking of HTC
this is one of the OEMs that has
committed to bringing us lollipop
updates in the next 90 days or 70
something days already as that
announcement was a couple of weeks ago
and if you have any curiosity as to how
they plan to integrate HTC Sense with
lollipop links in the description we
have some screenshots of how everything
looks so far this could be an alpha or
beta obviously there is a lot to work
here but we do see the new multitasking
icons and the whole card view and new
fonts and everything it could be really
cool but let's see what we get 80 or 70
days from now now Samsung is definitely
an unpredictable company just yesterday
we were reporting that company
executives had confirmed that the
company was going to double down and
make less smart phones in a way to focus
on things that are more important
you know wash off the galaxy brand but
as it turns out we've got some
interesting sources that are claiming
that Santa is now going to be working on
smartphones with bolding displays among
other things I don't really know what to
expect here or what Samsung plans to do
but it seems that the Galaxy Note edge
was more than just a prototype let's see
what Samsung comes up with and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
it seems that Apple is already working
on the iPhone 7 or iPhone success
whatever they're gonna call this phone
and what enhancements should we expect
we know that Apple usually keeps the
same design and we always wonder why the
protruding camera on the iPhone 6 if it
doesn't really need to be protruding we
have optical image stabilization on the
iPhone 6 plus but then on the 6 we don't
reports claim that apparently Apple is
planning to make some huge enhancements
on the camera which could mean that
that's the reason why we have the design
now just to avoid the changes in the
future but apparently Apple is going to
give us the SLR quality photos with the
iPhone 7 or success and apparently the
way it's gonna do it is through a dual
lenses setup and we don't know if those
two lenses are going to be on the same
module or we will have separate lenses
like we have on the HTC One m8 it's
really hard to predict but John Gruber
is a very interesting source he's almost
always right so that leads you to the
question of the day how important are
photos from your smartphone camera from
1 to 10 10 being yes it's extremely
important for my smartphones to have a
good camera or one being I don't really
care as long as it makes phone calls
because in my case honestly the smart
phone camera it takes a 10 for me it is
extremely important mainly the reason
why I stick to iPhones most of the time
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think friends you know the drill
