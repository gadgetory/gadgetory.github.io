but also in an event date Apple admits
that even its OLED display is not
perfect on the iPhone 10 and Samsung has
already begun to prepare for the galaxy
note 9 in a big way I'm high metal Iveta
and I don't know about you guys but my
favorite game is definitely Super Mario
Odyssey there's no in the comments which
one is your favorite this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals though the list is so long I am
just going to ask you to follow the
first link in the description it'll take
you two targets Black Friday deals we're
including iPhone 8 Samsung Galaxy Note 8
in addition to a couple of great prices
for iPads and this is again just part of
it there are a ton of other deals and
targets going to be offering and the
dates are also rather compelling again
more information in the description now
let's talk about the LG v 30 and some
interesting official news now for those
of you that didn't know a lot of
companies provide wireless charging but
pretty much only Samsung provides fast
wireless charging LG was offering 15
watts of an improvement in the case of
the V 30 but it turns out that official
information today's states that we only
get eight watts and the current standard
is five so yeah you get faster charging
on the V thirty wirelessly and that's
great at least better than other devices
like you know the iPhone 10 but yeah you
can learn more about all this in the
description as well now let's talk about
the samsung galaxy note 9 we are very
far from this product to believe here
that Samsung is already working on it
code name for this device is crown and
the features are still vague we hear
that most of the design changes that we
should expect for next year galaxies are
not going to come to the s9 apparently
they'll come to the note 9 we hear a new
user interface for the fingerprint
scanner that'll probably make it to
display in addition to other things so
yeah crown as the codename we wonder why
now start out the iPhone 10 if you
remember in the announcement Phil
Schiller pretty much said that the OLED
display the super retina OLED display on
the iPhone 10 was the only display
worthy enough to fit on an iPhone
because it had better color accuracy etc
etc as it turns out the company has just
updated us on crucial information two
things number one that we should expect
screen burnin on this device because
that's just something that happens to
OLED and for those of you complaining
about the color shifting on the Google
pixel to excel Apple pretty much said
that we could expect that to happen with
the iPhone 10 as well so yeah not so
perfect and it seems that for now oh let
this place have just become the bad
screens of the picture when it's not
really the case but anyways and finally
the very hot they have to do with the 1
+ 5 t because one last week we heard
that the devices name was going to be
the 5 t that's great but the second part
is that we finally have an official date
November 16th and I was about to say
October I'm still stuck there but yeah
November 16th is going to be the event
in New York City and you can bet that we
will be covering it live this is great
news I can't wait to see what we get
though we're expecting it to look a lot
like the Opel our 11s which makes sense
given the case of the r11 and the
oneplus 5 but it leads me to the
question today number one are you
looking out for the 1 + 5 t and number 2
what are you expecting to get from this
phone in my case I do expect something
that we were missing with the 1 + 5 how
about some water resistance like
seriously leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
again if you want to get the news
earlier follow us on parking out or
comment subscribe to our channel up here
for more videos like this one you can
also catch our parking out daily from
Friday up here and our thoughts on the
pixel to excel down here it also follow
me on Twitter hi managers quarterly that
on Instagram at high metal beta please
give this video thumbs up if you like
what you saw I am high metairie but I
think so much for watching we'll see you
