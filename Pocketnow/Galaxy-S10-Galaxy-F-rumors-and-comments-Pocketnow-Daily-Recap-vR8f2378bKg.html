drinking expired milk you're the type of
guy that likes to come up with the
weirdest comments every time Hema says
my god humankind moves closer to
salvation Q and the most probable
religious meme that vehicle already has
whipped up
thumbnail when you say too many R's in
your name and break yourself thumbnail
when you probably should learn a little
Spanish that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi Metairie get out of
this is PocketNow and even though I'm
pretty much tired and wanting to go to
sleep before I get on a flight this
these comments just woke me up this is
PocketNow
that's right it's that time of the week
I am home it'll be better this is
PocketNow and this is the baaga now
daily recap your comments for last week
even though I'm about to get on a plane
I was falling asleep this just woke me
up so at Monday the topic was the
completely bezel-less Samsung Galaxy S
10 as the rumors point there are some
pens there is some technology that would
enable this and I asked you what would
you think about something like that
he had 610 comments if Samsung can pull
off that design every phone with a notch
would want to bury their heads in the
sand 385 likes confirms that the thing
is the technology's not there so you
know it's not like if it took Samsung a
little more time to figure that one out
I think the Samsung under display
technology is a great direction and will
be a definite draw for their devices I
do believe so - I think Samsung design
is getting boring they need some changes
of course bezel s smartphone is what I
want a beautiful Super AMOLED display
with no bezels just wow take my money
just Wow huh definitely uh sure why not
it would be awesome so long as they
could pull it off and the
implementations good then on Tuesday the
Samsung Galaxy extra Galaxy F was teased
for the Samsung developer conference I
asked you if you're just I don't know
excited for this foldable product
whatever it is we have 309 comments
Jaime I apologize for the face that
looks the same every day lol I know
right I wish I could get better you see
this face damn Samson give us a software
update first rather than a foldable
smartphone true that definitely that's I
feel a priority that the company should
figure out first
Samsung started the trend of phablet
size phones with enough series so they
can pull off this as well they can
but you have to remember that the note
wasn't necessarily great in its first
iteration so I don't have very many high
hopes for this one but on Wednesday the
topic were the differences between the
three Samsung Galaxy S 10 models I asked
you what did you think about the
strategy and we had 352 comments the
Samsung a line feels like how the note
line used to be the guinea pig before it
goes elite with the S line yes
definitely but I loved the companies at
least giving it a try and I also loved
that the mid-range is getting some love
yeah I agree with him like I may not
want the bigger phone size but it would
suck to settle for a lower quality
camera yes definitely I again I just I
would love for three phones to have the
same capabilities and you just pick the
size you want
totally agree specs should be the same
otherwise why call it a premium estline
definitely it just blurs the line
between the a and the S line it just it
makes no sense
totally then on Thursday the topic was
the Xiaomi me mix three our own Joshua
Vergara wasn't China covering the event
we had an awesome hands-on I asked you
what did you think we had 430 comments
Chinese phone makers are killing it
right now in the design department
killing it making it and doing so much
more
totally only 10 gigs of RAM I'll pass on
that I wanted 32 right whatever
we mix three will kick a if the cams are
good so the camera on the mimics to us
was good on the side of almost close to
great wasn't fantastic there are better
phones out there but you know for the
price tag if you remember how much the
me makes three cost it's a $500 phone it
was good for the price and then finally
Friday the topic was the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 the reports that there will be no
headphone jack on at least one of the
models or all of them and asks you what
did you think we had 629 comments and
you know those were controversial same
thing we knew you were going to take the
headphone jack out eventually
please don't take out the SD card option
though true I do feel that like in my
case I haven't used the expandable
storage in a while
I would rather a headphone jack and a
good amount of storage built in but I
totally get your point
that'll do two things make headlines and
make Samsung look foolish after throwing
so much shade on Apple what's next
notch introduction rumors are that we
are getting that - you know what just
give me the dongle and some wireless
headphones in the box and I don't really
care anymore
exactly it's come to the point where
Bluetooth headphones aren't really that
crazy expensive there are some premium
brands that have crazy price tags above
100 bucks but then we've got one plus
charging 70 I mean why not just charging
me 50 extra bucks and giving me a pair
of wireless headphones totally agree on
that one that's it for the bargain out
