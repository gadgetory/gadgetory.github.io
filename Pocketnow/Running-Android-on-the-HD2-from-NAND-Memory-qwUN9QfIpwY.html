pocket now calm for a while now you've
been able to run android on your HTC hd2
by running the heresy lenox bootloader
off of your microSD card now there's
actually a way to run android on your
hd2 throon and storage almost making it
feel like your hd2 is natively running
android and now there are many roms
available for this method of putting
android on your phone even once with
Gingerbread this video we're going to
show you gingerbread sort of natively
running on HTC hd2 through the nand
memory tool ok so i'm going to turn it
on right now we're going to see what
will happen here it's going to show you
a splash screen for the windows mobile
rom i was using an energy rom and now
it's going to boot into android from net
so it takes just a few minutes and i'm
going to cut back in in a minute when
it's all ready to go and here we are i
should mention that if you do this and
you don't like the android you can go
back to windows mobile so here we are
i'm going to unlock the screen and what
we have is a kind of custom version of
gingerbread 2.3 you'll recognize a lot
of it the performance is good the Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth ends radios work it's just
it's gingerbread on the hd2 running
natively so here we've got a Wi-Fi
connection it looks good let's dive to
pocket now calm we've got the
gingerbread style keyboard here looking
great we'll run some benchmarks on this
in a second to give you an idea what
kind of speed you can expect to see
because you can presumably or definitely
use this as your your full time
operating system and actually run
gingerbread on your hd2 you were able to
do this with the other method but with
the nand storage method things seem a
little bit faster so we are loading
pocket now we can go into landscape mode
accelerometer support is there and here
we go really good performance in the
browser as it loads pocket now ok we're
going to jump back home now and it has
support for landscape got a reflection
they're in the home screen as you can
see okay and so let's jump swipe around
a little bit kind of standard android
home screen stuff here and let's go into
quadrant and run some benchmarks now in
order to do this on your hd2 some things
have to be in place for example your
radio needs to be updated and your hspl
needs to be updated to one of the newer
versions I won't fit all the steps in
the post on pocketnow.com so you can
know how to how to get this going
because it's not as easy as dropping
some files on your SD card and going to
a file browser and running hair exe but
close let's see what the score comes out
to for the den and Android on here on
the on the hd2 and we're almost finished
here it's doing some of those 3d tests
should get a result pretty soon send the
benchmark results up and let's see what
we get Wow pretty darn good it's coming
right a little bit of better better
above the the galaxy s they're not as
good as the motorola droid x definitely
9 not as good as the nexus one running
froyo but pretty darn good for something
that's not intended to run on your hd2
so of course we can go back to the home
screen go into the settings everything
is is pretty much normal here and go to
about phone and we can go take a look
this is android 2.3 point one so kind of
the the latest version there they pull
down notification has the black this is
obviously full-blown gingerbread and it
works pretty darn fast there's no
question that you could use this as your
daily operating system even the little
shutdown animation works boom there you
go so again we'll put links on pocket
now calm on how to get this running on
your hd2 really cool that this is even
possible if you think about it very
interesting stuff and there are tons of
roms that are coming out with all
different flavors on XDA developers that
you can use if you do the nand method of
loading android onto your phone please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
it and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
