with super big screens well this
probably isn't gonna be the review for
you not really you can go and watch
something else on our channel the rest
of you still with me alright let's talk
about something just a little bit
different you understand that a phone
can be built with a specific audience in
mind that we can arrive at different
interpretations of productivity and that
maybe just maybe there could still be a
small market for some kind of novelty or
fun in our smartphone design to get part
of the conclusion out of the way right
now
it's those reasons that I just went
through that make the xz1 compact one of
the most fun phones I've reviewed this
year if you go back through our video
reviews of Sony last year I really did
not enjoy what they were doing with the
X the X performance high price tag
numerous compromises and some severe
issues with performance this year gets
sony back on track
they haven't addressed all of their
gremlins but this phone is imminently
more usable than what they were
producing last year no one's gonna be
shocked by this design it's the angular
monolith look that Sony phones have had
for the last several years and I know
for a fact that there will be people who
will drop the buh-buh-buh-buh-buh bezel
comment long before they've even watched
this part of the review I've never been
the guy to be particularly bothered by
bezels I'm not the one out there
complaining about wasted space though I
think we can all agree that the forehead
and chin on this phone are pretty
sizable and Sony is gonna catch a little
flak for the screen resolution being
more in iphone territory but none of
those points take away from the fact
that this is an attractive and
well-built device with a singular focus
on it being a small Mighty Mouse
powerhouse of a phone even with a bit of
a picture frame feel on that front face
it doesn't take away from the fact that
this phone is one of the best one thumb
experiences you can have in the Android
ecosystem exactly why I'm a fan of
phones like the iPhone se absolutely not
the most aggressive multimedia
presentation but it addresses a legacy
idea of a phone being a mobile
communicator and it's an idea that gets
me back to phones that I absolutely
adored like the HTC One m7 Sony gets a
lot right this year instead of using a
mid-range or chipset in this phone we're
back up to the top of the line gierek
Wacom 835 is powering a diminutive
screen four gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of built-in storage although
this year at 32gb
bytes of storage you're definitely gonna
want to get a memory card out of the box
I was really happy to see it's running
Android Oreo with only a few little Sony
isms altering the overall UI and
navigation it's such a little thing but
Sony has a toggle switch which changes
how you drop shortcuts on the home
screens and I don't know why that
bothered me as much as it did but that's
one of those few things like you used to
just count on in Android you long press
it drops it on your home screen and for
whatever reason now you need to go into
a launcher setting to re-enable that
kind of behavior that's just a bad move
outside of that software gripe the rest
of the phone is pretty bulletproof it's
lean it's mean it's snappy it's quick
this is the kind of navigation that
we've been praising Sony for for the
last several years don't need to engage
in any screen resolution manipulation or
other tricks because it's only a 720p
display that means when we're firing up
games this thing chews through graphics
intents fair and the multimedia games on
point the stereo speakers are always
going to be a nice addition and the
headphone jack is respectably high
quality though sony like Apple a company
renowned for bringing high quality audio
to consumers doesn't seem particularly
interested in joining the fight at that
top-tier that LG V Series phone kind of
headphone performance the camera tech
though another one of those examples of
some great pros and some really
obnoxious cons the sensor and the optics
are very good but Sony's app can still
feel like it's fighting you sometimes
the way that the normal autofocus on
this phone works always seems to produce
just that little bit of a lag or a delay
after you lock your target the phone
will then cycle after you hit the
shutter button it's just not a familiar
feel for how most of our phones work
intelligent auto is delivering some
great shots it's not quite as seamless
as just the normal mode that you'll
engage with on a pixel but it's similar
idea for image processing and I'm really
happy to see that the manual mode is far
more complete right from the main phone
app interface you don't have to go
digging through additional menu settings
to find things like your shutter speed
or your is up like we saw from the x/z
premium in good light that super
slow-motion burst is crazy fun to play
with I'm still a little anxious to see
those thermal throttling warnings on
your camera app but honestly you're
probably not gonna want to shoot tons
and tons and tons
a video from a phone like this anyway
the bummer for video while I'm happy
that Sony has included 4k video directly
into the camera app you don't have to go
searching for some additional plug-in or
camera lens there doesn't seem to be any
user controllable autofocus when you're
shooting at that resolution and for some
reason the image processing on 4k video
just seems to be significantly darker
especially in low-light conditions than
what we can attain with 1080p output
there are some significant improvements
to this camera app but there's still
this overwhelming sense of arrogance
that somehow Sony knows better than you
what's going to make for an amazing
photo or for a really sweet video and it
takes some of that control out of your
hands unless you kind of fight the phone
a bit to get in there and assert your
creative vision but I'm always gonna be
stoked to have a dedicated camera
shutter button squeezy grippy things
bixby buttons not just give me a
two-stage camera shutter and I'm gonna
be really happy I don't spend a lot of
time on selfie shooters but the
front-facing camera on this phone has a
wide mode which rivals phones like the
LG V Series a little bit more of a
fisheye look a little bit more barrel
distortion but if you really want to get
everyone in the group in one shot this
is one of the best options you have at
your disposal and that brings us to
battery where some people might complain
that this is kind of a chunky little
phone though I I liked having something
that I can really hold on to the battery
included the battery inside is roughly
the same size as what we're going to be
getting on the smaller pixel too this is
easily an all-day performer thanks to
the more efficient chipset and the
smaller lower resolution display on a
pretty busy weekend at around 9:30 at
night I ended my day with three hours of
screen on time with 40% of the battery
still remaining I'd taken a couple calls
I shot a couple dozen photos I shot a
couple video clips edited them
reproduced and re-rendered 4k snippets
of those videos and this phone handled
it all like a champ that is one of the
things that I like about smaller phones
there's a slightly different psychology
of play I don't find myself drawn into
long deep dives down social media it's
really more the quick interaction
pulling it out of your pocket finishing
up a couple little notifications swiping
away a couple messages and then getting
back on with your day though it wouldn't
be a Sony video if we didn't deliver one
major gripe and that's this continued
issue we have with North American phones
and this
your print sensor I popped in a review
sim I have full support for t-mobile's
network Wi-Fi calling but I can't unlock
the phone with my thumbprint and this
notion that it's NBD because I can go
online and I can go through developer
forums and I can try and find all these
different pieces of software plugins and
flash a different firmware doesn't
really work for me I spent about two
hours trying to do just that and ended
up pretty much exactly back where I
started
so the xperia team is either unable or
unwilling to address this problem for
the United States and neither is really
a good look for a company as
well-respected as Sony so let's wrap
this up where's that leave us with the
sony xperia x z1 compact first of all
that name is terrible sony xperia x z1
compact if you're watching this review
I'm shocked that you even found it but
all too often in Los Angeles jumping in
and out of my car
wrangling an angry two-year-old with one
arm while I'm trying to reply to my wife
and look at a shopping list at a
supermarket with the other hand the
smaller phone factor phone really rises
to that occasion that on-the-go feel
that on-the-go use again why I've been
such a big fan of phones like the iPhone
se we know these are not going to be the
top sellers in the current smartphone
market but that doesn't mean we
shouldn't have them as an option folks
who actually like smaller phones are
usually pawned off on cheaper fare this
is really exciting that we have one last
nice premium example two point two that
means the Sony Xperia XE one compact can
deliver something that literally no
other Android manufacturer can as always
