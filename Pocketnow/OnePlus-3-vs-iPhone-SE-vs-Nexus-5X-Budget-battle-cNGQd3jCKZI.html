to spend we've covered mid Ranger's in
the past but we're seeing more flagship
grade specs slide into phones at cheaper
prices oneplus built their reputation on
making inexpensive phones Apple now has
a new phone purpose-built for the
mid-range and for good measure we're
looking at a phone which used to cost
$400 last year okay it still lists for
$400 but it doesn't take much savvy
shopping to find a cheaper online
looking at design the Nexus is the odd
duck here this plastic shell is fairly
dull and it feels a bit cheap in the
hand Apple tries to slip one bias as the
iPhone 5s was truly a gorgeously
designed phone so gorgeous that the se
is a virtually identical device which
can largely use the same cases as the
older 5s the oneplus 3 has barely been
accused of drawing more than a little
inspiration from Huawei and HTC but it
does represent the most significant
manufacturer evolution of the three
moving to the screens display tech is a
tricky comparison for Apple here they
would win an award for best one thumb
ability where my stumpy thumb's
delivering such an award but alas they
are not it's a practical screen with
very good brightness and decent pixel
density but no one's going to be
impressed by a sub 720p display today
oneplus moved over to an AMOLED panel
this year which we would normally
celebrate but this pentile display looks
softer than the LCD on the Nexus so
we'll give the win to the 5x talking
about storage all right sorry Apple yeah
no 16 gigs not great the nexus fares
better here but since none of these
phones have SD card expansion the
oneplus crushes this category a
fingerprint sensors are also something
of a toss-up
the iPhones home button is easy to reach
but we're kind of spoiled by always-on
scanners on a personal note I prefer
rear mounted sensors which are easier
for my tiny Hobbit hands to reach so the
5x wins here and you can drop angry
comments below this video
listening to audio kit the Nexus is
compromised one area LG likely coasted
through to keep the price low apple and
oneplus battle really well here though
the oneplus is just nipping at the SC's
heels for amp output and the
compared very well for dynamic range in
noise for the iPhone down samples high
resolution audio but otherwise it just
barely edges out the oneplus three super
close fights are a lot more fun camera
tech is an interesting battle - Apple
delivers maybe the most well-rounded
platform for photos and videos super
consistent processing for photos high
quality UHD and 60 frames per second
1080p video and great fun features like
HDR processing slow motion video and
panorama stitching the Nexus gets us
really close to the SE though the video
could benefit from better image
stabilization funnily both the iPhone
and the Nexus deliver mono audio for
video and that's funny like what a
bummer not funny like haha the oneplus
three has both optical image
stabilization and stereo audio recording
and yet it delivers the shakiest footage
and the poorest audio of the three still
photos are more competitive but the
third one plus comes in third for this
part of the comparison and I'm no fan of
selfies but the iPhone se front shooter
is pretty late when it comes to software
we're going to call support for the
Nexus and the iPhone at AI as both
phones are currently running developer
previews the oneplus 3 might be near
stock but it's still not full stock so
it'll probably lag a bit behind Nexus
devices the iPhone also wins for battery
though it has the smallest capacity of
the bunch
the smaller lower resolution screen
helped this puppy sip juice running our
media test streaming 30 minutes of video
over Wi-Fi at 50 percent brightness the
SE drained 3% the oneplus drained
5 percent and the Nexus strained 9
percent that Qualcomm 808 isn't doing
Google any favors for run time all three
phones have reversible cables and all
three phones can use NFC based mobile
payment systems so let's wrap this up
our delivery might be a little
tongue-in-cheek but these are fun
comparisons to produce so why not have a
little fun producing them these three
phones have pretty entrenched fan bases
and it's probably uncommon that someone
shopping an iPhone is going to go Hey
look at this red Chinese phone and just
switch teams like that it's less about
outright winners and losers and more
about watching prices plummet on really
solid hardware $400 buys a lot of
these days and phones at this price tier
don't feel as compromised as they might
have a couple years ago we're also happy
to see the Nexus 5x holding its own
there were some concerns at lunch about
the lower power processor but it's
hanging in there just fine it still
represents a killer deal when you see
you can score one for around $300 with a
little shopping we're feeling the good
feels on this one folks so let's leave
this off with a little kumbaya since all
is good in mid-range smartphone land as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
more fun comparisons and hit that thumbs
up button for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos fag now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video okay if you
twist my arm the 1 plus 3 wins
cheese get all cranky about it why don't
you oh I need winners for all of my
comparison videos Murr</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
