extensive array of Hardware sensors but
until recently we haven't seen many
third-party apps take advantage of them
well that looks to be changing I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is your quick look at weather
station for the Samsung Galaxy s4 this
app came to our attention courtesy of a
thread by its builder a minor on
xda-developers
as this video is not a review most of
our information that's not first hand
comes from there again this is just a
quick look based on a single day's worth
of usage to give you a feel for what
this app does and what weather station
does is simple like s-health and a few
other titles the app leverages the
Galaxy S Force thermometer barometer and
hydrometer to provide data rather than
using that information to a specific end
though like s health and its comfort
meter weather station just displays the
almost raw data in a clear simple manner
the main screen displays temperature
pressure and relative humidity in
constantly updated values and a user can
tap a button under each value to see
readings plotted over time on a graph
that graph can also be saved as a
tab-delimited text file to the SD card
if you're a record-keeping type there's
a surprising amount of customization
available here from units of measurement
to reading time intervals to a manually
adjustable altimeter for more accurate
atmospheric pressure readings and if any
of that confuses you there's a veritable
encyclopedia onboard telling you exactly
how to use the app to get as precise a
meteorological reading as possible
now how precise is that reading well
we're not sure about the atmospheric
pressure or humidity meters but the
onboard thermometer is definitely
affected by the device temperature as
you might expect the SGS 4 doesn't run
particularly hot but it's still a heat
generator so the temperature value
displayed is usually a little on a high
side and it tends to swing wildly
depending on whether the phone is in
your hand in your pocket or Avni open
fortunately the readings are easy to
keep tabs on as you can pin a widget to
your home screen for constant updates
and you can adjust how often that widget
updates as well if you're concerned
about battery life
a weather station doesn't provide the
utility of a more fully featured title
that could integrate all of this
atmospheric information and put it in a
larger context but as the developer says
it'll be appreciated by amateur and pro
meteorologists and anyone else who wants
to get the most out of the galaxy s4's
hardware extras the developer is already
at work on the next version so gs4 owner
is interested in this one should keep an
eye out for updates and bug fixes
weather station is available for free
with no ads in the Google Play Store

s4 at pocketnow.com
