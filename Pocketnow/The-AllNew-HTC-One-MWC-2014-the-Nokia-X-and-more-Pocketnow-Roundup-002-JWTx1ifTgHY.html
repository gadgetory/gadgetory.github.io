valleys happy Friday everyone it's
michael fisher with pocket now here with
a recap of everything that's happened on
the editorial and feature side of
pocketnow.com in the past week and
because the pocket now daily is on
temporary hiatus while Jaime Rivera is
in Barcelona will cover a few news items
as well it's been a busy week leading up
to mwc 2014 so let's get to it this is
the pocket now roundup kicking off the
week bright and early at seven a.m. on
monday was Joe Levi with a piece on why
the much-ballyhooed notion of an HTC
made tablet might not be the panacea for
the company's wounds that others might
think it is and hot on the heels of that
editorial came a flood of HTC leaks that
stretched across the week starting with
in hand shots of a gold-colored device
and eventually progressing into renders
all but confirming the unique look of
what we're told will be called the all
new HTC One there's plenty of time for
more conjecture on this as we won't see
an official launch event until March
25th so click the HTC tag down below to
join in the fun and be sure to swing by
our story on HTC's new warranty program
for buyers of one series handsets called
HTC advantage which the accident prone
should appreciate also if you've ever
broken a phone come commiserate with
your comrades and clumsiness Taylor
Martin has a poll for you to take after
which you can add your horror story to
the comments spigner Taylor Martin our
North carolina-based senior editor
finally took delivery on Nokia's Lumia
icon this week you've probably seen his
rather epic unboxing or if you will
unque Singh here on YouTube and we've
since seen a couple comparisons with a
full review coming quite soon while you
wait Adam doubt has a think piece on
just why one of the biggest rumours of
the week android apps running on Windows
Phone is a bad idea calling the proposed
solution a possible short-term gain but
ultimately a long-term loss for the
platform
speaking of Android and Windows Phone
the nokia X the erstwhile nokia normandy
is almost certainly making its debut at
mwc if you believe the big green X in
its event invitation but the story
doesn't stop there rumors of the
android-powered Nokia phones apparent
low price point have incensed Joe Levi
who employs a lot of exclamation points
in his recent editorial to explain why
this is not a good idea add in his
appearance on this week's PocketNow
weekly podcast and is to video tutorials
on printing documents from your phone
and Google's new voice interface
enhancements and our Android guy might
win the award for most prolific editor
of the week but that doesn't mean the
rest of us weren't having any fun can
you guess which smartphone took these
photos if you can congratulations you've
got a sharper eye than ninety six
percent of commenters in our second
monthly smartphone guessing game
published on Monday the answer is
already posted but if you scroll
carefully you should be able to examine
the evidence and make your own guess
without getting spoiled and judging from
the success rate in the comments we're
happy to say you should prepared to be
surprised that's not because the
commenters are dumb but because
smartphone camera quality isn't quite as
easy to discern at a glance as one might
think stay tuned for more from this
series as time goes on and to round out
the last week of pre mwc editorials I
contributed a brief piece on why we'd
like to see more sony smartphones this
year and also one bemoaning the lack of
salt water resistant devices on this
blue planet of ours while Joe leave I
couldn't quite put the pen down and he
kicked out one last piece this time on
LG and it's g2 mini weak sauce or
awesome possum Joe seems to think it's
the latter which gives him the status of
contrarian of the week but there's an
important qualifier to click on over to
his piece to find out what it is and
finally be sure to check out Steven
shanks pre mwc roundup of everything
we're expecting hi May and Anton to
report on from Barcelona from the huawei
leaks that just broke covered today to
the products teased in Nokia's and
Samsung's mwc trailers Adam Lane and I
will be covering the Samsung unpacked
event from New York City while
Anton cover it from Barcelona so stay
tuned for that but there is much more
mobile news happening both before and
after the galaxy s5 announcement in the
run-up to the world's largest mobile
technology trade show keep it locked to
