as they even have their current
processor now in danger Vodafone and II
have just postponed their 5g launch
obviously because of everything that's
going on and if you have a one plus
seven pro with disappointing camera
quality an update is on its way I'm
hearing that out back from London and
things continue to get complicated day
by day with the Huawei topic this is far
get out daily the official news today
begin with deals those of you in the
market for an Apple watch B and H here
in the United States has well $70 off
pretty much almost every model of the
Apple watch again I highly recommend
Series four and we're even talking about
the cellular variants it all depends on
what you're looking for you can learn
more in the description now let's talk
about Apple and WWDC the company has
just sent on presentations for the event
to happen on June 3rd in the morning in
San Jose California and what we're
expecting a new version of iOS were
expecting a new version of Mac OS we
hear that there might be something
significant for the iPad obviously TV OS
should see it change with the whole td+
and well there's so much to come stay
tuned and set your calendars will
definitely be covering it and now let's
talk about the oneplus 7 pro those of
you that have already bought the phone
and have been noticing that your camera
quality is not necessarily the best
you're not alone up to the point where
the company has just fished out a
software update with some fixes and
apparently there's another software
update in the works to bring even more
when it comes the nightscape in
particular so stay tuned obviously we
will be reporting it as soon as we've
got the information and if you remember
we had carriers in the UK like E and
Vodafone scheduled to launch their 5g
networks on May 30th now we hear that
the companies are planning to postpone
their launches because one of the major
partners for this 5g launch was Huawei
and even if the UK hasn't necessarily
instilled a ban here it seems that there
are plans to support what's happening in
the United States obviously there was a
huawei smartphone that was going to
bring 5g as part of the launch so we'll
keep you posted as this continues to
develop and finally the most concerning
news that I have to do with Huawei in
the future of the Kiran processor
thing you know that all the architecture
that's defined for mobile chips comes
from ARM arm is a u.s. technology but
it's now on a uk-based company and so
even if this is a UK company with no
bands yet
well again because it's a u.s.
technology they have decided to cut ties
with Huawei or at least we hear from a
report we don't really have something
official but apparently there's an
internal memo that arm employees should
not continue talking to wall way so this
makes things even more complicated think
about this obviously no 5g roll out with
Huawei in certain European countries
obviously the problem that there's no
Android and now the fact that they can't
even use ARM architecture to build their
chip smearing meaning the keren 980 or
whatever new cairn is coming is based on
arm technology so oh my god and today's
question what do you think I mean what
is your impression of Huawei with
everything that's going on lately
in my case obviously I know that there
is so much that has to happen this is
something legal companies have right so
it's not like if this is just going to
be the flow collapse of Huawei
there will be alternatives and there
will be legal action so it's not
something as simple as everything that's
happening so I don't know I'm skeptical
as to if things are going to actually
cripple Huawei fully or not but that's
just me leave us a comment down below

opinion friends again if you want to get
