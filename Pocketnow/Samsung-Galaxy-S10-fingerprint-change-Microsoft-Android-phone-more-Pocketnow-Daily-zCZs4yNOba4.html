live in the link in the description now
let's talk about the Google pixel to
excel that phone that keeps on bringing
more issues and still has one of the
best cameras of the year
we've got users already complaining on
social media of the camera not working
just out of the blue for no reason
whatsoever and what's most interesting
is that Google is responding to tweets
they're saying yes we acknowledge the
issue yes we're working on it so you're
not alone but I can't tell you when it's
gonna get fixed so stay tuned we'll keep
you posted now let's talk about Apple's
MacBook Pro since we're talking about
complaints if you remember the butter
Frawley mechanism was one of the biggest
issues that most MacBook Pro users were
complaining about the company has now
added a new silicone layer to separate
the keys with the butterfly mechanism
mainly it could be to avoid any lint or
dirt to get in there makes a lot of
sense it seems that this is one of the
main changes that will avoid any issues
to your keyboard
still whoever has a former MacBook Pro
like I do you're still covered for three
years but yeah that's it seems that's
gonna be the change Alice will the
spotlight over to Microsoft as a an
anonymous Microsoft employee has just
said that the company is working on
Android phones yes
okay X no not the Nokia X but you get
the picture the company is bringing its
own approach to Android but we're not
exactly sure if this is a fork version
of Android like Nokia X or if this is
Android running on all the Microsoft
apps that we've seen launched I would
definitely love it to be more of you
know typical Android and then at running
Android apps uh you know but we'll see
we've already got a Microsoft launcher
in addition to other absolutely and
finally the most interesting news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy line
I'm not just the galaxy s 10 we're
hearing even the galaxy a Lelaina was
going to be benefited by the on display
fingerprint scanner provided by none
other than Paul calm and these rumors
come from none other than Ming Shi quo
I'm glad that we're not just getting
Apple rumors here yeah I'll display
fingerprint scanner provided by Qualcomm
there are orders for up to 10 million
units and it seems that these are still
continuing hopefully the Galaxy S 10
will be that phone that will launch this
but in today's question let us know
given the disparity I mean you see Apple
going to you know everything unlock your
phone with your face and now we see
Samsung pushing everything to on display
fingerprint scanners and we don't know
anything about on display you know face
unlock biometrics what do you think what
do you prefer what approach is your
favorite in my case I mean it depends
for me I love face unlock in the winter
Oh cuz I can't be taking my gloves off
to unlock my phone but I love the
versatility of the fingerprint scanner
