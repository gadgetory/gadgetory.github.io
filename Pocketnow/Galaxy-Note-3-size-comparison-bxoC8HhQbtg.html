but how big is it I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow
and this is a galaxy note 3 size
comparison we know the galaxy note 3 is
big well bigger than most phones that is
it certainly isn't the biggest available
or even the largest phone from Samsung
but it is the most intriguing and
promising smartphone over 5 inches to
date I can spit dimensions and tell you
how large the no.3 is all day long but
beside my hereditary meaty bear paws
it's difficult to convey its actual size
the easiest way to truly portray the
size of the Galaxy Note 3 is to show you
so we've scrounged up all the common
household items and devices we could
find in the office to create a size
comparison for your viewing pleasure
first we begin with a scale from
smallest to largest of all the phones we
have lying around from left to right the
iPhone 5 Moto X Lumia 1020 Galaxy s4 HTC
One LG g2 Galaxy Note 2 and finally the
Galaxy Note 3 it can't go without saying
that the note 3 is actually smaller than
the note 2 in every dimension with the
exception of one height it may have a
larger display but it's narrower lighter
and thinner than the note 2 and it's
only 0.1 millimeters taller aside from
that there are some important things to
note the entire iPhone 5 actually fits
inside the area of the Galaxy Note 3's
display and the Moto X very nearly does
as well the only three devices we have
that are actually thinner than the note
3 are the galaxy s4 the iPhone 5 and the
iPad Mini the LG g2 comes very close but
the note 3 is still thinner people
constantly joke about how the note
smartphones are practically tablets foot
sized up with its next-of-kin the Galaxy
Note 8.0 the note 3 is quite obviously
not quite tablet status yet even
compared to the smaller Nexus 7 and iPad
Mini the note 3 is significantly smaller
enough to where it at least fits in a
pant pocket and don't even get us
started on full-size tablets the Nexus
10 is over three times larger than the
note 3 just shy of four just to clarify
to those who love exaggerating and
overreacting the note 3 is not a tab
just a phone with tablet-like qualities
the Z ultra and Galaxy mega 6.3 are a
different story that said it is
encroaching on scientific calculator
size just not in thickness the TI 89 is
a little over an inch taller and about a
half inch thicker but how does the note
3 size up against non tech things such
as the deck of cards pins or other
everyday items take a look
sure the note 3 is an extra-large
smartphone maybe even too large for most
but it's considerably smaller than the
smallest tablets and e-readers my
biggest fear with the note 3 size was
that it wouldn't fit in the Moga pro
controller and I would instead have to
use the included tablet stand nearly
defeating the purpose fortunately
however it does fit in the integrated
clip though it nearly stretches the
adjustable arm all the way out the one
place I've found that it doesn't fit too
well is the random tray in the console
of my car where most other phones fit
without a problem go figure
