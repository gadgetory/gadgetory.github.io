and it's been about six months since
samsung has released the galaxy note for
international users of course we all saw
the 18 t version and it was surprising
that the AT&amp;amp;T version somehow managed to
get an official Ice Cream Sandwich wrong
before the international version so here
we have the semi official Ice Cream
Sandwich Android 4.0 wrong which we're
going to show right now so let's get to
it so the Galaxy Note originally shipped
with Android 2.3 Gingerbread and we've
upgraded it to android 4.0.3 so if we go
into the settings we can go to about
phone we can view that it's Android
4.0.3 and unlike custom roms that have
come out in the past this one is the
semi official version from Samsung so
everything wrong is really smoothly
everything works the s-pen works
perfectly
everything works that's the most
important thing about this new rom so
another new feature that's come with
this new ROM is we have power saving we
can go to system power saving which
allows the system to automatically save
the battery and help you use less power
and we also have our custom power saving
some users said that they didn't like
how the battery drained rather quickly
on this particular device so we can just
go back home another cool feature that
we have one downfall to the galaxy note
which I really do not like was the huge
keyboard this is a 5.3 inch screen so
when you're trying to send a text
message is really difficult with this
large keyboard especially if you're
trying to use one hand well now with
this upgraded Android 4.0 we can just go
into settings and we have this
one-handed operation which allows us to
view a keyboard on the side so we have a
smaller keyboard which is much easier to
use if you have average too small sized
hands and we can also move it to the
right position we can go back home let's
go into the settings again because
there's a few more features that are
available for the one-handed operation
so one-handed operation go in there we
can change the dialer make the
calculator a different size and we can
also do the unlock pattern
make it even smaller so let's go and
view the dialer here so click on here
and we can view that it's a little bit
smaller which is much easier to use with
one hand we can also move it over to the
right or left position so there happened
some enhancements to the s-pen the s-pen
is a great feature to this device so if
I walk on the hovering pen icon and if
you can see right here it will show us
where the pen is going to point without
even having to touch the screen so I'm
not even touching the screen and is just
floating right over it
and you can see that little icon so this
S Pen is phenomenal especially for
applications like oh I don't know if you
were at play draw something this I my
opinion I think it works better than
using your finger on a tablet it's much
easier to draw with than it is to just
use the finger on the device you can
have much more control with the s-pen so
if I wanted to play a game I can play
one of these games and draw this on my
friend's little clique out of here so we
have the same TouchWiz user interface
that Samsung came out with and that's
both a good and a bad thing a bad if you
wanted an upgraded version but good if
you want to make sure that you're able
to stay cohesive with your user
experience so people that are very
familiar with the TouchWiz user
interface will enjoy that they haven't
changed too much so long with that we
can go into the applications we have the
same file system here so if I wanted to
go to edit just a point to add a folder
I've to do is a drag and drop it onto
the screen and then I can just place my
name of the like lit ok and now I can
move my applications into this folder so
let me just Val you can see here I can
move my applications into this folder if
it'll allow me okay there we go does not
have an application in that folder which
is nice and you can also change it to
the ListView if you have tons of
applications and you want them in the
alphabetical order so there hasn't been
too many upgrades or enhancements other
than the Android 4.0 interface does seem
much faster than data with the Android
Gingerbread version so I hope you
enjoyed this video and if you want to
get the Android 4.0 unofficial wrong
semi official I should say to your
galaxy note I will post the link in the
description to pocket now and you
and follow that and there will be
instructions on how to do that
