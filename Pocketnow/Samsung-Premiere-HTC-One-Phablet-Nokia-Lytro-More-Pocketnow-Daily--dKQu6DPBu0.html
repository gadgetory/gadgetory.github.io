twentieth talks galaxy and at Eve more
details emerge on HTC phablet in
development and no key executives keep
talking about a light field camera for
future Lumias I'm hi meri behna and yeah
that date on that Samsung premier event
is just too obvious this is out
daily let's start stay off talking about
the lame news we all saw the white Nexus
4 Google i/o it's not a state secret the
product is was there available nobody
could take it home but we all know that
it exists and still we're seeing some
more leak renders of the device we still
don't know a specific day when it will
be launched but we all assume that it's
going to happen on jun 10th you know
that same date when WWDC is happening
for apple and apparently android 4.3 is
also going to be happening we still
don't have a confirmation but it's just
funny to still see these linked renders
let's see how that goes now let's move
over to note guess their company
executives are talking more about the
option for light-filled cameras you know
that technology where you can take a
photograph with the camera and then you
can reselect where you want the camera
to focus within the software not
necessarily taking a photo again we all
saw that with the Lytro cameras it's not
new anymore and executives keep talking
about the fact that it is coming in the
future of the Lumias and apparently
windows phone is equipped to deal with
this new technology so stay tuned this
could probably be part of the yields
project that everybody's waiting for
probably by the end of this year up next
we've got more rumors of a phablet
version of the HTC One we all remember
that the HTC One was called the m7 as a
code name and then the new desire is the
m4 now this code name for this phone is
the t6 and I don't know if six could
stand for a screen size because m7
doesn't stand for the size of the screen
of the HTC One except for the 4.7 inch
display but still apparently this device
will have a couple of variants not just
one LT variants so it'll probably be a
device that will be launched on all
carriers stay tuned right now all we
have is the t6 codename it could
probably ring a bell and eventually
we'll keep you posted now let's talk
about some more rumors you know that
galaxy s4 mini that has not been
launched and at least four of you out
there still waiting for you know this
device is now being mentioned on the
samson website apparently as
leak and it'll bring a qHD display with
a dual core Exynos processor probably
some of you out there will like this
product it does seem interesting I mean
a 4.3 inch display is something that a
lot of people are looking for not
everybody wants a jumbo phone but sadly
what the fact that the galaxy s3 mini is
not getting any newer versions of
Android I don't know if I'm going to
recommend that s4 mini so stay tuned
let's see what happens with this one and
finally for the interesting news of the
day Samsung is sending out press
invitations for an event to happen on
jun 20th in London and it rings Samsung
Galaxy products and atif products and we
all know about the galaxy s4 active
that's been rumored and also the galaxy
s4 zoom as well we also know that the
atif lineup you know the windows phone
and the windows products haven't really
taken off so let's see what the company
has in store for us so that leads you to
the question of the day what are your
predictions for this event what do you
think that Samsung is going to be
launching I mean it's happening so close
to WWDC it affects to wonder what the
company is bringing but whatever they
bring out as long as it's not the galaxy
s4 mini and just the s4 mini I don't
care what they launch so stay tuned
we'll definitely be at the event
covering it live and of course is we
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet well make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com and scrubs our youtube
channel as well you'll also follow me on
twitter and hien underscore rivera

you liked what you saw I am Hyneman

we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
