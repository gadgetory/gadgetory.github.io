pocket now calm and this is our full
review of the Microsoft Surface RT let's
get to it the surface RT is very
important for Microsoft for the company
it's a hero tablet that represents the
new Windows one that is more focused on
touch and less focused on keyboard and
mouse input that characterized the last
30 years of computer interaction but
Microsoft isn't parting ways with their
past either as that would be too risky
and because many still rely on the
productive Windows desktop environment
and so Windows 8 is somewhat of a
combination of the old and the new the
surface RT runs Windows 8 RT
which is really an answer to iOS and to
Android that runs on tablets
even though Microsoft would lead you to
believe that it's in a class of its own
the RT version of Windows 8 only runs
applications designed to run on ARM
processors like the Qualcomm Snapdragon
the Exynos and the Tegra 3 which is what
is found inside the surface RT we'll
talk more about this limitation later
let's take a look at the surface we're
going to talk mostly about hardware and
performance in this video if you want to
learn more about Windows RT be sure to
check out our RT explanation and walk
through a video where we talk more about
the new operating system the surface is
undoubtedly a unique beautiful and
durable piece of technology it's made
out of metal or vapor mag as Microsoft
caused it so it's cool to the touch
while the casing does feel durable we
oddly found the Microsoft logo on the
back to start chipping away just a few
days after use this is likely an
isolated instance and we've yet to hear
of other surface students experiencing
this defect the design like many tablets
is tapered around the edges giving the
appearance of thinness and a bit less
than 1.5 pounds the surface RT is about
the same weight as the full-sized
iPad so it's not lightweight but it's
easier to hold with one hand thanks to
some really interesting weighting
that feels concentrated in the middle of
the tablet it feels significantly better
to hold than the iPad the display is ten
point six inches and 1366 by 768
resolution granting it a 16 by 9 aspect
ratio
that means that you won't have black
bars while watching HD content but it
also mean that using the surface RT in
portrait is very awkward the screen is
just quite tall in that orientation
there's a capacitive start button on one
of these vessels and we've yet to see a
tablet with a capacitive button for a
good reason when you hold a tablet in
various ways your fingers are always
resting along the bezels on the surface
RT miss presses of this capacitive Start
button are unfortunately very common
here on the left side we have a speaker
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and volume
rocker over on the right is a groove
that helps you extend the kickstand on
the top we have two microphones to help
with noise cancellation plus a power
button then on the other side we have a
second speaker a micro HDMI output jack
and a USB port which will work with USB
flash drives mice keyboard and even
printers then on the far right is the
proprietary charging connector let's
talk more about this touch cover it's a
100 to 120 dollar option that integrates
quite well with the surface even if it
is overpriced thanks to some strong
magnets you can easily snap the touch
cover into the connector whether you are
using the type model or the one with the
flat keys like we have here then if you
fold out the kickstand you have a mini
laptop setup that works quite well on a
table or even on your lap the touch
cover itself wraps around the device and
has an interesting felt like texture
which is a great contrast to the cold
metal of the other side it's a really
interesting effect the keys on the
keyboard take a lot of getting used to
on the touch cover they're nearly flat
as as if you're typing on a display like
a capacitive display but you can
actually rest your fingers on the keys
without the keyboard registering presses
it's something you have to experience to
understand but we can tell you that even
with a good amount of practice we were
left longing for a tactile keyboard and
integrated into the touch covers a
trackpad while it's really small it's
quite usable at handy if and when you
decide to dive into the desktop
environment of the surface which in RT
is a bit of an illusion because you
can't run any regular Windows apps in
there
we actually would recommend that you
find a Bluetooth keyboard with tactile
keys and an integrated mouse pointer
which can be had for less than 50 bucks
on Amazon
the touch cover is just too expensive
and not good enough now back to the
screen while the pixel density of the
display is quite low and you'll be able
to see pixels the quality of the screen
is excellent thanks to great color
saturation and good viewing angles when
you're using the Smart Cover and are
sitting several feet away from the
surface RT the pixelated screen doesn't
look too bad but move closer and you'll
see that text is pretty grainy let's
take a look at a select number of apps
and see how they perform on the surface
RT first let's take a look at one of the
best games we could find in the Windows
8 app store and they keep changing the
name of the App Store so we're gonna
call it the Windows 8 app store
it's called hydro thunder hurricane and
it costs 10 bucks
we hope that Windows 8 apps aren't going
to be expensive because it'll act as yet
another barrier for people to get an
iPad or an Android tablet where app
prices are half as much so here in hydro
thunder hurricane we can see that while
the effects with the water is impressive
the game is quite light
this could be because of unoptimized
software or perhaps the Tegra 3 is
underperforming either way for 10 bucks
this isn't a good enough experience but
we are glad to see the Netflix and Hulu
apps in the Windows 8 app store both of
which provide beautiful and clean
interfaces I'll be long load times when
not in RAM watching video on the surface
RT is a pleasant experience thanks to
the 16 by 9 aspect ratio display the
kickstand and the great weighting just
makes for a really good video player we
just wish the dual speakers were louder
then the if Skype which is now owned by
Microsoft
we were hoping for an amazing skype
experience but we were let down while
the stand on the surface RT puts the
camera adjust the right angle for a
video chat
we were unimpressed by the quality of
the video even when over a strong Wi-Fi
connection on both ends what's more we
didn't appreciate the advertising that
now appears in the Skype app and finally
in terms of battery life the surface
will get you through a workday of about
eight hours just as long as you're not
playing videos or games which has a huge
negative impact on battery life but
that's not unique to the surface that
happens with all chowder's
in terms of charging speed the surface
RT powers up quite quickly giving you a
full charge in as little as three hours
this is more than twice as fast as the
iPad
so here's what we'd like and what we
don't like about the surface RT we like
that the surfaces hardware is truly
unique
we like that the battery life is
reasonably good as long as you're not
playing a lot of games and we like that
the display well low resolution is well
saturated and bright with good viewing
angles what we don't like is that
Windows RT is a broken concept and
doesn't do either of its functions
particularly well we don't like that the
performance of the surface RT is laggy
at times and we don't like that the
touch cover is so expensive so in the
end we cannot recommend the Microsoft
Surface RT it has great hardware there's
no doubt about that Microsoft did a
great job on the design of the surface
RT but it's laggy and slow a lot of the
times and it runs Windows RT which is
just not a pretty picture so we can not
recommend the surface RT we give it a 6
out of 10
let us know what you think about the
surface RT give us a thumbs up if you
like this video thanks for watching and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
