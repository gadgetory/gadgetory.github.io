and you're already thinking about ways
to take stylized photos or you just want
to look like a peculiar character
Samsung's got you covered I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is a
quick look at the lens cover accessory
for the galaxy s7 brought to you by D
brand okay so if you've ever seen a nolo
clip these will be very familiar they
screw onto a threaded hole on a special
galaxy s7 cover which itself is nothing
fancy but it does bear a texture that
reminds me of old film cameras and
they're made specifically to match the
s7 s optics one is a telephoto lens for
a magnified image and a narrower field
of view while the other is a fisheye
lens for super wide angle shots I'm
gonna let my colleague Juan Carlos bag
now go into further detail on just what
these lenses do and why they are or
aren't worth the extra cost I'm just
here to tell you how they look
ridiculous and how well-made they seem
very and how practical they are depends
on how serious you are about your mobile
photography honestly I think most people
who'd seriously consider one of these
are likely to have their own pro camera
anyway
but as smartphone shooters continue to
displace dedicated cameras first-party
accessories like this may become
commonplace especially if they feel this
awesome these are all metal and they
really really feel great in the hand
pricing and availability are TBD pocket
