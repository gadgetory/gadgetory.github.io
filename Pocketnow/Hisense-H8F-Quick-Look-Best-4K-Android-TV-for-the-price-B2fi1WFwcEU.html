possibly one of my favorite products of
early 2019 and there are some important
reasons why but before we get to that
quick disclaimer yes they sponsor in our
video back at CES in addition to this
one and at the end of that video I
explained the reason why we accepted see
these Android TVs look so good on paper
that I was like sure I'll make a video
but I really want a retail variant to
prove that it's as good as it claims for
the price I'm high metairie better with
pocket now it's about that time so fact
sheet high sense has been in the market
for a while they make their own you LED
display technology in addition to the
high view chips that power their TVs
which explains one of the main reasons
why I wanted to make this video see
usually companies that control their
technology are able to be very
aggressive about the price tag this TV
starts at 399 and while the variant that
I have here is the 55 inch model meaning
you'll pay an extra benjam√≠n but you
would be shocked at everything that you
get for the price tag there are a ton of
reasons why you should care and it
really starts with a design this is one
very elegant TV you can barely see the
bezels on the borders I love how the
brightness fades into them and it is
very thin now one of the things that I
care about most when buying a TV is the
amount of ports and there are plenty
here we have 4 HDMI ports two USB ports
Ethernet and aux jack and in the
wireless department we have Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth the screen on my unit is a 55
inch you led at 4k resolution and 60
Hertz refresh rate that's optimized to
motion rate 240 it can get very bright
at up to 700 nits but also includes full
array local dimming to get great
contrast than light control it supports
HDR 10 Dolby vision and the wider dcpip
three color gamut it also gets plenty
loud thanks to 215 watt speakers that
support dbx TV
seriously just the very experience of
watching TV has been fantastic this you
LED technology provides some very
vibrant colors and deep blacks and the
refresh rate is just fantastic usually
this is where companies cheap out for
less expensive televisions but that's
not really a problem here another thing
that I really like is the amount of
thought put into the design and
everything you get in the package it has
two different slots for the legs in case
you have a smaller table to place it and
in the Box you get literature a
non-intrusive power cord and the second
reason why I love this TV which is this
remote see this is a full-blown Android
TV and after some recent software
updates it's gonna be really hard for me
to go back Android TV solves one of my
biggest complaints with smart
televisions which is how many layers you
have to go through just to be able to
launch anything honestly I just want to
sit in my couch and watch what I want as
quick as possible here all you have to
do is hit the Google assistant button on
the remote tell it to play Avengers
infinity war on Netflix and that's it
and then the second reason why I love
the Android TV approaches because it's
not just the television this is pretty
much a Google Home Hub or a smart
display on steroids the Google assistant
is connected to your account so you can
ask it
other things like details about your
commute or even the weather the other
advantage is that if you have Android TV
you pretty much don't need a smart
speaker if you just have the Google
assistant control your home automation
lights etc and then there's the user
interface which solves my other
complaint with Smart TVs these are
usually very slow that's not the case
here Android TV breezes through
everything with a very practical
approach to how it stacks applications
and content and just like on your phone
features like settings are more TV menus
than an added mess of buttons on your
controller and speaking of applications
yes even games are supported and since
the design layout of the controller
mimics Android on a phone you can play
these games using the controller just
fine to conclude let's go back to the
initial premise the Hisense HAF is a 50
to 65 inch TV with 4k HDR motion rate
240 lots of i/o a beautiful design all
powered by android TV and it's
starts at 399 sure it all looks good on
paper but after testing the 55 inch
variant this past week I've got to say
that I'm very impressed I don't think
you'll find a better deal right now of
such a complete package at such an
aggressive price I do believe you should
give them a try hi so this is actually
also running a Facebook giveaway of a
couple of these so make sure you follow
