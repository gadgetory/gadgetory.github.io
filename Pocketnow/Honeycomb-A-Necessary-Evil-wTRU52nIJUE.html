today we're going to talk about
something that we don't talk about a lot
here at Pocket now and that's tablets
more specifically honeycomb on tablets
let's go take a look so this is going to
be more of an editorial and because I
don't just want to show you you know my
hands pointing at things on a screen
with not a lot of action I'm going to do
a little bit of talking up front so we
can kind of dig right into the topic
that topic is honeycomb now honeycomb is
android version three point and it only
came out for tablets I don't know of any
smartphones that ran honeycomb there's
kind of a reason for that honeycomb
needed a bit more processing power than
a lot of the smartphones of the day had
not that they couldn't have but then
weren't an awful lot already out there
that could handle some of the stuff now
that stuff primarily is a GPU and not
just a lightweight one but kind of a a
heavy can do an awful lot of cool stuff
JP you now a lot of phones had GPUs in
them before they just weren't all that
powerful and Android didn't really
utilize the GPU you had to write games
specifically for the GPU in whatever
phone and since there are lots of
different platforms out there you had to
write custom code to tie into the Jeep
or the api's for all those different
GPUs was it pain in the neck and of
course that made appt writers not really
want to write games for android because
it really wasn't any one unified way to
talk to that graphics processing part so
kind of just SAT there underused well
honeycomb came along and it changed all
that honeycomb was the OS for tablets
and it was really kind of pushed out my
personal opinion here but it was pushed
out by Google to compete against the
tablets that were coming out from Apple
that the ipad the ipad 2 and whatnot and
google was really missing the boat they
had to do something to stay in the game
otherwise they weren't going to be able
to keep up so honeycomb came along and
it enabled developers
you use the GPU using basically Android
ap is very cool very nice you could use
once at a code for your game for your
app whatever and talk to the operating
system which would then accelerate it
and all you had to do was custom code a
little teeny bit really one or two lines
to say hey use GPU acceleration if it
exists and your app was GPU accelerated
was great was fabulous did a lot of cool
things so that having been said they had
it turned off by default and I don't
know why not only that but the the OS
itself the launcher and all the apps
that come from google weren't really GPU
accelerated so it was kind of laggy and
it was kind of slow and it had
hesitations and it had bumps and it
really wasn't a pleasant experience now
it was a lot nicer again my personal
opinion then say gingerbread on a tablet
and no qualms against Samsung hey
samsung did a great job coming out with
the original tab and making gingerbread
run on it wow that that's impressive but
still the operating system wasn't built
for tablets it wasn't built for that
extra screen real estate and doing all
the extra things that you expect a
tablet to do because really a tablet is
just a small laptop without a keyboard
right okay that may be an
oversimplification but it's so much more
than just a smartphone all right so all
that having been said there are a couple
other things that honeycomb did in
addition to getting Google's foot in the
door and getting tablet manufacturers to
adopt honeycomb rather than adopt
gingerbread and just start slapping on
custom launchers and what not to try and
make it work and I'm going to say it and
fragment the platform even further they
pushed everyone two words honeycomb and
honeycomb did pretty well at doing what
it was supposed to do so what was it
supposed to do well let's go back just a
little bit honeycomb also brought us
what are called fragments not to be
confused with fragmentation fragments
now what a fragment is is it's a piece
of a screen and on a smartphone you can
have a piece of
screen say a list and email list that
has all the emails laid out in a list
for you great you tap on one of those
emails or an item in the list and it
then opens up the view of that email the
body that's another fragment on a
smartphone you can't see both of them
side by side because you don't have
enough screen real estate but the two
are coupled together it's one fragment
of the same view essentially think of a
mirror that you drop on the floor you
have lots of different fragments they
all go together just you have to look at
them differently depending on if you're
looking at them close up in your hand
with a smartphone or kind of pushed away
at more like a 24 inch view at arm's
length like you would with the tablet so
that's what fragments were on a tablet
you can see the list on one side and you
can see the contents on the other side
really kind of cool and now we've got
apps that are written to take advantage
of that a lot of the early apps didn't
because it didn't exist so you had to
kind of build that on your own and you
had at version 4 smartphone you had a
version for tablet and then if you want
a google TV that was something else
entirely we're not even talking about
that in the context of this video so
lots and lots of stuff there but it was
setting the stage okay so we've got all
that sit down we're going to switch over
to desktop operating systems all right
how many of you remember Windows Vista
raise your hand you in the bag with your
hands up okay good Windows Vista sucked
but Windows Vista was awesome and I know
that's opposite ends of the spectrum
what can I possibly mean well if you had
a computer that you were trying to
upgrade with windows vista it was
terrible you had all of your hardware
devices that didn't work right all of
your old software didn't work right but
if you've got a brand-new computer with
them with windows vista on it already
pre-installed with new software you've
got a new printer and knew this and do
that it were great not a problem at all
it was only when you were trying to
couple the old stuff there that you ran
into problems now I come from a pc
background I built them I troubleshot
them I sold them I did all kinds of
stuff for a local crazy guy
in fact that's what everyone kind of
calls him you can go look that up it's a
whole nother story but when we did Vista
the new computers worked great as long
as you had new hardware that's where our
company was different from everyone else
we use name-brand hardware not cheap
stuff but name-brand really good
high-end components went into these
computers not integrated not all that
stuff so the drivers were there that's
where Vista was different from
everything before it to be able to grow
past what Windows was what windows XP
was and everything down underneath that
Microsoft had to reinvent the hardware
abstraction the drivers all kinds of
sivan the security infrastructure
especially the security infrastructure
had to be bootstrapped from the ground
up and the sound subsystem alone was
brand new that meant all of the old
stuff didn't work well luckily hardware
is hardware all you have to do is have
software that talks to the operating
system that's called a driver and it
works just fine unfortunately some of
these manufacturers would rather not
write new drivers for their old hardware
and instead sell you new hardware that
has the new drivers that work with it
that was probably the biggest problem
software wasn't all that big of a deal
maybe a little bit but it was the
drivers it was that the hardware
compatibility just wasn't there but it
was a necessary evil to be able to get
us past the windows XP into windows 7
windows 8 which is a lot slimmer a lot
faster a lot more compact and a lot more
able to do stuff just with current
technologies it was the old architecture
that was holding windows back now a lot
of you are going to argue with that and
that's a lot of over generalizations on
my part so please if you've got
constructive comments about that leave
it down below but realize you know if I
said something a little bit technically
simplistic know that it was for the sake
of a broader audience okay so that's
Windows Windows Vista as it compares to
Windows 7 and Windows 8 which should be
coming out pray
soon and he'll be get all kinds of cool
with tablets on it all right but that's
another video let's get back to android
so honeycomb was a necessary evil it had
to be done to keep google in the game to
keep basically android on devices now
smartphones I think they'd still be
running Android if we didn't have
honeycomb that probably true fact like I
said earlier no smartphones that I know
of run honeycomb in fact cyanogenmod one
of the biggest custom mods out there and
probably my favorite custom rom out
there skipped right over honeycomb
entirely and I think Google did that on
purpose they deliberately withheld the
source code for android honeycomb from
the development community until the same
day that they released android ice cream
sandwich so then released version 3 and
version 4 at the same time version four
is a unifying operating system it runs
on not only tablets but it also runs on
smartphones and we're starting to see
some tablets come out with it built in
and the number of smart phones that have
ice cream sandwich still is kind of low
that the Galaxy Nexus is really the
flagship and it's the biggest one out
there right now but we're going to see
more and more start to to carry it new
and of course we've got some really good
OEMs you know who you are I don't have
to list you my name that are putting ice
cream sandwich on their phones thank you
for that I appreciate it everybody else
kind of needs to to not to mention any
names samsung but please do that now why
is that a big deal now that we're coming
back to one core operating system one
version if you will now everybody has
one target to write for great apps are
now writing to one unified set of AP is
where you can have hardware acceleration
GPU acceleration all that stuff
fragments and at that point you have one
app that's built for different views not
different platforms if that makes sense
so google went through a lot of work
rethinking and taking apart android so
that they could then put it
all back together again honeycomb was
where they did that and it caused a lot
of pain then a lot of that pain has been
growing pains and user interface stuff
and you know they didn't have matias
duarte back then maybe they did but he
was just coming on but they didn't have
a lot of his influence in the early
phases you'd get the timeline down there
i think i got it right but now they've
got that foundation they went through
that windows vista phase it had to be
done to get passed that on to the next
and the next is Ice Cream Sandwich and
jelly bean and whatever is going to come
after that but now that that foundation
has been laid now that we've had all of
those pain and that struggle we have a
solid foundation to build upon and with
that solid foundation now android is
poised to be even bigger than well
anybody else in all honesty but there's
one you ready for this one catch Google
TV now Google TV just came out with
Google TV 2 point 0 awesome great and
it's based on honeycomb why why okay it
has to do with timing they were working
on Google TV too way back before ice
cream sandwich was available so that was
the next step up and in all honesty
they've got tighter control of the
hardware I believe correct me if I'm
wrong you google TV guys than they do
with tablets so maybe they've got a
little bit tighter control over the
whole UI eventually I still predict
we're going to have maybe Google TV 3 or
maybe a little jump right up and call it
four or five or whatever and it will be
based on Ice Cream Sandwich so that'll
be great we'll have one unified platform
to develop for where right now you can
kind of do it because remember Ice Cream
Sandwich apps run on honeycomb just fine
that just fine absolutely fine fact they
even run on you guessed it on your bread
and this stuff below it just not with as
many bells and whistles and finesse if
you will so now that we've got one
platform Google's even released a style
guide a recommendation for developers on
how to write
apps so that you can reuse common
controls that can be themed that can be
you know follow a common theme across
the whole device and really how to use
them properly so when the OS evolves
into the next version your app will
evolve with it without any extra coating
being done that means apps are going to
look more uniform all across them except
for those who decide to break from the
the standard not to mention any names I
don't ways you know apps that have
different interfaces that are custom
built for who knows why I know why but
that's again beyond the scope of this
video but when we have that now we've
got three different screens to build for
we've got the handheld screen which is
viewed you know this close in your hand
we've got the tablet which just
interviewed a little bit further away I
look like I'm driving the car don't I
and then you've got the TV the 10-foot
experience it's way out there things are
bigger but still as long as you have
those fragments as long as you have the
built right you can then see everything
on the screen in that interface and it
becomes the OS that handles how that app
is displayed you don't have to as a
developer custom code for it now my app
that I right we'll work on smartphones
it'll work on the tablets it'll work on
TVs across the board that right there is
nirvana that is what nobody else has yet
Apple has Apple TV which is based on Mac
it's not iOS you can't have one app that
runs on your phone and on your iPad and
on Apple TV you've got to have at least
two different apps maybe three depending
on how you write your app to work on
your your iphone vs your ipad those are
getting closer together but TV is still
way out there great who's poised to
change that Microsoft a Microsoft
Windows 8 Windows 8 should run on ARM
processors so that means we're going to
be able to run on tablets like we have
today that'll be interesting but then
we've got Intel coming out with their
new Medfield in there Adam line which is
x86 and should run native you know x86
native windows 8 so that'll be great but
windows seven if you remember and even
windows vista had media center built
into it it had a DVR built-in I've got
to assume that Windows 8 is going to do
the same thing and Windows 8 runs on
desktop computers runs on laptop
computers it'll run on tablets and it
runs on TVs I've got media center
running on my TV downstairs right now
got it hooked into my computer by a DVI
cable and I've got a bluetooth keyboard
and mouse i watch TV on it i watch
netflix on it it's right there all
together what's the difference between
that and google google has phones and
Microsoft doesn't well they have phones
just not running the same OS so you now
have two different apps you have to run
for desktop versus well not mobile but
your smartphone and if you want to write
an app that works in media center that's
kind of different again so writing one
app that works on Microsoft TV on
microsoft desktop on microsoft tablet
and Microsoft phone you've got to have
multiple versions of that app if they
were able to integrate all across the
board and they're getting there with
windows 8 I believe if they can build in
the app construction they're doing with
the core Windows 8 apps and build that
into the TV they'll almost be there we
just then need to be able to do that on
the phone and Microsoft well they've got
the monopoly and if that happens Google
is the only competitor that's close and
the only thing they're missing there is
Computers Computers they've got
Chromebook but it's anybody want to
comment with your experiences with
Chromebook it's kind of like a web
browser on a laptop and that's it not
all that great if it were Android on
that platform it might make a little bit
more sense but then again it's not
supposed to be Android on a netbook or
on a laptop it's supposed to be a web
browser so it's doing what it's supposed
to be it's just kind of leaving a hole
there and I think Google's taking a
gamble on that all right so long and
rambling where we were where we are how
honeycomb was a necessary evil I think
google had to do it and I think amber
had ice cream sandwich and the entire
Android architecture the the whole
environment is better for having
honeycomb even though honeycomb was
really really tough now I'm still
running honeycomb on my zoom and my next
experiment and we'll see if there's a
follow up video to this one will be
getting an Ice Cream Sandwich to run on
this so make sure you tune in and watch
that this of course has been an
editorial and an awful lot of talking
and it's not something that we normally
do but we're interested to know if you
