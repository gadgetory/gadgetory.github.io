pocketnow.com
and in this video we're gonna take a
look at windows mobile 6.5 standard
which was just released officially for
the HTC snap we talked a lot about the
touchscreen version of windows mobile
6.5 that is professional but not so much
the non touchscreen version because it
doesn't bring that many changes to the
platform but now that the official ROM
is out we're going to talk about them
now on the HTC snap so let's zoom in on
the screen a little bit and see what is
different
first and foremost now we have the
application store marketplace on the HTC
snap or windows mobile 6.5 standard so
again you get please wait while checking
for updates and then the main screen is
a little bit different you don't get the
featured icons on the top as you do in
touchscreen devices so we can
immediately search for a particular
program or drill down into say
categories from here we can go to any of
the categories and this looks very much
similar to how it looks on the
touchscreen version of Windows Mobile
it's pretty fast loading and let's say
we want to get tic-tac-toe we click
install it says sign in with your
Windows Live ID and then I'll install to
your device just like you would
experience on the touchscreen version
okay so let's get out of this and talk
about what else is different
also new is Microsoft my phone is
included and also widgets are part of
the operating system so that you can get
the weather widget or a stock widget or
you have a custom made widget you can
run it natively on this device now let's
take a look at internet explorer Mobile
which has been revamped to be more like
the touchscreen version so we're going
to go to go to web address and you're
going to see that a place flash of video
right on the right in the browser so
we're going to go to youtube.com slash
pocket now video
the interface is a little bit different
than it was in windows mobile 6.1
standard click go
okay we're taken to the mobile version
but if we go down to one video in
particular and as you can see you get a
little preview on the side to know where
you are on the page we can go down to
the latest video and tap on it and get
that virtual mouse cursor which is quite
nice and we're actually going to get
real flash video playing right here and
you see the little YouTube swirly thing
we can make this fullscreen just like
you can do in windows mobile 6.5
professionals let's tap it home with a
full screen then we have full screen
flash video and let's go to another web
address real quick let's go to
amazon.com and see how that looks and
how it feels to kind of scroll around
the page and like in Pocket Internet
Explorer or Internet Explorer mobile as
they call it now
on touch screen devices you get the
the.com and the www added so you just
tap on that Internet Explorer Mobile
still a little bit slow that's why we
still like Skyfire a lot which uses
server-side rendering to pull down the
page faster so here we are on the
desktop version of of amazon.com and the
pointer has turned into a zoom tool so
we can tap on any area to zoom in on the
text now if to zoom out we tap on one of
the buttons here and do a zoom and we
get the zoom slider but it disappears if
you don't use it quickly we give the
zoom slider that you get in the version
of Internet Explorer mobile found on the
touchscreen devices which gives you a
level of control but it's a lot of
button clicking to move around on the
page so now I have to move around like
this I can zoom in it's not that easy to
zoom in and zoom out quickly so let's
just really quick click on a category
here
so try to click on books oh here we go
here are the menus that we were looking
for certainly not the best-performing
browser that you can get for Windows
Mobile standard but it's definitely an
improvement of what we had before on the
windows mobile 6.1 devices so that was a
really quick look at windows mobile 6.5
standard on the HTC snap we'll post a
link on pocketnow.com on how to get the
official rom update for the HTC snap and
this is for the unlocked version really
not that many changes that come in 6.5
standard we have the marketplace widget
support an updated version of Internet
Explorer Mobile and that's really it and
unlike the touchscreen version of
windows mobile 6.5 we don't get a new
home screen interface we still have the
sliding panel interface which is quite
nice and actually the the version for
touchscreen interfaces is based off of
this kind of concept of going down and
scrolling to the right scrolling to the
left and having everything available on
this main screen so just a quick look at
windows mobile 6.5 standard that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
