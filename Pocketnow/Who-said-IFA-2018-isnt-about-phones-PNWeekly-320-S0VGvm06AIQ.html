butchered that but it's also currywurst
I'm well that's for everyone in Berlin
including Jaime Rivera who is not on the
show today because he is out
gallivanting at Aoife in Berlin but here
in North America we're left to be
content discussing the 9 yes 9 phones
that launched at Aoife and most of them
came out even before Aoife officially
began it's kind of par for the course
but we have all of that news for you in
this show does blackberry hold an icon
that everybody wants is honor playing in
the big leagues now is HTC shrinking
away from us further doesn't Android one
push makes sense for LG and Motorola how
does Sony do with its first OLED mobile
phone and is there vengeance for ZTE
after months of dormancy there is so
much to cover on this week's Aoife
centric show we have specs and a few
bits of other info for all of these
phones so let's go ahead and talk about
it on this the pocket now weekly hello
everybody and welcome to episode number
three 2-0 brought to you by pocket mount
and xda-developers on this day Friday
the last day of August actually 2018
from smartphones to tablets to wearables
and so much more we're talking about all
the stuff that you wish you had when you
were a kid so let's go ahead and get
talking I am your host for the weekly it
is Joshua agar what's going on everybody
and we have a couple of new faces on the
show at least new for me in a way but in
place of Jaime de Vetta who is out in
Berlin and also Brandon minimun who has
the day off we have a couple of our
friends from XDA
we're gonna start off with creative
director Mario Serra Pharaoh can you
tell me if I pronounced that correctly
that's fine nobody can figure it out in
the US it's fine fair enough now right
when I got into the call before we hit
the hit record on the live live stream
here you guys were taught you and Jules
were talking about a little story that
we'll talk about later but won't you
show our fans oh yeah I might be the
first person to have a broken s-pen like
this oh my goodness you know that it's
uh that chrome II bit yeah so had a lady
over she put a bunch of crap on her on
my nightstand I subconsciously try to
put my phone back on the nightstand at
2:00 a.m. after some
texting and I couldn't find room for it
so it just fell I'm like okay I have a
case on it no big deal
now everyone that knows Samsung Galaxy
Note phones knows that when the phone
falls the espen just ejects just the
loss of physics always makes it just
shoot out the SP shoots up okay fine I
inspect the phone no big deal I can't
find the s-pen okay where's the s pen
and then I shined the flashlight and I
see the chrome II bit I'm like oh no no
it's not and I start cursing just like
cursing cursing cursing and that didn't
help things
no have you posted this to the Tech Gore
subreddit yet no I haven't I haven't
it's old it's too sudden you know I'm
still morning morning
yeah I did make a very just one day
delivery order for another one that's 50
bucks down the drain
plus the expedited shipping so yep
it's a it's available on samsung's
website now you could buy it separately
I bought it for Amazon so Oh gotcha okay
yeah well we will we will pour one out I
mean I don't have tea today because
we're kind of in a hurry but I'll pour a
little bit about for the s-pen but in
any case we can also move over to our
senior editor Steven Zimmerman and Jules
usually makes the scripts for me to be
able to follow and it says here what's
good in the GTA and I learned something
today you can tell our viewers Steven
yes it's pretty good in Toronto it's uh
starting a little bit chillier it's no
longer 30 filling degrees out but it's
still so myself the Greater Toronto Area
I've never heard that before but when I
go see my family in Toronto I'm
definitely gonna say that from now on
yeah yeah yeah you gotta take that trip
up the Don Valley Parkway nice and you
were just hearing our podcast Wrangler
and the man in the production booth
Jules Wong how's it goin Jules yeah yeah
I'm doing good in the Greater Boston
area and or the GPA it's the best the
hub of the universe
okay well Jules I have to add my hat's
off to you like we do our best to put
together a great show every single week
Jules you had a lot of work ahead of you
this week so we're gonna go ahead and
just jump right into it we have a lot of
stories out of and we're going to start
off coming back out can I like can I
just get out of this show like I'm not
prepared actually for my for in my head
in my heart it's just I like I'm a
doctor has given me a note I kind of am
NOT prepared either this is the first
Aoife that I am NOT at in like probably
five six years it's kind of a
bittersweet thing because I mean just on
a personal level I'm I have nothing
against Aoife or Berlin or anything like
that but in the grand scheme of all of
the shows throughout the year I mean I
told myself if I don't have to go to
Aoife then I'll be okay it's cool like
I'm not gonna really worry over it but I
will admit all of the photos that Jaime
has been showing over on his IG and his
IG stories and and then all of these
announcements I got I got a bit I got
teeny bit of the FOMO going right now
I'm not gonna lie so we'll start off
with one of the any device announcements
that happened we're starting off with
the BlackBerry key to L II now le we
originally thought it might be called
light le could mean limited edition and
it certainly feels like it because there
are a few new colors of the BlackBerry
key to let's run through the specs real
quick it does Rock the Snapdragon 6-3
six it still has the 4.5 inch screen at
1080p resolution four gigabytes of RAM
though we would love to see a six
gigabyte RAM Edition one day in the
future the battery is 3000 milliamp
hours with quick charge 3.0 and
apparently it's out now it's available
on August 30th as it says on the pocket
not website you can head over to see
that story at pocketnow.com well well
it's - because it was announced
yesterday and it will launch within the
next month so I'm not to mislead our
viewers here or listen oh well I've
already sent in my email to them and I
said bring that red one over right now
so fellas how do you feel about the
BlackBerry key - l/e
hmm well I certainly think it's more
limited perhaps not as in like limited
edition terms there are many downgrades
to it that um almost make me sad because
there are many things that I liked about
the blackberry q10
kind of Rob's it of its executive feel
by opting for plastic and then the
removal of the capacitive scrolling on
the keyboard that's like a signature
feature of this new kind of the revive
form factor right and then the battery
downgrade which you know the key one is
known for a legendary battery life so it
it seems kind of a bit too limited if
you ask me okay how many over there
Stephen yeah yeah they definitely took a
couple things and stepped down in the
right spot spaces like the 636 into the
660 is a completely reasonable downgrade
it's honestly not much of a graph now
great too at all but they definitely did
go overboard in certain areas it almost
feels like it should be branded as a
different brand not today you lose the
key one name right the lack of that
battery is really gonna have an impact
on how it's used how its received and
hopefully it doesn't knock it down too
much
Mario you mentioned the the loss of the
executive feel like do you think the
colors also contribute to that a little
bit or are you jazzed about the colors
so I'm kind of just because I actually
really really like red phones like I was
begging oneplus to release a red phone
and then when they released the red 5d I
was like oh my god this is everything I
wanted and now they continue that with
the red one plus six which is also
beautiful
for this though I almost feel like it
doesn't quite match it kind of reminds
me of like the approach the BlackBerry
had in countries like in countries of
Latin America where I would see
BlackBerry's all the time and it would
be like the cheaper BlackBerry's not
like the executive looking blackberries
but like the cheaper more plastic ones
that everyone had because they were
cheaper so it seems kind of that they
they went back to the okay we want this
semi high-end but not really executive
phone and now we're also releasing these
cheaper ones are more accessible more
colorful have kind of more of a broader
appeal but also in the process they lose
a little bit of that special
yeah I agree III I do think that there's
a little bit to be desired with these
phones but I think that was kind of the
point
I mean after all Jules any thoughts on
the three hundred and $99 price point
after all yeah that's gonna be a little
bit more convincing for people who are
kind of normal but also do you want that
nostalgic blackberry keyboard some of
the features as you've said have been
taken away like the capacitive scrolling
but I don't think if you know it's not a
feature that was lost to many of the
customers that would be would want to
you know if they're approaching
blackberry again for the first time in
many years or they're just approaching
it from an all-new point that is going
to be something that they won't miss and
I feel like in terms of what the spec
combination provides here it's not much
of a step down for the price that you
know the we got at 6:49 for the key to
and this takes it down to 449 if you
really want to be you know well stop
cheating yeah and also I didn't know
that there was so much Pokemon go favors
favoritism here in terms of a team valor
if we're going by the colors red yellow
and blue instinct may have been my color
here oh yeah
fair enough III think it's an honorable
play from a blackberry and let me have
my segways I think it's an honorable
play by blackberry to create a version
of their latest phone that is accessible
to as many people as possible even if
they have to cut things down a little
bit the price gets cut down too which is
which is probably the right thing for
them to do in order to get into more
hands speaking of honorable place we
have also the honor play was announced
at Eva now what we have here is another
phone trying to blast into the gaming
segment and as this advertisement is
you're probably seeing on the live
version right now it says it's crazy
fast and crazy smart
now the karin 970 is the processor but
it comes with something called GPU turbo
now my favorite part about the way the
honor play well as sort of marketed is
that obviously samsung was using
fortnight as their game in order to
markets the galaxy note 9 but in this
case they've gone ahead and gone for the
complete other side of things with a
competitor and now this is the fun if
you want to play pub G ma which is
pretty hilarious and I think it's really
awesome one thing I do like about this
phone though is that honor claims that
you can go for a whole season of a TV
show I wish that they said what TV show
that might be but apparently the battery
is gonna be able to last for quite a
while gaming segment phones and now we
have the honor play in the mix how do we
feel about the honor play you guys I
still don't know what GPU to vote is yes
I've message people from honor I've
asked for a white paper they've sent me
just a bunch of slides so it's just like
a rehash PowerPoint that didn't really
teach me anything that said there are
some improvements when you actually get
down and tested the 917 years a very
capable chip and this is more of an
affordable device as honor devices
typically are so it's actually really
you know it's a compelling package it's
interesting that they're using pub G to
advertise that it's actually very
interesting and like I see that before
tonight and pub G they're both being
just used by everyone trying to push a
gaming four on a phone that can do
gaming they'll feature in their
marketing material and stuff it seems
like a very compelling package and at a
good price big battery big screen
powerful specs it's you know it the 980
is coming really soon so have a nice
evany at the end of the cycle is perhaps
not ideal but it's still for the price
it's it's actually really compelling
still it's one of those moves that helps
the phone's stay as affordable as
possible but I wonder if that the desire
to keep an honor phone affordable kind
of cuts it at the knees because for
example and I'm asking you Stephen and
Jules about this do you think that for a
phone that's trying to have pub G mobile
as its marquee videogame you have the
970 which is fine but then is it cutting
yourself at the knees by having
something like four gigabytes of RAM
only 64 gigabytes of storage because
these games that they're hoping to use
require a lot of RAM and they also
require a lot of storage space
I mean I think Patti definitely is some
it definitely is a bit of a
disappointment from if you're hoping to
have high resolution games with high low
resolution graphics at the same time if
your juice if you're locked into one
application you're not really gonna be
pushing up to 60 bytes quite yet you
still can make by with 4 gigabytes
forgive its I ran there via bytes of RAM
Gabe it's with off you're not but I
think they'll actually be ok with for
you weights I just I'm more concerned
about the battery the 3750 is big but
it's not massive for the screen size for
a similar screen size and for the GPU
yeah
it's about you know very powerful GPU it
could be quite the Buried ringer yeah I
know they said that they'd have the
ability to watch a full season's worth
of a show but that's it really GT heavy
that's nothing coding right yeah talking
about lost always said like first season
of The Walking Dead which is like a mini
episode yeah Sherlock something like
that um one thing I find interesting
here is that there's there's there's
this feature that they have the 4d smart
shock kind of like the HD rumble on a
switch yeah in a way yeah well what does
this even add to like games are not
necessarily tailored for a vibration
feedback to begin with so what would
this even do for you I mean even with
the need to have this sort of haptic
feedback that's going to take up more of
that - Henry - yeah you know just keep
that going so and with the pub I like
what else is it going to work with just
pub G which I'm sorry that you couldn't
get the fortnight partnership but hey
the way to react with that but yeah like
I find it kind of a doubtful I don't
think it is necessarily have to have it
in my hands to test it out because if
it's not approached in a thoughtful way
it's just gonna feel like some random
shaking is happening and or maybe it's
gonna be no I want to really hate this
but it's like when you're winning if you
have the rumble pack on or you're
winning Mario Kart and then you get
first place and then just starts
continuously shaking for like ten
minutes after you win yeah and then
that's a pretty funny situation now one
thing that I do wanted to touch upon
before we go into our next topic honor
has a pretty strong foothold in Amazon
and apparently this phone we have no
information as to whether or not this
one is even coming to America personally
again I think they're cutting themselves
at the knees because honor is one of
those sought after phones because of its
affordable price point on Amazon yet
we're not getting the honor play I mean
pub G Mobile this is where pub G mobile
lives here in the US so I'm a little bit
worried about that okay so let's go and
move on to it yet another company who
announced another version of their
flagship device a little bit like the
way blackberry did HTC has announced it
is now officially the u 12 life now
naming conventions aside HTC does like
to use the word life quite a lot and
usually this means that it is the lower
tiered version of the flagship device
so what we have here is an F HD plus six
inch display at 18 by 9 aspect ratio and
this time the Snapdragon 6-3 6-2 Slyke
in the key to it also has four or six
gigabytes of RAM however and we also
comes in storage variations of 64 to 128
the rear camera is a duo 16 megapixel
and five megapixel shooter at F 2.0
aperture and the battery has a 3600
milliamp hours in its capacity now there
is one thing that a lot of people have
touched upon when it comes to this phone
and all of the videos I've seen coming
out of Aoife the fact that it looks very
pixel like yeah I got that two-tone back
and I don't even know is that glass at
the top I'm trying to hit the create
glass yeah ah just like really glass the
HTC did like not really they didn't
developer manufacturer I don't think
that's the word but didn't they sort of
build the original pixel so it kind of
makes sense then they have this design
aspect coming in did any of you guys use
the life phones
from HTC over the last couple of years
mm-hmm no there's it was available at
t-mobile and direct from HTC yeah okay
they're surprisingly reliable I have to
say like it's it's one of those phones
that because of because of generally of
the price point like right now we have
European prices at 3:29 and 349 but if
that translates to America that's a
pretty good price and you know what for
the performance I got out of the u.s.
six gigs of ram for 349 euros like but
there here's the question though like um
where where is HTC like in the ashkelon
of in the in the vast spectrum of smart
phone companies where does HTC land with
you guys cuz this is this is a question
that I've heard asked many times
everyone has different opinions and now
we have HTC still making phones out
Aoife how to help where do you where do
you land on HTC right now mm-hmm well
Stephen and I are big fans of the HTT
ten we both do cell phone a while I
don't know what Stephen thinks I've
personally grown really the solution
with uh HTC they've kind of moved away
from some of the things that I liked
most about their designs and that said
if I were to judge it eh well do you
twelve live in a life in a vacuum it
looks really nice like it's got that
pixel aesthetic but it's got this shiny
glass cover and my only disappointment I
don't know it's not an Android one
device I think they'll be perfect
Android one device you know I've been
hearing that a lot lately Android one
not being on on quote-unquote affordable
devices I guess they're synonymous in a
certain type of way but I've heard a lot
of people say that if Android ones not
at the helm of it and it's kind of you
know there's a bit of a loss it's
interesting perspective I've been
hearing a lot lately
Stephen any thoughts on HTC or the you
twelve or the you twelve life well I
mean the problem there is just pure
worried about updates people don't want
to be something some old soft version
without the latest features without
delays the ability to play all the
whatever apps or anything that requires
a new version that's
it's a bit at this point see a low-end
device that normally wouldn't get
updates not beyond Adrienne one where my
client updates right and H sees Austin
as Maria saying she's spitting and Billy
step back it's a ways from what they
were doing before
even with HT 10 which I use until the
battery died there was there are things
from the HTM 9th I missed it didn't have
the motion eject the gesture to turn on
the camera by just going the volume
button and turning it it didn't have
certain features and it feels like they
were replacing a lot of those very
useful features with things that don't
really have the same usability do you
know I'm squeezing your phone's you
imagine if you're able to squeeze HTC 10
with those sharp edges those chamfer
edges you just there she hit 10 had like
the biggest chamfer the whole time - oh
for sure you can call them champers
their bevels
there speaking of which the back in our
chat for this live there are a few
people who agree that the HTC 10 is a
very fondly remembered device goran
petrovic my 10 is still fine battery
replaced two more years easy we also
have ten-hut saying that the m8 he had
the m8 rather and misses the boom sound
speakers I kind of agree with that to be
honest yeah I remember the first time I
heard the boom sound speakers I was at
the park and I heard this is very loud
music and I thought that someone was
carrying an actual boom box but then I
realized he just came from a tiny phone
I'm like oh it actually doesn't work
nice yeah what was what was the
mid-range version of their phones back
then in the m-series was like the m8
mini minis and and they were really
watered down they had the places they
had the meaning the one the one that is
interesting yeah
[Laughter]
alright so as is the as is sort of the
trend at Aoife right now what we have
are variations of already existing
devices and LG is continuing that trend
with two g7 variants
the first one is called the LGG seven
one which is an android one smartphone
so there's android one coming back this
one however is powered by the Snapdragon
835 has four gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage it also has a quad
HD Plus display that 16 megapixel
shooter on the rear and is powered by a
3000 milliamp hour battery also even
though it is an Android one device it
still has all of the features you would
want out of a g7 apparently with the
milspec and also a quad dec even has an
FM tuner that's pretty awesome for for
an Android one device it's pretty beefed
up and then the other one is the g7 fit
which when I heard this name I thought
okay I wonder what we're going with this
it's powered by the Snapdragon 820 one
has the same amount of RAM a 64 gigabyte
version and it doesn't really change the
fact that they are identical in size
what do we did fit this fit mean
mid-range is like is that what we're
going for
normally yeah fit devices or something
are the super durable extra water since
device samsung s active series yeah you
accused me of most about those the
processor why yeah one do you have that
many left over are you better off for
this point your truth you press from
scratch so why they 21 remind me real
quick is the 821 the one that kept
overheating cores 820 is a DEA pen Oh II
did 10 that was okay yeah maybe they do
just have a lot left over who knows but
calling something that g7 fit it just
really is weird and that 64 gigabyte
version has a fit plus and it seems like
they're really they're missing the
market in terms of people who want like
a rugged active phone in a way so maybe
it could be plastic yeah hmm so you know
what my speculation is on this is that
okay so they launched the LD g6 with the
Snapdragon 820 one because Samsung was
hogging all of the eight thirty fives
for its Galaxy as aids yeah that's the I
think that was it and they basically but
they they were like the last ones
because like they were in like the phone
the chipset
launched all the way back last year
and it was coming to the end of its like
mainstream life in April which was when
the LGG six launched so Qualcomm was
probably probably like hey we have like
20 million units left have them all at
this very discounted rate thanks very
much
so I feel like that was like the the
period for Qualcomm and just LG is like
okay what do we have to deal with these
yeah yeah and Mario any thoughts on the
Android one edition in this case I think
it's great I think it might be the best
Android one phone out there actually
like the inner one has been relegated to
mid Rangers but if you look at the a 35
it's still a very capable chip that's
not at all for then any mid Ranger that
I've seen an Ender one phone and you get
the premium design you get the LG
features it really depends whether they
market this a safe flagship or very
cheap flagship or like an expensive mid
Ranger if it was an expensive mid ranger
as opposed to a flagship of any of them
the nomination I think that would be a
good package because you get like my
main issue with LG is always the
software so having an Android one phone
and perhaps perhaps just better updates
because their update center hasn't done
anything they've they've just talked to
talk they never walk the walk so it
could remedy some of my biggest problems
with LG if it's done right so I'm
actually I actually like it even with
the outdated processor it doesn't really
matter to me that much well there's
always that software question but I
think there's a good toss up in their
chat here from DJ Jones I am commenting
this on a g7 right now does that mean
that we should expect roms that allow us
to flash Android ones firmware on
existing g7 so I think that might be a
little bit of a stretch but if any of
you want to take that that's a hell of
an idea I think yeah I don't see why not
actually I mean if I mean if you if you
phones travel enabled and if you get one
of those G sevens the lucky ones are
bootloader unlockable
truth be told I having kept track with
LG's bootloader unlocking stuff just
because it's been a mess or so long I
possibly yeah you just follow the Fred
Foley the Florham of your device and
hope for the best and maybe ask around
and see if anyone's considering
developing that it probably really
should have gone for a different name
other than fit that's really the one
thing I'm thinking here but I will give
LG a little bit of credit if this is
their ploy to move away from the
thinkyou weirdness and maybe that maybe
that's okay can you imagine if this was
the LG G 7 think you won oh speaking of
the term one being used in a lot of
places apparently now we're going to
have the Motorola one all right so after
the introduction of China exclusive
Motorola P 30 the International Inc
global version was supposed to be the
conversation moving forward and
apparently the Motorola one may be the
answer to that question now it doesn't
contain too many of the specifications
but what we have here is basically a
four gigabyte of RAM phone with the
snapdragon six to five expandable
storage at 64 gigabytes 3000 milliamp
hour battery along with Motorola's turbo
power charging which is always nice dual
camera system something we're going to
expect pretty much in any phone moving
forward even when they are mid rangers
for the most part 13 megapixels with a 2
megapixel secondary headphone jack which
is awesome and it is Android 1 even
though it comes with the version 8.1 now
there is another version of this the
Motorola 1 power
Wow yeah Motorola one power does have
upgraded specifications this time it has
the now common at least ID first
Snapdragon 636 has the 4850 million let
me say it again
4850 milliamp hour battery for goodness
sakes
it does get updated cameras but however
this is not fully fully confirmed yet
but it has a 16 megapixel with a 5
megapixel secondary rear camera and a 12
megapixel front ok maybe the main story
here is the fact that the Motorola
power even exist with that thick old
battery yeah yeah well like he's
supposed to have the day off today but
freakin Brandon minimun has dropped into
a chat I think the design of the moto 1
power looks gangsta plus huge battery
double hearts over there so yeah like um
there's a great combination going on
with the Moto 1 power does that mean it
automatically gets the buy
recommendation over the Moto 1 hmm well
the moto 1 is using a very crusty
processor at this point I the 6:25 just
keeps proving that it just won't die
anything it just won't die for a reason
because of that you know reputation for
good being it's super that's true it is
a very superb but I mean it is a battery
superb just because it's got an all
power efficient core configuration which
at this point you know we've moved in a
manufacturing process and we have da 55
which is a step up that said it's nice
that I like I like that it's sporting
such a nice glass design and a knotch
screen which you know love it or hate it
it is kind of a premium feature or at
least it was a few months ago at a very
affordable price it's almost very weird
to me that there's such a design
disparity between two phones at one is
glass that's the outdated processor and
that has a newer processor but it's like
metal more like rock door or thicker and
beefier I think they're both okay I
think that the price might be a little
bit higher
considering that specs wise it kind of
cannibalizes their Moto G line a bit but
you know it depends whether they want to
target the Moto G people and try to lure
them would nicely the signs even though
that last Moto G's had very nice it's
nice - yeah
Steven do how do you feel about Moto's
direction especially under lenovo like
for anybody
quick shameless plug I did do a moto
xiii review here at PocketNow so make
sure you check that out but one of the
one of the points I made in that video
is that Moto definitely doesn't seem
like the company we remember back in the
X days so Steven how do you feel about
now the Motorola one being the latest
step in that direction
so us it seems a little bit like they're
trying to find themselves again they
they're trying a whole bunch of
different tactics they've got the ones
line they've got the G line doing some
different things they brought the X line
back for a little bit
they're trying out to see what they can
do with the atom batteries and stuff
with the aect with a dead lion they're
going all these different directions it
doesn't seem to have one unified path to
it hopefully they'll find a good path
for cuz I've loved some advice in the
past but I'm not sure which direction
they're gonna end up settling in yeah
I'm a little bit skeptical myself
because Motorola one the way that it
looks the way that feels just sort of
like the general feel behind at all it
does it feels less moto and more Lenovo
than anything else and I remember when
moto was when they were excuse me when
they were acquired by Lenovo I kept
thinking to myself Motorola is what
we're gonna get in the u.s. Lenovo is
gonna be what we get everywhere else but
it just kind of doesn't seem like that's
been the case anymore
all right so oh sorry go for it I am a
little curious about the one power
though I'm really wondering how thick
the device ends up being with that
battery cuz we've seen some ones that
end up actually not being that correct I
mean you'd expect it to be thicker with
the larger Barre but we've seen quite a
few times where some of the really
massive battery films in it being only
like 11 12 it no one meters thick so I'm
curious will end up being that way cuz I
haven't seen any hard specs for that
it's true
yeah I just got a funny image in my head
of somebody just holding like a power
bank and this is my phone this is not
even a screen oh boy okay so from
Motorola we move into Sony and Sony
always uses Aoife as a as a wonderful
place to just announce some new phones
whether or not they actually make it to
a lot of markets remains to be seen half
the time because Sony likes to like
change up the phones a little bit when
it comes to the carriers in the US so we
don't know what's going to happen with
this particular phone this is the X z3
also naming conventions be damned we
have the X z3 right now this is this is
without a shadow of a doubt a flagship
level devices snapdragon 845 a quad HD +
display with the triluminos and the ex
reality mobile
technologies underneath yeah before
giggle I believe this is their first
OLED bravia OLED : yeah yeah oh that's
awesome
so it's triluminos and it's peel that so
it's probably our our bgb doesn't refer
to the three colors that they're using
it per pixel on LCD sub pixel every I'm
not sure actually especially well I
think it's just branding from show it's
just like this stuttery mid point that
I'm just exacerbating for the dramatic
effect yeah just forgot what the
branding came from orginal yeah they're
just continue to use it even though it's
yeah yeah that's true
well one of the one of the interesting
things with this latest Xperia device
and and I think I think it was Jaime who
said he predicted it and he was right
that the latest Xperia phone that would
be announced would not have that that
massive 48 megapixel sensor you know in
this case we have the rear 19 megapixels
motion I so where would we where might
we see that next
IMX sensor I mean I'm just wondering
where that might end up going we might
not see the phone it might be an it
might not be used in a different type of
device that's and just never amania me
you never actually end up seeing usage
in phones yeah they do canvas other they
itself a security can't really stole
them for all my other applications it'll
be see what I did happened with it yeah
yeah I mean we had the what what was
that the the 4k display on one of the
previous experience and that kind of
didn't go anywhere
yeah I mean do current I'm not your you
are ISP guys so would would the spectra
even be able to handle that much
resolution um I'm actually not sure I
think it should be able to handle it but
you may not be able to do really fast
burst or anything like that right it may
require down sampling like the Sony's
used to back in these at three days yeah
so just for to clear things up here the
snapdragon 45 has
Dule 14-bit ISPs and support for a
16-megapixel so that's photo 32
megapixel single camera okay yeah so so
that's that you know that's often uh
they're often some bottlenecks that
people don't associate with the sensors
themselves such as a data transfer
speeds or like lately they've been doing
embedded memory on the sensor itself so
there's like also like those processing
limitations that sometimes hold back
these new technologies the generation
even if you get like much better say
frame rate on a new sensors frame rate
capability so if you get much higher
resolution or whatnot sometimes it's
it's got to wait a little bit for the
ISPs to catch up well hopefully we see
that since we're coming at some point
whether or not it's in a Sony phone a
couple of questions in our chat real
quick is the X z3 water-resistant indeed
it is it has IP 65 or 68 ratings and
also I saw one here just a second ago
okay Shawn Vega valets I'm not Villas
I'm not going to actually say what the
comment was but it was commenting on the
the look of the phone and I kind of just
wanted the I wanted to give of just one
thought like okay experience owns they
tend to have very similar designs from
year to year this one kind of looks I've
seen this before the one thing that I
have to comment on that finger provider
looks kind of low don't you think yeah
very low yeah I have no idea what the
what the the thought was there from Sony
to put it so low because this is gonna
dis gonna result in more drop phones
than anything else all right
my just cameras too cuz I subconsciously
I would that's why I would put my finger
yeah that's true I think it actually
might be higher than it looks I think
it's just really tall phones we can look
extra low but it definitely is a bit low
even then yeah but even then it's like
at the center of gravity of the phone so
so even if you hold the phone kind of
like Center a little bit you have to do
some damn I still holding this you have
to do something
still holding that ask
you see just can't let go man just can't
let go go no I've have a feeling I have
a feeling that the engineers over have
sewn you were like this is where the
balance is that's where the balance yeah
exactly that's where the fingerprint
reader will go all right so a name a
name in the smartphone game that you may
not have heard a whole lot for a little
bit is ete now we have the X on 9 Pro
and as Anton routes here at pocket now
it's supposed to be a true multimedia
flagship so we have a full HD Plus
display take that for what you will if
you're looking at a multimedia phone but
it does have the snapdragon 845 6
gigabytes of ram 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage and that panel is an
AMOLED display so what we're looking at
here is ZTE s return but of course the
number one question here is how do they
bounce back from all of the controversy
that happened especially here in North
America is this going to is this going
to do it for them do you think mm I can
almost hear you shaking your head is a
very big controversy we're talking like
the US president got involved kind of
big you know even it's just for Twitter
which I mean that's a prime way of
involvement anyway well that'd have been
crazy if like he tweeted what he said
about ZTE and then on the bottom it's a
tweeted from it CTE I mean it's an
interesting phone that the action 7 was
the sleeper hit that everyone keeps
comparing this to yeah this is a very
different phone like there are some
definite downgrades
in terms of resolution there's definite
ground downgrade to 1080p there's no ID
phone jack for a audio for an audio
centric phone there's the bottom firing
speaker that's still you know for the
purpose of stereo but it's not the same
as to front-facing speakers to me like
the most interesting oldness wireless
charging a bigger battery those are nice
things but to me the most interesting
bit is what they're doing with the
display so to those listening who don't
know what they're doing they're
including an RGB sensor that would
measure the color temperature and just
the general ambience of where you're in
and then the display would be adjusted
asked to compensate for that color
temperature in order to bring you the
best viewing experience kind of like
true tone I guess but more focused
towards a nice viewing experience not
necessarily an accurate one and then
they're doing some frame interpolation
so that if you play a 24 to 30 frames
per second video it will fill in the the
frames to make it run at 60 frames per
second and that's a SAS DP footage well
I mean it's interesting I don't look
like a soap opera yeah I mean it's
interesting I don't think it's very
useful like everything that I would want
to watch us 60 frames per second it's
already at 60 frames per second anyway
and there's probably some very virtual
our artifacts going on but I do
appreciate that there this is something
we haven't seen included or anywhere
else for a kind of media centric phone
it's interesting yeah yeah I do you
think that the full HD display is kind
of knocking it back where do you land on
where do you guys land on screen
resolutions do you immediately kind of
scoff at the lack of quad HD
I mean I'm currently using a full HD
phone so I'm okay with not having super
super high resolution but same time I
can see that it's lower I visit Lee
without even having a second phone
nearby to compare I can still tell
that's a 1080p phone but it's not so
much an issue that's bugging me if it's
come as a trade-off comes with the right
savings and the right
improvements elsewhere it can make sense
okay I don't know whether this is a
forward backward or lateral move from
ZTE because you have to remember the
axon 7 came out 2 years ago and there
was a gap year in between and since then
the only time that ZTE has been in the
news is because of this whole debacle in
politics between the US and China on
trade and with this this yes I see I
love that no one quite remembered
exactly yeah well axon Mario would would
know about that I guess thank you for
reminding me there but yeah like I was
actually there for the freakin
launched a man was complete memory Hall
exactly but like even like but that was
still like around the same time because
that was late last year right and that
was when this whole ginning up with the
political machine started so like there
was a whole bunch of them stuff and then
you know earlier this year the the
bottom just fell out so at this point
this is an exercise of rebuilding it's a
shape we saw this in pre briefs at CES
and but we didn't know exactly what
would happen beyond you know when we
heard about the news that everything was
you know going down the drain and that
the imports ban was being issued you
know yeah I think this is maybe a safe
move a safe I mean at least this amoled
at least there's a decent battery inside
and even with the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack getting out of the game
well I actually am not sure about that
but Bluetooth technology is all the
better for me well my personal take away
from this is uh it's it's just it's just
a hot take you know I keep looking at
this photo of it and I want to say that
I'm E's hand obviously it's it's got
some real g7 vibes to me and I don't
know how I feel about that personally
like it just doesn't really seem that
much different to me as the way in the
way that the axon 7 did and I think that
that might uh that might not that might
not really work to their benefit this is
a freaking stupid comment I just wanted
to highlight it I'm sorry um Shawn Vega
villas and his Trump uses a ZTE Melania
Huawei and their son Baron a oneplus
family of Chinese speaking of our
comments there I love that the the live
chat is kind of moderating itself a
little bit but I will answer this
question on the air Donnell Paige asked
what's the price of the Exxon 9 well
only German availability is available
right now but it will go for 649 euros
which translates to a little
under a little under $800 in the nose
but who knows if it will come in the US
that's the thing no that's another
important part that I don't feel we have
touched on it's just the fact that
there's a big price disparity between
what the oven was $400 yeah yeah I mean
that was part of why it was such a
sleeper hit because it was so affordable
exactly yeah I think Stephen knows is
that what you were going to touch on
yeah I actually three things that was
one of them second was that I mean yeah
I know everlaw pill like the accents of
his design but it wasn't really unique
design it it took heavily from me she
sees design at the time there come on
the triangles were like the best things
about it right
I will admit when I was talking about
the design of the x17 that was it was in
my head like yeah so that's very much a
QC style design dual front speakers that
was very much an HEC thing at the time
it took heavily from it those were good
aspects that we wanted to see more
almost made it memorable there we were
miss having triangles not the dual em
the dual screen of the I was about to
say ZTE take a take note I'm not too
worried about it looking like other
phones that's not saying that okay sorry
that's et's really losing compared to
before what I was curious about though
is how their quality control is gonna be
to surround seven I had multiple friends
that has to return the phone after
buying it because they ran into issues
either was charging or with the speaker
stopped working sure the microphone not
working anymore or a couple other things
like that and now their quality control
team have had some time off kind of bad
or better and yeah they were they had to
face in garage no I was about to only
say that they were they were trying to
fix a urinal in place of what they were
yeah sorry yeah I was bummed I was gonna
go with they got government they got
government induced PTO in any case we're
gonna go ahead is gonna be our little
bit of an intermission let's go ahead
and pay some bills in our break
this episode of the pocket man weekly is
brought to you by jamp now a program to
help you set up manage and protect your

now to start up your free account today
that's je a mmmph
com slash pocket now I'm gonna we're
going to do this in vivo because of
course YouTube is such a beautiful Beast
could you pick up the last bit again so
that I can edit that in oh sure sure
yeah all right live live for all of our
live alright
best of all it's pretty affordable as a
listener to the weekly you can set up
your first three devices for free each
device after that is just two dollars
more a month head to JAMF dot-com slash
pocket now to start up your free account
today that's JAMF dot-com slash pocket
now perfect okay so we have a couple of
new faces on the show today I do want to
make sure we do a bit of a check-in and
also just a bit of a bit of an
introduction I mean you guys have
already been adding to such a great
panel today so let's start off with
Mario over there once you give our
viewers a bit of introduction to
yourself okay well frequent readers of
XDA probably know me I was editor in
chief at X da from I think 2015 - up
until early this year so it's quite a
run mostly specialized in big technical
articles and I still write those for the
site beyond that I'm a mathematics
student University of Minnesota
senior year doing my last year
specializing in AI
machine learning and I don't know I have
a really cool cat I guess that's pretty
and a broken fortunately yeah well I'll
get a new one just a couple hours oh
there we go do you know what the funny
thing is that broken espan it kind of
looks like when you snap a pencil and a
half all right don't you let the viewers
know a little bit more about you yeah I
I've been right for XDA for awhile
joined back in 2016 almost exactly two
years ago actually I think my first
article isn't like the 29th of August
yeah congratulations on your second
revival anniversary I got to go to
Google i/o twice well with X it's a ton
of fun outside of XDA I'm a senior
financial analyst for a venture capital
firm Pharmaceuticals wow that really
your second exactly all right cool Jules
how things been since last week so I'm
Jules and I've been the pocket now for
four years and I don't know exactly what
I'm doing here but hey I'm here so yeah
it's been a pretty fun week it's been
pretty hot being Bermuda highs be damned
I shall be rid of you soon because fall
is coming
are you still are you done traveling
like are you back now or I'm back for
the next few weeks just got ahead to New
York for a show I think it's a show
stoppers thing or something but yeah
that's pretty much it unless you know
Brandon needs to drag me down to
Philadelphia for that fair enough
Brandon if you're still in the Chad he's
he wants that beer alright so one thing
that I wanted to do as part of our
check-in or read not really ask for our
chicken but in this little mid break
that we have okay
all of the phones that we had in this
past segment in this last segment before
we get into sort of the bigger like I
don't know it's it's hard to rank all of
these but that's what we're gonna try
doing so far out of everything that
we've that we've
looked at now Jules has here that we
wanted to do the best three but what is
something that you're really excited for
at least up until this point I think
that's where I'm going to put that well
I'm excited for a more injured one I'm
not one of those stock Android
evangelists that you know like there's a
lot of that in kind of the reviewer
community that it's like stock Android
or bust but that said I think it's a
good fit for mid-range devices just
because they're always having the
performance issues and the security
update issues and if you have mid-range
devices are updating faster than
flagships and that kind of put the onus
on the OEMs to really speed up their
security patches floor of their
flagships themselves so I'm excited for
everyone yeah all righty
how about you Steven yeah well what are
you excited for so far what jumps right
out at you partly what thing only mesh
so far they mostly say for one directly
want the stories itself it was the focus
on battery life I actually love large
memory phones the majority phones is
also you don't get me through the day
I'm really happy to see multiple phones
focusing on battery life right now and I
hope this trend continues yeah fair
enough
and then finally Jules yeah I'm pretty
happy about the spread that we have
today and obviously we'll be getting
more as the weekend progresses I'm just
again I'm just happy that there is a lot
of options that we see here that are
prominent that are something that
consumers can actually consider as
something that they can drive their
lives daily with them as opposed to
previous years where we've just gotten
short shrift on mid-range phones or
phones with like this little quirk to
them like these are all saleable phones
at your stores or your carriers or
whatever so I'm pretty glad to see that
happen in 2018 go at least for me I just
I'm happy that we're not having think
you all over the place anymore so I'm
gonna stick with it but if they were
going to go for a fitness slash active
centric phone let's call it the g7 gains
just do that g7 Kido yes she's an Aikido
exactly Lokar of lifestyle okay so what
we have coming up in terms of games as a
new processor coming from Huawei see my
segue to a point today come on
we have always just announced like
literally like I woke up to this email
this is the here in 980 so what we have
here is a brand new processor now the
cure 970 has already gotten a lot of
great press it's it's it's well known
for having wonderful performance now the
19 he just aims to really just sort of
up the ante in that case it's the first
to feature arms cortex a 76 cores and
also there is the Mali g76 GPU in terms
of graphics and I'm sure a lot of people
are going to be really happy to check
that out in terms a fortnight and Club G
Mobile moving forward or there's also
the dual NPU so they are going to be
doubling down in a sense on their AI
technology and also that dual MP you
will also be used on top of the ISP as
used for photography
any thoughts I'm sure I'm gonna go and
refer to our much more technical people
on the on the panel here thoughts on the
Kiran 980 whoa do I have thoughts it's
this is a very interesting release for
huawei the one of the reasons why we've
seen while we kind of remain
quote-unquote behind Qualcomm even
though they usually launch a little bit
earlier and thus get a bit of an
advantage in terms of CPU performance
for instance one of the reasons was
because they were still behind in some
areas so for example the one of the
reasons why the hiring 970 was behind
the current snapdragon 845 in terms of
cpu performance is because that
processor was built on TSM C's 10 and a
meter as opposed to Qualcomm's 10
nanometer I mean Samsung's 10 nanometer
and also there's the that the fact that
I was running a 73 course which were
older now though we expect the next
during on a 45 a 55 sorry
to have the their course a Creole course
based on a 76 core so it would be the
same kind of core baseline as the new
current chipset and also we expect them
to be built on the same Senate in an
immediate process so there's gonna be
more of a parity the reason why we see
Kwame touting a something like 75
performance increase over the last
generation it is precisely because they
were a little bit behind and something
similar goes for a GPU so there they're
coming up with very very large
improvements and they also have some
their Flex scheduler which should allow
those course to be better adjusted to
very particular workloads I mean
absolutely multiple tasks multiple types
of different intensities at the same
time there you go there you go and
there's also the fact that they're doing
something really interesting for the
first time we see a big middle little
setup in the sense that we have two big
powerful a seven a 76 course clock that
I think it was two point six years and
then we see another two a76 scores that
are clock lower I believe it was uh
still somewhere that Jews right yeah it
was not it wasn't one point ninety two
yards and and they also have different
voltages so they are not just like lower
clock they're also operating at a
different price power ratio absolute
performance power ratio and then you
have the a fifty-five which are the
power efficient course so you have this
structure set up we have two powerful
two middle which are still very powerful
and then the four efficient and this is
something new that's enabled by arms
dynamic IQ system which would was
promising this kind of level of
flexibility in the core arrangements and
we're now really seeing this come to
fruition so that's on the CPU side GPU
wise we also see a gigantic improvement
the the new Malley g76 as I think is a
30% higher performance density which if
you confer if you compare the highest
configuration of the MAL g72 which was
the type of GPU that the carry Knight
970 was using with the
of the g36 which is a kind of GPU the
90s using there's a 25% peak performance
difference however the Chiron GPUs the
the the Mallee GPUs do not come all
created equal
Qualcomm usually have some more powerful
ones because they they feature more
course in different frequencies whereas
huawei's is always opted for kind of a
more middle the real configuration
that's never been asked powerful so
that's kind of why we see Exynos GPU
performance be higher than the current
GPU performance but both still lower
than the Qualcomm CPU performance the
audrina this time because at a higher
performance density we have just 10
cores as opposed to 12 of last year's
GPU but they're much more powerful and
we've seen something like I think was 46
percent improvement in GPU performance
in something crazy like a hundred and
seventy five percent power efficiency
improvements which is really what they
need it because those GPS have been just
terrible for I have a story I'm getting
here is that there's been a lot of fewer
reference pieces being drawn in and more
of the customization going on I wonder
if as Steven you can cover some of the
back end here in terms of the NPU in
terms of also the ISP yeah so it's
definitely gonna be a big step forward
for why wait for what way hopefully
it'll find uses in the actual devices
themselves hopefully we'll see some more
interesting camera stuff like they were
doing with the P series but the big
question for it my quote in my case is
what else are they gonna try and do with
the phone I think sorry with the
processor I think at this point the cure
and I maybe is that level where it's
actually powerful enough to be used in
ultrabooks and stuff like that I think
we may actually get when we're if they
want to they could put out a cure in 980
base Chromebook or even a Windows 10 on
arm mate book of which is always
branding for their laptops so a you can
see what to do there and if they can
integrate it with Cortana and all that
other stuff that way and Google
assistant on the Chromebooks they think
there will be some definite uses for the
MPU with all that extra machine learning
processing that is being used by those
voice assistants yeah that's still love
that's still a distinction that a lot of
people have to make is that's machine
learning /ai
whether or not they're the exact same
thing but having a dual NP you all up in
there is like you have you have a lot
more processing power and as far as the
ISP is concerned it's able to it's able
to recognize so many more at a much
faster rate which is kind of cool I mean
but that's that's something that we're
gonna have to see moving forward I will
say though that the the AI and the
camera of the p20 Pro it's still
probably my favorite version of it or at
least until now the Samsung one's not
bad but even Samsung knows not to use
certain terms like AI yet yeah yeah yeah
they definitely kind of like put it in
like the print of like their marketing
materials like oh it's a I base scene
detection something something to keep in
mind regarding AI is that ultimately the
NP you and even welcomes DSP in terms of
AI itself they see very limited
implementations now we saw while we kind
of tout the offline translation power
through Microsoft back in previews
releases and we obviously feel this
camera stuff right but the truth is that
ultimately it the it's the
responsibility of the developers and
kind of the the the spotlight is on them
in order to actually begin utilizing
these very powerful application specific
modules in these chipsets because
ultimately those bits in the processor
they're not doing something special per
se they're doing compute they're doing a
very fast vector math and a matrix math
they're doing a lot of operations per
second it's just more arithmetic but
they're doing they're doing it at a
faster rate they're specialized for that
kind of arithmetic and they're doing it
at a much more power efficient point so
that's the thing with this kind of whole
AI mbu's like I I'm very excited about
this stuff obviously like I wanted to be
part of my future right
but at the present time it's something
that hasn't really materialized in a way
that kind of makes the marketing points
really resonate and really translate
into something that arrives to the
end-user experience and that people can
actually be excited because something
like a 30% boost in CPU frequency it
will have a noisy B frequency CPU
performance it will have some
trickle-down effect in your day to day
user experience it might be minimal it
might not be depending on how its
implemented with the software but
something like mm P you sure you can you
have two of those things it's all
parallel math anyway so you get pretty
much a two point two if they get I think
they got two point two X improvement so
you basically double the that
performance yeah for sure but it's still
like you're doubling performance of
something that is very fast in the few
things that it's being used anyway and
it's not being used for enough things
that it is yeah I had a feeling that we
were gonna have a really good discussion
on the 980 when we had you guys on I'm
glad to know that I'm right that I was
right as I I love the deep dive into
stuff like that now unfortunately we are
going to go from a super high powered
processor and so on that might not be
quite as powerful the mediatek helio
found in the latest blue device what we
have here is blues on is this X I or 11
plus I wants a Olevia there xi it's
there a lot of generation thing and you
never know these names oh yeah but
that's their xi vivo thing going on at
blue and it comes at a point where
they've decided that there's been a
whole bunch of damage that's been done
to their brand over the course of the
years they started out with this
unlocked phone mission and they've just
been spamming through the industry for a
lack of a better term in terms of giving
out all the these models so a little
statement from CEO Samuel Oh have I
aziah in here since we started this
company in 2010 it was always our
commitment to provide customers with the
best devices at incredible pricing along
the way our obsession with free
frequently launching new devices became
excessive and eventually a dent there
was
way we could support so many different
models with software updates after sales
service spare parts accessories and
other important parts of the customer
experience what it would expect of a
reliable smartphone brand we all make
mistakes
the important thing is to learn from
them improve and move forward that's
what they've been doing there at blue
and hopefully this is just a touchstone
this is only a point at which we can
observe from at this point but it will
have to see we will have to see if they
follow up and provide those updates so
for this phone they're saying that March
2019 Android Pi is coming they're
starting off at eight point one we'll
have to see and I know it's it's late
March March 2019 for pi but let's see if
they can make this promise because the
blue life one that I tested all the way
back when I first came out came along
here did not get it scheduled lollipop
update so yeah that's that's something
to walk out for well we're jumping
through a few of our last topics here
just some quick thoughts even if they
are going to release fewer phones in
their cycles are you excited all about
the latest one that there no sorry no
but blue has been just so off my radar
and I mean we we've written stories
about blue phones on the portal I've
edited many of them but it's not
something I particularly care about and
I think that most in the enthusiast
community don't particularly care about
that either fair
Steve how it is uh yeah I think it's the
change that they have to make their
whole thing beforehand before now was
that they were making it easier to get
those cheap Chinese phones and have them
localized to your current region and in
true now you can get those cheap Chinese
phones directly please Express that's
what and even on Amazon so they need to
make an extra step in that support life
they want to be able to keep rebranding
those phones and a great point yeah
mm-hmm yeah cheap Chinese phone it's not
oh sorry Steven no quicksaving uh I
think this one had 60 bytes of RAM for
280 that's not too bad
definitely not to be a before the
six-four 400 I think it was yeah well
you don't really have to expect that
this next phone is going to be just a
cheap Chinese phone though that is a
phrase that can be knocked around a
little bit show there's a Chinese phone
a Chinese phone I'm messing up but
definitely it is uh well depends on you
right yeah to get ahead of a lot of the
announcements that have been coming out
of Eva it feels like a lot of these
phones that now have sliders built into
them whether they're motorized are not
be solid they all seem to be motorized
but I wish they weren't all motorized
Xiaomi has announced or not announced
but also I kind of just unveiled maybe
give a bit of a peek into their next
device the me mix three now we have I
think it's pretty safe to say we've all
been fans of the me mix line it's done
some pretty great things it may not be
the perfect device but it does some
things very right and it's a memorable
phone is this one going to be as
memorable as the rest and now that it
has a rather Oppo find 10 like design
with that camera array that pops right
out of the top any quick thoughts and
Hut takes on this one you guys it looks
like it's the whole backslid of anything
yeah now it looks like the top display
part is moving down to make room for the
cameras
and I think you know in terms of you
know the whole engineering part of this
has been a big debate in terms of moving
parts I personally think that if there
is a passive element if you can move it
without doing damage to the internal
mechanisms that's fine but in like if
you can feel it if you're working
against motors when you're moving it
around I'm sorry pass yeah put the
motors away like give me back the
sliders from like old you know I think I
think the the magic one might be manual
they D that the honor announce also the
honor but I think yeah I'm pretty sure I
read that I think I think oh yeah yeah
so yeah that's the new thing right but
the thing about the thing is that the I
mean if someone has consistently been
doing this whole minimal vessel thing
right it's been
show me with this particular line of
phones so I actually do want to see
whether they can keep outdoing
themselves and now outdoing the
competition because the next is really
impressive it's turned a lot of heads
even if it's motorized and some people
are doubtful about how long they'll last
and how fickle how finicky it might be
it's interesting to see that that it's
not it was not just the one off that
vivo did right it's it's something that
other OEMs are adopting as well you know
it's not like a concept car right and
that's exactly yeah exactly yeah and I
have to give show me a lot of credit
because it's their phones consistently
at least in my estimation as my world as
a review over the last five years that
it's it it seems like their phones are
the ones that you just can't really it's
hard to just bash it out right you know
like it's hard to do that it always
leaves a lasting impression so that's
that's something that I really enjoy
with that Steven had a quick point this
seems like a much more sturdy
implementation of the pop-out camera
than some of the others also
I remember the oak OEM one from a while
back the moveable camera he will
constantly break it it's a worry for a
lot of the other pop-out camera ones
this one seems like a more sturdy
application of it yeah definitely
alright so as we're rounding out our
stories for today we have ourselves one
final story about smartwatches and it's
about where OS where OS apparently is
going to be getting a bit of a UI
updates and the question here is about
whether or not this is going to actually
give it the revival that it needs now
one thing that I do want to give a bit
of a back-end thing we are seeing
processors getting improved to the point
where smartwatches could probably be
more practical lasts a little bit longer
on top of what might be coming from
Qualcomm and Samsung moving forward even
though Samsung focuses on Tizen what I
mean is if the if the innards are
getting better while the software make
all the difference for example the fact
that in the UI you can only swipe maybe
just one time to get to all of the
different items rather than having to go
through the entire entirety of the UI to
get to your tasks that's one thing that
I think is great
you also have kind of a Google now feed
over to the left
that will allow you to get straight to
it just like on a smartphone so where do
you guys what do you guys think about
where OS in general and do you think
that this is actually going to help it
out hmm
well I use wear less pretty much every
other day I actually have the Fosters
gagin full cell phone watch just really
nice and and then I also use the gear s2
when working out but to be honest like
it's Jimmy is just an extended
Notification Center so I don't actually
care much about all the other things
that it can do that said yes more more
Hardware will enable them to do more
things in the sense that it's not that
they all the processors were not strong
enough to do it this it will still be
very basic interfaces but they'll be
able to do it at a more efficient kind
of power consumption point so they can
do a lot more I think with the upcoming
chipsets and I mean I'm interested to
see like whether if they really optimize
the UI to make it simple and fast
whether I'll be using it for other
things in just a notification center
true yeah I think notification extension
is like the main function of a
SmartWatch how about you guys drills and
uh Steven yeah same here I might be
using a Android wear Tizen SmartWatch
right now I'm still on a show me and me
band right now okay come on the three
cool yeah right now they were easy until
now we barely store too short for me and
I mean having swiping on the main screen
change the change the display itself
seems a little bit of a waste of uh bit
of a waste of a function it I hope that
now with the redesign it will be a
little bit more useful and work a little
bit better and maybe have a bit better
barrier Lahey
yeah there's no number one thing that we
all need final thoughts from Jules
before we sign off I'm actually looking
forward to ditching wear less entirely
and going with this new Nubia thing that
was post well I'm about to post it but
it was the like it's a flexible OLED
strip that's taller than your wrists are
like longer than your wrists would have
four usable space and it's interesting
what they have going on there
they announced that at Aoife there's a
video you should see it pocketnow.com if
not you know right after the live
broadcast or later on if you are
listening to this offline yeah all right
well we ended on some smartwatches and
on that wearable notes we're gonna go
ahead and call it on this show for this
week remember that the weekly is just as
much a conversation as it is a show this
one went a bit longer because there's so
much news coming out of Aoife and even
outside of Aoife a little bit in the
case of Xiaomi and blue but make sure
your voices are heard either in the
comment section down below or by
emailing us at pocket cast at
pocketnow.com you can also get into
social media and tag the podcasts on
twitter with the hashtag pn weekly I
want to give a big special thanks to
Mario and Steven for joining us on the
show today
we do Mischa Jaime but you're probably
eating a lot of course and drinking a
lot of beer so maybe we don't miss you
that much as for our personal social
media handles Mario is a tech young gun
yeah yeah that's the one TAC hy o n GU
and Steven is at okay so are the hyphens
part of this handle here okay so s zi m9
- there we go that's s zi m9 - over on
twitter pointed jewels as always of
course found at point in jewels and I am
of course JV tech T I'll make it easy
for you I love tech and I love drinking
some tea a quick shameless plug if
you're looking for a little bit of note
9 coverage I did do my review over on my
channel at youtube.com slash Josh over
Carla so if you are interested in that
you can head over to my channel for that
and then look forward to the ultimate
review coming down here at pocket now at
youtube.com slash pocket now of course
pocket now is also found on Twitter
Facebook Google+ and YouTube in English
and espanol where you can find more news
on the daily and also at pocket now add
audio every weekday Jaime's been doing a
really good job doing that even though
he's on the road we're also on on
pocketnow.com for all your mobile tech
needs we also would really appreciate
reviews and ratings through Google Apple
stitcher podcasts or wherever you happen
to be streaming us from without them we
wouldn't be able to make this show for
your eyes and ears for 320 weeks
straight
that just hit me
now with that we will go ahead and call
it on this edition of the weekly thank
you so much for tuning in take care and
we'll talk tech again next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
