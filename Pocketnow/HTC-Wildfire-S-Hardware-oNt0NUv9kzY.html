today I've got the HTC Wildfire s to
show you it's a really really cool
little phone and I think you're gonna
like it let's go ahead and get this in
the unboxed okay so before we get
started a big shout out to t-mobile for
providing us with this review unit 2 to
test and to show you it's very very cool
as such the the stuff that we're gonna
tell you is our own so don't worry about
t-mobile trying to influence us other
than than providing us with a
specification sheet everything that
you're gonna see here is purely us so
let's go ahead and get this thing open
and take a look at it first of all we've
got a very nice lift up box nice design
here very good-looking phone over on the
side we've got some branding we've got
some what's inside over here on the back
some very quick specifications and a
whole bunch of fryin print like you're
used to and down on the bottom just
t-mobile branding on the other side of
that box is a sticker with IMEI
information so let's get this open now
there's the phone nice and pretty set
that aside for a minute and see what
else we have in the box of course we've
got a nice white colored HTC wall wart
with u.s. prongs and a USB port on the
other side just like we've become
accustomed to it does have a matching in
this case white USB cable with the the
nice rounded white edges and corners I
really really like that it's just an
extra level of finesse on it even a
white little rubber band there now this
is white because the phone is white the
phone is also available through select
distributors in black as well so when
it's not your thing you can do that I'll
show you that in just a minute and I
think you'll kind of like it so inside
this little box we don't have to open
the lid or anything there they just kind
of slide out is our return label so you
can take your old phone put it in the
box slap a label on it send it back for
recycling or repurposing this is
something that t-mobile does that I
really like next we've got a start guide
formerly known as the QuickStart
Gide but tells you a whole bunch of
stuff one thing that it doesn't tell you
okay so look through this really quick
yada yada yada right here tells you
about the SIM card detach the sim from
the bigger card okay good enough
pull the back cover away from the phone
and remove the battery that's it
step two is very ambiguous and you'll
see what I mean in in just a minute kind
of crazy but remember that step two yeah
pull it off okay and last of course
we've got the terms and conditions
return policy limited warranty in multi
languages okay you guys didn't want to
see all that in that much detail so
let's get onto the phone this is the
phone now the first thing you're going
to notice there's the Wildfire here's my
g2 this this is a ridiculously small
phone it's teeny looking at it on edge
you can see it's about half the
thickness of the g2 about the same with
a little bit narrower but the big thing
there is just the overall length just a
huge amount of space has been eliminated
from this device of course the the
Wildfire s does not have a keyboard like
the g2 does but it's not supposed to so
what does it have let's take a look of
course you've got your nice very
reflective screen on front you've got
nice capacitive buttons on front but
there is an absence of a trackpad or a
trackball you'll notice that first and
foremost that means if you want to have
fine precision control over your pointer
you're gonna have to have a keyboard
that has the arrows on the bottom of it
now or just be really good with your
fingers I've got big fat fingers so it's
hard to get precision that's why I like
my trackball I don't think that's going
to be a problem let's keep moving on
here so down at the bottom you'll notice
we've got our menus it's in the same
order as on the g2 which is very very
good I hate it when devices switch
around the menu items you notice they've
gone with the new kind of stylized
buttons
they're pretty much the same menu on
mine says menu this one is just the
three lines in the past that used to be
a longer line with too little in lines
underneath it to infer that it was a
menu
now as a house without any eaves whereas
my has eaves and a chimney isn't that
quaint so moving back to the Wildfire s
we've got t-mobile branding on the
bottom we've got HTC branding on the top
we've got our microphone excuse me our
speakers up here on the top moving
around to the top of the device we've
got our multi-use headphone jack a
little notch there that assists in
taking off the back of the phone
remember I told you about that yeah
we'll get to that in just a second and
then our power button over on the side
we don't have a dedicated camera button
at all over there kind of interesting
down on the bottom we've got our speaker
or shooter on our microphone holes over
on this side we've got a micro USB and
our volume rocker which feels really
really good I might add
now while we're here let me go ahead and
plug in the micro USB just so you can
see how that fits it's a very nice fit
really snug when I get into it all the
way it feels really really good so I'm
quite impressed with it over on the back
we've got our camera now let's get into
some details about the camera because
everybody's interested about that first
it does not have a front-facing camera
just a rear-facing camera and that
rear-facing camera is it's really pretty
good it's a 5 megapixel camera it's got
a 3x digital zoom on it and you guys
know I don't really like digital zooms
all that much it does have that LED
flash autofocus the camera app that it
comes with has face detection and very
shooting modes you're familiar with the
HTC camera so we won't go into too much
detail there we've got our rear speaker
back there on the back very simple
branding HTC with HTC Sense this is
running Android 2.3.3 so not quite the
latest version of the OS but it it's
running since 2.1 so that's a little bit
dated now so kind of interesting there
now i'm going to try and get into this
back panel see if i can do it
remember step two that said just take
the back off not as easy as you might
think
you've
really got a it's tough alright guys
take my word on that so let me go off
camera and get my little tool here and
we'll be right back alright so once
you've gotten this initial separation
done and I would recommend using a
plastic case tool to do that with which
you know what most people don't have so
if you're gonna get this phone make sure
they do everything you need to at the
store where they've got those tools but
once you've got that separated just run
your finger along the seam and it
separates it nice and then you can
easily lift the phone out now that's
where things get interesting you'll
notice down here there's actually a
recess that the phone fits down inside
just like that this is the first phone
that I've seen that's done something
like that and it's really really a nice
way to go it holds the phone securely
and it also gives an option for not only
the manufacturer but others to make
third-party accessories for example if
you wanted to change this to blue if
there's somebody out there that makes it
a blue case wrap for it you can just do
that pop it in snap it in place and now
you've got a blue phone versus the white
one that you have now now I did mention
that black is available through select
distributors so if you want black
instead of white you can do that stock
or hopefully hang out and see if there
are some replacement options out there
for you but very nice and it holds on
very snug it's them a metaphor that I
like really well having met that little
lip that sticks down in there
one other thing you'll notice in classic
Android style and it has a little uplift
to it so you've got the Android chin
right there kind of cool but let's get
back to the phone so down here we've got
our battery let's go ahead and take that
out and take a look at it it's an HTC
branded battery and if we look at this
it's got a 1230 milliamp hour capacity
so not huge but for such a small device
it should be just fine
plenty fine in fact a little bit larger
than most the sim card that's in this
way to get it in and out you simply
slide up and that unlocks it and then if
I had better fingernails I
I would be able to to lift this out
there we go just like that and then
simps out just like that put that back
in and lock it back in place down here
you've got your SD card now this is not
a push to eject this is just a pull it
comes with a Samsung 2gig micro SDHC
card or micro SD card rather to get it
back in you just push it in and you
don't have to worry about it locking in
place because it just slides in place
now that is not accessible from outside
the device which most SD cards aren't
anymore so if you want to get at it
you're gonna have to take the case off
and I would also recommend taking the
battery out just because the way we use
our SD cards today as app storage and
whatnot so that's the the device it goes
back together very very easily put that
back together put that back together and
overall a very nice very small phone
that I like quite a bit how small 3.2
inch diagonal so it's a really small
screen but it fits really really well in
hand it feels comfortable it feels nice
it fits perfectly with the contours
right back here you've got the rounded
back so I like it quite a bit now this
is just the hardware side of the review
because honestly it went a little bit
long and showing you all the details I'm
trying to get that back panel off make
sure you tune in for our software
portion of the review we're gonna do
some some benchmarks and some tests
we're probably going to skip the first
boot because it's HTC Sense 2.1 which
you've seen before so very very common
common first boot sequence we may still
end up doing that but make sure you
subscribe to our video channel if you
haven't done so already so that you can
make sure you know when that comes out
if you haven't told your friends about
this giving the video a thumbs up is a
good way to do that because it shares
your your likes and really your dislikes
with with your friends and the people
that are following you on YouTube and
various social networking sites so make
sure you do that as well and of course
we're going to use this primarily as my
daily driver
for the next few days here and we're
gonna do a thorough review on it here
coming up very quickly so make sure you
have got pocketnow.com on your bookmark
so you can come back and see that full
review as soon as it is out showing off
the HTC Wildfire s for to mobile for
