pocketnow.com in our first unboxing
video of the samsung wave we only
briefly touched upon what bada is is an
operating system so now we're gonna do
is we're kind of going to give you a
basic overview of the navigation through
the system kind of give you a tour what
it can offer that sort of thing we're
also going to show you the email
application in the camera and video
recording application let's go ahead and
get to that alright and we're back and
one of the main points of this video
here is just gonna be kind to give you
an overview of the bada operating system
on the Samsung Wave now as I've said
before Samsung actually created this
operating system from the ground up to
kind of revolve around what they wanted
it to be so I'm gonna go ahead and swipe
to unlock the screen here now it's gonna
be kind of tough to tell but basically
the way this operating system works is
you're gonna have screens so this is the
first screen here second screen here you
can see there's actually a number up
here at the top that actually
corresponds to which screen that I am on
so second screen third screen fourth
screen fifth screen you can do up to ten
screens and the way you can add more is
you can just keep adding widgets to here
these widgets are just like a widget on
a different operating system you can
just come right through click which one
you want drag it right onto the screen
itself now it's gonna ask you this is
the BBC player so it's gonna ask you to
kind of accept the offer accept the
terms and conditions more or less in
from here you can keep dragging this if
you want you to the next screen over
there's also a very cool way you can do
this as well you can turn on the side
here there yet if we go into the widget
mode you can turn the actual screen on
the side here and this is going to give
you a almost like a card type view of
all of your pages and then from here we
can keep going over then we can add
another screen another screen it'll go
up to ten screens total this is where
you can also erase the screens did you
see if we go all the way over to the end
there is number ten so ten screens total
I'll go in a little further so you can
see little bit better ten screens total
for this guy now one of the things you
probably saw and I'll actually go back
to the the normal view one of the things
that you likely saw was
my homepage very simple when I press the
down button here
I left my homepage simple for a few
different reasons one there
unfortunately aren't very many widgets
available for bada currently it is a
very new operating system it's actually
brand new so there's only so much
customization you can do with it so on
my home screen here I have the Google
search the Google Maps with the mail
sliding over I have my gmail from there
I have what's called a daily briefing
that's gonna be the Samsung daily
briefing it's built right in once again
to bata basically gives you some options
such as whether stock quotes AP Mobile
which is The Associated Press so for
example if I come here and actually
press this article there you see the
daily briefing starting right up so now
I can actually pick a news article here
it's going to load the website you can
see this is the browser functionality
it's going to load the website here and
here's the article now it has
pinch-to-zoom multi-touch built right in
so I can zoom it very very smooth as you
can see and I'm all set you can also
double tap to zoom right back out but
again you pinch to zoom in and out it's
very smooth and very very polished now
what you can also do is press the end
button here to go back to your home
we'll keep on swiping we're gonna have a
calendar the Samsung Apps itself which
I'll also get into this is basically
your most visited and so on and so forth
now I will give you a little overview of
the widgets that are available currently
just you can kind of see them off I'll
actually swipe through so we have the
network info birthdays days themselves
clocks I will skip a few the friend
updates the buddies that are online now
with the chat and that sort of thing
once again the BBC yellowpages.com
the wallpapers Music Store dual clock
etc etc now I'm gonna go back here one
of the main things about this operating
system is going to be the notification
bar reminds me a lot of the web of West
notification bar now if we swipe this
down here it's gonna be right here at
you can tell the Wi-Fi is on soon also
give you the quick buttons for Bluetooth
in the silent mode and it's telling me
currently that I have one notification
which is gonna be for the email so I can
actually clear that if I want to but
what's very cool about this is well
press the end button and we'll press the
center button here which
bring up the main menu for all of your
apps that you have on here as you can
see we have logs social hub music player
etc etcetera is actually about 2 &amp;amp; a
pages of apps on here by default the
main some of the main ones is actually
take notice on our Facebook and Twitter
and YouTube which I was going to for the
next video right now however what we're
going to do is gonna go into the music
player it does have one song on here
which is the samsung beyond song and i'm
going to start playing this song i'm
gonna go ahead and close this the song
is now playing i press the end button
here brings you back to the home so i
can go into a different application cuz
if i can press mail here it's now
opening up the gmail that i can go into
the gmail.com is that using the app the
main thing here to see though i can drag
the notification bar down once again and
i now have the music player built right
into the notification bar so i can pause
the song right in the actual
notification bar that is very smooth
that is very slick something that you
know android and a lot of the other
systems need in my opinion that's it's a
very good offering some of the other
ones again I'm gonna go back by pressing
this home button here we're gonna go to
the settings just to kind of give you a
brief overview of what these settings
allow you to do I don't see you have
options like flight mode connectivity
the sound profile is display and the
light now the display I only have the
brightest right now at 6 it will go up
to 10 which is very very very bright I'm
going to turn it back down you can
change your theme I only have one theme
on here right now you can download more
though from the app store or from the
Samsung store which I will show you on
the next video but for now we're gonna
press the cancel button to go back you
have your general settings which are
going to be anything from the type of
keyboard the language the touch control
is the notification types that sort of
thing as well as date/time applications
widgets for example one of the main
things that I want to touch on though
are going to be applications here so
these are your application settings
calling messaging email etc but the main
one that I want to touch on is the
Internet as you can see here we have a
preferences button
I don't think Intel right there but that
says run flash that is key I'm gonna
touch on flash on the second video for
the software overview but that is very
nice the fact that the browser has the
ability to run the flash based on that
preference I will warn you ahead of time
this is not on by default
I had actually go in and turn it on
myself gonna press cancel again here
again you have your Samsung app these
are basically all of the application
settings once again social networking is
big because we do have once again the
Twitter and the Facebook integration
which I will show you security
memory about the phone itself which
would kind of give you the system info
shows you that it's about a 1.0 and all
of that fun stuff
also tell you how much battery is
remaining and the CPU usage I'm only
using 1% here just kind of being idle so
I'm going to go back be memory as you
can tell here it's checking the status
how much free memory there is right now
this is simply phone memory there is no
card in this phone as of right now
another feature I do want to touch on is
the camera now I took a sample clip
earlier with the camcorder which will
actually record if I press the Settings
button here will record and up to 720p
if you'd like which is very nice so
momentum press this back arrow right now
I'm gonna play a video that I have
recorded earlier by plugging the play
button down here in the bottom right
corner now I took this video of my dog
chasing after a ball I'm hoping this
camera will pick up the clarity of the
720p and need the color accuracy I'm
going to press play here this is to show
the frames per second with this camera
now as you know he's gonna throw it one
more time he'll see him run by angry no
this is this was taken at night with
indoor lights however it wasn't exactly
the brightest in the area that it was in
as you can see there's a little bit of
stutter in the playback however the
quality is just phenomenal the playback
quality of that video is phenomenal I'm
gonna go back into the camera here we do
have the ability to put the flash on I'm
gonna go into the camera now by pressing
this top left button here now we're in
the camera mode and you can actually you
can tell right there press and hold
screen to focus we can actually click
here it'll focus on this area I can
press up here it'll focus on that area
now we have an auto focus it's already
on you have macro you have face
detection now I I will tell you the
macro actually better yet let's give you
a test right here we have some small eye
actually the best buy receipt right here
now holding this close looks pretty good
if we go to macro here we can actually
see the writing from this camera on the
actual phone itself if you can actually
read the Best Buy receipts writing which
is held pretty close to the phone by
turning on the macro you're able to get
a lot however you know it's a little bit
blurrier this far away so what you do is
you just press the autofocus settings
and there you go it's back to normal you
can adjust your exposure levels again
you can do your flash you can do on/off
auto open on let's take a quick picture
as you saw it's a pretty bright flash
you do have your shooting modes you can
you continue this vintage panorama
there's a lot you can do with this
camera you can see we have a resolution
button as you can see it's pretty high
resolution especially on a phone set as
high as it goes that's the five
megapixels right there now on this thing
I do want to touch on within the ibadah
operating system is going to be the
email support in the email integration I
personally am a gmail user as you saw
earlier I actually have the Gmail widget
here which now has all of my emails in
it however if we go to the menu button
here in the middle I usually use this
email application here it's a little bit
easier for me
now I haven't actually gone through and
fixed all my emails yet as you can kind
of see let's say we scroll down here
just pick any random email let's pick
this one from play on so by default the
email is not going to actually download
all of the information all the HTML code
it's just going to give you the
recipients in the subject which it's a
little annoying a little I'm just
puzzled why they would do that so you
have to actually go into the settings
here go to settings and this is
basically where you would actually
enable it to download the attachment and
the HTML code by default now viewing the
emos you can see here is actually fairly
nice you can do pinch-to-zoom just like
on many many phones out there nothing in
particular but it's a very fluid
operation the moving left and right
again once again it's very very fluid if
you want to reply just press the apply
button we can do all we can do just the
sender I'm gonna do just the sender
because for some reason they put
everyone in there and now I can go ahead
and type Ramage picking anything random
and as you can see there it is giving us
the auto predicted these spell
correction so that isn't the strongest
with this phone it's a little slow at
times but it does happen when you need
it to which is good one thing I do want
to note is also the push email at least
for Gmail is not supported off the bat
you have to actually go in just like the
downloading of the attachments and
manually configure it so again a little
puzzling as to why that is it is very
capable of doing push with all different
types of email including Gmail in
exchange however I had actually go in
and search for it myself and find out
how to do it bada as as a whole is a
great start for Samsung what I will do
in the next video the press the middle
button here I'm gonna go over some of
the other aspects of bada which is gonna
be your social networking so I'm gonna
go over your Facebook your Twitter of
course I'll touch on YouTube as well and
then some of the games this is gonna
come with asphalt 5 on here by default
there's also many many more games which
I will go into and then I'm also going
to talk about Flash and a little the
browser itself the browser is a very big
piece to the bottom system and it's it's
unproven at this point and we're really
going to kind of analyze that and see
how it works so once again everyone stay
tuned if you like this video give us a
thumb
but also subscribe if you're interested
in seeing the other videos of the
Samsung wave and many more to come
