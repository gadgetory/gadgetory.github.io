it seems the HTC Radar today's view on
October first and rumors of SkyDrive
enhancements for the near future all
this and more coming up right now hello
everyone I'm hi metal you letter with
pocketnow.com and welcome to Windows
Phone view the show we wrap up all this
week's good and bad inside the world of
Microsoft's Windows Phone platform let's
start this week off with what's good
well as of when we film this video there
was still no official memo but it seems
that windows phone mango was being
launched in Taiwan as of today launched
rumors headed for September 15th and
that data's come though we're still
gonna tag it as a rumor until we get
something in black and white but so far
mango is the most anticipated operating
system of the year and trust me when I
tell you it's worth every penny
Microsoft has even begun their marketing
campaign to lord developers into pouring
their applications to the Metro UI so
hopefully it's only a matter of time
before we see mango in our handsets
officially rumors also have it that HTC
is preparing for the launch of at least
one of their mango handsets 4th October
first and that's going to be the HTC
Radar uk's phone for you came on record
to confirm ability carrying the radar at
the state in the UK and while this is
great rumors for those who are planning
to get one it's also been listed as
coming soon an orange UK so rumors do
hold water ironically HTC's based in
taiwan and based on the previous segment
it's just weird to see that even though
most probably mango was being launched
today in taiwan well hcc hasn't really
mentioned anything and speaking of
Windows Phone releases AT&amp;amp;T has just
confirmed that they'll continue being
the flagship Microsoft premier carrier
for releasing devices they've just
announced their fall line above devices
and yes it does include the HTC time
that everybody's anticipating and that
we were able to demo in the IFA event
now for samsung we also have a refresh
for the samson though we haven't
actually seen it it's the samsung focus
s and hopefully that S stands for a
galaxy s design and aside from that it
seems that they'll also bring a samsung
focus flash though not sure what to
expect on designs hopefully it comes
really soon and hopefully a TNT comes up
with a date for these long
speed of HTC it seems that they'll be
building an attentive phone feature to
their mango handsets if you remember
those old features that came with HTC
sends on the old windows mobile devices
where you could just flip the phone and
turn on speaker or actually just mute
the ringer when you were pulling it out
of your pocket or actually mute the
phone completely well this feature
apparently comes to the next mango hands
it's coming from HTC though it's sad
news for the rest of us that wanted but
apparently there's this application
that's also by the same name on the
marketplace that will bring these
features to other handsets though we're
not sure if it comes to HTC handsets
only or to others you might as well look
in the marketplace because apparently
it's not available for all regions
really cool features coming up hopefully
when those phone picks it up for the
future and while Microsoft keeps
competition fears it not only offers you
20 more free gigabytes of storage on
SkyDrive than I cloud for example but
you can also do with your SkyDrive
whatever you want I mean I cloud has the
problem that you're limited to only
specific applications using it but you
can actually explore the modifier file
explorer like you can with SkyDrive now
things might be getting better because
Microsoft apparently is now working and
this is just the rumor on allowing you
to have photos and office files
unlimitedly in SkyDrive meaning that
won't account to your twenty five
gigabytes of free storage this is pretty
much what I cloud offers to certain
features like photos but it's not
available for documents so hopefully
these enhancements will leave rumor mill
before mango gets released or a while it
does because 25 gigabytes of storage is
a lot and the fact that I could do
whatever I want with it is even better
well with windows 8 coming to develop a
preview many of us ask ourselves the
same question how will it integrate with
Windows Phone 7 if it looks like Windows
Phone 7 in every way well the Nvidia CEO
came on record to tell that windows
phone seven applications will actually
be supportive natively by Windows 8 just
as well when those seven applications
will work natively even if the UI is
pretty much different and it makes a lot
of sense given that Windows 8 is going
to work on a lot of different processor
architectures now another interesting
note and this is another rumours the
fact that the windows 8
Colonel will be ported to Windows Phone
8 in the future so it's really cool to
see that Microsoft is finally really
working on integrating Windows Phone to
their windows 8 application services and
just about everything I mean it's kind
of an irony the fact that when those
mobile in the past wasn't really that
integrated to windows as it is or it
will be in the future okay so that
doesn't for the good let's continue on
with what's bad rumors at the end of
last week had it that Samsung was
probably gonna drop Android from their
mobile operating system line up in order
to support some sort of Linux
proprietary OS for themselves and well
is not an Android show but the problem
is that apparently well it didn't make
sense apparently the rumors were caught
on and just dismissed and well Samsung
didn't really mention anything but it
seems that they will not be dropping
Android because it's free and it's open
source rumors have it that it'll be
dropping Windows Phone 7 and well those
are really bad news because definitely
well Samsung does a really good job in
bringing great designs and great phones
so obviously we are hoping that Windows
Phone 7.5 changes things would mango
because well we all know that sales for
windows phone 7 weren't really that good
last year and we'll mango is really a
game changer for windows phone 7 let's
just hope that sales figures are there
and that Samsung stays on board because
we are imagining a samsung galaxy as
designed for windows phone 7 in that
focus s hopefully and well these are
really good phones for the future
hopefully that's it for today showing
for a week full of rumors I'm hi meta
meta thank you very much for watching
and remember to give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
