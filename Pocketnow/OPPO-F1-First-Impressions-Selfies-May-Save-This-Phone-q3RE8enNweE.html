race this phones in is the one to get to
your pocket
I'm Jules Wang with pocket now here's
our first impressions of the Oppo f1 the
Chinese manufacturer is jumping into the
metallic mid-range mess for 2016 as it
competes with its cohorts from blue
Nubia plus both Huawei and honor the f1
comes into the fray with a sandblasted
metal alloy back panel coupled with a
polycarbonate shell it's a lightweight
and on the lower end of the
substantiality threshold but it's
altogether a phone you can easily whip
out and keep in your hand the screen
stands at 5 inches and at 720p it's
acceptable to the eye but 294 pixels per
inch
even on a 229 Giro phone is
disappointing to see at this point in
time the innards are literally one step
up from last year's pack a Snapdragon
six one six runs the show tagged to
three gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of storage
this scheme features a dual SIM tray
with a hybrid microSD slot so those of
you who want sell your flexibility you
won't have to weigh the difference in
storage another caveat here is since
Oppo is only offering up a phone and
select European and Asian markets he
won't be testing the f1 cell reception
it's also going to skew or battery
testing as well color OS 2 point 1 is
laid upon android 5.1 as with most
chinese skins it's as dent the forest as
ever with superfluity in this nook nanny
ism and that cranny and just a whole
bunch of stuff we'll say for the full
review there's no NFC no fingerprint
sensor no real frills for a phone edging
on the upper end of the price scale they
claim that Oppo makes the make up for
that point or at least it hopes it will
is that the f1 will be your selfie
expert the rear snapper squares up to 13
megapixels with a single LED flash well
an 8 megapixel cameras on a quarter inch
sensor marks the flipside so far as we
can tell the plain old pics are decent
enough but does the f1 live up to its
promise will you become a selfie expert
