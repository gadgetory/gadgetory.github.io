now calm in this video we're gonna unbox
something I've been waiting for for a
very long time light bulbs that are
controlled with Wi-Fi with your
smartphone there's a lot of possibility
here let's get to the unboxing so this
is called Philips hue and right now it's
an exclusive in the Apple Store the app
is only available on iOS devices
although this will be available on
Android devices and this product will be
sold in other places in the coming
future so the cool thing about this is
like I said these bulbs are controlled
via Wi-Fi on your smartphone but not
only that but the bulbs which are LED
bulbs which last for a very very long
time and are very power efficient can
change their color to 16 million
different colors which seems crazy but
there are a lot of really interesting
possibilities and we're going to talk
about that in a minute so let's take a
look what we have in the package by the
way this is not cheap at all this is new
technology and you're gonna pay for it
this kit which includes three bulbs and
a gateway to allow you to control the
light bulbs with Wi-Fi from a smartphone
app is 199 bucks and then you can buy
additional bulbs for $60 each yeah that
is ridiculously expensive it's many
times the price of a standard LED bulb
and most people aren't even buying LED
bulbs
you've got the compact fluorescent light
bulbs which are power efficient and then
these LED bulbs which are even more
efficient and they're a lot newer so
they're more expensive so let's see what
we have here kind of really interesting
packaging it gives you a really basic
set up scenario here one of the things
you can do with this is through the
smartphone app you can import a picture
so let's say you have a picture on your
wall that has the color of a sunset you
can actually make the lights have those
colors in them so you kind of create
this mood within a room or maybe you
want to have a light that is very
conducive to paying attention or
studying a very bright light that really
focuses and it's kind of like a natural
sort of sunlight I'm not a lighting
expert as you can tell but the the foss
they seem really cool here so let's just
take a look inside the packaging and
exactly what we get and by the way this
system can handle up to 52 lightbulbs so
if you flood it too you could put your
whole house on this and each individual
light bulb can be linked to one another
so you could press one button for a
party mode of one button for relaxation
mode and all of the light bulbs respond
differently throughout your house
whether you're connecting this to
overhead lighting when you're connecting
it to a lamp which is probably what most
people are going to be doing so we've
got a ethernet cord here interesting
alright because we connect the ethernet
cable to this guy which makes a Wi-Fi
mesh network for the light bulbs I can't
believe they put Wi-Fi chips and light
bulbs that's awesome
OSI Connect that's your router with the
ethernet cable and let's see what else
we have this is probably power adapter
yeah a power adapter so not much to
unbox here I'm kind of unboxing the
prospect of really cool geeky sort of
home automation these bulbs are actually
kind of attractive they don't look like
light bulbs out of the year 3000 I mean
they look like great regular light bulbs
and they've got LEDs in them a series of
LEDs to be able to make those 16 million
colors so I'm super curious about these
whether this is something that actually
makes life a little bit better or if
it's just a complete novelty and who
cares about having 16 million colors so
we're going to do a follow up video and
talk about how this system works again
this is an Apple Store exclusive for now
you can get it on apple.com and it'll be
rolling out to retailers other retailers
in the near future so let us know what
you think about Wi-Fi controlled light
bulbs if you have any interest in that
kind of home automation or if you have a
less expensive system that you're
looking at or thinking about or already
have leave us a comment down below it's
a little bit of a different video here
for PocketNow but it's related to mobile
because it works with a smartphone and
tablet app that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
