Samsung's flagship Galaxy phones how
does a company improve upon the note 5
well make it more like the Galaxy s7
edge like we saw with the galaxy s7
Samsung focuses on taking what worked
earlier this year refining it and
popping in and s-pen and following on
the heels of the s7 edge denote 7 feels
like a slightly more progressive
iterative jump when looking back at the
no 5 the rounded back of the no 5 is now
mirrored on front and back for a
symmetrically curved Gorilla Glass 5
device we have similar screen sizes and
resolutions with so many phones out
there with 5.5 inch screens the note no
longer feels like a behemoth the
tapering edges deliver on that illusion
of maximizing screen real estate as a
very early first impression though this
editor feels like the note 5 is a
slightly easier phone to keep a hold of
the flatter sides better for gripping
especially when used one-handed looking
at the specs the note 7 becomes
something of a lateral move from the
note 5 the Qualcomm 824 North American
note 7s and 4 gigabytes of RAM catching
up to the performance of last year's
Exynos chip set in discussing the
differences after the curved display the
next most visible change is the move to
a USB type-c port on the bottom of the
phone finally bringing Samsung phones up
to date on the next-generation cable
spec and here we can see the note 7 is
impressively a bit thinner microSD card
expansion returns this is still a handy
feature even with 64 gigabytes of
built-in storage our phones are
increasingly used for richer multimedia
consumption and creation shooting UHD
video should feel a little less
claustrophobic now over last year's no
and speaking of cameras the note 7 also
reduces resolution from 16 to 12
megapixels for better low-light
performance and incorporating dual pixel
technology for lightning-fast focusing
performance as span is spruced up over
last year's phone we get a finer tip and
more precise experience hiding to the
lifestyle durability this piece is water
in dust resistant and we were happy to
see that there are no pen gate issues
this year
the iris scanner is another feature
which sets this phone apart even on a
busy show floor it trained and scanned
faster than the Lumias we've used and
it's a best of both worlds situation as
you still have the fingerprint sensor
from last year's phone we thankfully get
a battery bump as we saw from similar
increases on galaxy esses and actives
we're confident this should improve the
daily runtime of a handset which should
be an uncompromising productivity device
though it is a bit odd to see an ever so
slightly smaller battery here over the
s/m edge and lastly it's just nice to
see water resistance on an open port
note finally while these wraparound
glass devices are far from rugged
there's extra peace of mind that a near
laptop expensive mobile gadget should
survive a splash or a short shallow swim
or plenty of note5 devotees out there in
our audience so there really wasn't a
lot to fix but we are happy to see the
same attention to the small details here
that we saw with the s7 launch in
playing with these two phones side by
side it's easy for us to predict that
the note 7 will be a top seller for 2016
it might not represent the same Vanguard
product it was when the first notes
launched but it maintains a charm and
uniqueness which other large screen
phones lack and we're always happy to
see progress we'll have more to look at
once we can dig in to the note 7
properly and run it through our camera
and audio tests as always thanks so much
for watching be sure to subscribe to
this channel for our full coverage on
the Galaxy Note 7 including camera and
audio reviews coming soon and a host of
phone comparisons for pocket now I'm
Juan Carlos back now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
