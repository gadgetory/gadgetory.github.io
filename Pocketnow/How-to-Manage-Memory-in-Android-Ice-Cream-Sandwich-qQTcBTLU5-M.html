pocketnow.com Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich has a built in task manager and
you might not even know it let's take a
look at it now now Android already does
a really good job at managing background
processes but I'm a power user and I
like to be able to go in there and
manage background processes on my own
it's just a thing I like to do so an
Android 4 points easier than ever so if
we go into apps here it starts off here
in running services you can see all the
apps that are currently running on your
device and if you go into show cached
processes it will show you the apps that
are loaded into cash so that when they
open they open faster but as you can see
here the browser using 44 megabytes of
memory how do we close that quickly well
you go into the Android multi task you I
hear you swipe it off the screen and
watch what happens browser will
disappear in a sec there disappeared
giving me forty four megabytes of space
back and of course you don't have to get
obsessive about this but if as you start
to learn which cached processes are
using the most memory you'll be
surprised at how high some get you can
start managing your apps a little bit
better by shutting down certain apps
after you've used them here through the
new Android multi task user interface so
just a quick tip on how to better manage
your background process is an android
4.0 again you really don't have to do
this an Android it intelligently manages
it for you but some of the control
freaks the power users will certainly
want to be able to have this capability
and an android 4.0 and super easy to do
that with the swipe action here in the
multi task you I if you liked this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now
