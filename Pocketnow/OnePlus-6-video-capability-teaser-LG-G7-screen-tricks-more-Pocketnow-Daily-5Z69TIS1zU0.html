in super slo-mo with the one plus six we
get a video of what we should expect for
the iphone se2 or at least we think
that's it and new leaks of the LGG seven
think you emerge along with features of
the infamous knotch I'm Jaime Rivera and
this is the best part of the week even
if I'll be working on the weekend enjoy
yours
this is parking out daily
the official deuce today don't begin
with deals actually it's the other way
around as Amazon Prime is going to
become more expensive very soon
currently I pay as I am an avid Amazon
Prime customer a hundred bucks a year
now it's gonna go up to 120 bucks a year
pretty much it's still cheaper than
going for the monthly rates is Amazon
Prime worth it
every penny at least for me but I don't
know in your case it could be different
now let's talk about the LG G 7 thank
you as a famous tipster evan glass is
providing more information first of all
the fact that the notch is there but
apparently LG is bringing in some
interesting ways to hide it I would say
that it's totally unique I hope it's
better than the way Huawei does it with
the p20 Pro which is actually an
inexistent solution if anything it only
causes more trouble you'll learn more
about that in my review but let's see
what we get with the g7 now how about if
we have a bad news of the day segment at
least for today kg eyes Michiko just
brought some information regarding the
internals of the next generation iPhones
and apparently Intel will be the
supplier of 70% of the modems Qualcomm
will only make 30% and bear with me here
it's not that I have anything against
Intel it's just Intel modems on iPhones
provide terrible results bad reception
terrible battery life and so if anything
I would have preferred Qualcomm to be in
charge of this and with welcome being on
top of everything that's 5g it only
means that the iPhone and 2018 will not
be ready for any of that but yeah we'll
see
and speaking of iPhones there is a
leaked video or a video that shows a
probably leaked iphone se - I will call
it a fake mainly because most of the
rumors claim that the iPhone se 2 will
be slimmer they won't have a headphone
jack and apparently less bezels and this
phone pretty much just looks like a
current iPhone se II and somebody just
put like a glass back on the back or
probably just the skin it looks more
like a skin to me but you let me know in
the
comments if you think this is real or
fake and finally the most interesting
news today have to do with oneplus and
the company's latest teaser for the one
plus six according to the company we
should live our lives in super slo-mo
that won't work in New York City by the
way oneplus but true to that obviously
this means that we will bring super
slow-mo technology and hey the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 is capable and that's the
chipset that's most likely coming here
so we are expecting this feature but in
today's question let me know I mean
regardless you don't have super slow-mo
on your phone right now you probably do
let us know in the comments do you
actually use that because I'll give you
an example like I have it on the you
know galaxy s 9 plus in the Galaxy S 9
it's cool but the biggest problem is
that it only lasts for a few seconds so
I honestly don't really use it but
that's just me leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion

news earlier follow us I'm fine no
