as Apple CEO to become chairman of the
board images of the expected iphone 5
begin to emerge and jailbreakme.com
founder comex gets hired by apple all
the sin walk coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi everyone and welcome to
the pocket nail I review the show we go
through all this week school and the
not-so-cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices this is a strange week with
a lot of more not so cool news and cool
so let's breeze through the cool and
then we'll start off with the not so
cool now images of parts of the supposed
of next-generation iphone have begun to
surface and it all sounds like I told
you so first of all the images of the
frames all point out to a flat back
iphone just like we have with the iphone
4 and at this point out that we also
will have a glass back though this one
does seem mat instead of the glary one
that we currently have so hopefully
we'll also have a glare less front for
the next generation device aside from
that the 85 chip is a given and it does
seem that the battery will keep the same
size and while we're all expecting a
larger home button and a larger casing
but that's yet to be confirmed because
the images could just be zoomed in for
the casing and that's really hard to
confirm now remember we are assuming
that apple will release two devices at
the same time hopefully it will be the
iphone 5 and the iphone for us or it
could be the iphone 4g in the iphone 4s
doesn't really know what moniker they'll
be following but we will most probably
be getting two devices and these images
can probably just be up the cheaper
iPhone that will keep the iphone for
design time will tell and continuing on
with rumor mill sprint is on the mix of
releases that will probably get at the
same time that the seamless sprint will
be getting both the iphone 5 in the
iphone 4 now what's really got us all
cooking is wondering if we will get a
wimax on the next-generation iphone or
if sprint simply won't get 4G because
we'll probably only get LTE rumors have
it that the next-generation device will
be a dual mode device that will work on
both gsm and cdma carriers but still 4g
is something that we really don't know
what to make of now
remember since September's in the air
rumors also have it that Apple is
already working on the ads that will be
used to promote the device most probably
that initial video that we got for the
iphone 4 and hopefully the same thing
that will be getting once the device
becomes public well iOS 5 beta keeps
cooking and rumors have it that Apple's
working on sort of an earthquake
detection technology for the japanese
market if you unable to serve as
apparently to let you know seconds or
even minutes before an event that
something is going to happen now before
you ask me how does this work no it's
not going to work with your
accelerometer or gyro I mean can you
imagine some people getting the alert
and other people not getting it well it
does seem that Apple all apples going to
do is connect the Japanese government
warning system which apparently Japan
has one of the best in the world to let
you know whenever these alerts come now
this will definitely be an attempt
against your battery life so it's an
option for you to activate it or not now
the sad news here is that it seems it
will only be available in the Japanese
market and it's such an irony because
Apple is currently residing in
California where earthquakes are also
common and it doesn't seem that it'll
make it to the Californian demographic
so sad news there
we've been very lucky to have brought a
few revolutionary user interfaces to the
market in our time first was the mouse
the second was the click wheel and now
we're going to bring multi-touch to the
market and each of these revolutionary
user interfaces has made possible a
revolutionary product the Mac the ipod
and now the iphone Steve Jobs has just
resigned this Apple CEO to become
chairman of the board you believe this I
mean according to Steve's resignation he
promised Apple that he would resign
whenever he didn't feel fit to fulfill
his duties and sadly that time has come
we're hoping that this has nothing to do
with Steve's deteriorated health and we
do wish him well now some of us believe
that having Steve as chairman of the
board is actually the smartest move in
corporate history see Apple is no longer
to have to be pushing things for the
board to have proven just make things
breeze faster because steve has promised
that he will still be working directly
in major product development so sadly
little history has proven that Apple
doesn't really do good without Steve's
micromanaging so we're not sure what to
expect Aston cook becomes the new CEO of
Apple so time will tell and let's hope
that things do happen for the best Apple
stock is currently up after it fell a
couple of points so things do seem like
it the stock market does buy into what's
going on as part of Steve Jobs
succession plan Tim Cook has been
appointed as Apple's new CEO after being
Apple coo for quite a while and well
Steve recommended it to the board and
they approved now Tim Cook has been
handling Apple ever since Steve Jobs's
had been having medical leave so we've
got really no discussion about his
leadership style or his capability of
handling the reins of Apple the question
is does he have the vision I mean we're
really worried about Tim Cook bringing
that same Steve Ballmer effect that we
see in Microsoft Steve Ballmer is a
really good business administrator but
you really doesn't bring any vision to
the products that they launch again he
just does a really good job in bringing
the stock up so that's really not what
we're looking for I mean we really need
somebody to continue bringing that
vision to Apple in the future and we're
not really sure to cook is going to be
able to deliver in that part now can you
imagine a Steve note being something of
the past and having Tim could bring a
Tim note I don't really see that and
finally 19 year old Nicholas Allegro
famously known in the underworld this
comics has just been hired by apple why
is this band well jailbreakme.com was
designed by comics and he was the only
person that could figure out how to get
an over-the-air jailbreak for your
iphone ipad and ipod touch through a PDF
exploit he's at the time the only human
being that's been able to bring an
untethered jailbreak to the iPad tues a5
chip so this could just give you an idea
of how grim the future for jailbreaks of
the next-generation iphone brie and I a5
chip could be in the future hopefully
you did pass on his secrets to somebody
else but again it's just really sad to
see him go thanks for everything for all
the brilliant work comex and we do wish
you well in your new internship and
Apple let's see what happens from here
on that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm Hyneman iveta
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
