pressuring European countries to comply
with the Huawei ban or risk their
relationship a lot of Google services
crashed the Sunday and Google is
thoroughly looking into the why and we
may be getting a ceramic 5g variant of
the Galaxy Note 10
faster charger it seems I'm Jaime Rivera
and yesterday was definitely the Apple
show I don't think I've ever been so
excited about an apple launch ever I
highly recommend you watch that video
for details
let's go through everything else this is
bargain out daily brought to you by the
one plus seven Pro the official news
today begin with deals as Samsung is
celebrating 10 years of galaxy and
they're actually doing so with deals
some of these good some of these not so
good for example if you buy a Galaxy
Note 9 or an S 10 Samsung is giving you
a year of YouTube premium and they're
also throwing in a free pair of galaxy
buds if you buy them before June 8th and
the companies also teamed up with Best
Buy for a $300 discount on s10 variants
but there's a catch you have to get them
on AT&amp;amp;T all before July 13 definitely
Galaxy phones are still great expect
some comparisons coming soon as these
continue to be some of the best photos
of the year now how about if we move the
spotlight over to 6g and yeah don't look
at me that way I know I made myself the
same face when I read the news cuz uh we
are barely launching 5g right now and we
already have LG launching their own R&amp;amp;D
department for 6g in Korea and now
Samsung decided to jump on this - not
exactly sure what these companies are
going to do and it's most likely gonna
take around 10 years for us to see
anything that has to do with 6g but as
Diego pointed it out and he makes a
really good point I mean it's all about
the patents and truly whoever gets their
R&amp;amp;D first that defines whatever 6g is
going to be is going to own the patents
now does anybody remember the Samsung
Galaxy home no I know I had already
forgotten about it too but I was at the
Samsung Galaxy unpacked for the Galaxy
Note 9 not for the s10 we saw the Galaxy
home which definitely looks a lot like
the eggs for me
and well Samsung promised this to be a
smart speak girl with amazing sound and
we saw so many of these at the event I
mean they look interesting they look
like no smart speaker out there
definitely not like home pots these are
more like furniture than anything else
think about it is well we don't have a
launch thing we were expecting to get it
at some point early this year now we've
got Samsung CEO claiming they were
supposed to wait until q3 2019 still
don't have a price tag I don't know what
else to tell you just yeah if you're
interested all two of you you can wait
it out and since we're talking Galaxy
Note let's move the spotlight as well to
the Galaxy Note 10 we've been covering a
ton of rumors we have a lot of
speculation and now we've got Geekbench
information it seems that there will be
a ceramic variant of the note 10 sort of
like what we get with the S 10 there are
two model numbers for different sizes
one variant with 12 gigs of ram which
could be the verizon ceramic variant or
something like the s10 5g that we've
already seen and then there's another
variant with 8 gigs of ram and we assume
that's going to be the non ceramic
variant probably the most interesting
part is the fact that we apparently get
a 45 watt charger in the box yes believe
it or not Samsung is finally moving away
from their old chargers which are I
believe click charge to and it's all
about the fact that you know Qualcomm
chips support up to a quick charge for
but then Exynos chips from Samsung don't
but Exynos news don't end there
apparently Samsung is actually bringing
a different Exynos chip for the note 10
which is weird this is going to be a 7
nanometer variant we'll see about that
this is the first time that we see chip
differences in the same year which is
great and for those of you that join me
in the frustration of watching well you
were frustrated over trying to watch
YouTube videos on Sunday I was
frustrated because I had two videos to
publish and we couldn't it took forever
I started at 1:00 p.m. and then I think
it was like it around 4:00 p.m. that
things got solved and well it's the
reason why is because Google really had
a big deal here
according to the company the issue
happened because of a configuration
change which was only supposed to go to
a small amount of servers and was
applied to actually a large amount in
neighboring regions that way Google
Cloud
stop using half of the network available
which resulted in congestion the issue
was quickly noticed but the congestion
also created service degradation which
slowed the engineering team to be able
to fix it
Google is now looking thoroughly into
what caused this problem but we don't
have anything official I hope it doesn't
happen again Google I mean you know
we've got a schedule to follow and
finally the hottest news that I have to
do with the Huawei band and what the
United States is doing with other
countries I think about it is I thought
that countries were sovereign states but
it seems that the United States wants to
apply their own kind of weight into
enforcing the ban right now Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo has warned German
Foreign Minister that Germany could be
cut off important intelligence
information if they let Huawei build
their national telecoms Network the
warning looks a lot like the one issued
in March as Pompeo says that Germany is
an important ally as much as France and
Britain are which didn't really comply
with the van and parva says that the
United States might take the risk
because the last thing that they want is
for important security information to be
on a network that they can't trust which
would be the one built by Huawei so it's
not that I'm saying that the argument
doesn't make sense it's just my god the
weight of the United States is trying to
pull over this ban is huge let us know
in the comments down below what do you
think do you think that this is
something that company countries in
Europe should comply with or do you
think that every country should decide
on their own because it's not like if
the United States is gonna apply
discounts or whatever or other 5g
services they could bring and this is
the interesting part I mean there are 5g
infrastructures being built by European
companies like Nokia and Ericsson and
still European countries shows Huawei so
that's it's getting kind of read
interesting I think that it shouldn't be
this way I think that every country
should do whatever is most convenient to
them but leave us a comment down below
