develop from pocketnow.com and now we've
got Brian again who's going to show us
the LG spectrum that was recently
announced tell us about it so we
announced this yesterday so this is a
android device running Android 23 the
biggest feature on this has got to be
the screen so I hope the camera is
picking up this has an HD screen 720p
resolution brilliant colors video looks
awesome on here so we honestly does look
amazing Wow yeah it's a level of detail
of that background there is amazing yep
so it's got i want to say 329 pixels per
inch pixel densities 321 pixels per inch
so much either zoom into that that's how
it looks beautiful yep so sports great
color reproduction and we've included so
we've got a couple applications designed
to take advantage of that great screen
so we've got netflix HD so you've got HD
streaming of netflix video over the 4g
LTE network you've got scorecentre HD of
your sports fan you've got news and
video highlights all in HD and then if
you're a movie buff you can actually
create your own movies so it's got 1080p
video capture okay it's not all right
okay raise your voice 1080p video
capture and you can create your own
movies using oh ok BHD applique ok I
love the size of the phone I mean it
it's long it's long instead of wide yep
yeah so it's a nice and thin again 4.5
inch screen feels really great in the
hand you're not going to able to get
this but it's super light no I am let me
try it trying to hold it it's really you
know it's thinner that I thought thinner
than in the pictures it's got this like
chrome finish obviously it's a
fingerprint magnet but well you're going
to have to carry something to clean it
up but the buttons are really nice yep
they got this really nice nice packed it
feel to it run facing camera I honestly
love the design that's probably my next
phone nice I honestly really love it
really happy with it but the interface
is interesting is this this is still
gingerbread right yeah this is
gingerbread so a little bit of an LG my
holder yeah so you can see we've got you
know so your applications are actually
categorized so you can kinda cute things
kind of separate you collapse for groups
of applications down
expand everything else so some nice
functionality they've built in pretty
cool widget right here for all your
multimedia so you're blameless or your
albums and all your pictures and all
your videos let's see what else you have
weather weather widget if you need one
write a news widget there's a social
widgets oh yeah it's poking twitter
updates so it's really gotta cover from
software well I really like the device i
mean if all of you like the LG nitro HD
that we reviewed recently from AT&amp;amp;T i
guess you're on verizon you want the
variant i guess this is your option it's
a really really nice phone 4g LTE speeds
and aside from that the design is just
compelling i mean if you're into
something close to like an iphone that's
small and well this is not small at all
it's just very well designed i think
that's the case because of the long
display just looked smaller than usual
yep very beautiful design thank you very
much Brian to the preview amazing phone
and well pricing and availability go to
verizon wireless comm /c yes this will
be out on January 1900 okay fabulous you
have a launch date on this guy okay
fabulous thank you very much really
appreciate it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
