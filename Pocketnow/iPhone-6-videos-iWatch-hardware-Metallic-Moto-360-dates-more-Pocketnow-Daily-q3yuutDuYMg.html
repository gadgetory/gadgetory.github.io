in a huge batch of videos the first leed
schematic show us what to expect for the
eye watches design and carrier
information leaks went to expect of
italic moto 360 I'm hi meri behna and
even though our team is returning from
etha the first link of the description
leads to our full coverage this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
some sort of official news as Motorola
is the company that did not give us the
information for when they're launching
the metallic moto 360 right now you can
only pick up the leather one and then
you pay eighty dollars premium if you
want the metallic bands whenever they
are available but verizon has just
posted this information that tells us
that apparently the 360 in its metallic
variant will be shipping to customers as
of november 11th so if you really have
to only get the metallic variant that's
when it's going to happen but if i were
you just get the leather one and then
bites trap now a company that is not
making any headlines over how many
phones it's sold as amazon reports claim
that the company is only sold around
26,000 35,000 phones over the last
couple of weeks which is terrible so it
seems that they've woken up and smell
the coffee apparently you can now get
this phone for a penny or it would be
close to a dollar plus a two-year
contract on AT&amp;amp;T yes the phone is still
not exclusive it has performed terribly
and we still can't figure out ways to
like it one of the most anticipated
phones for the fall is the Galaxy Note 4
so far one of our favorites at Aoife but
if you're wondering exactly how well is
that display when it comes to color
accuracy is super amoled displays have
never been the best reports claim that
there are some professional tests that
are being conducted in apparently this
is one of the most accurate displays in
the market for 2k right now and we have
tested this with the galaxy s5 Prime in
our review but obviously these are
scientific tests and apparently this is
probably one of the best displays you
can get so stay tuned as our reviews
will reveal more and as we are just one
day away from the launch of the iphone 6
supposedly the event is happening
tomorrow it seems that there are some
leaked videos the show is absolutely
everything we want to see of this
operating iphone and
as you expected this is pretty much a
bigger iPhone in every way meaning there
is no other additional way to use the
canvas on this display except for the
fact that it's got more icons but there
are some separate reports that
apparently there are some simulator
leaks from iOS that claim that there
will be this landscape mode for the 5.5
inch iphone just like we see with the
iPad and with the Galaxy Note lineup so
at least there are some benefits there
let's see what we get and finally for
the interesting news of the day we have
the first league schematics of the
iWatch it's interesting we haven't seen
any leaked photos of this product for
the first time ever Apple is terrible
when it comes to leaks but we've got the
schematics we've got a leak housing and
apparently the design will not be round
or square they'll have round edges sort
of like what we see on the icons of the
iphone and what we've seen with the
icons of the Mac forever Carly Apple is
going to retain that design which have
you read the Steve Jobs biography there
is a purpose for this but in addition to
that it seems that this product will be
water approved 20 meters in depth it
will also have a microphone and the
speaker for sehri among terrible
performing one day battery life we'll
see how that goes but that leads me to
the question of the day what would be
the perfect design for smartwatch for
you is it round as it's square is it the
round edges like we see with these i
watch schematics because in my case
honestly you know you can have as many
as two or three watches so the price is
right I would rather have different
options and of course saying that the
iWatch will have two designs and four
different color variants her design so
uh leave us a comment down below what
would be your preferred friends you know
the drill if you want to get it was
earlier before this video is phone
machine follow us on pocketnow.com
instructive channel as well you don't
follow me on twitter Jaime underscore
iveta please give this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi
Natalie better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
