pocketnow.com we're going to do a quick
unboxing of the samsung galaxy s 4g that
just came out for t-mobile so let's
check it out so here's the box and first
thing I want to show you is what the old
samsung vibrant box would like so just a
little quick comparison kind of
different so the galaxy s 4g is the
upgrade to the old samsung vibrant which
you see came with avatar and this one
comes with inception so let's check oh
well you'll also notice that it's very
similar to the hd7 S box at this edge
there alright so let's check it out we
got that edge there we got features for
g 4 inch super amoled touchscreen one
bigger espresso there blah blah blah ok
so let's open and here we have 4g
you got your little pocket of info
documentation want eguide spanish stuff
start guide and that's about it don't
need that we also have a micro USB cable
of course charger USB port oh that's
cool a micro SD card adapter and some
headphones let's see what these alike so
it's the rubbery ear thing and we have a
little clip with one button microphone
that's about it alright here's your
device see how the size compares to what
you might ask all right how about the
samsung vibrant look these in all right
pull this up
can you tell which is which yep this one
has a front facing camera on the side
there's the difference the back plastic
backing all right so those are really
pretty much exactly the same size let's
look at the hd7 we need that behind
pretty close okay and I guess the
blackberry torch there's much thicker
only that's it for the unboxing for now
stay tuned for the hardware tour that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
