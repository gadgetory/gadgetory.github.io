PocketNow com android version 2.2 also
known as froyo has built-in wireless
tethering options and also wired
tethering options so you can take your
phone and turn it into a high-speed
modem for your ipad or laptop or
anything wherever you are let's take a
look at how it works okay so let's get
started here now people that have had
their device is rooted on Android have
been able to do this for a while now but
now it's built right in to the operating
system which is quite nice so I'm just
going to go over here to settings and
then I'm going to go to wireless and
networks and then tethering &amp;amp; portable
hotspot here's the option it's not a
program it's actually buried within the
settings i'm gonna select that and i am
going to check off portable Wi-Fi
hotspot now it's going to turn it on
very simple to use okay and now we can
see a notification up here that says
tethering or hot spot is active i can
change the settings if i want to make it
have a certain level of security with
wpa2 but i'm going to leave it open just
for simplicity sake and let's get out an
ipad and connect to the device so let's
take a look here so we are in the
settings here and i'm going to look for
the network here it is android AP and
we'll do a speed test to see how fast
the speeds are while you're tethering
through your android phone now with
froyo so i'm going to go back here and
let's go to the speedtest net
application and run a speedtest so let's
see how we do okay for some reason we
got really bad performance let's test it
again hopefully we'll get better results
this time for some reason the
performance on the built-in froyo
tethering for wireless isn't as good as
the wireless tether program that you can
get if you have rooted your device but
let's take a look at what we get here so
pretty good upload speeds download
speeds aren't too aren't too great and
only 361 kilobits per second but let's
go into the web browser just take a look
at how webpages load while we're
tethered here to the nexus one running
froyo so i'm going to go to pocket now
calm
so here it is not too bad took about 10
seconds to load certainly if you are in
need for a wireless hotspot if you're on
a train or in a car or at a starbucks
this will be certainly helpful although
I'm likely to revert back to the
wireless tether program let's take a
look at how the wired tethering works
we're gonna use a laptop be right back
okay here we are so I've got the nexus
one plugged in with USB I'm going to put
the other end into the laptop here and
we should be able to switch on USB
tethering so it says turn on USB storage
I don't want to do that I do want to
turn on i do want to turn on USB
tethering here someone check that off
and it's making funny sounds on my
computer it says your device is ready to
use so I'm going to wait about 15
seconds and try to go on the internet
okay let's see what happens when we go
to pocket house homepage I mean here we
are we are tethering with USB it doesn't
seem terribly fast I'm going to run a
speedtest in a second I'm sure the
speeds are much much faster than we just
saw with the the wireless tethering so
I'm going to jump over to speedtest.net
let's see what we do and while you are
tethered on the nexus one you get a
little notification up at the top that
says tethering your hotspot active just
like we did with the wireless so let's
click begin test and see how we do
alright so much much much better when
you're connected with a wire we're going
to get a solid almost 3 megabits per
second down and of course we're on were
on AT&amp;amp;T HSPA network see what upload
speeds are going to be Wow just did a
big big burst there to 1.5 up and about
three down so much more impressive if
you are using the USB tethering mode but
again I think that the wireless hotspot
application that's been out there for a
long time for rooted users just actually
provides faster speeds for the wireless
portion of this then does what is built
into froyo I'll put a link up on
pocketnow.com on how to get that
particular utility and that was a look
at the tethering options now for android
2.2 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
