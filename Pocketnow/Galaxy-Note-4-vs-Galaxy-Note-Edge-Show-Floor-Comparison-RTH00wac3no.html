but two new Galaxy Note handsets the
Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note edge I'm
Taylor Martin the pocket now and let's
see how they compare truthfully we were
surprised to see Samsung begin to build
out its Galaxy Note handset line here at
Aoife but we shouldn't have been Samsung
is notorious for finding something that
works and tweaking the hell out of it
with multiple versions of the same phone
every year what better place to
introduce a new Galaxy Note smartphone
than Aoife where it unveiled the very
first Galaxy Note ever so what's
different about the Galaxy Note edge
first let's start with what isn't like
the Galaxy Note 4 the note edge has at
Snapdragon 805 SOC which purrs along at
2.7 gigahertz both have 3 gigabytes of
ram 32 gigabytes of thick storage and
microSD card slots 16 megapixel rear
camera with optical image stabilization
3.7 megapixel wide-angle front cameras
integrated s pins and brand new metal
frames a lot of the galaxy alpha as far
as internals go there are only a few
very minor differences the note edge
will come in a 64 gigabyte model both
will come with ex and Oh's 5433 versions
and the note edges battery is three
thousand million hours even while the
note 4 comes with 220 million powers
more for all intents and purposes these
are the same foams save for design and
really that's all the note edge is about
the right side of its display extends
around to the edge of the phone hence
the name it's display is marginally
smaller five point six inches instead of
five point seven and it comes with an
additional 160 pixels on the horizontal
to accommodate for the edge display as
it's called this display also makes the
design of the note edge quite different
than that of the note 4 and that affects
the in hand feel the edge feels a little
strange to hold by the note for phils
well like a galaxy note 3 only much
nicer both feature soft touch leather s
backsides but the edge display gives you
right thumb very little space to rest
and it doesn't accommodate for lefties
at all the display is also the only
point of difference in software both
have the new S Pen features smart select
and the updated multi window and the new
UI but the note edge has the additional
on screen space for the edge screen or
the software feature that displays
notifications stock tickers app
shortcuts and more on the edge of the
display
covered these features in more depth
yesterday to learn more about the note
edge of software be sure to check out
that video and our initial note edge
hands on the point is the galaxy note 4
is a device that will appeal to the
masses or relates the power users who
want to get more out of their phone who
want a high-end samsung phone with nicer
hardware and an S Pen the note edge on
the other hand is for those who want to
say on the cutting edge of the mobile
industry we're not convinced to display
that wraps around the side of the phone
is truly useful especially in everyday
life but it's sure going to turn some
heads keep it locked on packing out for
more comparisons straight off the show
floor here at Aoife stay tuned for full
comparisons and reviews of these devices
in the coming weeks I'm Taylor Martin
Katz bar tack on Twitter and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
