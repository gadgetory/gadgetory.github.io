but two new Galaxy Note handsets the
Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note edge I'm
Taylor Martin the pocket now and let's
see how they compare truthfully we were
surprised to see Samsung begin to build
out at skelux note handset line here at
Aoife but we shouldn't have been Samsung
is notorious for finding something that
works and tweaking the hell out of it
with multiple versions of the same phone
every year what better place to
introduce a new Galaxy Note smartphone
than Aoife where it unveiled the very
first Galaxy Note ever so what's
different about the Galaxy Note edge
first let's start with what isn't like
the Galaxy Note 4 the Note edge has a
Snapdragon 805 SOC which purrs along at
2.7 gigahertz both have 3 gigabytes of
RAM 32 gigabytes of fixed storage and
microSD card slots 16 megapixel rear
cameras with optical image stabilization
3.7 megapixel wide-angle front cameras
integrated s pins and brand new metal
frames allowed the Galaxy alpha as far
as internal skov there are only a few
very minor differences the Noda edge
will come in a 64 gigabyte model both
will come with X and O's 5433 versions
and the note edges battery is 3000
milliamp hours even while the note 4
comes with two hundred and 20 milliamp
hours more for all intents and purposes
these are the same phones saved for
design and really that's all the Note
edge is about the right side of its
display extends around to the edge of
the phone hence the name its display is
marginally smaller 5.6 inches instead of
5.7 and it comes with an additional 160
pixels on the horizontal to accommodate
for the edge display as it's called this
display also makes the design of the
Note edge quite different than that of
the note 4 and that affects the in hand
feel the edge feels a little strange to
hold while the note 4 fills well like a
Galaxy Note 3 only much nicer both
feature soft touch leather s back sides
but the edge display gives you right
thumb very little space to rest and it
doesn't accommodate for lefties at all
the display is also the only point of
difference in software both have the new
S Pen features smart select and the
updated multi window and the new UI but
the Note edge has the additional
on-screen space for the edge screen or
the software feature that displays
notifications stock takers app shortcuts
and more on the edge of the display
covered these features in more depth
yesterday to learn more about the note
edges software be sure to check out that
video and our initial Note edge hands-on
the point is the Galaxy Note 4 is a
device that will appeal to the masses or
at least the power users who want to get
more out of their phone who want a
high-end Samsung phone with nicer
hardware and an S Pen the Note edge on
the other hand is for those who want to
stay on the cutting edge of the mobile
industry we're not convinced to display
that wraps around the side of the phone
is truly useful especially in everyday
life but it's sure gonna turn some heads
keep it locked on pocket now for more
comparisons straight off the show floor
here at Aoife stay tuned for full
comparisons and reviews of these devices
in the coming weeks i'm taylor martin
Kaspar tech on twitter and i will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
