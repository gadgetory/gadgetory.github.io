the Galaxy s7 edge and you'll notice
that it's bigger than the s6 edge of
last year and that's not the only change
let's go take a closer look
this year's galaxy s7 edge is bigger
than the galaxy s7 which is the novelty
because last year's galaxy s6 edge was
the same size as the galaxy s6 but
that's not the only change let's take a
look at the outside first we still have
the red round edges that do all
curvature on the left and right but this
time around the back feels also rounded
a little bit because the glass is
seamlessly molded into this very thin
layer of aluminum and it really feels
good in the hand you no longer have
those edges which feel rough in your
palm it just feels like a polished nice
bevel on the outside that's not all
that's changed the galaxy s7 edge just
like the galaxy s7 is this time around
waterproof it's rated ip68
you can immerse it for up to 30 minutes
in fresh water don't go swimming in the
ocean with this but you can go to the
pool let's get under the hood because
there's also changes this time around we
are looking at a 5.5 inch screen
compared to last year's 5.1 inches same
quad HD display
same MO lat button colors the blacks of
course there's some software tweaks here
going on we'll get back to this but
let's first talk about the specs real
quick you can look them up on the
internet any time but just real quick
it has a Exynos 88-90 processor compared
to d 7420 of last year it's got 4 gigs
of ram compared to 3 gigs of ram
it's got 32 gigs of storage and most
importantly it's got the micro SD card
slot right up there it's a dual tray one
for two sim one for two micro SD and
this time
Samsung really innovated the camera on
the back is protruding less you don't
have a bit of a hump as you had last
year it's been reduced it's not
completely flushed but it also looks and
feels better and since we're talking
about the camera it's a 12 megapixel
unit versus a 16 megapixel unit last
year's model but don't let that fool you
we have a new pair of lens which is
brighter at F 1.7 compared to have 1.9
from last year and the sensor is life
sensitive enough so that you can capture
good pictures in very low light
situations there's also some changes on
the software side we have the always-on
display the phone knows whether you are
placing it face down or face F of course
it has cellar ah meters but you have the
information classic information like
time.they appointments notifications and
so on but once you go ahead and unlock
it you'll see the same Samsung knew I
slept on top of this time Android 6.0
marshmallow and there are some changes
on the edge display too fast and so this
is basically a test switcher where you
can just go quickly from one application
to the other depending on what you would
like to use yahoo news is one of the new
partners
there will be new partners which will do
applications that will take advantage of
the edge screen so expect to see more of
that in the future of course fingerprint
scanner is there but heart rate monitor
is there everything is the same and
yes you will probably not be able to
tell it apart from the galaxy s6 edge+
there's a different video for that on
Pocket now this is as much as we could
fit in to this hands on video evidently
night coming to you from Barcelona thank
you very much for watching go look at
the other videos we have for you they're
interesting the pocket now's MWC 2016
