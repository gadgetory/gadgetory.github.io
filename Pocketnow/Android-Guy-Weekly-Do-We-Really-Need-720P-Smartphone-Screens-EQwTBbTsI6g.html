high-definition on a smartphone screen
what are the advantages what are the
disadvantages that's what we're going to
talk about today on the android guy
weekly with Joe Levi alright let's lay
the foundation of this topic with some
history and to do that we're going to go
back to televisions in fact really old
televisions you know the ones I'm
talking about there they're big they're
clunky they hiss when you turn them on
they played even be black and white but
they're that big old cathode ray or CRT
technology yeah really really ugly and
low resolution for a few reasons ok the
first reason is the number of lines of
resolution that screen had so let's say
you've got say a 19 inch TV which back
in its day might have been on a little
on the big side smaller screens were
more likely to be back in the early 80s
whatnot and yeah that's how far back
we're going but TVs at least in the US
had about 480 depending on who you ask
for 86 but about 480 we'll just keep it
nice and even for the purpose of this
video about 480 lines of resolution now
that means that instead of displaying an
entire picture it's displaying a whole
bunch of lines that when viewed together
make up a picture and TVs you might not
know this but TVs have moving pictures
on them it's called sarcasm right there
these pictures move and to do that you
have to update the lines so one line may
have a whole bunch of dots on it that
when put together has a picture of a
flower but then a breeze comes along the
flower moves well to to convey that
moving you have to update the lines and
to do that we have what's called
interlaced lines so instead of
displaying every single line and
refreshing them all at the same time so
that the whole screen might blink we
only display half at one time that's
what 480i stands for that's the eye is
interlaced so you're displaying half of
the lines at a time and then you're
updating the other half the other half
the other half back and forth back and
forth and it kind of gives a little bit
of blurring but it means you only have
to send half as much information to
screen as you would otherwise it made
for really not sharp images but hey it
was TV and it was cool right well now
technology has moved on and we don't
have the same limitations in fact what
limitations did we have back then well
most of us didn't have cable TV back
then or satellite TV back then it was
usually broadcast and I know a lot of
you did but let's talk broadcast just
for a minute because it's very
illustrative of the point that I'm
trying to make instead of having this
huge fat pipe there's this bandwidth
just seemingly unlimited coming through
you know the satellite or a cable
connected to the house you had an
antenna on your roof in your attic maybe
even rabbit ears on top of your TV now
there's only so many frequencies that
you can transmit signals on whether
those are radio or television in this
case and a television signal takes up a
specific amount of space in that
bandwidth so you literally can't have a
lot of television signals coming through
a dozen maybe until you start running
into technological limitations with
distance and whatnot start overlapping
into other things but you know that's a
ham radio discussion not a pocket now
discussion so we'll leave that for
another podcast somewhere else but what
it does illustrate is they did unique
and novel things to try and maximize
that bandwidth like interlacing the
signal instead of making it progressive
that's what the P stands for in
resolutions okay so far okay but the
resolution wasn't that great it didn't
really matter because we had antenna on
our TV that were just sucking in the
signal however they could and the signal
wasn't all that great it was staticky it
had lines in it that were from you know
the neighborhoods running their blender
or whatever lots of environmental
factors that made the signal really kind
of distorted so the screen the display
looked the sport distorted as well well
there was another side of that on the
other end the people who are actually
filming these things these television
shows that we were watching if you go
back now and watch them on a really high
resolution signal like you know I
Netflix HD or whatnot you can see men
the source really wasn't
great either it was grainy it had pops
it had all kinds of artifacts built into
it that then was being broadcast out to
everybody else and we couldn't tell
because the resolution was so low we
didn't know any better at that point but
then something happened our screen
started to get bigger people started to
get big screen TVs and these were big
TVs but they still had 480 high
resolution some people had what were
called up samplers to try and make them
look better by interpreting them and
kind of doing some math in the signal to
to imply more lines than there were just
was kind of weird and whatnot but we got
to a point where the bigger the screen
the worse the picture and that wasn't
any good so what to do in the u.s. we
decided let's go to all digital pictures
so that we can go to high-definition
screens and high-definition content so
what is high definition well it's higher
than low definition that's pretty much
it so the first high-definition standard
believe it or not is 480p yes twice as
many lines of resolution is 480 I but in
the same space the same way out the same
all that stuff the nintendo wii for
example with the right hardware can
output 480p signals and that's the
highest it can go you know it doesn't
really need to if you just connect it
using the stuff that comes in the box
you're getting for a TI but that's
higher definition it's twice as many
lines in the same space so theoretically
you're getting twice the resolution out
of it and in fact it does take a little
bit more overhead to do I'll get to that
in a minute 720 I is the next one 720
lines interlaced just like we were used
to that kind of came and went and I
don't see it that often then we've got
720p 720 lines progressive so they're
all updated all at the same time 1080i
was around for quite a while and now
1080p seems to be what everybody is
standardizing on because we can do it
720p really easy to do you can get a lot
more signal through on a 720p signal
stream than on a 1080p signal stream but
1080p works a lot better for much larger
screens like a big screen TV that you'd
hang on your wall so far
we're good what does that have to do
with smartphones and tablets why are we
even talking about it so let's take a
look this is the galaxy at or excuse me
the Nexus S and it is a smartphone if
you couldn't tell this is the Galaxy
Nexus which is a little bit bigger and
this is a samsung galaxy tab 7 7 so all
of these have different resolutions and
they're not TVs their displays now look
behind me I've got a 19 inch computer
screen that has a particular resolution
and different screens for computers have
different resolutions on them and really
it's kind of a pain I'm a web developer
I have to write web pages so that they
display well on all of these different
sized screens and they're all over the
place how many dots are there how many
lines how many pixels wide it's a pain
in the neck think about smartphone apps
if I write an app for this is it going
to look good on this because it has
different number of dots is it going to
work on this it's got a different number
of dots so there had to be something
done to kind of standardized on what
those dots and lines were going to be
that's where we're kind of going to a
standard basic display metaphor if you
will this metaphor is based around one
common type of screen we're not there
yet but we take a look even just you
know generation back phone was kind of
doing its own thing but now we've got
720p this is a 720p high-definition
screen just like you'll find on a 720p
high-definition TV screen or computer
monitor so whatever I write on one
screen is going to look exactly the same
smaller but it's going to look exactly
the same on all of those screens that's
great there are some pros and some cons
to that okay so first let's talk about
some some cons and we'll wrap up with
pros first of all this type of screen is
easy to make relatively speaking this
type of screen with 720p is harder
because there are more pixels here there
are more lines so trying to cram them
all down into one screen is kind of hard
to do
we really haven't had the technology to
do that very well until just recently
but we we just couldn't do it before
we're finally to a point where we can
and well some would argue we may still
not be there because if you look this
screen this is again the the Nexus is
you know quite a bit bigger than the
nexus s so the Galaxy Nexus is a much
larger device to accommodate that larger
screen kind of a catch-22 because you
don't want to have huge smartphones
because at what point do they become
tablets you want to have a smartphone
that's small that's you know useful that
you pack around with you really the
Galaxy Nexus is right there on the edge
some people it's too big some people
like me it's just right other people I
guess it might be too small but it's
right there on the edge we've really got
to make them smaller now that's the
second thing if I have a 720p TV screen
hanging on my wall with a 720p signal
and all that stuff the dots that make
that up are the same as the dots that
make this up this is obviously a lot
smaller even then this tablet so if
these have exactly the same resolution
which they don't but let's say they do
if they have the same resolution stuff
on this screen is going to look a lot
better a lot sharper a lot crisper than
stuff on this screen because the pixels
are smaller so that's the first thing
things look higher resolution when
they're smaller than when they're larger
the larger you go you've got to get more
and more pixels more more lines right
okay so ebook readers used to be e ink
because they could make those e ink
pixels if you will a lot smaller than
they can make actual real pixels so by
doing that they can have a sharper
higher resolution screen it was a lot
slower and was only black and white not
color but they could do that and it
really lent itself better to book
reading because it was higher resolution
it was more like paper now we've got
720p screens you know we're starting to
see that same level of a resolution on
eBook readers now of course there are
some power implications that we're
really not going to talk about but we're
starting to see shift away from eating
and over to real LCD screens because of
a higher resolution that we can do in
the screens we're making the pixels
smaller and smaller the the iphone with
the retina displays a very good example
of that making those pixels so small
that you can hardly even see them with
the naked eye so really kind of cool
next we've got standardization once I
know that my screen is 720p widescreen i
can write content for it regardless of
the actual physical dimensions and have
everything look exactly the same all
right so now let's talk downsides one of
the biggest downsides to a screen other
than its availability a high-definition
screen is the fact that there are more
pixels now I know you're saying whoa Joe
you just said that that was an upside it
is huge upside but it has some some
baggage with it one of those things is
those screens are harder to make because
the smaller you make things the more
difficult it is to make them you know if
you have a pixel that's an inch by an
inch relatively easy to make a pixel
that's you know a millimeter by a
millimeter or smaller that's hard now
with technology and with automation you
know it's getting easier but relatively
speaking it's more difficult to do
that's the first thing okay the second
thing is the more pixels that you have
on a screen the well generally in this
case the bigger the screen is the bigger
the screen even when we're talking
between these two smartphones there's
one there's one okay this has a lot
bigger screen area the bigger the screen
area the more power it takes to drive it
the more lighting you need it just sucks
down power faster so you've got to have
a bigger battery or more efficient use
of energy to make up for that if you're
going to have the same size battery so
battery life power consumption is a
concern another concern is the more
pixels you have the more computing power
electrical power the computing power you
need to drive it all so for example
let's say you have a screen put this
over here you got this screen and you've
got this screen you can essentially fit
what three of those on there so you
think that if I'm doubling my screen
size
then all I have to do is double my video
processing power right no you have to
quadruple it the reason for that is you
have to multiply height x width so if
you've got something that's twice as
high and twice as wide that's four times
the number of pixels that you have to
create content for you have to process
content for you have to put out on the
screen so your video processing has to
be much more powerful as well which
either means you know you're using the
same video processor and it's going to
seem slower because it's still taking
the same amount of time to render say a
thousand pixels now if you've got 4000
pixels it'll take four times as long in
theory and there's some other stuff in
there that that would mitigate that a
little bit but generally speaking it's
going to take about four times as long
so hey now your new big screen device
seems four times slower than your old
one right that's not good so we've got
to have a device to drive it that's at
least four times faster at presenting
those pixels out and you probably are
going to have something faster than that
but the point is you've got to upgrade
your tech behind it as well as the
screen itself of course that means more
processing power and more battery power
to run the thing so again kind of a
two-edged sword that you've got more
pixels it's looks nicer but you've got
to have a bigger screen which takes more
power you've got to have a bigger GPU
which takes more power so you're going
to have a bigger battery you've got to
have you know stay close to an outlet
something like that so there's kind of
the ups and downs to it overall 720p is
fabulous when we're talking smartphones
that here's my prediction is the new
standard everything is going to be a
720p smartphone display now it might
take a little while to get there but
that is going to be it right now we're
working on these guys and we still have
some differences in display resolutions
kind of standardizing on sizes right now
but resolutions are where it comes into
play in fact if you'll notice that's
kind of long and skinny it's a 16 by 9
aspect ratio so it's letter box if you
will
this not so much it's you can see
there's a little bit of a difference in
the then the sizes there and the ratios
so we don't really have 720p tablets yet
I think we will I think that will
probably be the next step but after that
one we're talking 7-inch versus you know
right around five inch it makes sense to
be the same resolution 720p you're not
going to lose that much resolution on a
tablet over a smartphone when you do
that but when you go to bigger stuff
like a 10 inch tablet like the zoom like
the iPad that's where you really need to
have 1080p resolution to have that same
sharpness and clarity so when we see
that I don't know when are we going to
see the letterbox tablets I don't know
but it's coming and it's coming before
too long give it a year or two at tops
and we'll be able to see kind of where
things are going so 720p pros cons
benefits disadvantages what do you think
this is your part of the program where
you comment on what we've said here
don't realize that we've kind of dumbed
down some of the technical lingo so that
we can reach a broader audience like the
whole for 8486 thing with TVs so keep
things about the concepts and talk about
what you know what kinds of experience
do you have and what do you think the
future is going to hold what do you want
to see and what are some trends that are
developing that you aren't really
impressed with that you don't like
comment down below let us know of course
if you like this video like this format
big thumbs up so that you can share it
with your friends and tune in next week
for another episode of the android guy
