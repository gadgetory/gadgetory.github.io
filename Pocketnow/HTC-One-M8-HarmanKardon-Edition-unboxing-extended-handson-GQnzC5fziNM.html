m8 at the sprint launch event yesterday
but conditions weren't great for a
proper hands on thankfully Sprint and
HTC were good enough to send us our very
own Harman Kardon Edition HTC One m8
review unit for a second pass today join
us for an unboxing and first look so you
probably remember the HTC One I made
from our full review and comparison
coverage just a few weeks back and if
you haven't checked those out the link
to the full review is in the description
unboxing this device which is exclusive
to Sprint in the United States by the
way is kind of a pleasant surprise we're
not used to seeing additional color
variations come this soon after a
flagship launches but that's exactly
what we have here with this black
version it's still aluminum even if it
feels a little more slick in the hand
than the gunmetal on our other unit but
solid black with some nice champagne
trim around the camera and also on the
boom sound speaker grilles up front it's
a little easier to see smudges but
otherwise the hardware is identical to
what we've seen up to this point down at
the bottom is the Harman Kardon branding
calling out the principal focus of this
device it's a smart phone made to
deliver a very special acoustic
experience that starts with the bundled
Harman Kardon earbuds which HTC says are
worth a hundred and $49 retail it's a
huge value considering most of the time
we're happy just to get the crappy OAM
branded but this special acoustic
experience continues in the software
there's new tech here so of course there
are new brand names clarify and live
stage we'll get into this more in a
future video but these bring new means
of decoding and presenting compressed
audio basically delivering much more
realistic sounding mp3s
according to Sprint and HTC the software
is also putting sprint music plus and
Spotify in the foreground which is no
accident in what Spotify calls the
biggest deal it's ever done it's
providing premium Spotify access free to
Sprint customers on a family plan for
six months with a discounted rate
thereafter the special edition Harman
Kardon One m8 will be available May 9th
for $230 on contract a $30 premium
/ the standard model and once again it's
exclusive to Sprint will be going more
in depth with this phone over the next
week or so as we go ears on be sure to
let us know in the comments what you're
most interested in learning about the
device and we'll do our very best to
cover it until then this has been
