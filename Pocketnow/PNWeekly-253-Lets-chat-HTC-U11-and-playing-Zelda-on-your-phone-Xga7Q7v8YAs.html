HTC's next flagship will be you eleven
help this company rebuild is Apple
giving up on the iPad Mini maybe Steve
Jobs was right about smaller tablets
after all and we'll take a closer look
at Google Lenz announced at Google i/o
so make sure you're charged and ready
for Episode two five three of the
PocketNow weekly recorded Wednesday
night 9:45 p.m. on the west coast this
weekly podcast is where we dissect and
discuss those gadgets that make our
lives mobile smartphones tablets and
wearables it's all the stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and lenses
were things that you used to use to melt
your action figures with I'm Juan Carlos
paganella senior editor pocketnow.com
blasting the signal from a late-night
Southern California joined this week by
plucky podcast producer mr. Jules Wong
who's still out on location around the
the New York area how's it going out on
the East Coast buddy boy hey hopefully
the wind isn't cutting me out and the
noise isn't cutting me out and hopefully
I don't have to cut out of this segment
just like I was cut out of Joel's
segment I really wanted to talk with him
for a little bit about that you love it
but unfortunately you'll have to get in
with the right kind of people in order
to do that yeah yeah Jules is giving us
a little time travel is I'll be will be
bringing on a special guest at the the
second half of this podcast to talk
about the HTC u 11 you give yourself a
discount because you say it's 9:45
Pacific time you have to remind yourself
that it's also 12:00 I don't need to
remind myself I know exactly what time
it is out on the East Coast which is
this this was not my choosing to record
the podcast at this time not with
relation to East Coasters I should say
who needed to record on a Wednesday
night at midnight their time so this is
not ideal for me either I got I got
plans tomorrow that's BAM whole damn day
and between that and IO which we'll talk
about in just a second as we will that
has been a major effort upper what's
been going on in my life so apologies
for all of this we'll try and get back
on track here as best as we can but
before we get to that do you want to
remind you that we still would like your
feedback on everything that is mobile
tech we want your questions so send them
over to podcast at pocketnow.com you can
do that through email just send a few
questions over heyse and send a million
we'll get to them as soon as possible
and also that p and weekly hashtag
that's also pretty useful for us too
because I will be able to go through any
sort of you know shorter I guess
questions all during the span as well
all right so on that note let's jump
right into some news I'm going to switch
over to looks just here let's jump right
into the website view that does not mean
that my microphone is falling off of a
bench so that's very lovely once you try
to edit that out but I'm just going to
go on and charge on because we're
professionals hello let's pretend to be
a theist so IO happened today was the
big day that it started and start off
with the big keynote one of the main
features that was teased out from you
know AI that's what we want to go
through student sundar Pichai his last
two letters with his name's AI it's
important to him as well and she's been
going through all the server
backside issues backside haha to make
these services possible and one of those
services is google lens and that
basically comes up to a bixby vision
kind of competitor so it's going at it
right against Samsung it has the power
to do so I would think in the ingenuity
it's just about incorporating that kind
of and
visualizing all these data plots on
objects that your camera sees and then
putting on the good use so you put it to
Google assistant instant translation of
course now we already have instant
translation but it's getting wrapped
into Google assistant so that you can
actually build upon what's going on on
that stuff you're looking for like a
translation to this food sign and you
want to ask what that whatever that's
what it wasn't what come a what is
welcome a about you'll find out through
another Google search a Google systems
what's going on with what coming oh look
at see we I think so there you go other
sort of issues going in like a Google
photos those shared albums as well
there's a whole bunch of integrations
that you can check on at pocketnow.com
for that as we move on for the rest of
the news we also see that the Galaxy
Note 8 is going to be the best phone
ever we always look better anyways dual
camera potentials are climbing ever so
slightly higher with another reports
today from I believe it is it's just I
guess it's just the Chinese or so uh we
owe it's Korea Herald
excuse me about that we have three times
zoom so pretty much like the iPhone 7
plus it had a dual camera module going
on there what through two times in on
the second of them so three times I
don't know it is that going to make any
difference in terms of getting a clearer
sharper image that much closer boss to
see what we're playing with and over to
our next story here which is about that
iPad Mini that sort of in-between
between the iPhone plus size so 5.5
inches and we also have the standard 9.7
inch iPod and between that nothing is
really God in between since 95 94 which
was believe a 2015 model we did get a
reset on those memory
options this year but I'm like you know
we don't have any developments that I
mean that's a pretty minor iteration and
when we're talking about twelve point
nine inch I play I've had pros and even
a ten point five inch iPad pro rumored
to come along soon it's not really
building well there's rumors or talk
from a source and Apple that this is not
it's basically being eaten out of its
size category and want to see what
happens maybe it's gone
it'll get a complete revamp we don't
know at this point we would like to find
out so hopefully there's so much please
tell us what's going on I'm not pulling
out my hair about it because I have a
handful so okay oh man this is crazy
um risings it's it's not good it's doing
terrible at supporting devices so LG I
in an earlier take of our other podcast
we talked about the LG watch urbane
second edition LTE and how that ways of
failure at launching because it was
pulled out by LG for some reason we
never really got the reason this time
it's the opposite side the carrier side
of things
Verizon said it would hold a it would
carry the LG watch sports the LTE
version for Verizon um we don't know why
it has dropped it but that's the word it
has a disruptive just gone so all you
get now is maytee and teachers are named
unlocked I guess wears an or bluetooth
to say at least this is a disappointing
news for Friesland users who are into
the SmartWatch thing and Verizon has
been though well it's been behind the
ball in terms of IOC kind of pushing
that time as a deal so I want to see
where that goes finally Legend of Zelda
coming in to the smartphone field yeah
we're pretty happy about what it already
has done for this switch Nintendo switch
but it seems that Jordans that's not far
enough we're gonna have to go
little bit further for its 25th birthday
and that means a more coming in next
year so 2018 and well actually there's
going to be a limited show starting
around the holidays but all come fully
in 2018 you don't have any real detail
about the game itself just sound so
there's something sure about right yeah
as so long is that the the Zelda move
for smartphones isn't just like run and
jump link game like Mario was now you're
gonna have to really parse that out
because smartphones have never really
been built for that kind of like you
have the I know your family's future
fight from one as well and I've been
passed along several releases some time
about you know features right - and all
that but you know it's kind of free well
dude it has it's a roaming course game
it doesn't let you go along and play
actual goons and stuff that's cool I
mean it's hard to imagine a free roaming
game a Zelda esque
kind of deal going on smartphone because
that requires a lot more polygons and
you know render distance and all that
stuff going on even with Vulcan I'm not
even sure oh you know I I still think
there's an opportunity for Nintendo too
so I think Zelda would be a game that
would translate very well if you were to
take sort of a graphics repolish of the
original top-down map panel Legend of
Zelda I think there's an opportunity
there for some of those older titles to
kind of get that modern day you know
sprucing up and I think they would
actually translate really well to a
smartphone experiment use you're right
if we were to develop like the n64 Zelda
that wouldn't work at all but you know
there are other incarnations like Game
Boy style incarnations a Zelda that I
think people would love to play on on a
phone directly without hefty having to
use an emulator
well is Nintendo fighting oil there's
that but I'm kind of really fighting
those devs who are creating we want to
do that kind of thing reskin HD eat and
just go for that kind of thing or is it
is it just concerned more about going
with the verticals it is dealt with and
just being able to make money off of
that I mean we've seen it in several
iterations I don't know if you've done
it done Fire Emblem what but uh no just
like that's our story does let well see
what the smartphone barbecues do well I
think there's their RPG things I also
wouldn't put put it outside the realm of
possibility of some sort of like Zelda
world building game or something like
that you know again taking the IP and
maybe it's not a direct translation of
what might of what Nintendo might
consider competing against their console
solutions maybe it's a watered-down
gaming experience but it's still set
within the world of Zelda I just mean no
the Super Mario run thing was novel and
kind of interesting for a minute and I I
don't need another run and jump game
that's not what I wanted I know title so
I don't know that it's kind of a
countervailing those expectations where
you kind of just expect okay so it's
it's in mobile and this is probably the
process they can modify it to fit you
know to actually be enjoyable while
you're in a kind of a smartphone gaming
situation you don't have much time or
something like that whereas if you don't
want to be left disappointed if they do
try to um how shall we say it's full ass
that's right I'd then have it be an
experience where it's just you know it
ends up being choppy or jarred because
of how has to be delivered per you know
mobility smartphones and whatnot I mean
yeah totally totally different so I
wanted to kind of track back to google
lens for just a minute
you something into my depth finally well
but I mean just like it it's funny we're
going to call this like a big speed
competitor but is it that's just getting
Google back to where we were with the
early camera experiments with Google
Goggles and the other apps that were
trying to scan images and do visual
search directly from our phones I mean
Google has dipped their toe into this
type of into this type of solution and a
number of times since Android has been
really I mean I think it's just
convenience kind of merging
announcements because you know sooner
bhishan was all about the teeth you know
talking about TPMS don't time art EDM
time division multiplexing niche you
know if you can explain that to me
I know you know it's used in CDMA
situations but there's just a whole
bunch of you know it's all about having
the server's be capable of handling
Google what Google ins wants to do and I
think in the you know the earlier cases
in Ellen's kind of a case built
situation where you had be sorter
servers set up for exact situation
whereas you know okay let's have all the
Google servers be able to just be able
just plant these boards in and then
everyone can do lens everywhere and just
have it accessible from the assistants
so I don't know it's a it's an
announcement of convenience yeah I guess
maybe that that was what was holding
goggles back originally was that
back-end infrastructure for moving
images and doing that kind of processing
as efficiently and as quickly as
possible it's just I I guess I just have
to question from what I've played with
on big speed I I guess I just don't see
where this needs to be such a precious
part of the phone experience like I
don't search for things with the camera
you look at everything through your
phone right well you like I'm always
just holding phone cameras up in the
front
you know everywhere I got to walk around
and do this on your house because I mean
it makes a lot of sense like you were
saying that the idea of real-time visual
translation for different languages
that's awesome but that that has already
been working really well you know I
don't know that having yet another sort
of branded Google assistant lens bixby
solution thing really elevates that
experience significantly unless it's
just that branding exercise of we'll
call it something new so that people
will go out and try it because it's a
new service and then they'll see that
really this was just Google Goggles all
along but it's just been phenomenally
improved since the last time it had a
proper brand name I mean if there's
anything that people want it's time it's
for fun right seriously like that's
that's going to make it happen
so we'll see we'll see I'll be really
curious to see now what this means for
competition because I I haven't been
completely sold on Bixby has a
standalone competitor to what Google is
already doing with Android so yeah if
this causes no need to fight back then
that's great
yeah there's also a bunch of other eye
our announcements frequency to assistant
photos as well as a couple of nitty
gritty Android Oh stuff that you can
check out on the site as well
yeah the Android oh stuff doesn't really
seem like the needles moved much from
that very very early Developer Preview
that we we wrote up okay like so I want
to try and see if I can do this little
jig again because if and also the screen
brightness on this I have my Nexus 5
here running the second version of the
preview you got it to set up I mean Tony
sending me angry emails right now like
why haven't I installed it here like I
haven't had time to sideload it and it's
all I know if I'm not getting my OTA
you're about getting the OTA because if
you flashed a previous image you're
automatically signed out of the
in a program you have to sign back on
life alright then I'll go today that's
what I had to do to get mine and you
know they switched it up the dark means
gone now it's light and there's also
yeah of course you got to change up the
color it's some light little stuttery on
my size X I'm sure that's a it's not
going to be probably at all but you know
there are other little features like a
notification dots it's less annoying
than the how you see the number like on
the on an app icon badge right having
that grow but you're able to actually
just hold on the app icon on the home
screen and be able to individually act
on those aggregation but you gotten a
notification shade like really what I
just I'm you know just the fact that you
said that you know there is still no
dark theme that that makes me so crazy
cranky I was like The Dropper dirt they
changed everything they changed all
those the UI elements from grey and
black to white like that's but I don't
care I miss I miss holo theme holo theme
was this a rate you know low power dark
theme it was great for AMOLED screens I
I switched over my Galaxy s8 almost
instantly different artwork that's
that's what I said basically but I want
it Jules I want it give it to me
um lastly just because you know I'm the
camera nerd what do you think about a
dual camera Note 8 if we get an optical
zoom do you really think that moves the
needle on an image processing at all i I
kind of feel like people like the zoom
on the iPhone but it's not really a
primary or I hope you're getting the
goose I hope yeah that sounds awesome
oh yeah I don't really think it's
something that people on their iPhone 7
plus is like they use it I'm sure but
it's not like this major I don't think
many people regarded as being a major
component sig okay feature you know what
I'm saying
yeah get it now yeah yeah get it how it
suppose to old anyways uh yeah I'm not
sure how much farther this takes us I
mean three times I was arguing
originally for a four times lens on the
iPhone 7 because I would think I think
that we would save enough between one
and four just to get in and you know do
that variable zoom and whatnot ah qua
way is making a room it's not they're
still now I don't I don't know how to
feel bringing this up but they're DXL
mark schools are still kind of there is
a pretty good but there are a few points
behind against the s8 which scored in 88
so and with that and that didn't change
much for the s7 edge they didn't change
it all actually you know going if this
is going too well
I'm a little less concerned with the XL
mark scores just because they completely
missed the significant lens flaring on
the pixel and still managed to give the
pixel dar their highest score of all
time when lens quality is supposed to be
one of their metrics if we're going to
say it's image processing then yeah I
can I can appreciate that but I guess
I'm just kind of I think I find it kind
of curious that zoom is becoming you
know so Apple went for zoom like reach
like zooming into your subject where the
LG went for zooming wide and I think if
a lot of people were to compare the
usefulness of a wide angle lens versus a
zoomed in lens I think more people would
probably lean towards the wide angle
lens because the software our op zoom is
okay and then you've got your normal
field of view and then you have this
ultra wide field of view for getting
more into each shot I find a counter is
that Samsung followed apples move there
I'm gonna say just first and then I'm
going to do it I want a flexible
telescoping lens so that it goes you
know
zooms out of the module and goes all the
way around to that time you actually get
the view that you want from wherever you
are but even with just like if it's in
module you got motors to you know inch
it this way or inch up that way if you
can't really you should try and get a
shot but you can't really part even
better if you're trying to shoot out of
a window and the reflection of the light
it doesn't work out because it's just
looking too much of the interior that
can really help so I don't know I mean
yeah that's one of the little gimmicks
that I can think a second well I won't
take it it has some value to it oh no
I'm not I'm not saying there's no value
and and there are definitely pros and
cons for every solution
you know you touched on huawei the cons
are there is no focal length flexibility
at all no like you've got your one field
of view with those two camera sensors
but the pro would be I think you've got
some of some of the most photographic
image processing I've ever seen when you
merge the output from those two sensors
there is definitely a call for having a
higher quality when zoomed in but unless
Samsung has figured out a way to give us
a longer lens on a comparable image
sensor without degrading image quality
then we're kind of stuck in the same
situation that we were with the iPhone 7
where once you don't have perfect light
the phone is already starting to
struggle with that zoom sensor because
it's a smaller sensor so that it can
take up less space and you can use you
can kind of gimmick the focal length of
the lens to make sure that you're
getting as much reaches your advertising
and that's where I think LG actually did
something really cool with the g6 where
the wide-angle and the standard view
have the same sized image sensors and so
you face a little less degradation of
your image when you switch back and
forth between normal field of view and
wide field of view so that's just kind
of what I mean like I think wide seems
to be the more flexible edition
and that's where I'm kind of curious
like if Samsung really does do this with
the note 8 why why I think it's kind of
interesting like they would follow in
Apple's footsteps instead of looking at
maybe some of the other consumer
researchers and you know put it in front
of focus groups or something like that
all the funnier focus groups on
photography photography yeah out of
focus groups on fricative right ah no
like um I mean I don't really know where
to go in terms of just focal lengths
here I mean we got wide we got you know
I mean the only real solution I guess
for me is you know you find a way to uh
put some distance between those sensor
on the lens which is already hard to
deal with it is you can make those you
know you don't have you can you can be
able to produce a flatter of lens and
still get a fairly wide feel but other
than that you know zooming in is like I
don't know how to do it it takes more in
spot than just trying to talk about it
on a podcast as well and especially when
we're speculating about rumors because I
mean there are other solutions to
already like it's just it's just you
know three and it's pretty it's pretty
straightforward so far so unless Samsung
decides to you know keep one little
detail very closely guarded we're going
to know about it eventually
anyways so and and we're going to say
that it's a guarantee that this is going
to have a quad camera array for zoom
wide and dual lens photography with an
8k screen and a sixteen thousand
milliamp hour battery so you heard it
here first folks galaxy note I will go
further on bail it's over 9000
you heard it here first folks the Galaxy
Note 8 will be the phone of the future
today yeah I'm going to throw my knee 20
elinoz and right after this call as soon
as we're done I'm going to take all of
the other phones in my collection of
review devices and run over them with my
car
with their little vineyard the other I
kind of wish I added Miata that would be
a fun hard to drive but we also had a
one of the big news stories this week
coming the HTC you 11 we got our first
hands-on from mister hi may be betta and
I think it's time that we brought on our
special guests to unpack that news so if
you want to wrap us up here Jules we can
we don't let you go find shelter out in
that beautiful I shall and to do that
all I have to say is you can find
details on these stories and more just
go to pocketnow.com search the podcast
section for this episode and it's going
down also check out Jaime Rivera he
hosts as said before the pocket now
don't know he talked about in for the 11
so I pray that well but yeah we can
still say he's the host of the day we
have the pocket now daily and we can
find that on a two page okay okay
baba ah bye-bye ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls it is my pleasure to
introduce you to the gentleman that's on
your screen right now if you're watching
the the video version of this or the
voice you're about to hear if you're
listening to the audio show and that's
one mr. Joel head flop Joel thank you so
much for joining us tonight
sotell thank you at both Juan Jules
actually it's not with us right now but
thank you so much for having us
I'm happy to be here and joining you and
the PocketNow family here it's been fun
keeping up with you guys in your channel
personally and excited to be jumping in
with some video work with you guys yeah
I'm Adam glad you brought it up that way
you know talking about family because
we've been having a lot of conversations
internally a pocket now as to how we
could expand that family and when we
were in those early conversations you
were absolutely an individual that I had
at the top of my list I've been a big
fan of the work that you've been doing
on your own personal channel so I wanted
to bring you in to start help us fill in
some of the gaps in our lineup from some
of the products that we haven't been
able to review we've are
be giving you a phone that you're going
to be posting a review at the end of the
week right yes
this is your quick update that means you
saw that then you know for watching the
video then you know which one was other
than that you know your news you got
away or if yes so so drop a comment the
first person who can identify that phone
you get no prizes
we're not giving any comments yes you
get a virtual high five from Joel and
and definitely hold on to that I think
that that high five will probably be
worth something in the coming years it
could be so we're going to be expanding
on the HTC u 11 you've had a chance to
check out some of the videos and stuff
that have been put out on this I may
actually did our primary hands-on but
before we get to that I wanted to take
just a minute to sort of sort of talk
about your background a little bit where
you're coming from helped introduce you
to our audience like like I said and I
mean this I really liked going through
your channel and seeing that you won you
weren't afraid to be critical um you
know that there were phones that I could
tell that you liked but that you were
still trying and working to to make sure
that you were showing off the pros and
cons of a specific device I'm you use a
V 20 so I know you've got good taste
obviously I've said this before but one
was right when they were originally
announcing it PocketNow covered a lot on
the b20 and i was between a couple
phones and hey video reviews work
because one convinced me because of you
20 and I haven't looked back it has been
great so coming high praise when I hear
that he likes my videos
high praise to him for his work we're
talking out and some gadget guy but but
more than anything else one of the
things that really struck me and and if
you can drill just scoots just a teeny
touch to your right perfect
yeah I know you've got some light there
I know you're gonna be a little bright
but just uh because I like to move
around to not lift yeah I was like I was
starting to lose you on my side there to
your to your left
um but but one of the things that I was
I was really happy to see on your
channel um you know in addition to you
not being afraid to be a little critical
and you I think you taking your response
commentary very seriously with it you
are also just approaching it with some
enthusiasm and and you know we've had
conversations about this offline just I
get why there's a certain vibe in tech
reviews but I'm a little tired
personally of kind of crafting around
the notion of everything's cool and
chill and I'm kind of over it because
you know I see all these things all over
the place and I'm super tech savvy so
whatevs and I personally want to like
show people when I'm excited or show
people when I'm concerned like that
little bit more emotion as we're talking
about these things and I really like
that you had a sense of that with the
community you were building on your own
channel yeah I love that I will say
though on my resume does say cool and
super tech savvy so you got me on that
no but I love I love what you're saying
there I love as much as I can to get
through every comment talking connect
with people that are watching my videos
I really want to throw off that vibe of
this like uber tech reviewer and just
say hey this is my experience this is
what I see the goods the bads if I'm
getting bad battery life I'm not going
to you know show this building well I
got 10 hours of screen on time now I got
three and a half on a good you know like
I wanna make sure that people are are
seeing the experience that I am and if
it's different for someone else let's
have a conversation about it
and you know I'll use the tech expertise
that I've learned over the years and
things like that to walk through with
people and hopefully give them a better
experience they can help make some good
informed decisions then we'll have some
fun along the way so that's how I
approach it and so it's fun having
conversations like this and getting to
talk to these phones and new devices and
really just jumping in together that
family aspect I always want to look at
the positive and then see a critical eye
of what we can maybe improve with those
things and you know give people the best
experience they can with watching a
video review right on and and and I've
also just sort of appreciated the fact
that I think you bring a pretty high
level of expertise to your video editing
so that that I think your videos look
good
in addition death that you could well
thought Apple not yeah I enjoy that and
part of that was college background of
doing video editing in college and just
more picking it up in the last couple
years just dig it in and and chopping
and swiping and putting things together
it's fun I enjoy it I'm more enjoyed
being on camera than editing but I do
like crafting a good story and script
and just ro seeing it from start to
finish and then really being like this
is my work let it be free let's get out
the world and getting those first likes
and comments and people appreciating
like I like that shine like I worked on
that later that wouldn't occur while
then edit took a lot like stupid edits
that should I don't need to spend this
long on them but I'm like if you really
cool add this tracking in here this
edited you know now I'm just wrapping up
a video this afternoon going like I
don't really need to do this I don't
need to do this and yet I still couldn't
help like I've got to get this macro
shot I've got to get up here like I need
my action figures in the background it's
visually interesting for the frame and I
totally appreciate that everywhere well
it's one thing you'll do for sure
well yeah I think that's another reason
why I had to bring you on - it's like a
compliment my Transformers collection I
needed some limited sci-fi and Star Wars
in there so yeah so person Zelda are the
majority in here but there's a plethora
of afraid of things around the room that
people pick up on and comment really oh
you like Dragon Ball Z or are you like
it's like hey alright so you know I
don't want to jump the tracks too much
but Dragon Ball Krillin has got to be
the most powerful human in the show
right I would think so yeah I mean as
far as humans go because it's either
like Crillon or TN and and I don't think
and it's definitely I'm sure nothing
that's deep enough we don't need to go
any any any dorkier on our anime god
right there I think enough people have
seen my Vegeta wall scroll up in the
side of my room and that set on this
shelf over here you can't see also I
have a couple Benghazi figures there so
so let's let's jump in so I really
wanted to chat you eleven with you
especially knowing your v20 owner and
one of the things that I think sold you
want to be twenty like I can see you're
wearing your sin II cans like I've got
the the 599 so those the 598 eight
mmm-hmm so yeah you know you know as
part of our gadget personal area network
of accessories and stuff I I know you
have an appreciation for higher quality
audio that that kind of a multimedia
experience and a company that I think
the company that was most responsible
for elevating the conversation with HTC
and so there are some steps that I think
are really interesting about the U 11 I
think there are a couple moves here by
HTC which might be a bit concerning in
kind of going through a lot of these
first impressions videos or first
hands-on videos what did you think of
the well first of all let's start with
the design and then you know we from
there I think we can we can move out to
some of the other hardware features but
the look of the phone this seems to be
HTC's new design language is is this
something that you think is going to
resonate with the smartphone buying
public that's that's hard to see yeah
with the HTC you ultra you know that was
kind of they're dipping their feet in
the water so to speak with it and they
had some weird hardware choices with
that so we'll put that aside that's not
their flagship this is so that aside
this is how they're moving forward and I
mean the the glass and the glosses is a
big deal and that's you know we see that
now g6 and the the s8 and I I mean it's
interesting I haven't gotten to hold the
different colorways but like the red
yellow one where you can kind of turn it
and it like looks like a solar flare
almost like generate the color ways how
they change I think it's an interesting
approach and it's a kind of flashy
but but it'll be interesting to see I
mean the definitely new fingerprint
magnets and will be a bit of bear to
keep clean but hey feel good in the hand
in there you know that I think they look
solid enough and most people would would
enjoy would enjoy a device that looked
like this for sure and I think the looks
are gonna turn anybody away I know I
definitely don't think that looks are
going to turn anyone away I'm curious if
we've actually managed to find the peak
of this glass back experiment though
where from all the different experience
you know like have you seen an honor
rate where it's got like those sort of
different reflective surfaces to make
like laser laughs that cut through the
back or a phone like well I really think
the note 7 was in a terrific example of
design for glass back obviously the
Galaxy s8 sort of following in that
footsteps but now getting this sort of
colour infused purposely mirrored
surface yeah have we have we kind of
peaked on both like the look in the
practicality this is a design
achievement I think this is something
which looks really stunning and yet I
know this is something that I'm gonna
probably not enjoy holding and as soon
as I have access to one I'm going to be
telling it into a case right yeah a case
or skin or something just yeah because I
feel like it is it is a big deal well
HTC has always kind of been big on their
their design and their manufacturing
with the aluminium body originally you
know how they were huge on that they're
like how it looks how it feels and so
they wanted to push that forward and
they've kind of done the same thing over
the years and so this departure here
yeah this big trend with the glass is a
big deal but the the mirror it is I
don't know it's pretty little for videos
chuckles but on everyday use it's like
is this going to be what I really want
on my phone and you're totally right I
might but I would put a case on that bad
boy right away yeah because no I think
it's really funny you know
the notion is like it looks really cool
but even in a talking with highmane and
a part of his video was like this thing
is really difficult to shoot yeah so
even be like really good for videos like
it's almost like again is the same thing
that I've said about the galaxy si it's
like I just want to put it in a glass
case under museum lighting yeah right
exactly I this isn't sort of limit leo
not the phone I think I would recommend
to my wife as her purse sort of eat
gadgets for breakfast right I'd maybe
not you know
maybe not recommend this one actually
right now she's most interested in the
BlackBerry so we're going to see if
she's going to take my review unit for
me see that's why I like the key one to
be twenty other phones sure they don't
look great but they're functional and I
just I could throw it around and I have
any issue like I know it's going to do
what it says it's going to do and not
let any flashiness get in the way and I
kind of met the practicality is is a big
deal to me I mean sure if it looks nice
that helps but you know we'll see if
that we'll be able to straight people
it's going to be a hard sell I think
because it's a solid device and there's
lots of great things going for it but
with the s8 in the g6 in this crowded
space right now is a mirrored finish is
that the biggest differential I don't
know I mean I'm looking at stats but you
know that doesn't always tell the inhale
and how the device is going to run I
love HTC's launcher and what they do
with their you know custom overlay but I
think you know it's real tasteful and
simple compared to you know TouchWiz and
some others but we'll see yeah I'm
always excited about new phones so well
and before we completely leave before we
completely leave this notion of design I
mean we can say like a phone like you
know the v20 is I think it's sort of
diesel truck charmingly ugly you don't
exactly I'm good yeah but
I look at a phone like the key one and
one of the things that I really like
about the key one is the feel in the
hand and the look of the phone it feels
like it was made for grownups right it
feels like it's designed to go with a
nice attache or a high quality corporate
bag of some kind the cases that
Blackberry picked people heard me talk
about this with Stephen shank on a
previous episode of the podcast but like
they partnered with to me which is a
company that's very well known the
respected bag manufacturer and you know
that's the branding that would be on the
back of your key one and it was
something that even my wife responded to
where it's a phone that recalls a gadget
like the note for you know the network
got pan for not being the sexiest phone
but it was metal in a grippy back which
had sort of an executive feel to it and
so the more I start looking at glasses
an experiment and I don't want to
trivialize this you know like oh it's a
phone for girls or something I mean that
at all it goes down on one Oh
technically I'm right on the cusp which
makes me yeah yeah curious as to who's
getting to decide that I think that
calendar right but when when we're
looking at looking at sign design can we
go to in Washoe to flash yeah I know
what you mean
yeah and the the 3d Gorilla Glass that
edges over the corners I would like to I
want to see how that feels in the hand
cuz that looks solid
it makes it look you know like it melts
in it's not a curved edge necessarily
like the s8 is but it is the form factor
lends to that and to me I like the sa
and I think it feels great in the hand
but I really this could be just me but I
like the note 7 better and the way it
melt in the hand it was a little more
subtle of a curve but it had on the
curve on the back and on the front yeah
but not as harsh as the si is and yeah
it was kind of like the good sweet spot
between it not too much of that but
you know each their own maybe people
laps maybe people absolutely love that
but I'm fine with 16 9 18 and 1/2 by 9
is cool and I'm sure a lot more phones
will do that but the you alter that of
the 11 still 69 correct yeah it still
going to be that 2 by 9 in and I'll be
I'll be really curious to see what other
companies pick up on that but I'm real
quick now let's jump into let me see if
I can find just the specs here that we
can put up on camera so uh we're looking
at a snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM
64 gigabytes of storage with micro SD
card expansion the 3000 milliamp hour
battery a new 12 ultra pixel 3 camera
I'll be really curious to dig into that
16 megapixel front-facing camera ip67 uh
water-resistant and quick charge 3 dot
oh so these all feel like like the
requisite flagship specs for phone this
year that's why they even bumped down to
the 1.7 aperture to even less time with
the larger pixels and that's always
that's been HTC sting for a long time
even you know way back in the one day
when they're like oh you could get by
with 4 megapixels cuz they're all true
out big so everybody was like here you I
was I was completely on that experiment
I was completely on board it was it for
me though that year the top two phones
were the Lumia 920 and the HTC One m7 in
that order yeah until the next year when
my one aim m7 fell prey to the Purple
Haze and then I was like no I'm done
with you I had this is dead to me he I
remember that yeah that was such a
bummer because yeah we're getting really
really good shots with it yeah I was
yeah I was gonna buy I was actually
going to buy it around the time that
they all started getting purple haze and
I was like he never money I don't need
that it was shocking to me that I had a
phone that operated great for about a
year and then uh just went like
completely Barney the Dinosaur
it was just terrible yeah well and
that's a good testament to HTC they had
a super solid the devices with those and
so I'm Rob rooting for them because
they've they've had a little bit of a
kerfuffle so to speak you know a little
bit of a bump in the road here and this
this is looking like a good solid entry
I don't think they took too many risks
to go over the top with it but they
definitely check some good marks here
for a really solid flagship that that
should get some attention so yeah I
think it's interesting because we've
we've also been having this conversation
with LG and I think you know LG means
maybe been a little bit more successful
in the transition so from a g4 era of
LG's to now we've gone through some
weird experiments some odd design
choices and we arrived at the g6
and the g6 we hold it in your hand is a
phone that feels like it makes sense now
HWC it's interesting because I don't
think HTC's had quite the same kind of
teething pain like they didn't have a
weird modular phone they didn't have a
really hard stop they just had a
slowdown I guess just a mediocre couple
phones well I think they were definitely
affected like in HT c + LG we're both I
think ravaged by the Qualcomm 810 series
of processors though yeah yeah so the
one m9 from a design standpoint is a
killer phone it's a great phone but it's
wildly inconsistent performer same thing
with the LG G flex 2 you know both of
those phones being out early using that
chipset very I mean like moments where
those things are screamers and then most
of the time the phone is throttling
itself or the yoga the full benefit of
that performance but their their
response
you know the HTC 10 was on point and I
think we had just gone through so many
the one the what was the one a9 was
another sort of just mediocre halfway
step in trying to make a mid-rare
and and then the the you ultra just an
odd phone to release so we don't have a
lit doesn't seem like we have a lot of
confidence in brand right now especially
from the carrier standpoint that yes is
a this isn't a phone that's being widely
embraced right now it seems like the
only carrier that's on board is sprint
for getting this phone into showrooms
outside of if you guys seem to make you
happy there I'm on spread yeah we do
they might get acquired by t-mobile soon
but we'll see always seen what I mean
you know what honey Devin that could be
great for a sprint user though right
yeah I mean it could because they could
they could really get some more
expansion although they are they are
pushing right now um you know the Ltd 5g
there's they're saying that they're
going to be the first to expand out you
know everyone's saying that though but
we'll see each carrier has their big
thing that they will be the big next and
and they're going to get a new
spokespersons that's going to crack on
the other guy there's a big battle but
it wouldn't hurt to have three big leads
instead of just the two big leads and
then two minor leads right you know
because t-mobile is definitely growing
and they're getting into that space but
a teensy and Verizon are just kind of
overtaking things but didn't me to
derail things no no no because you know
this was also one of the other top
stories about the you 11 was this sort
of carrier because it's not even like a
carrier exclusivity it's sort of akin to
what we went through with the pixel you
know Verizon was the official only
carrier exclusive a place to stock the
phone but then t-mobile would also like
well you could just go buy a pixel and
use it on t-mobile and we'll cut you a
deal and then sink to a lot of normal
consumers for sure
right so why do people talk personally
they're like oh no I can't get the pixel
it's only on Verizon I'm like oh and all
wrong the I this this will be curious to
see can
HTC see one of the biggest problems and
we've we've cracked on LG a lot for this
- but HTC is maybe even worse at this is
can they get that message out to
consumers it's not enough anymore to
make let's say that the U 11 is the best
phone of the year and maybe we get it
and it turns out that this is just an
amazing combination of technologies of
hardware of software and somehow this
phone is like the absolute best
all-rounder all consumers should be
using it so they actually get that
message out to consumers you know it
hard because Samsung and Apple and just
kill it on marketing it's just destroy
other people and in HTC you know they
have Robert Downey jr. fer was at the
nine of the ten oh god it was so like
and then LG had Jason Statham there like
with the five and if they're not doing
well I hire me I love this mic Wellner
you they can't now because you're a part
of the pocket now family that would be
okay are you sure they couldn't possibly
pay you well enough to leave pocket it
is I'm just like who's making these
decisions and like how it is passing
through sometimes because I'm like these
are some silly silly things and
Samsung's just crushing it and an Apple
sister I would say Samsung has probably
the best phone marketing like Apple just
has the brand that wins right now to the
solid brand and they have more people
but as man boy do I ever see people
switching over Samsung in droves just
because of the marketing and they're
like oh that display oh you know it's
what you know so especially with the
seven that was waterproof that's Evan
and that's when a lot of people were
like oh the galaxy phone is a great
device it's waterproof and that was like
and glass so so that's when I saw a lot
of people regular consumers say oh yeah
this samsung galaxy thing could be an
iPhone alternative totally um
I mean it really did and like Samsung to
their credit actually did put themselves
out there you know this was a threshold
that now every other manufacturer is
stepping up to to match or it used to be
like we would get these really weird
Japanese one-off phones because Japan
has different regulations on things like
device durability so you know Japan got
the LGV 34 and they are the only ones to
core that phone yeah because it was
water-resistant and so now I think
manufacturers are sort of getting hit to
the fact that like this is something
that consumers want to pay for across
the worker hold not just because a
government holding they had to there was
a bunch of people that were commenting
on my videos saying Joel please review
the the LG 34 I'm like I can't like I
guess I can import it but well anyway
for us like you were pretty you we've
got pretty good relationships with
different you know our people and stuff
and you're like no it's a Japanese only
phone you're like well people watch our
videos in Japan it and they're like yeah
I'm not gonna have it so uh before
before we leave this off I wanted to get
your thoughts as another fellow v20
owner I'm going to see I'm scanning
through the video right now so no
headphone jack
HTC the company that that brought us
boom sound killer speakers and really
high quality headphone audio is now
playing the USBC audio game and I was
just wondering what your thoughts on
that might be given your really
expensive Sennheiser headphones that
you're wearing right now single-tier
because of people that happening no yeah
I know it's somewhat inevitable at this
point with the given fact that how
mobile is going and you're somebody
manufacturers ditching it but I really
thought HTC would hold on to it longer
just because the innovations with the
boom sound and their DAC and everything
is sounding so good
and when they first didn't put the front
boom sound speakers a little my heart
just just fell a little bit and then
whenever I you know saw them do this I
was like HDC I mean one redeeming fact
is they do have the USBC noise
cancelling headphones in the box which
which okay that's nice and I'm looking
forward to a real audio via you but and
I don't know how good the DAC is in here
if it still as good as the 10 was that's
something to look forward to but man
that's a bummer I really want them to
hold on to it and I think there will be
people that will be a little bummed out
about it I'm Mike and I can hear that
this is an idea that's potentially one
generation of Android ahead of its time
yeah as we know from the Android Oh beta
some of the news that's been coming out
of Google i/o and then just like we've
been working with some of the developer
previews on Android Oh pocket now behind
the scenes we haven't done a lot of
coverage on it just because there
actually hasn't been a ton to cover as
of yet but one of the focuses of Android
Oh seems to be finally delivering on the
promises of jellybean of improving
Android audio and one of the major one
of the major I mean obviously they're
looking at Bluetooth including aptX and
aptX HD and Sony's codecs for wireless I
don't know there you go okay but a major
problem with Android has always been its
USB audio support you know this Linux
kernel is fine it should be fine for
supporting USB i/o for audio but it just
really hasn't been implemented well on
an android level some phones have
executed editor than others and so we're
fingers crossed again that Android Oh
will be the operating system that
enables this if that's true then we can
finally start moving over like for
example you're wearing a
her Sennheiser headphones I would love
to take the DAC out of the hands of
smartphone manufacturers where some of
them do an amazing job but most of them
just put in the bare minimum this will
drive an audio signal to regular
consumer headphones and just imagine
what we do with a Sennheiser designed
USB DAC for their headphones oh and all
we're waiting on is something that will
work universally so that it's not like
it'll work on some Samsung phones and
some you know wah wave it's it has to be
consistently supported across all of
Android or else USB see audio is a
non-starter and I think this is going to
be a small misstep for HTC if this works
like the HTC bolt or the HTC you ultra
where they're USB C headphones only work
with that phone right work with another
phone or they don't work with my laptop
it's buggy it's kind of a waste yeah
and that's that is frustrating and maybe
HTC knows something about fuchsia that
we don't ah yeah that's hilarious
they're building this for an operating
system that's still in like the get high
definitely not definitely not but yeah
that's that when I heard there you know
the headphones didn't work with other
things I was like how how hard is that
well that's so a little bit different
but USB see in general that's why the
surface laptop that Microsoft came out
with the reasoning they said they didn't
put USB C on it was because of the
confusion of cables you know that people
have for charging cables and they didn't
want somebody to grab a USBC cable and
throw it in the bag and it be a 2.0 and
not be able to power their their surface
laptop and so they said we're doing the
proprietary surface charging cable and
you get one USB 3.1 a and you're like
wait what I feel I feel it was
Koni in response to the potential of
consumer confusion because I think they
were like let's pat ourselves on the
back for our great business you know I
don't know but now that was that was it
it's true there's just a lot of
confusion and USBC it's definitely
future it's it's it's so great but they
really need to fix the playing field
with audio with synching with you know
and just Thunderball everything with it
could be so much more healing with lines
what's frustrating here is that I think
that we've got the right beginnings for
a spec from us BC from from the
consortium of us B I'm a huge fan of
thunderbolt unfortunately it looks like
Thunderbolts maybe not going to win as a
proper standard for our computers
because of an USB C on peripherals to me
doesn't make any sense
if I were Microsoft I would say well
we've got Thunderbolt ports on this
computer and they'll work with anything
USB or Thunderbolt so it shouldn't
matter that would be my solution but I'm
not a multi-billion dollar company I
think this is where I'm probably more
inclined to throw shade at HTC and
Motorola where they have come up with
proprietary solutions that use a
standard plug and that to me is one of
the most frustrating aspects of talking
about a phone like the bolt or the the
moto Z we add we have a standard but
there's no interoperability is it so if
we're going to tag Apple for getting rid
of the headphone jack and like oh I
can't take my lightning connector ear
pods and plug them into my macbook well
yeah there's no port on a MacBook which
accepts lightning it's very clear that
felt ear pods will not work on your
MacBook but if I have a USB C port on or
a thunderbolt port on my laptop and I
plug in my HTC headphones and they don't
work why why would you do that to me and
now it was I've got a care
my headphones from my laptop and my
headphones for my phone or I've got to
invest in some kind of wireless solution
which people may or may not be inclined
to do well I thought it was so funny the
right when the axon 7 came out you know
no headphone jack and they're like
included headphones in the box can't be
used with your macbook break you then
you're like duh don't have a Lightning
ports USB see they're not the same thing
but I just thought it was funny some
like a bunch of videos and things were
like okay bring it time I'm like no
that's not doing that really that's not
a rant about our situation
hello and and especially and especially
that I I've yet to sign my get HTC or
Motorola include both headphones and a
3.5 millimeter adapter and again you're
you're rocking a great pair of
headphones there's no reason why you
should have to buy different headphones
or even use like if they came included
in the box when a 50 cent cable right
maybe it's a dollar a dollar Donnell
will get you plugged in so I'm hoping
that HTC recognizes that there are other
things that people are concerned with
you can give me great earbuds in the box
and I will be happy to have great
earbuds the bolt earbuds are very nice
but I don't like them as much as I like
my in-ear monitors I don't like them as
much as I like my Sennheiser's I don't
like them yeah which is even I don't
even like them as much as I like my V
Moto's and I'd rather use my V motives
and if I can't do that then you've given
me a legitimate reason to consider a
competing device yeah and that's a
bummer because I mean if you're the like
a tech of gear and you have a wall of 15
headphones I don't support it work style
I was just I was going to say yeah it's
a century you know you have all of those
on the back behind you and you're like I
can use one of these yeah look like yes
I'm using these again today well I go
out and I know my usage
not typical because I have earbuds that
I like for music
I have earbuds that I like for gaming I
have headphones that I like you know I
have a pair of headphones that I like
for movies you know because you know
movies are mixed in a very you know very
different ways especially action films
so you know I'm not expecting people to
use or to you know accessorize their
phones like I am but the thing I can
point to is to say like when I'm using
my phone with this pair of headphones
I'm having this kind of an experience
and so whatever you feel is most
important to you maybe that's how you
might want to buy it if you pick up an
HSE you can't do any of this ha ha ha ha
and that to me is worrisome for a
company that maybe will sell you a Down
go like ah well you know even if they
want to sell me I just don't know that
there is one and I might be wrong there
and someone will absolutely correct me
in the comments I was not aware of a
good HTC dongle solution so I don't know
if they're using additional pins on USB
C to carry an audio signal from a DAC
that's in the phone I don't know if I
directed to put a built into the into
the headphones and into a dongle adapter
like Apple does I just don't know and
that's one of those things like right I
would be very curious to see I'll be
very curious to see how the the UL Evan
handles that hey what's that for sure oh
the dongle life is on your life it so
it's it's legit these days we're
definitely all sort of in the same boat
there so Joel final thoughts um HTC u11
what are you what are you thinking is
this is this the direction HTC should be
building upon or do you think we might
see another sort of experiment from them
kind of like we did after LG went from
the g5 to the g6
well I it's tough to see because we
definitely want to see how the market
takes it but I think it's going to be
hard for them with the g6 and s8
this could be the most incredible phone
that HTC has ever produced
and it and it get lost a little bit in
the crowd yeah I've already seen
some tech reviewers saying I don't know
if I'm going to pick this up and I'm
like ooh that's harsh when you know you
have these big markets so we'll see I
think that it could really be a big win
for them if they get a really solid
device and it's going to check the marks
and from everything I've seen it looks
great it but it is is it going to get
lost in the crowd like the ten did you
know like that was a great device and I
see people doing the you know the one
year reviews and like this is still a
great device you can still get it really
cheap but but it's it's hard when when
you're you're up against such a great
competition so it'll be interesting for
me to see six months from now three four
months from now if they decided okay
let's scrap that all glass was a great
idea or this wasn't a great idea let's
go with the 89 and make a more sleek
phone yeah I don't I I'm not a
definitive answer for you on this one
it's well unclear right now yeah it
doesn't have anything like we're going
to be in I think this will be a little
bit of an iteration on them testing out
if this is what's best for them and then
they make a change in the future that's
my leaning is this is an iteration
they'll test it out and move forward
with it I'm rooting for him come on HTC
bring back the headphone jack right now
before I report for it well I was
definitely feeling that way about the 10
when I went to revisit it I got to do
the after the buzz and it really I think
it really was one of the most underrated
phones of last year it was it was so
much out but also a great performer all
over um that that's the thing you said
this before I think he might have even
said it near s8 Plus talk is like a
phone does everything well but like what
is its main goal in the phone and with
the s8 it's kind of like look at this
display you want to buy a new one at my
command with HTC you know 110 it was
like it's great DAC you know the stereo
speakers that they have with the
earpiece and that sound good they sound
solid you know
everything was really good about it but
it wasn't like wowing you with this one
big thing and it was really similar to
him nine in a lot of ways with design
and so it was like you people didn't
really take to it the same way but man
if you just want to recommend like a
good phone to people that would be a
great one to do still today I would say
I'm sure you can pick it up pretty cheap
at this point I've seen some some budget
clearance on it recently so yeah totally
well Joel I want to thank you for
jumping in man this was this was a great
chat yeah well tell you have a have
we'll definitely be looking to have you
on more regularly you're your first
video again we're kind of keeping that

sending it out that willing that all the
powers that be think it is a good at it
it might be a little bit later than that
if if some other things get changed
around so we'll see what that yeah how
long as they edit through I'll be one of
the people critiquing that edit so you
better you better bring your a-game
