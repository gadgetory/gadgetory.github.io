pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to talk about a new free browser
that you've gotta try call netfront
browser for android let's get to it so
this browser is the most visually
intense browser available for android
just in the way that it lets you
navigate between web pages it's actually
quite very innovative so what we can do
here is look at this zoomed out tab
management view but it doesn't just show
you your open tabs with this nice little
carousel at the top and by the way you
can have up to eight tabs open and it
shows you how many you have open at a
given time with the little indicators
along the bottom if you go all the way
to the left you get to a search page
where you can also put in a URL for a
new website so not only do you get to
see your open tabs but you can also
swipe through your bookmarks here or if
you swipe to the right this is really
cool shows you your web history so if
you don't remember the page you were
looking at earlier you can flick through
your entire web history do you find
something you like you just tap on it
and it will open it up here on the top
of the screen so let's dive into one of
these pages that has already loaded
performance is quite good it's a little
bit choppy I guess it depends on which
device you are using and here is what
the interface looks like when you are
actually in a web page we're going to go
to the desktop view of pocket now to get
a better view of what we have here
rendering speeds are quite good they're
not as fast as the stock android browser
but definitely quite good for a new
browser of course it's free so that
gives you another reason to try it so
it's almost unloading now it's done and
we're going to flick down the page
quickly see if there's any checkerboard
there isn't there is no multi-touch
support so you have to do the manual
zoom here so when you tap on the screen
you get a zoom slider and you can tap
into zoom kind of cumbersome not ideal
you can also double tap to zoom in but
it doesn't reflow the column which is a
little bit archaic for a modern browser
so let's click onto one of these pages
and see what it's like now it does
intelligently pull YouTube content so we
can play the YouTube video there and it
will
the YouTube player let's zoom out and go
to another web page swipe over here to
the right so as you can see very very
smooth tab management if you look at
lots of tabs at one time so here we've
engadget we're going to flick really
quickly down the page see if we can get
checkerboards and there are none so it
keeps up very well with fast scrolling
it's also got a really cool feature
called tilt mode so if you turn it
sideways it will actually show you the
website in a different view now the
reason that this is helpful is because
it lets you see more text kind of in the
diagonal view but I don't see many
people using this view it's just very
strange so we're just going to dial into
landscape view here and try to get a
little bit closer on something tap it
open see how long it takes to open the
particular page so here we are pretty
fast page load times again not as good
as the stock android browser it's a
little bit annoying not having the
multi-touch because you can't be as
precise but once the page is loaded
everything comes up fast you don't get
any checkerboards and this really
awesome 3d view is just fantastic you
can close tabs by pressing the X you can
favorite a particular page in one touch
by tapping on the star button here says
added to bookmark so now if we flip
throw you can see all the bookmarks you
can also change the display here
bookmarks by date added or by most
visited so it'll put the most visited
sites here in the front of all of your
favorites you can also go to manage and
you can change all of your bookmarks you
can delete some you can add some and do
everything right from that screen let's
die on tough settings real quick we can
change the default zoom level so you can
change it too far close or medium can
choose whether to load images fit screen
fit page to screen with block pack up
pop-ups enable javascript enable plugins
so that you can look at the YouTube
content enable angle display which is
that really weird kind of slanted view
that I don't think many people are going
to use cookies location which keeps
actually going into turning on the GPS
on this phone which is quite annoying
remember username and passwords and so
on and so forth so overall a really
innovative browser that you should
absolutely try because it's free really
helps you to manage
abs in a really fluid interface that we
haven't seen yet on any other browser
that's out there right now if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
