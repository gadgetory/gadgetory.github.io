now calm Opera has released Opera Mobile
for Android is it good enough for you to
use it as your daily browser let's take
a look now opera has had Opera Mini for
Android for a while now but Opera Mobile
is the fully fledged browser from opera
that includes some of the features of
Opera Mini plus it adds a lot more that
really makes the experience better so
let's take a look at Opera Mobile for
Android now Windows Mobile users know
Opera Mobile very well it's been around
on Windows Mobile since the days of HTC
touch diamond2 fantastic browser it had
great CAD management in later versions
we got the speed dial and now it's on
Android so let's talk about how his
interface is so of course we have the
speed dial which is an awesome tool and
comma sort of from Google Chrome where
you can put your favorite websites here
so right when you launch the browser you
can jump into the sites that you want to
see so if we press + on one of these it
shows us our recent history so let's add
PocketNow and it's actually going to try
to pull a thumbnail from pocket now to
kind of give you a nicer visual
experience and there it did that let's
add another we're going to add regular
Engadget and it is pulling the
information from there and there we go
and what we can do is tap and hold on
one of the speed dials to clear it off
or to edit it so let's go to a website
and talk about browsing around on a page
let's start off with Engadget this is
actually going to the mobile version of
Engadget I should mention that I have
opera turbo turned on right now which is
users use a server-side rendering talk
about that in a minute so we should get
faster page loads here so here it comes
launched loading the full version of
Engadget not super fast but it's coming
along quite nicely we can browse the
page while it's loading and scrolling is
pretty darn fast we're getting a little
bit of checker boards but in all
fairness the site hasn't finished
loading yet so it's coming up now let's
move around on the page quickly we do
get a little bit of blank spots the
scrolling is fast once everything is
cached and and rendered but in that
first scroll you get a little bit of
checker boards we can also pinch to zoom
here which works quite some
we can zoom out another thing you can do
to get closer you can tap one time which
is kind of odd for a mobile browser
usually it's a double tap to zoom in but
in this case it is a single tap so they
move around on the screen but we can do
a lot of things with tabs so I'm
actually in the full-screen view right
now so the tab interface isn't showing
what I can do here is open up the tab
interface launch another site go back
into the tab interface what launched yet
another site you can see how this gets
really fast with this great tab
management in Opera Mobile for Android
so I'm just gonna keep loading on web
sites here so you can get a sense for
the performance that this browser brings
when you're running lots of different
web pages at one time it's about four
open now let's make a fifth okay so now
we have five tabs open and you may have
noticed I didn't wait for the other tabs
to finish while I went to the next one
and let's see if they actually loaded
and it looks like they actually did so
this is a really cool way to flip
between tabs you've run out of space
pretty quickly though so you may not
want to be running more than five tabs
at a time but the pages continued to
load even as other tabs loaded which was
quite fantastic let's check out the full
version of Gizmodo here see if we have
that same problem with the page
struggling a little bit to keep up now
of course we have a landscape view if I
slide out the keyboard here it uses the
accelerometer but I have that disabled
on this particular device will go back
into portrait let it finish loading so
here it is Gizmodo loaded quite fast
again we're using the opera turbo let's
scroll down the page so in this case
very smooth everything is there
everything is loaded and we can tap to
zoom in move around on the page very
smooth panning and scrolling let's go to
another part of this website and see how
fast that comes through whoa is that
that's all ready it's loaded using opera
turbo things are rendered on the server
opera servers and then they're beamed
down to your device the downside is
there's some privacy concerns right
because if you're sending your
information to opera first and then down
to you they're probably being able to
track that information but if you're
doing just casual web browsing it's a
good idea to leave opera turbo turned on
so let's jump into the settings
these settings may look very familiar to
Windows Mobile users is the same kind of
thing let's go into settings to
different things of note here load
images as on opera turbo is turned on
opera link is a feature we're not going
to talk about here mobile view is turned
off full screen it's probably something
you may want to keep off actually
because it hides the tab feature unless
you press the Android button you can
choose text wrap and the zoom mode and
so now we have the non full screen mode
so all the time we have access to these
handy shortcuts and we can move between
them although it's it's not the kind of
interface where you can sort of swipe
your finger and go to another one it
doesn't really work like that it's more
like tapping on another one so that the
others move out of the way and let's see
how this handles a website like mini
clips calm it's actually a flash site
that lets you play some some games so
let's check that out
okay so we're done loading here is
pretty fast there so let's see what
happens when you press play now you
probably know what's going to happen
here and you probably could have guess
what would happen nothing happened
because it doesn't support flash content
here in Opera Opera Mobile but of course
you can use a stock Android browser with
the Adobe Flash 10.1 plugin if you want
to get some flash content on your
Android 2.2 device so overall a really
fast browser that is plenty good enough
for you to use as your daily driver if
you're looking for an alternative to the
stock Android browser does great tab
management it is opera turbo to give you
a little bit of a boost especially when
you're over at slower connection and
then has this really nice start page
just a really nice interface that people
from windows mobile world may remember
very very highly recommended browser if
you're looking for another kind of
browsing experience please thumbs up
