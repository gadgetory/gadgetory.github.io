pakka calm and today we shoot a new game
from windows mobile market place called
droplets 2.0 so let's get started so the
game droplets 2.0 is a relatively fun
and addictive puzzle game and I'll show
you exactly how to play in just a second
let's go into some of the settings so if
you neither have the sound on or sound
off as you can hear it we can see our
scoreboard and the graphics are pretty
cool when it moves and transitions from
one screen to another we can go back and
we can either continue select a level if
you've already played it or start a new
game so let's view the instructions real
quick so you can move your drop either
left right up or down but it must touch
another drop to activate that point and
as you see here that's the only one that
is available all the others are illegal
moves and you can also get a hint or
undo and menu and timer and your score
whatnot so we're just going to go back
and now we're going to start a new game
and I'll show you how to play I'm just
going to choose mega mode and as you can
see there's 300 levels so without a time
limit and will just begin this so the
first thing you'll need to do is
activate these drops so it's pretty
simple we'll just move this drop down
and it's activated that drop and it says
well done course a very easy level here
to do this one will move it over and
then move it down so also a very easy
level and it becomes more increasingly
difficult as the game goes on and there
are other challenging objects that come
on the screen such as this black droplet
which is an Eightball droplet and it
must be the last droplet on the screen
and there's also a ladybug droplet which
I'll show you in just a second if it
reaches that level so let's see here
we'll need to use this drop to destroy
those two drops and as you see we have
the last drop is the 8-ball droplet so
continue on
let's see here if we can get to the
ladybug droplet will just continue let's
see this one looks a little more
challenging oh of course I I messed up
on that one so if i needed a hint i can
just go here says some moves will be
rolled back to provide a hint okay so
now i can either undo and start over if
i want and as you see it gives me a hint
and it tells me how to beat that level
and here's one of the ladybug droplets
so try don't try to fling droplets into
ladybug so they'll pops okay okay hmm
let's see here how we're going to do is
let's see that maybe they're there and
in here and now we have our last droplet
and we've completed that level so we can
just go back this game is pretty fun it
is to dollars on the windows mobile
marketplace but there is also a free
version available if you so choose to
play that game before purchasing the
full version and this is in the
marketplace pic and the purpose called
droplets 2.0 and you find that on the
windows mobile marketplace and i will
post a link on pocketnow.com as to how
to get that and if you do like her
videos of course always give us a thumbs
up and leave some comments thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
