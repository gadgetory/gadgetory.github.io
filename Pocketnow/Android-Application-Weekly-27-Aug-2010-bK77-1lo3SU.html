Park geun-hye com and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started if you've ever been out and
about with friends and had a couple of
ideas to do certain activities flipping
a coin is great option heads wins tails
loses whichever you decide but what
happens if you don't have a point well
this application is called coin flip and
it is free on the android market works
either by touching the coin or you can
use the onboard accelerometer on your
device to flip the coin you can also
change the coin and change the
background this application is called
convert pad and it is free on the
android market and it allows you to
confer practically any sort of formula
or volume wait mass practically every
sort of conversion that's out there
directly on your android device so II i
have here 185 pounds i wanted to figure
out how many kilograms that is it's 83.9
1 which is much more easier than
dividing it by 2.2 so this application
also allows you to add your own
user-defined units as well as your
favorite units if you like to exercise
and keep track of your heart rate then
instant heart rate is the program for
you this application uses the onboard
camera similar to the way that a pulse
oximeter works at a Medical Center so
all you have to do is place a finger
underneath the camera and if your device
has it it will also turn on the light
and we'll just let it sit here for one
second and we'll see if it starts
reading my heart rate it detects the
changes in color when your blood is
saturated with oxygen ok so my pulse is
around 82 through 85 this application is
called keeper and it allows you to keep
track of all your passwords and
usernames and whatnot on many different
accounts and this application is free on
the android market so if i wanted to
look at my bank of america account i can
just go here look at my username and
also my password another cool feature
about this program is if you want to
create a unique username for
you can just click right here and it
will create a very unique username as
well as a very unique password backup
all your usernames and passwords as well
as sync with your computer whether you
want to lose weight gain weight or keep
a constant weight myfitnesspal which is
free on the android market is a great
application to have what you do is you
input your initial weight and your goal
weight and then it tracks how many
calories you should eat or decrease
during the day so as you can see I have
a breakdown of all the foods that eat
and I can also add things to my diary if
I click here let's say I want to add
some water it can also add exercises if
I want we'll save the changes and I can
go back home and do all the nutrition
information for everything that I've
eaten so this has been another episode
