calm and in this video we're going to do
a quick comparison between Windows Phone
8 and Android 4.1 let's check it out
okay we're going to start with a cold
boot we have the Galaxy Nexus on the
left and the Windows Phone 8x on the
right both of those were held down at
the same time we're booting up now both
these have a dual-core processors this
one is 1.5 gigahertz while this one is
1.2 and both have one gig of ram so here
we go booting up it's taking a little
bit of a little while here and we're
waiting
anyway in this video as we wait we're
going to talk about the lockscreen you
know the homescreen differences probably
a sum game performance a few similar
apps you know the web browser and we'll
also take a look at this source
I think the Nexus may have frozen
because it really shouldn't be taking
that long so I'm gonna cut the video and
pull the battery out okay it took a few
reboots but we got a Android 4.1 one
running on the Galaxy Nexus and here we
are at the lock screens and you see over
here I have a CNN app that's loading a
picture and a news headline down here we
have a calendar the day and the time and
we have little notifications of emails
or Facebook whatnot and over here we
have a little lock icon on the time the
day and you have little notifications up
here to about emails and Facebook and
everything that might be going on so
let's see how customizable these are so
here we are in the lock screen settings
on both Android 4.1 and Windows Phone 8
and you see we have all these options
for what kind of lock you're gonna have
on your lock screen so you can do a
pattern unlock you can do face
recognition you can do pin password and
over here we can turn password on and
then just choose a you know numeric
password
but we have lots of customization
options for the background image
third-party apps appear here and each
app has its own little options sometimes
we have show artists while playing on
the lockscreen and we can choose what
kind of information appears there as
well over here we also have just the
background image raelia that we can
change and it uses the same background
as the normal operating system and of
course there's all sorts of apps that
you can use to install on android and
customize it we're just going to go over
the the stock android right now now the
home screens there's a significant
differences here i'm Windows Phone 8 we
have a infinitely scrollable Start
screen where you can arrange all sorts
of live tiles and you can make them into
three different sizes a full width a
square a large square a small square and
they have they can display all sorts of
information whether a calendar
information there's a radar map there's
news stories there's Groupon information
and over here on Android we also have
all sorts of widgets that can also
display all sorts of information but we
have a horizontally scrolling home
screen design and by default that it's
limited to the number of home screens
that you can add stuff to but you see we
have little icons for programs sometimes
we have big wide weather widgets
sometimes you know there's an another
different size which is so widgets can
be all sorts of different sizes and
sometimes they'll fit sometimes they
won't but you have a huge amount of
customization options over there on
Android now when it comes to the program
listing
there's your Android version
and for Windows Phone 8 you scroll all
the way to the bottom you can see the
arrow you don't really you don't always
have to scroll all the way to bottom you
could just swipe it and here's our
program listing it's a vertical
scrolling design whereas over here we
have a big grid of icons all of their
labels underneath and you can scroll the
side-to-side to get more grids and then
widgets so everything is here and you
can scroll side aside
the advantage of a vertically scrolling
design is that say I'm holding it with
one hand I don't have to move my finger
that much to get to something else you
know I can just keep moving a little bit
a little bit a little bit and now I'm
out the thing that I want or is over
here
I really have to if I swipe it like that
and I want this one up there
I really have to reach way up there with
my finger and so a lot of hand movement
it's kind of difficult sometimes ok so
now let's look at the performance of a
few similar apps so here I have CNN
showing up here and seeing in there and
let's just try to do at the same time
and they both started pretty quickly but
it looks like the Windows Phone has
loaded everything a little bit faster
and you you see the difference in design
of course that's loading this is already
done all right let's try another one
about Facebook let's get to that one
ready
both of those at the same time this is a
very Internet intensive app and we see
Windows Phone seems to have gotten up a
little quicker
and both seem pretty smooth scrolling
let's try one more
how about Twitter let's do those at the
same time here we go and Android the
Android version uh one that I match up
now how about a game because those are
pretty intensive on the memory let's see
where's the one that I want
here we go both unloading this is going
to do Facebook don't want that and the
Android version looks to be in the lead
and the Windows Phone version is kind of
stuck okay now that we have them both on
the same page we're gonna navigate a
little bit let's do some flicking you
see that Windows Phone has two rerender
a little bit sometimes whereas the
Galaxy Nexus
it's a pretty smooth the whole time and
let's go to one of these pages let's see
both at the same time when his phone
starts quicker and for some reason this
one went to the mobile site but we're
loading more over here see if you can
get rid of these ads all right now let's
try a video zoom in a little bit get
ready
and it looks like windows phone went
faster okay lastly let's just compare
the stores and see what's in there so
that's good at play store
I'm just launching at the same time see
what happens this one came off right
away a nice animation where we saw a
loading screen over here so here's a big
difference in the design we have
something featured up here at the top we
have different categories apps music
magazines movies and TV books over here
we don't have as many categories we just
have apps games music and podcasts
there's no movies and TV there's no
magazines there's no books and we have a
very different design there's a feature
app very landscape style layout so let's
go to apps over here again big grid some
ads
there's a bunch of different apps there
of course Android has many many more
thousands of apps but over here I'm when
it's phone we have some interesting
features
there's your spotlight this is a good
one pics for you where it chooses apps
that you might like based on what your
friends like and what is popular so you
can see some my friends like that one
and we also have that over here
recommend it for you
so androids recommended for you is based
on Google+ and also what's popular and
what you may have downloaded before the
music store again we see design
differences nicely there's a recommended
for you in Google Play which is
something Zune had a long time ago but
they did not implement it in Windows
Phone 8 for some reason and we have nice
few featured music some free ones that's
pretty nice so that's a quick little
comparison between Android 4.1 and
Windows Phone 8 there's lots of
differences we could go on and on about
all the differences but we just wanted
to show you a few different things
obviously some have advantages and some
have disadvantages one's better
sometimes one's better the other time so
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
and that's it for now
