Store and brings us a lot of details
android 4.3 starts showing to a batch of
Samsung Galaxy devices but not all of
them and Apple retains a multi-touch
patent that could mean trouble for
competitors I'm hi mera neta and please
apple today is Friday and it is not time
for another patent soap opera part 2
this is pocket now daily lets her stay
off with some official news as at duplex
is now providing market stats for
Windows Phone and yes it's no secret no
kiss boning the market but guess by how
much the company owns a staggering
ninety percent of the market when
compared to HTC Samsung and Huawei but
guess which phone is actually winning
that race it turns out to be the
budget-friendly Lumia 520 and if you
want to look at the 920 for example it
owns like a nine percent of market and
then the Lumia 1020 is actually nowhere
to be found which makes is worried could
this be that you know when those phone
is turning to the next budget operating
system let's see let's continue talking
about Samsung as their update to Android
4.3 is now rolling to the galaxy s4 but
not every model obviously it's going out
to the International XO knows arcta I
9500 and the LT variant of the
international model i9505 if you're like
us in the United States you will not be
getting the update just yet and we do
not have any dates and for those of you
that are waiting for the update on the
Galaxy Note 2 and Galaxy s3 well
November is probably your date but then
again that's for the international
variants as well as we do not know when
the US carriers are getting anything so
oh well now let's talk about Sony as the
company is working on a new technology
along with a chief standard that will
allow them to charge a phone wirelessly
in less than an hour yeah less than an
hour now obviously for a company that's
currently abetting batteries all
together then this does make a lot of
senses you really can't replace the
battery anyways but the only catch here
is that savio technology will be ready
until 2014 and not for the early
high-end lineup of smartphones that gets
announced at CES I'm talking about
probably what we will be getting at
Aoife in the second half of 2014 so the
technology is coming I just do not think
it'll be backwards compatible
now let's talk about Apple and the US
Patent Office a combination that a lot
of people dread but it turns out the
government agency has decided to uphold
the patent for multi-touch that will
benefit Apple and this is actually that
patent that allows you to ignore certain
swipes whenever you're scrolling along
the website which is really smart on our
iphones but obviously this was the same
patent that got a lot of samsung phones
band a couple of months ago or probably
a couple years already and this standard
is already being used but live Android
phones at the moment so let's hope that
this does not become another soap opera
but obviously Tim Cook is not the same
guy Steve Jobs was so let's see how that
goes and finally for the hot news of the
day I think Google has just
intentionally leaked their Nexus 5 on
the Google Play Store and this is the
smartphone that we're waiting for we're
talking about a Snapdragon 800 processor
a 5 inch display with LTE and the 16
gigabyte model that is starting at three
hundred and forty nine bucks yes this
phone is going to be awesome and it just
takes us back to the time of the nexus
one which is an awesome phone and it's
time though we are getting some press
invites for october 24th but i would not
relate these because this present bite
is focused on the google play store but
anyways that leads to the question of
the day speaking of the Nexus 5 is this
the phone that you're buying this
holiday season I mean 349 bucks all
those specifications in my particular
case honestly Google you are taking too
long my money is waiting I have not
bought anything and I am just waiting
for this phone so please release it now
and print as always if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone to tell the
world but you follow us on fire get out
