Pacquiao calm and this is a new segment
called Windows Phone 7 app roundup and
it's similar to our android application
Winkley and which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started go voice is a google voice
application that ties directly into your
google voice account so you can get all
of your text messages your voicemails
you can also get all your information if
you'd like you can see one of these
contacts and you can also call them or
send a text message directly to them to
through your google voice account so if
i want i can go down here to this plus
sign at the bottom and i can either type
in a message if I like or i can just
dial a phone number and hit call and
that will call my contact in the
settings we can move to trash archive
markers unread save contact in email
conversation norful is a pretty neat
application that allows you to turn your
friends or family or whoever into a
three-dimensional little character that
you can edit so let's say I want to edit
this space here I can change all the
colors and shapes of their face I can
also go back here and it has some other
cool effect let's say letters make this
girl rather fat I just hit the fat
button at the bottom and I can make her
fat i can also add makeup and i can make
your rock out and it will render your
friends or whoever space into a
three-dimensional image on the program
max in the magic marker is a fun yet
challenging puzzle / adventure game
similar to those doodle games that you
have to draw various objects to complete
the level so right here I have to draw a
bridge with the amount of ink that I
have in my pens hopefully I have enough
so I can just draw over here and now it
looks it looks as though I hit max so
now I can cross this water away and I
can continue on so now i need to make
another bridge i can just do that here
and the levels continue on throughout
the game point is a location based
application that will help you find any
one of these subjects so let's say I
wanted to find a restaurant I like to do
is click on here and I can either choose
a restaurant nearby or I can search or
choose a specific cuisine so I'm just
going to choose restaurants nearby so I
have all of these restaurants here let's
say well that I wanted to choose Captain
Jack's Bar &amp;amp; Grill I'll just click on
here I can get directions Matt I can
also call them and send
to a friend I can also go back to the
front of the page and get weather
information I'll just click on here and
it shows me the current forecast as well
as what is coming up this game is called
glider and the object of the game is to
fly around these different worlds and
collect these rings and gems and all
this other cool stuff it does tie it
directly to your xbox live account so
you do get G if you give certain
achievement so the game is the
accelerometer as well as the type screen
to navigate through these different
worlds and as you can see I can collect
some of the gems here and here I'm in an
area where there's an updraft so if I
crash into the ground then I lose the
game so this has been the first video of
the windows phone 7 app round up if you
like our videos make sure you as a
thumbs up and also leaves comments down
below to get the download information
just follow the link in the description
to be directed to Pacquiao's website
where we've posted links that will
integrate with the zune software of
course you can always search for these
applications in marketplace by their
name thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
