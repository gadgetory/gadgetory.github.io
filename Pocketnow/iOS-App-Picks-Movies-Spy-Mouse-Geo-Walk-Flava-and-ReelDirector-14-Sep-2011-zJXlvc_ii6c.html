Pacquiao comm and this is another
episode of the iOS app picks in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it movies by
Flixter is a free application to build
on the App Store what this app does is
it allows you to view the ratings from
Rotten Tomatoes directly from your iOS
device so here we can view the ratings
of various movies that are opening this
week which shows that drive is 96% and
the critics liked it so that's it
probably a pretty good movie to see so
we can go back we can see that straw dog
is only is only 57% so that's probably
not going to be a very good movie to see
and of course you can see the little
green rotten tomato so it can view the
theaters within our area search for
movies and find out more information spy
mouse is a paid-for game available on
App Store so the opposite the game is to
get the slip piece of cheese and then
exit through the mouse hole before being
seen by the cat here so we can also go
pause and via the other goals so it
looks as though I'm only one path I get
a ribbon by clicking to the wall I get
another ribbon and of course if I score
100 I can get out of the room and so
here I cannot lure the cat before the
cat catches us and hopefully we're able
to oh there he ran into a wall so we'll
probably get another ribbon for that one
and when we've reached the goal we can
move on to the next level cheetah walk
is a free education application if it'll
master so what this app allows you to do
is to view pictures from around the
world and we can click on one of these
photos and it will bring up a little bit
of information if we click on it we can
view the entire blurb on the back here
it looks as well we have an African
elephant so if I want to view the map of
where this is and there it is okay so
then we can view that we can also view
other animals and other items are from
around the world by clicking down here
we can turn things off so when we think
that we've mastered the entire planet we
can just go down here to the quiz and we
can test our knowledge Flava is a paper
application available on the App Store
that allows you to create your own
personalized scrapbooks so here I have a
little photo that I created with me and
one of my friends and it's ezzio
so it's very simple you can also go back
and create a new one so we can add a lot
of multimedia to our scrapbook pages we
can add text we can choose new photos in
the camera you can choose photos in the
album we can also go to places music
books and also URL photo in my album and
if I want to add something fun I can use
one of these stickers on the bottom and
we can share it over Facebook Twitter
tumblr and we can also email and SMS
real director is a pape replication veil
in the app store so what this app allows
you to do is create videos on your iOS
device directly from photos or from
video clips and you can also add your
own audio if you'd like so here let me
just choose something when we add let's
say I wanted to add another photo or
video I can click on and so it's added
in the middle if I'd like I can add text
to this I can change the title and add a
subtitle I can just go I can also add
transitions cutscenes and also add
various of the best so when I'm happy
with my video project all I've to do is
go back here click render and then save
it to my iOS device so this has been
another episode of the iOS app pics and
