pocketnow.com and this is another pocket
knife throwback where we're taking a
look at some vintage windows mobile
devices devices that came out eight nine
ten years ago recently we talked about
the iPAQ 3600 series which really
started the wave of PDA devices that
have had similar to functionality that
you would find on a PC so you could
finally have capabilities in your pocket
that you would normally need to get only
through a computer it's really the start
of the PDA revolution and this is a very
large device but also a very popular
device if we look at it next to an HD 2
we see just how how large it was in
terms of thickness and in weight it was
an absolute monster but you know people
really didn't care because you got a 200
megahertz processor in a pocketable
device so we're going to talk about the
differences between this device the 3600
and this device over here the 3800 which
is the successor to the 3600 but first
let's take a look at this doc I know a
lot of people that have this device also
had this charging dock so this dock has
a few features first you have stylus
holders over here which is pretty cool
I'm going to pop out the stylus and
let's say you put this on your desk to
sync and you can pop in your stylus and
have it within easy reach although I
never understood why there were two of
them there who uses two style I am not
sure let's look around the device we
have a little slot for the wires to go
through so it could sit nicely on a desk
and these were the days when you didn't
have wireless syncing so you definitely
needed something like this let's see
what is on the end of this cable we have
two choices for connection we have
serial I think this is Sarah serial and
also USB so you could you could choose
between the two okay so let's talk about
how the 3800 and the 3600 differ and the
3600 came out in 2000 that's a full ten
years ago and then the 3800 came out two
years later now the 3600 came with
Pocket PC 2000 that was the name of the
operating system and this device came
with Pocket PC 2002
although I haven't really used a so it
may have an updated version like 2003
both devices have a two hundred and six
megahertz strong ARM processor and of
course we're up to about a thousand
megahertz
now with the Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor the thirty-six hundred and
thirty two megabytes of RAM and sixteen
megabytes of ROM for storage the 3800
doubles that 64 megabytes of RAM and 32
megabytes of ROM both of them have the
same size screen with QVGA resolution so
that's just you know 320 across and 240
down it's a really grainy picture that
you would get from them
neither of these devices support Wi-Fi
so you're not going to be able to get
wireless internet although you could buy
an adapter that would allow you to
connect to the Internet I remember
having an adapter for one of these
devices I forget which one and it was a
sleeve that actually had a networking
port on it that you could plug a cat5
into neither of these devices at
Bluetooth but they do have infrared so
you can transfer through very very slow
infrared the 3,800 added and expansion
card slot here for SD whereas the the
3600 did not have that so you would
actually have to get an expansion sleeve
to be able to get that extra storage GPS
forget about it camera forget about it
these devices definitely didn't have
those modern things although the battery
in the 3800 was significantly bigger
than the 3,600 3,600 was at 960 milliamp
hours and this one all the way up to
1400 milliamp hours so you really got a
lot more battery life out of the 3800 so
kind of let's go through the procedure
here of setting this device up we have
this screen protector here that I know a
lot of devices shipped with and you can
kind of see the the evolution of design
here so it went from this sort of ugly
looking d-pad with a speaker inside of
it to a a nicer looking almost artistic
d-pad with the speaker up here so quite
a nice evolution so it says tap the
screen to begin of course this is an old
resistive touch screen so you need to
align it and we have to go through this
whole process this was this was changed
in later versions of Windows Mobile so
you didn't have to go through this whole
process and tap the screen to begin and
now it's going to do some iPAQ stuff and
this was before HP bought compact so
this was actually the compact I pack and
now they have the HP Ipek which they
really haven't done much with they have
the Ipek to listen which is a windows
mobile 6.5 device but it's not getting
that much attention because it doesn't
do anything truly amazing so here we are
and let's go through the settings and
see what we're dealing with here this is
again the old vintage interface of
Windows Mobile so let's go to about see
what we have here so this is version 3.0
which I think means is 2002 let's see
what kind of programs we have on here
the screen was very sensitive just like
the 3600 because it had a recessed touch
screen so the resistive layers were very
close to one another compared to say the
HTC touch Pro or touch diamond which
really didn't have very sensitive
screens because the the flush touch
screen that they built it with so pretty
good screen clarity nothing like you
would get today that the backlight is
quite dim very basic stuff the operation
is actually quite fast there's nothing
on here obviously right now here's the X
button in the upper right corner let's
see how long it takes to open up a new
document
oh it just spit you right into the new
document you can access volume up here
of course there weren't two sliders
because this doesn't have phone
functionality let's dig a little bit
more into the settings to see an
expansion pack settings so you can have
an external battery for extra juice you
can have all kinds of expansion packs I
remember there's actually a camera
expansion pack that we reviewed on
pocket now a long time ago and see
compact audio you can adjust the
settings
bass boost if you're listening to mp3s
and people really started to get mobile
with music with this device they loaded
it up with mp3s Windows Media Player
would play the music very ugly interface
here let's see what we're doing with
memory so right now we have free 27
megabytes of program memory not that
much to work with of course we have a
total of 32 megabytes and over here with
storage we only have 32 megabytes also
for storing documents and photos
self-test it's kind of a developer tool
here screen of course we can align the
screen let's turn up brightness all the
way and sort of see what what it looks
like when we do that and here backlight
brightness well this is actually maximum
brightness this backlight is obviously
dimmed over time because it it's quite a
it's not very pride so anyway guys that
was a quick look at the vintage iPAQ
3800 I'm sure a lot of you remember this
device it was a big seller and it really
started the wave of PDA devices that
came down the line this was well before
the smartphone operating systems when
you could truly have some power in your
pocket and be able to bring your
calendar with you and your your contacts
end with a big bulky expansion sleeve
you could get internet it would be very
very slow slower than 56k but it could
happen this actually I believe has
Internet Explorer on it probably the
same version of Internet Explorer that
was shipping a year ago because they
haven't changed it very much so that was
again a look at the iPAQ 3800 that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
