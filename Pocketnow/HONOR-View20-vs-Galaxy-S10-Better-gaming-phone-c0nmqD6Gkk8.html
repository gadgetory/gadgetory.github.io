the value that it has to offer that's
today's question on one end we have the
s10 Samsung's latest flagship of 2019 on
the other we have the latest and
greatest from honor the view 20 starting
at about $200 price difference at the
base model can the view 20 hold its own
against the Galaxy S 10 this is TK with
pocket Mao and XDA when it comes to
hardware both the s10 and the view 20
offer us large displays with the new
style of front-facing camera cutouts the
view 20 offers us a six point four inch
1080p IPS LCD display supported by the
790 meter Kiran 980 and eight gigs of
ram and starting storage of 128
petabytes the Galaxy S ten offers us a
6.1 inch dynamic AMOLED display
supported by the snapdragon 855 qual
comes first seven nanometer SOC and
eight gigs of ram and is starting
storage of 128 gigabytes as well when it
comes to software both of these devices
are running the Android 9.0 with some
type of skin on top of that Samsung is
running the 1ui 1.1 and honors running a
magic UI 2.0 both of these devices offer
as game modes that enable us to have the
best gaming experience possible
Samsung's game launcher provides us the
ability to have a unified launch pad for
our installed games and a great way to
discover new games to try out in fact
this is the way to install fortnight on
your Galaxy S 10 as it is one of the
featured games you can customize what
notification sounds come through any
performance mode from gaming focused all
the way to power saving
honor provides us a similar experience
with the app assistant all of our
installed games can be added here we can
customize our experience with options
like uninterrupted gaming mode and game
acceleration the RFU 20 also supports
GPU turbo 4 supported games to get
better performance like in pub chief
in today's comparison we're going to be
focusing on the gaming capabilities on
the s10 and the view 20 haven't used the
view 20 since CES earlier this year I
have to say that gaming on this phone
has been great we get compatibility with
the latest games and even support the 60
frames per second gaming in fortnight
also as a perk we get to enjoy the honor
guard skin for free while jumping off
the bus game acceleration gives us the
ability to enjoy 40 frames per second
gaming in pub gee thanks to the GPU
turbo support and built-in optimizations
for all your chicken dinners full view
display gives us the ability to enjoy
the entire display and the camera for
the most part is nicely tucked in on the
bottom left side of the display not
covering any of the details you need to
see lastly we have some unique gaming
experiences on the view 20 allowing us
to play games that utilize the time of
light sensor on the back so while
connected to a TV using an HDMI USBC
adapter we get a connect like experience
out of a mobile phone that's something
that no other device can do right now
from first-person style games to racing
games the view 20 can handle extended
gaming session with the help of the four
thousand milliamp battery that we have
here as well as the heat pipe cooling
system that we have on the back the s10
is following a line of very powerful
devices with the brand new Snapdragon
855 with options of all the way up to 12
gigabytes of RAM on the SN plus there's
not going to be any shortage of power
here Samsung has a built-in game
launcher now this is kind of like a
gaming store by itself we can play games
directly from it customize our
experience and discover new games as
well the really cool thing is that the
Estell line of devices supports 60
frames per second gaming in fortnight as
well as the free iconic skin that is
only available for s 10 phone owners
the battery we have on the s10 is a
little bit smaller at 3400 milliamps but
with the performance mode on you will
not skip a beat on this phone
we have Dolby support with stereo
speakers for gaming and consuming media
playing games on the Infinity Oh
displayed with the curved edges really
makes you feel like the graphics bleed
over the edge of the display now married
that with the three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack just like the
view 20 and you have a great experience
playing games after using both of these
devices for over a month I have to say
that gaming on them will be great it's
going to be both enjoyable and creative
depending on the model that you go with
again we do have connect style gaming
here on the view 20 the galaxy s online
of phones come with a lot of power and
big display to support them the view 20
offers us a lot of the s10 gaming
features for a lower starting point it
truly comes down to what you need from
your phone 750 dollars is the entry
point to the galaxy s 10 line of devices
that's starting with the SN II that's
slightly smaller but still holds the
same gaming experience as the s10 that
are shared with you today the view xx
starting point is at 550 that's already
a $200 savings there for you to be able
to get a very similar gaming experience
at a much lower price games here will be
enjoyable fast and responsive
this means that gaming on either one of
these phones will give you access to the
latest tech that both companies have to
offer hope you guys enjoyed this
