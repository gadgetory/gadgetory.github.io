best most powerful most capable galaxy
to date I know that there are some
reviews already circulating out there
but because the software is not final
we've been having issues with the camera
hanging every now and then we decided to
hold off our review and tell you about
our experience so far I'm hanging out
any better with pocket now and I've just
spent a week with the Galaxy Note 9 we
already had an epic unboxing by none
other than Joshua Vergara and Brandon
minimun so yes this phone ships complete
with accessories galore I highly
recommend you watch that video so far
the honeymoon phase has been rather
interesting I have zero complaints when
it comes to the quality of the hardware
and the design I seriously do love
galaxies for that and I also pray
Samsung for finally giving us the ocean
blue variant for the review and not the
black variants of the past that made it
a nightmare to film though then again
this is not a phone that's exempt the
fingerprints Samsung was nice enough to
bundle this flip case with it but I do
find the book to be just too much this
phone definitely crosses the line of the
size that I'm willing to put up with
when it comes to a phone though I'm not
really complaining about things like the
placement of the fingerprint scanner
that change was great the problem is I
don't understand why Samsung decided to
raise the height of things like the
power button for example for no reason
whatsoever and just as a disclaimer this
review is really based on the 6e good
byte variant with 128 gigs of storage
setting it up for the first time we're
greeted by the usual Samsung animation
that's now powered by bixby voice in
case that's your thing we get prompted
for the usual Wi-Fi or data will account
if you want to restore this from an old
phone which I said no because samsung's
Smart Switch works flawlessly and then
you go into details like setting up
biometrics which I find the fingerprint
scanner to be the most reliable then
you're prompted to set up the Google
assistant yes the Google assistant goes
first on this phone
and then you're prompted to install
galaxy applications set up your Samsung
Account which I do recommend and that
leads to your home screen and then
there's Samsung Smart Switch I have my
trusty beloved Galaxy S 9 plus here I
connect both phones with the USB C and
the OTG adapter included in the box set
my Galaxy Note 9 as the new phone and
then select what you want to restore if
you like your home screen on the old
phone go right ahead that option is also
included the process to restore took
around 10 minutes
I noticed we're now greeted with icons
grayed out to install just like in the
pixel to just give the apps on time to
install and voila
your Galaxy Note 9 is now restored now
fair warning which is a benefit for some
in an annoyance for others is that the
amount of tutorials in this phone going
forward is insane and it makes sense
there's I think no other device in the
market with the amount of features that
this phone has so just bear in mind the
setup process is not over powering the
show we have Android 8.1 Oreo with
Samsung's experienced UX and 9.5 and
well as I set in my hands on I can't
really tell any improvements this
continues to be one of my favorite user
interfaces when it comes to the
aesthetics and the added functionality
and I'm glad to see this review unit
came with zero carrier bloat the phone
breezes through the UI just fine even if
some animations seem to still need
optimization that could just be again
because the software needs more work the
animated wallpapers and always-on screen
animations are now gone and I presume
this has to do with preserving battery
life but I still do consider this to be
the coolest always-on display in the
market I do promise you I gave the
Samsung keyboard a try one more time it
seems that the multilingual support has
not improved that also I definitely
activated SwiftKey and had it set up as
quick as I could
now one thing that I do notice has
improved this intelligent scan I've
noticed the phone unlocks dramatically
quicker today though I wish there was an
option for it to just unlock and show me
the content of notifications as the
iPhone 10 does and then swipe to enter
the rest of the user interface 1 plus 6
sort of does this though it's not
perfect - you either activate
notifications to be visible
or not one thing that did also improve
is Bixby we're now at version 2.2 it
shows a leaner user interface when you
call on Bixby voice it no longer has the
speech bubble at the bottom and instead
over it takes over half of your display
I will tell you I do love Bixby for its
quick commands which let you tailor
strings of actions by just saying one
thing but I do not like that it's still
only limited to like three languages
three voices and it still sounds like a
robot for the most part now one feature
that I do love about this phone are
things like dual messenger which are
little things I have more than one
whatsapp account so for me it's
extremely useful and I love that you can
limit the context that you can reach out
through each messenger I also love that
secure folder is still here to help in
adding even more accounts if you prefer
I use it mainly to avoid having to sync
the pocket now account with other sync
services on the phone so it's really
handy for the most part and then finally
there is the s-pen which is probably one
of the coolest updates that I have seen
to the Galaxy Note in years Bluetooth
functionality now means that you can
control the phone with a button the app
actions are self programmable meaning
you can use it to launch the camera or
start a voice recording or you name it
and then within applications you can
tailor the additional commands that can
follow I will have to admit that because
of these Bluetooth changes I've been
using the s-pen more than ever before
and I've been using Galaxy Note since
version 2 I did get asked that you can
use a different s-pen on this device and
it seems that there is an option there
is this reset feature which will allow
you to put in the s-pen and I assume
that you can put in another S Pen if you
want though we'll have to prove this in
our review and for those that have asked
the other S pen's work with this device
they actually do the only thing is you
need to remove the S Pen first for these
to be detected once you put the S Pen
back into the device these will not work
at all
photography on the Galaxy Note 9 has
proven to be great so far the new
variable aperture means significant
improvements in low-light when compared
to its predecessor voters have been
crisp in detail detection of moving
subjects and lowlifes seems to have
improved when compared to the Galaxy S 9
plus as well but we'll have to test this
phone for
to give you our full opinion all these
photos have been taken with scene
detection enabled by the way it's not
the most accurate and telling what it
sees but I can't really say that it's
affected the photo quality in any way
there are even changes to the cameras
user interface when it comes to super
slo-mo which I do phrase I find it to be
a lot less confusing than the galaxy s 9
plus
overall I have to say that my first
impressions of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
are very positive there's probably not
just the best Galaxy Note that I've
tested but I'll see one of the best
phones that I've tested this year and
that really means a lot given the fact
that it's not cheap but I feel that the
added value of all the features that you
get here probably make up for most of
that I've been around different parts of
New York City and so far I have to say
that probably one of the most important
features of a note which is battery life
is definitely solid with the exception
of one day I will say that I've ended
pretty much every other day with at
least 40% of battery which is great
better yet the other day we went to test
data speeds between the Galaxy Note 9
another devices for another video that's
coming very soon and I will have to tell
you I am impressed this device really
smoked everything else out there it was
extremely impressive and this is really
what I was looking for when it came to
the Samsung Galaxy Note a device that
could do it all and that would last all
day let us know in the comments what
comparisons you'd like to see going
forward and what else you would like for
us to test during our full review all
right I'd make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to our channel as
well for more videos like this one and
follow me on Twitter Jaime underscore
during that hour on instagram @ hi Mary
Mehta please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I'm how you
matter even I think so much for watching
we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
