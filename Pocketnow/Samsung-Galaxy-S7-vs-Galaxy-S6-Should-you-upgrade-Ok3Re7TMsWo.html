smartphones should last around two years
some people upgrade sooner some try and
push their phones as long as they can go
for folks using last year's Galaxy s6
has enough changed on the galaxy s7 to
get you to part with your cash I'm Juan
Carlos back now for Pocket now and we're
going to take a quick look at a one-year
upgrade this comparison brought to you
by deeper and once the s7 was announced
there was a general concern that what we
would get was more akin to an S series
update from Apple improvements to the
internals with almost no change to the
outward appearance viewed from arm's
length it's easy to see why some might
have been concerned both phones are made
out of metal and glass
Samsung seems to have settled on a
consistent design language moving away
from plastics now we're looking at the
third batch of phones to refine this
look
the s6 had subtle elements recalling the
note for flat sides with just a touch of
a dimple or flair at the corners not as
reinforced as the note or active but
more shaped than just rounding a
rectangle and that's gone on the galaxy
s7 we're fully into note 5 territory
with scooped metal sides that showcased
the curved glass back panel while the
galaxy s7 is one millimeter thicker than
the s6 it replaces it's also a
millimeter shorter and narrower the
difference in hand isn't radical but it
does improve the screen to bezel ratio
and it's impressive
knowing that overall dimensions have
shrunk while including a bigger battery
and SD card tray the s7 returns with the
handy life style feature of being ip68
water-resistant meaning the phone can
survive under 5 feet of water for up to
30 minutes it's always a nice piece of
mind Edition to include on a phone and
the camera module redesign is also
impressive the lens cover on the s7
barely protruding from the back panel
just for anyone who might be curious I
keep a wood cover on my galaxy s6 as the
lens cover was cracked early into using
it and I often keep my galaxy s6 in a
wood panel case hopefully having the
lens cover which doesn't stick out as
far on the s7 will prevent similar
damage
battery life is nicely improved with the
extra four hundred and fifty mili amp
hour battery padding running a movie
playback test streaming HD video over
Wi-Fi 50 percent brightness the galaxy
s7 drained 5% of the battery the Essex
landed closer to eight percent we're
likely seeing other efficiency
improvements on the s7 than just
additional battery capacity maybe a more
power efficient screen perhaps and
speaking of the screens the s7 does seem
to perform slightly better in direct
sunlight exposure for this kind of test
is always difficult in bright California
Sun and the Essex is still easily read
outdoors but here we can see the s Evan
pushes just a touch brighter also it's
just nice to have an SD card slot again
high speed memory cards are a lot
cheaper than paying for built-in storage
with 32 gigabytes built into the phone
we have plenty of room for installing
programs apps games and leaving the
memory card exclusively for multimedia
content like photos and music files
moving to performance it took the Galaxy
S six several updates before we saw
improvements to sliding through the UI
and RAM management thankfully the s Evan
has been solid out of the box
it's slick while paging around the home
screens and handles multitasking well
apps load quickly the only area where I
see the s6 pull ahead is on the game
Marvel future fight using the highest
performance settings the Exynos powered
s6 plays the game a little smoother than
the Qualcomm 820 powered galaxy s7 and
less demanding games will play nearly
identically between both phones
lifestyle elements like launching the
camera are quicker on the s7 and this
camera comparison is an interesting one
low-light sensitivity on the new galaxy
is much improved and the dual pixel
technology makes for faster and more
reliable focusing performance the s7
will lock in situations where the Essex
will often just give up
we get a few more options to play with
while shooting video like white balance
fun features like motion photos and
panoramas are included and slow motion
videos have been improved to almost
iPhone like levels still there are some
folks out there who will prefer having
the higher resolution sensor on the s6
to crop or zoom with and many people
have left comments on our videos
expressing their disappointment over the
s Evans four by three aspect ratio
compared to the 16 by 9 aspect ratio
found on the s6 whether someone prefers
faster performance and better low-light
images or would rather have more
resolution that will ultimately be
answered by each individual of course
we'd be remiss if we didn't mention
Samsung removing the IR blaster it
wasn't the most popular feature on the
Galaxy s6 being able to use your phone
as a universal remote but the people who
used it are often pretty passionate
about it lastly speaker playback volume
is pretty similar with the galaxy s7
favoring mid-range audio and the galaxy
s6 delivering just a little bit more
bass
but on our review units the galaxy s6
has a louder amp for headphone playback
both phones have very similar tone and
utilize a fairly flat EQ not
exaggerating bass or treble in your
audio but the s7 doesn't seem to drive
headphones quite as well as its
predecessor so let's wrap this up if
you're on a Galaxy s5 or older upgrading
to the S Evan makes a lot of sense but
should s6 owners make the jump gear to
your upgrades can often feel a bit
underwhelming the galaxy s7 shows us how
well Samsung can refine a device and all
of these little improvements do add up
to a better overall experience
but the galaxy s6 wasn't that raw to
begin with this question is best
answered by looking at your mission
critical features low-light camera
performance battery life upgradeable
storage water resistance if any of those
features are make-or-break for you then
upgrading to the s Evan might make sense
if not then you'll probably be fine with
the galaxy s6 for another year anymore
for those who want to live on the
bleeding edge of mobile technology it
might be worth looking at faster carrier
upgrades or manufacturer leasing plans
for folks who don't care about having
the newest tech at launch even waiting
two years in between phone upgrades
might not feel like a radical
improvement anymore for flagship devices
for how similar these phones might look
though we are happy to see just how much
progress has been made in refining what
a galaxy phone should be looking for a
way to add some grip and eliminate the
fingerprints from your Galaxy s7 be
