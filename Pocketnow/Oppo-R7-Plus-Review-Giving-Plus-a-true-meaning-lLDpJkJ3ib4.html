of its our line of building devices that
defy the boundaries of design the r5 was
about thinness the r7 about elegance and
reliability and the r7 + well let's just
say that the size is just part of the
story I'm high memory that I would
pocket now here with our full review of
the Oppo r7 +
the plus denominator has been commonly
used these days as a way to refer to the
larger sibling of a particular product
we see it today with the galaxy s6 edge+
and Apple's new iPhones as well opens
approach the word plus is different
though as the Oppo r7 plus is not only
larger than the r7 but substantially
different in its design and particularly
its features to start if Opel would have
decided to simply grow the r7 we would
have had a much larger phone we do see
the same 2.5 D glass finish on the sides
and the curved edges and we also see the
aircraft grade big museum aluminum alloy
here that was very neat on the r7 and we
have a very cool gold finish that kind
of looks rose gold from an angle but
that's for the design similarities end
the Oppo r7 plus sports a gigantic 6
inch 1080p Super AMOLED display that
provides gorgeous color saturation great
viewing angles and very deep blacks but
since it takes up 80% of the screen to
body ratio this device doesn't really
feel much larger than your average
galaxy note only it's a little bit
taller oboes decision to go with
software buttons for the first time ever
is highly priced here if you think the
display lacks bezels well it doesn't it
doesn't
what Oppo did here is that it colored
the inner bezel below the glass in a
black color and therefore creating an
illusion that's rather convenient when
watching a video for example nes at the
screen size better pixel saturation
would have been nice but at 367 pixels
per inch this device is still within
retina territory under the hood we have
a 1.5 gigahertz octa-core Snapdragon 615
processor matched by three gigs of ram
32 gigs of expandable storage via
microSD and that microSD module is
swappable to a second nano SIM that's
also convenient if you want duel since
instead of extra storage
the added size was also fully taking
advantage of as there is a massive 4100
milliamp power battery here that's also
coupled by luke's rapid charging
technology so you go from 0 to 80 in
around 30 minutes we have a 13 megapixel
Sony IMX 278 camera
at the back and an 8-megapixel Omni
vision shooter at the front and below
that primary camera we also have a
fingerprint scanner that's actually
capacitive meaning that even though you
can't really press it as a button the
phone does detect your fingerprint on
touch and activates the display and also
the unlocking mechanism the sensor is
just as accurate as we saw with the opal
and three as well so I'd highly
recommend you stick to using this option
for unlocking your phone overall yes
this phone is massive for some and you
could also say that this gorgeous design
would have been benefited by a better
processor but as we dive deeper you'll
notice that these perks weren't really
much of a problem when actually using
the phone Oppo has proven with the r7
that it has taken its approach to
software rather seriously and we do
notice that with the r7 plus color OS
2.1 running on top of android 5.1.1
lollipop has not only proven to be
reliable but also unique it does retain
the same speed and fluidity that we
notice with the r7 over the last few
months but Oppo has decided to strip
lollipop away from many of its
annoyances for one the volume controls
are unified so yeah that problem is
solved here but even more interesting is
that you also have the same KitKat style
notifications at the status bar at the
top and not those annoying carts that
you can't really control on other
devices running lollipop you can fully
control which notifications you want in
which you don't which is also rather
convenient and this also applies the
lockscreen sort of like what you see on
an iphone Oppo also continues to bundle
a lot of software like for example its
own encryption application that now even
allows you to block gaps with your
fingerprint and you also get the same
suite of apps that we saw with the r7
like for example a full backup assistant
voice recorder etc overall even though
many of us are Android purists and don't
really like Android skins this is one of
the best skins that I've ever used and
for those of you that are moving away
from an iPhone to your first Android
smartphone I would highly recommend that
you give a try to this particular
version of color OS
I've spent the last few weeks testing
the Oppo r7 pluses my daily driver and
my experience has been rather Pleasant
for the most part playing graphics
intensive games on the r7 plus seems to
actually work better than on its smaller
sibling even though remember we have the
same snapdragon 615 processor here you
will notice some minor stutter here and
there on some games you have to remember
the Snapdragon 615 is not really
noticeable for its power but mostly for
its efficiency and we do notice it here
particularly because this device doesn't
really heat up when playing games the
large 4100 milliamp hour battery did
prove to be rather good when playing
these games as well and for the usual
texting and emailing the device would
end the day at 50 percent charge which
is great and then book rapid charging
took care of the rest
phone calls were also rather pleasant on
this device sporting one of the loudest
earpieces I've ever tested though the
placement of the speaker at the back
isn't necessarily convenient because it
gets easily muffled by your finger
something you also have to consider is
that not all devices support the same
LTE band so this particular unit that we
receive for review does not support the
ones in the United States just keep this
in mind in case you actually depend on
LTE like I do when it comes to the
camera I honestly couldn't tell much of
a difference between these photos and
the ones you find on any iPhone and
that's actually a good thing the camera
sensor does tend to overexpose some of
the photos at times though but other
features like HDR and other of the pro
modes included do proved to be quite
useful
your experience filming video would also
be pleasant as we did notice that the
device is rather smooth at zooming in
and out of subjects in addition to
focusing on them and handling differing
lighting situations as well and overall
I guess this is the best way to describe
oboes approach the new r7 plus this
definitely isn't a device for everyone
given its size in half then for those of
you who care about a smaller device the
r7 will suit you just fine both devices
are extremely similar to each other when
it comes to its specifications but the
things that are different are actually
the ones that incline me to choose the
larger OBO r7 plus I value a reliable
device when it comes to software that
can also help me get through a rough day
of work and media consumption without
having to worry about battery life
storage or even security thanks to a
fingerprint scanner
I think Oppo did a great job in giving
users the option to choose between the
smaller r7 and this larger r7 plus but
I'll definitely keep this r7 plus as my
daily driver going forward folks we've
got a lot of coverage not just the Volvo
but of every other smartphone in the
market right now so make sure you follow
