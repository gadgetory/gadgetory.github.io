everyone welcome to the 16th episode of
the pocket now pocket cast we have been
on a hiatus for most of the summer why
have we been on a hiatus well we've been
some people have been traveling some
people have been busy it's kind of been
a hectic time we're working on a
redesign for the site don't tell anyone
about that yet so there's a lot going on
and so we we wanted to be able to sit
down when things quieted down a little
bit and and work on a podcast so
consider this season two of the pocket
cast where we're going to go through all
the big events that have happened in the
last week in the world of smartphones
and in joining me on the line senior
editor of pocket now Anton Dean Aggie
say hi hey Brandon hey everybody how is
everybody after well at least here a
super hot summer yeah it's been it's
been a crazy a crazy summer not only in
terms of weather and I record this two
days before a possible hurricane is
coming to the east coast and recording
this two days after an earthquake
occurred but a lot is evident tech news
you know Motorola being acquired by
google CEO Steve Jobs resigning as CEO
and yeah tell me about it i'm on
vacation five days per year and guess
what motorola buys Google Steve Jobs
resigns Microsoft gets patent on its
Metro UI so it's crazy I shouldn't go on
holidays anymore yeah yeah yet tony was
off while a lot of this happened and
everyone is suing everyone Microsoft is
suing motorola Apple suing motorola
Apple suing Samsung it is it is bitter
out there and you know naturally so this
is a very high stakes industry
smartphones are still in the fastest
growing consumer tech industry and so
these companies have their patents and
they look at their patents and they say
how can we find a way that X company is
infringing on our patents because if we
can win we can win millions of dollars
just by hiring bunch of a bunch of
lawyers and at the same time it makes
sense right I mean part of the reason
why
companies can be great part of the
reason why Apple can be great for
examples because they can protect their
ideas and if a company infringes upon
that if they copy it the company that
infringed on the patents shouldn't be
rewarded with millions of dollars in
sales they copied off of somebody else
so well taking a look towards these
patent issues I'm sure lawyers are happy
because it's a face they always have
something to work on and they're billing
clients like Apple Motorola Microsoft
great clients some some great hours but
I think some of you will say that suing
is as bad I'd say suing is good and I
say anybody should sue anybody and
everybody who infringes upon someone
else's patents it's okay to get your
inspiration from somebody but nobody
likes copycats and I'm sure everybody
will say that Apple is the one who's
suing most well maybe because Apple had
the most innovative things others copied
from I'm just saying yeah but if there
is no way for an amicable settlement or
I don't know paying a certain fee for
every device or cross-licensing or
something then they should go to court
because it's really important to protect
innovation and to protect intellectual
property it's otherwise it will be theft
it is that and it's it's very
complicated and it's hard for for most
people don't understand that don't have
a law degree you have a law degree Tony
which is yes I do it's just interesting
it's it's very complicated and it you
know the the way the perception is kind
of something that weighs down these
companies a lot I mean this stuff makes
headline news in New York Times Wall
Street Journal all the big tech sites
report on it especially when a company
successfully puts an injunction in place
against another company from selling a
certain device like you know Apple
prohibiting sales of the galaxy tab 10.1
in certain countries prohibiting sales
of the galaxy s2 in certain countries
and
then it starts to impact you and me and
everyone out there who who wants to buy
a galaxy tab 10.1 or whatever exactly
and the it's funny you should bring that
up because I was of course on holiday
when this happened and I've read that
apple recently managed to band the
galaxy tab from from being sold in the
European Community and I'm living in
Romania which is a country from the
European Community and you can buy a
galaxy tab here so I'm not sure when
that ban will be affected from and
getting back to the galaxy s2 I've heard
that it all comes down to Google's own
gallery application and it's not even a
samsung application and samsung said
that they will issue an update as soon
as possible to prevent any further
infringement so it's funny that Apple's
use samsung for google's fault yeah yeah
yeah it's a big circle and of course
it'll drink there one of the big reasons
that a google bought motorola was for
all of those 17,000 patents that they
can use to take to these companies that
sooo android manufacturing say oh no no
no we've got this patent that says
you're infringing on all our stuff and
we're going to countersue so by the way
do you think that microsoft suing
motorola just a couple of days after the
google motorola deal has anything to do
with google acquiring Motorola's patent
portfolio I don't think so I don't think
I don't I mean why didn't they sue until
now I really don't know I think it might
take more than just a couple of days to
issue a lawsuit to serve a lawsuit you
know you need a lot of evidence you need
to deploy certain things I don't know
what the process is but indeed you do I
don't think it's related anyhow let us
move on let's get into the podcast and
if you hear some booming on my end it's
not because I had something for
breakfast that I shouldn't have it's
because there's a big storm out my
window here so hopefully the power is
not lost so let's get into this I think
the thing that is on most people minds
is steve job stepping down the CEO
and we don't really know why and we're
assuming that it's because of his health
he's unknown to perform his day-to-day
duties with Apple which is which is sad
but we got to look at this in terms of
the iphone and what this means for the
iphone of course there are rumors many
rumors saying that there's going to be a
new iphone in october at least one at
least one and there could be two perhaps
on sprint perhaps on t-mobile this thing
has been kept probably under the most
tight wraps ever because there are so
many conflicting legitimate rumors so
looking at it from from the point of
view the iphone do you think short-term
medium-term and long-term that CEO Steve
Jobs leaving a CEO has any impact on the
iphone what do you think don't well just
for a short introduction Steve Jobs
didn't leave Apple as a company as if i
recall well Bill Gates did Bill Gates
stepped out and step out completely of
Microsoft but Steve Jobs actually a
correction i was looking this up this
morning um am i wrong yeah bill bill
gates stepped down as CEO and became
chairman he's still chairman of my with
this it's the same thing with the wig
jobs too well no problem introduction
aside I don't think Steve Jobs stepping
down as a CEO will impact on short and
middle term talking about the next
iPhone either it will be
september-october it's the jobs doing so
it's his project and I wouldn't be
surprised to see Steve Jobs onstage
presenting the new iphone on on the
midterm I don't think that apple will
lose its market share maybe it will even
gain because Steve Jobs king with a
vision it's his fingerprints all over
Apple's products regardless if we talk
about the iphone the ipad or mac books
on the long term we might see maybe
Apple declining a little bit just like
Microsoft is a little bit declining
under steve ballmer and i don't want to
be biased here it's just the way things
are when somebody comes to a position
as a successor brings a new vision Steve
Jobs had his his personality strong
personality and attention to details and
that character of him being so excited
about everything I'm sure Tim Cook will
do a great job but he is not Steve Jobs
yeah yeah I tend to agree i think
short-term and medium-term meaning two
years from now we're not going to see
that much of a change of pace we're
still going to see innovative products
from them it's beyond that where it's
questionable but i tend to think that
Steve Jobs is such a high quality person
such a such a top-notch leader that he
wouldn't have done something such as
leaving a CEO that would inhibit his
company's ability to continue what he
has put in place in other words he will
be watching over the company for as long
as he's able and that also begs the
question is he sick to the point where
he might not be around in a few years
unfortunately but but if he is you
better believe that he's going to be
making sure that Apple is continuing the
legacy of innovative products as
chairman I mean that's a very high
position chairman of the board makes the
the final decisions when it comes down
to things that the board has to vote on
not only that he's probably going to
have regular communication with Tim Cook
and the other executives at apple and
although he won't be involved in
day-to-day he's still going to have a
lot of influence and I don't think we
should we should forget about these
things you know what will be interesting
to see I'm curious who will take Tim
Cook's position as CEO that will be
maybe a key position in Apple who's that
guy with the shaved head oh I don't know
you know I'm gonna find out that you
know the guy that goes on the videos the
young one the british one young exactly
the young british one yeah i have
elapses but i don't know his name his
name is he's in any and every product
presentation I think he is a director of
hardware or maybe not we yeah you know
not sure I think everyone knows who were
talking about huh yeah and we're sorry
we don't remember his name I mean you
know they've got a lot of good
management there you know they've been
hiring a lot over the last decade and
they saw this coming you know this has
been a this has been in progress steve
jobs but i'll not multiple hiatuses is
that into them what's the plural about
hiatus is it hides high 80 hi 8i honey
tea so I mean this this has been planned
for this isn't like oh my gosh we have
to figure out a succession plan I mean
even in his letter he hinted that their
head there always has been a succession
plan and he's he's not he's not stupid
you know yeah anyhow so um well before
you want to move on because I want to
ask you something of course I was of
course on a holiday when when HP
announced that they will kill webos oh
yeah no this everything happens when I'm
on a holiday and I know that you got the
pre three how is the pre three now that
HP killed webos at well it's still the
same of a Wesen pressure um it's funny
because I'm playing with in the
periphery now I ordered it and I
actually bought it for personal use
because I was excited to sort of
integrate it into my life um I bought it
like a week before they killed it and it
doesn't change I'm sad I'm not with 99
yeah exactly um and yeah and then they
may be the touchpad 99 bucks and even if
you want when you can't get one uh the
the pre three is you know it's one of
those phones where if this was released
when it was announced in the beginning
of 2011 it would be a contender people
would like it but it's got a wvga screen
which is ok but not the best it's got a
single core processor which is ok but
not the best 512 megabytes of RAM which
is ok but not that you see where I'm
going with this it's just yup it's not
really relevant anymore and not only
that what really pisses me off is that
all of the google voice applications and
there were two one was called google and
the other one was called like gdial pro
both of them don't exist in the app
store anymore the catalog because the
developers have had problems with with
HP they are no longer supporting the
product so they pulled they pulled it
and I use google voice for my calls I
use it for my text messages I can't use
the pre three now even though it's got
AT&amp;amp;T 3g which is kind of cool for anyone
out there that actually wants to 33 but
it's a cool phone you know you would
think that with with almost double the
pixels there'd be a big difference in
web OS 2.2 but there's really not it
just it feels the same everything's a
little bit bigger they really didn't
take advantage of the added screen space
that much its overall it's a
disappointment and what what do you
think I'm sorry to interrupt what do you
think killed webos and the the pre
smartphones was it there there same form
factor or was it the platform itself
that is a great question and I was just
talking about this talking about this
with a friend it's the lack of iteration
the slowness and bringing new products
to market it is not okay to announce a
product in january-february and have it
available for sale in August this is
this is the smartphone industry it's
it's crazy not only that but um limiting
to just form factors of a slide down
keyboards ridiculous android has proven
that people want choice people want sly
out keyboards they won't slide down
keyboards they want on-screen keyboards
and HP is forcing people to use this
slide down keyboard now let me ask you
something i know i'm talking a lot i
guess i'm so excited to be back podcast
let me ask you something do you remember
if you remember when HP bought palm 1.2
billion dollars their rationale was we
want to have a mobile operating system
we're going to make it on tablets and
PCs and we're going to use our
incredibly wide distribution to really
you know get the webos devices in more
people's hands
do you think HP has brought any
advantage to the webos ecosystem or
product no I think that except for
paying up to palm and exchanging the
palm logo to HP logo on the back of the
phones I don't think anything has
changed and I think this was the main
issue and by the time they realize that
they should have done something
different they just couldn't do anything
else and they that's why they killed it
you know I don't get it help how could a
company with so many resources have that
happen well not every company is good
and making every product the best I mean
HP is a great company when it comes to
laptops notebooks netbooks computers you
cannot be the best or among the best in
any or every of your divisions if a
company makes exceptional laptops it
doesn't mean that they will make
exceptional smartphones but then they
had the experience of bomb they only had
to bring up the innovation I think that
if they would have changed just
something with the pre three and the
veer and and the new devices which they
launched this year it they would have
received a boost a there would have been
some buzz around the product it would be
something you everybody would have said
HP brought something to the table they
change this and this and they are
heading somewhere but as far as I can
see things from the outside and just
observe it they're just standing in
place right right and then you gotta you
gotta ask yourself what was it about
webos that as the word hasent hasn't the
pace at which new products could could
be released and i almost wish i could
for one day be you know the CEO of HTC
or samsung mobile or motorola mobility
and understand what takes so freaking
long and i think it has a lot to do with
the carriers and the testing but then
again the question is why not you know
they announced the 33 in the beginning
of the year why not release it soon
there after one month as an unlock
device maybe
the price expensive ok great very few
people are going to buy it but the
people that are going to buy it are
going to be more forgiving they're going
to tell their friends about it they're
going to hack the software develop on it
make it better I think because HP is
well bomb HP's and the webos main market
was America and in the United States if
I know well from you and from the
discussions with the with our other
colleagues the main idea is to get a
subsidized phone now I cannot speak for
the entire for for Europe and its
entirety I can speak for myself and the
countries which I know we would rather
buy an unlocked phone and not sign any
contracts put a prepaid sim card in the
phone and use it freely on whatever
Network I wish yes of course I have to
pay a higher price for an unlocked phone
but I don't have to stay two years with
the carrier and another thing is that I
can speak for laying again strange if
you buy the samsung galaxy s2 from
either orange or Vodafone you will get a
price a lower price than an unlocked
phone if you sign a contract but by the
end of your contract if you add up all
your monthly dues and bills to your
carrier plus what you pay for the phone
you will get it more expensive even
vodafone has a higher price on it on the
sgs2 on contract then what you would pay
for the phone unlocked which is crazy it
is crazy and I feel like the model has
started to shift a little bit in the US
where prepaid was reserved for people
that just you know they wanted a lower
quality device they didn't care much
about the premium services um you know
t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T they're all coming out
with better prepaid plans so that you
know someone could buy the 33 from a
European retailer like clothes coat UK
pop in an AT&amp;amp;T prepaid SIM card and
you know they've got premium data voice
and text just as if they were to sign a
contract absolutely but if they for some
reason want to change let's say t-mobile
comes out with a better prepaid plan
they can move so I think they're there
is somewhat of a shift that I don't
think many people you know everyone's
locked into a contract so they're not
really paying attention but I think
there are a lot of really good prepaid
options in fact I use tmobile prepaid as
my primary line because I don't like to
be tied down for two years so so anyway
um yeah just getting back to the boy
enjoying the conclusion i personally
think that the lack of innovation both
hardware and software wise killed all HP
smart phone division and webos this is
my personal opinion I think I think we
can chalk it up as as such and let us
move on to the next thing and sorry if
you hear Tony breaking up a little bit
where do I break am I still breaking up
a little bit it's ok it comes in and out
we were doing this over skype since he
lives you know 3,000 miles away so it
made that that doesn't what could make
that 10,000 10,000 miles I think the
earth isn't even 10,000 miles around but
maybe a lady maybe I just thinking in
kilometers yeah maybe so you know that
is his quality should clear up it might
have something to do with us whether I
don't know aliens you know so let us
talk about the google nexus prime now
the nexus brand is a very strong brand
the nexus one was awesome the nexus s
was awesome people still use the nexus
one people still use the nexus s
obviously very good phone still and now
the nexus prime might come around we
don't really know much about it except
that it might be a pretty beastly phone
we're talking perhaps a true 720p
display i want to talk about for a sec
so regarding these HD screens i rode in
editorial on August eighteenth about
them a lot of manufacturers right now
like to call their screens HD you know
motorola will do it samsung will do it
they say clear crisp HD screen well it's
not
d it's not even close you know they do Q
HD screens right now on android which is
540 across x 960 up and they call that
qhd because it's literally the quarter
of 1080p HD resolution hopefully you're
following me so far if there were to be
a phone like the HTC vigor for example
oh or the samsung nexus prime that's
coming out with a true 720p screen that
would make for a pixel density of 342
which means if you take a cross-section
of the screen you cut off a one inch by
one inch square you would count 342 tiny
tiny tiny little pixels on the iphone if
you do the same thing you'll get to
about 326 pixels now Steve Jobs like to
say that after 300 pixels the I cannot
see pixels anymore so there really
wouldn't be that big of a difference
between you know 326 PPI of 342 PPI
except that you have more screen real
estate to work with you eyes can improve
so this upcoming nexus prime to run
perhaps ice cream sandwich on android
4.0 with a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor maybe even a quad-core
processor with the 720p screen is going
to be a freaking beast it's going to be
ridiculous and in 2012 is going to be
the year of a 720p display and it's
going to be super crisp super clear it's
going to blow away what what apples are
done with with the iphone 4 and it might
be coming to verizon first it's just
normal that we're going to to higher and
higher resolutions because let's take
just a couple of examples we don't even
look at smartphones if they not they
cannot capture 720p video and if you
capture a 720p video and you play that
back on a screen which is smaller than
the videos native resolution of course
the quality gets worse this applies of
course for for pictures taken to this is
number one number two
I have to agree with you on the screen
real estate sometimes my my screen
regardless if I use iOS or I use Android
is so seems to be so tiny that I have to
flick to the second or the third home
screen to find what I'm looking for yeah
maybe smaller icons larger screen in
terms of real estate more information
available at a glance aside from from
the usual which is good for your eyes
and better quality and display I think
it's all about more information
available to you at a glance whenever
you take a look at your phone yeah and
you know would be cool I'm trying to
find a tape measure but I cannot um when
we get to these higher resolution 720p
on an android screen so that we don't
have to shave our fingers down to be
really tiny it would help if they could
make the screens bigger well you make
the screen bigger the device gets bigger
well not necessarily true if you take a
device like the evo 4G or the galaxy s2
and you look at it you see how much
extra space they have on the sides on
the top and on the bottom to stretch
that screen I bet if you were to
maximize the screen on galaxy s2 the evo
whatever you'd get two not four point
six inches maybe more and it would have
to be wide screen because 720p is a wide
screen resolution and that means that
you'd have to increase the screen size
more so vertically then on the sides
which is perfect because you know
there's there's going to be more room on
the top of the bottom so i think it's
going to be really sweet to see what
what comes out in 2012 in terms of
larger screen devices with super
high-res displays and crazy fast
processors it's going to be glorious
yeah but I have a question and of course
the nexus prime is rumored to have at
least a 5.2 inch display five points 20
something what does it make a tablet a
tablet and what does it make a smart
phone a smart phone where's the line
between them I mean holding a 5.2 inch
smartphone in your hand you can say that
you're holding a small tablet in your
hand so what's what's that thin line
between smartphone and tablet because
it's it's blurring away I think I think
the lines are easy i think it's pocket
ability I think at the point at which
you cannot hold it into the pocket hold
it in the pocket comfortably it's a
tablet but then then there's a big
difference between like that borderline
tablet around five inches and a
comfortable tablet at seven inches and
obviously you can't comfortably put a
7-inch tablet in your pocket you
obviously can't do a 10 inch tablet so
so you'd say that up until six inches
it's okay to consider it a smartphone 6
inches and above it would be a tablet
because the software of course it will
be the same it's just the dimensions the
physical dimensions of the device I
don't think so I don't think six inches
is the number i mean if they could come
out with a six-inch phone that would
actually fit in your pocket so the the
dimensions would be too wide I mean to
why too tall wouldn't work I think five
inches is probably the maximum if you
make good use of the of the bezel and
you reduce the size of the bezel as to
not have to make the casing of the
device very but wouldn't make that that
5.2 inch nexus prime a tablet um well I
think for the nexus prime we're talking
about maybe 4.5 inch or four point six
inch where where do you see 5.2 well the
rumors were talking about a five point
26 if I colwell inches but there are
several other rumors which talk about a
four point something and I've read a
recent report and it said that we could
expect tube phones from Samsung
basically with the same internals the i
9220 which would have a 5 point
something display and an I 9210 which
would basically have the same internals
in terms of CPU memory and whatnot but
with a four-point something screen well
I guess we have to chalk this up as a
yeah we'll talk about this next week
because I'm sure by this time next week
we'll know more by this time next week
we should know more indeed we've got the
samsung event week from today and Tony
will be in Berlin for IFA a lot of oh
yeah a lot of fun smartphone stuff so
expect hands-on coverage if there's
gonna be a nexus prime at IFA next week
we're gonna get our hands on one and and
play with it in its full glory so
now you will be will so let us move on
HTC this is the season of smartphone
releases of course holiday seasons
coming up companies want you to buy
stuff and we will people go buy stuff
yes HTC's holding an event in London
which is important because usually when
they do it in London it has nothing to
do with AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile verizon or sprint
and just a second I'm interrupting you
the same event is going to be held also
in other places like Paris too and so in
France and Italy so it's going to be a
simultaneous event from what I've read
and from what I've seen on HTC's
regional facebook accounts okay good
simultaneous event in Europe so it's a
very generic invite as is the case
they're going to say you know we want to
show you what's next okay and so we're
thinking that they're going to be
featuring two windows phone 7 devices
the Omega the eternity which should be
pretty exciting we haven't seen new
windows phone hardware since well a
freaking year that is it's been a very
long time since we've seen windows phone
hardware and which which sort of begs
the question how do you see the current
state of of Windows Phone I guess let's
look at it from the perspective of
Microsoft who want to sell lots of
devices and earn lots of royalties and
also from the perspective of users who
want the platform to be competitive with
Android that want awesome devices to be
able to buy what do you think okay so
from Microsoft's perspective Microsoft
has been coming up with all these
excuses all we've been hearing from from
a year now is that Windows Phone 7 was
rushed to the market it lacked some
features which is the reason why it
didn't catch up to the competition
Android and iOS i recently read that it
sells even worse than Barra so Microsoft
came with a product which was not ready
for the market and we accepted that i
did at least and microsoft said that the
next day
thing to come as mango which will fill
up all the holes and we'll deliver the
experience which would have been
delivered or should have been delivered
by so last year when windows phone 7 was
launched if Microsoft screws this up
they will get out of the smartphone
business and this is my personal opinion
because one year after windows phone 7
is out in the market they are filling up
the blanks but i'm not sure and I now
I'm transitioning to the users
perspective I'm not sure the users are
willing to try anymore a Windows Phone
or another platform for that matter
because I'm okay with my android or I'm
okay with my iOS why should i switch to
Windows Phone when I did the switch from
windows mobile to the current platform
i'm using yeah so the timing is timing
is key here and it's always not not on a
Microsoft side they always have timing
wrong I think in part because the
company is so big and it's it's tough to
to innovate so I think from Microsoft's
perspective no they're not making money
on windows phone 7 there they have what
five percent of the market share but
they can they can pull an xbox here they
can be lose millions and millions of
dollars for years and years and if they
have a reason to believe but it's going
to be profitable they'll stick in there
and bleed money until there's a turning
point so I think Microsoft's not happy
with it necessarily but they know they
have to be serious about it I mean they
have to be in mobile they are a software
company for the use oh sorry you want
say something no no longer one I was I
was going to agree with you very good i
like it when you agree uh from the users
perspective you know I can't really tap
into the brains of of the average
smartphone using person but for me I you
know I've used mango I haven't used it
yet as a daily driver it's out there you
can get it on pretty much any phone
mango isn't mangos very good but when I
compare it to like my samsung galaxy s2
running Android which is it's an
extremely fast device it's got you know
I've rooted it it's got a custom rom and
it just works perfectly I can't feel a
need to use windows phone seven unless
something comes along to make it
interesting again and I think that's
where the hardware is going to come in
you know Microsoft put all its cards on
the table a long time ago with Magda
like here's what we're going to fix
here's what's going to happen so we know
that mango is what we got until next
year you know there's tango coming out
which is going to be from low end
markets and then Apollo windows phone 8
in in presumably a year from now and
there's got to be some really really
interesting hardware to jazz up windows
phone 7 and we're going to get it
hopefully to the extent that Android is
so what let me ask you this Tony what
what hardware evolutions which you have
to see the run Windows Phone 7 mango to
make Windows Phone 7 look awesome to you
oh I got an answer to that i'm waiting
for sea ray so am waiting for that
fantastic nokia hardware run oh yes
sirree oh yeah yeah and I'm waiting for
that at least sweat off megapixel camera
that would probably kill some low key
and it s and that will be a huge selling
point for me i've been using malgo rtm
and even the mat at the mango beta 1 and
beta tues as my daily driver I have
nothing against Windows Phone I like it
it does everything I throw at it I don't
need anything else it's just that I hate
running on my LG optimus 7 which is a
wave one device and it doesn't make it
pictures and yeah well you know there
any there they were all the same you
know I mean and and we don't even know
yet if mango is going to be able to
support dual core or even needed but I I
completely agree with you the the Nokia
partnership is going to play out big and
we're going to see this nokia c array
which is of course the windows phone 7
version of the n9 and it is some
glorious hardware I mean it is I see a
picture of it and I feel
like that thing inside of me that says I
gotta have it I don't care you know I
don't care what it costs I gotta have
one in my pocket because it's it's made
of metal it's just it's it is really
good stuff and you know hopefully nokia
gets it right with this with sea ray
they release it in time for this next
wave of devices and hopefully they've
optimized the heck out of it so it's
really fast screen sensitivity is off
the charts the camera is impeccable and
you know we expect nothing else from
Nokia they have really good cameras on
their phones but yeah see ray is going
to lead the way you know there's rumors
of a galaxy s2 like device running
windows phone seven ish I'd buy that one
too I'd buy that you know with a super
amoled plus screen they got to come out
with a successor to the focus certainly
and that's exactly you know the focus is
a galaxy yes and so the the update would
be a galaxy s2 inside with perhaps an
Exynos processor do you know about
whether windows phone 7 supports you
know dual-core know from chassis one
which we know it's not dragon Wanderers
processors and chassis to was made
public this year's myths and it's 800
megahertz processors and this is a
personal concern of mine because I've
heard so many rumors of upcoming HTC
windows phones and other Windows Phone
sporting the CPUs which are above 1
gigahertz 1.4 1.5 I don't think they fit
in the current chassis specifications so
I'm not sure what what's happening
Microsoft is clear either Snapdragon 1
gigahertz processor which is wave 1 or
Snapdragon 800 megahertz processor which
is way too where does that 1.4 1.5 fit
in yeah yeah we're gonna have to see
about that and you know there's going to
be I think he it looks like there's
going to be several different OEM events
like HTC's doing one of course that we
just talked about instead of like last
year Microsoft how the event and they
released nine devices I prefer that I
think that's better so you know
obviously its ease of you for us to
cover being in this industry but it
helps to sort of you know
by the message and you know Ballmer
could explain what this wave 2 means
what can we do we really want that as we
speak about Windows Phone mango and the
OEMs today the first Windows Phone 7
mango device was launched in japan
toshiba together with Microsoft and
carrier kddi where I launched the is 12
t which is a strange name for a windows
phone so is the first windows full metal
on the market and if you live in Japan
you can grab with its ratings waterproof
is that it 12 megapixel camera it's I
like the pink one does it make me kinky
that doesn't make you kinky I don't
think that's the right part okay anyway
let's move on from this before we get in
trouble okay um so Antonio you're
breaking up a little bit there so maybe
you can make it just it's the pink
windows phone it's the pink windows
phone that's making break up um anyway
so next up on our list when they release
the iphone 4 they kept the 3gs around at
a lower price and rumor is it's funny
that every piece of apple news is a
rumor um rumor is that they're going to
keep around the or they're going to make
an 8 gigabyte version of the iphone 4
going to keep it around for a lower
price but I'm kind of wondering you know
why are they gonna make an entirely new
phone they don't make an 8 gigabyte
right now 16 or 32 why would they make a
low respect device in fact I would think
that they would go higher they go with a
32 gigabyte model they make it 99 bucks
or 59 bucks or 49 bucks and they'd have
the iphone 5 be of course of the premium
price so that is kind of strange that
they would they would do that I think
there's no questions the iphone 4 has
another gear I mean it's still really
great hardware and there's a lot of
people that still want it and if its
price lower all the better yeah but what
if they go in six months from now with a
free iphone 4 they will have a budget
iPhone 4s with a lower capacity storage
but higher
respects like maybe the iphone 5 sub
cheaper materials and have the premium
flagship which will be the iphone 5 then
they will have something for everyone
Wow and that's something they would do
they would give us more than we thought
so they take the old version make it
better sell it for less bring out this
amazing new thing with a dual-core
processor and bigger screen no 20 gigs
of ram worse than that and make sure it
will be elegant and it will be top notch
and the materials used will be of course
on Apple standards because it's so
unlike Apple to come up with a product
which would be squeaky and could be
easily scratched and plastic and so on I
like my phone squeaky why you know I
don't think that's such a bad name well
I hate it I like to keep a phone in my
hand and my squeeze it I just want to
feel a compact slab in Miami yeah very
cool let us move on I think we're going
to skip ahead a couple of things here
for the sake of keeping this as close to
an hour as possible let's go to the back
to Windows Phone um I always kind of had
a problem with the way that Microsoft
thought about their their products you
know they're very business focus so they
try to get into every market they can
and they see big dollar signs in the
lower end of market the developing
countries and you know people that are
12 years old or whatever and you know
don't have a job and whatever and you
know we're talking about Windows Phone
tango which is a version between mango
and Apollo and and Microsoft has
confirmed that there's a tangled version
for lower and devices and i'm trying to
think back didn't they do something like
this for windows mobile they had some
sort of lower spect something I can't
remember I mean we had windows mobile
five then came 6.0 then 6.1 and 6.5 and
from what I know even low end my HTC
Trinity ran windows mobile 6.5 yeah me I
don't know what I'm thinking about but
the point is
they spend resources you know people's
time energy and subsequently money to
develop this version this risky version
of Windows Phone for developing nations
when they could take that same amount of
resources and plow it into Apollo or
mango updates or whatever I just I don't
get it I don't get why they would
sidetrack this early in well of course
it's because of the money because they
want to sell more and the more markets
you're in the more money comes in if you
see just windows phone as you know it
now was officially launched and
supported in five countries with pipe
languages and that's a deal breaker for
many including me who are in Romania and
I cannot use the live services but I
don't look as Windows Phone tango as a
completely different platform because
that will introduce some fragmentation
and Microsoft doesn't want that right
I'm not sure how they will pull this off
because having to say a samsung whatever
running tango in Romania and a samsung
whatever running mango in the United
States what's the difference so more
fragmentation let more bulky and late
updates and they don't want more ? sin
in the equation I think tango will be an
update which which will apply to all the
windows phones will bring some new
features which will not be ready or they
don't want to hold on to them until a
polo comes out but maybe we could see
those chassis two phones with 800
megahertz which will be cheaper and
talking about cheaper phones one of the
main main targets of Nokia is to come
out with cheap windows phones so I think
we're going to see an update which will
be called tango which will be applicable
to all windows phones but it will
introduce maybe chassis three or maybe
optimization for the lower and 800
megahertz processor this is the way I
see because if we're talking about the
completely new platform
which is only for countries like I don't
know serbia croatia romania and so on
countries which are not important to the
market as the USA UK Spain Italy Germany
and so on Australia I'm sorry if I
forget somebody then it will be a big
trouble for Microsoft I don't even want
to talk about phones 800 megahertz
processor it's depressing it really is
but what what doesn't what does it take
for a phone to to operate well do you
need strong dual-core processors like an
Android if you order this phone 7 as it
exists now on device with an 800
megahertz processor it's going to be
slow that's why they're probably going
to make tengo tu to you know take out
some of the animations and make for a
poor experience so that they can make
more money in other markets so it's
disingenuous to the brand but you know
yeah well let's move on before I throw
something at the monitor here speaking
of Microsoft they've confirmed that
Windows Phone 7 devices will have front
facing cameras with mango and will work
with skype of course Microsoft bought
skype recently and this is very very
interesting I think this has
implications across the entire
smartphone industry Apple has not been
able to make facetime a standard in the
smartphone industry they've kept it
close to iPads and iPhones and let alone
whether people actually use it which I
don't think they do it's made it
impossible for an android phone to face
time with a with a p and iphone and
microsoft is changing that they're using
skype which is an open protocol or is it
open i don't think it's not open but
it's everyone has it there's 700 million
skype accounts everyone and their mother
and their father has a skeptical they're
putting this into windows phone 7 so
that Windows Phone 7 can out of the box
talk to the skype on your computer on
your android phone on your iphone and
this is a really big jump for microsoft
the
I think Apple could have could have you
know done something with but they they
didn't fulfill their promise of opening
up facetime well I think this time is
specific for those who are Apple fans I
mean if you have a macbook or imac and
you are using an iphone or your buddies
are using an iphone you will definitely
use the facetime feature in the future
but skype became unwillingly maybe a
standard when it comes to video calling
I mean as you said apples FaceTime
didn't manage to challenge it Google's
video didn't manage to challenge it
quick and the other offerings are are by
far in lower quality than then skype is
but I think the issue here is is not the
actual catching up but Microsoft is
trying to bring something new to the
table I mean as you said you can use
skype from your windows phone out of the
pocket to talk to anybody regardless of
their platform and this isn't a direct
effect of Microsoft buying skype because
everybody was afraid that now Microsoft
has bought skype and now we will have no
skype updates on Android and on other
platforms now they are committed to
constantly updating the experience I
think what we will have here is is a new
era because Microsoft would skype and
with Facebook go for a huge trio and if
you add up nokia to that game then you
got a winner it's a good point there's a
lot of a very important assets it's like
Windows Phone 7 right now and you know
it'll serve them well um they're making
big moves with Windows Phone 7 they're
not really taking you necessarily baby
steps it's a big big deal to integrate
skype right out of box i mean to to be
able to press the skype button on your
new phone you just brought home type of
years and years name and password and
boom you're making video calls with
anyone that as a skype again I think
that's yeah and if they manage to
integrate it the way they integrated
facebook and mango then it will be a hit
which I don't know how they will manage
because mango has already arty and we
have already the first windows for mango
out in the market
skype integration will come somewhere in
the at the end of the 3rd or beginning
of the fourth quarter so it will come
this year I don't know how they will
manage to implement skype in the People
Hub maybe with a full rom update which
will be delivered maybe by next time do
I to all of the phones yeah yeah we'll
have to see um it should be cool and it
should be poppin fresh yep um all right
well with that let's uh let's let's end
the 16th edition of the pocket now
pocket casts season two thank you
everyone for your patience and thank you
for those of you that are listening we
apologize for the audio issues we'll
work on that and make sure that won't
happen again and doesn't that terrible
oh it wasn't that bad there's a couple
of times where I had trouble hearing you
but I think people can make out what you
were saying again thank you everybody
for listening and please leave us some
feedback on how you like this podcast
and what you want to hear from us I want
you don't want to hear from us more they
don't want to hear about my kinkiness
yeah yeah I think that's a different
thing in the u.s. than it is in Romania
but yeah we'll talk about that offline
okay all right well uh ciao for now
thanks a lot touch out bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
