hint to a bezel s display with a
fingerprint scanner Samsung begins
teasing its unpacked event from WC 2014
and Microsoft Windows Phone 8.1 DK
reveals a huge list of improvements I'm
hi Mary that I and if a spaceship is
traveling at the speed of light will it
need its headlights this is parking out
daily let's run off with some official
news as Google has just updated their
Google Search application for Android
and bring some significant improvements
first of all and probably the best one
is the fact that it now can pinpoint who
your family members are meaning once you
tell it which your sister and your
mother and your wife are eventually
you'll just have to tell if the texture
wife instead of having to specifically
say the name of the person you currently
see this in serie but just like in
Google search you will have to teach
Siri which is your sisters so it's
pretty much the same functionality it's
just great to see that google search
keeps evolving especially when we expect
Kourt canada probably bring something
more innovative to Windows now let's
talk about the HTC m8 one of the most
anticipated devices of the year which is
the successor to the m7 which is the one
we get the first league photograph of
the phone and even though it does look a
lot like the HTC One there are some
refinements and the borders of the phone
also on the top and the bottom and we do
see that the hardware buttons are gone
so we're expecting for this phone to be
announced very soon we're dreaming for
an mwc announcement but stay tuned we'll
see about that and speaking of them to
me see one company that has been done
teasing their event to Samsung though
this is kind of interesting we were
expecting for the galaxy s5 to be
announced at this event because we do
see a number 5 over the unpacked and
text but as we see this teaser we see a
lot of elements from the TouchWiz UI but
not necessarily a phone we don't see a
teaser her phone so if you think about
it it seems that TouchWiz is currently
on version four point oh so could this
be that all we're getting is the
announcement of version 5 point out of
the beliefs EE and not really the galaxy
s5 hopefully we will be getting more
than just a new version of TouchWiz now
sorry about Apple and Samsung on the
same news and this is actually not about
them on a lawsuit this is really
interesting the Korean Times is
reporting that apparently the
next-generation iphone
and the next generation galaxy s5 will
both include a bezel less display that's
capable of fingerprint scanning at least
in the lower portion of this phase the
technology is not really very it and its
really interesting we don't really
understand why we are getting this
teaser of two different phones that are
competing that'll bring the same
technologies now obviously if Apple
wants to make the iphone 6 be one-handed
friendly and also be bigger than with no
bezels on the displays the best way to
go but obviously stay tuned this is
going to be really interesting as well
competing phone is doing the same thing
we have seen samsung doing a lot of
better work in this department but we'll
see and finally for the hot news of the
day is the Windows Phone 8.1 SDK was
seeded to developers yet we've got a ton
of leaks a lot of screenshots of what to
expect and man this is probably one of
the biggest revamps of Windows Phone and
years and the reason why is because we
get Action Center we get windows phone
applications merging with Windows RT in
a way we're getting a lot of stuff lots
of changes again links in the
description the list is just so big that
i would spend pretty much a long time
trying to explain this then i only get
three minutes on this video but that
means you to the question of the day
again please read the article in the
links of the description and tell us
that of all these changes would this
make you buy a Windows Phone in 2014
because in my particular case I am quite
excited this pretty much brings Windows
Phone on par with Android and iOS and I
am really expecting for this to launch
soon but it will depend on Microsoft but
leave us a comment down below will you
buy windows phone after all these
changes and friends you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
