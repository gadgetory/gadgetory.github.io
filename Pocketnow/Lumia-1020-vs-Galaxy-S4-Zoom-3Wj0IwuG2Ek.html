that redefined the term camera phone
a pair of smartphones that placed
photography above all else on the spec
sheet they hail from different
manufacturers and they take completely
different approaches to delivering
outstanding optical quality but they're
both on store shelves this holiday
season so let's see how they fare in a
head-to-head challenge I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
Nokia Lumia 1020 vs. samsung galaxy s4
zoom we've already reviewed both of
these devices separately at pocket now
if you're not already subscribed here on
the tube and following us on social
media take care of that so you don't
miss future reviews it takes a grand
total of maybe three seconds to see what
the hardware differences are here in one
corner nokia has taken the chassis of a
Lumia 900 inflated it a little and added
a silver dollar sized camera module
containing an optically stabilized 41
megapixel PureView sensor the result is
a smartphone that we nicknamed the
warthog in our full review thanks to its
somewhat awkward feel in hand and
interesting appearance but awkward would
be a generous word for the galaxy s4
zoom it's less a smart phone than a
camera really a hardware stabilized 16
megapixel sensor made it to an optical
zoom lens and put in a casing that
doesn't just resemble a point-and-shoot
it is one and using it as a phone feels
exactly as ridiculous as it sound you
might think that disparity means the
Samsung phone has the better camera
software but that's not necessarily the
case
if anything the viewfinders here are
tied even though they're quite different
with the 1020 you're getting the same
suite of camera apps you'll find on the
rest of the high-end Lumia line allowing
for everything from manual focus
exposure and shutter speed to fun
features like moving object removal and
action shot as well as the new Nokia
refocus app which lets you select your
focal point after a photo is taken the
galaxy s4 zoom viewfinder contains more
quick and dirty shooting modes and it's
actually a little easier to use as a
result the manual controls are here if
you want them but they're not quite as
it forward as Nokia's sliders the end
result is that you're probably going to
be using the mode select more often
which is a more enjoyable experience
anyway elsewhere of course there are a
bevy of differences between the Android
powered Samsung and Nokia's Windows
Phone 8 software we've covered those
differences in any number of videos and
editorials for a better idea of how
these devices operate as smartphones
check out the full review of each unit
what you're really here for after all is
the camera comparison how does the 16
megapixel zoom stack up against the 41
megapixel PureView well once you get the
cameras launched which is much easier on
the Lumia by the way thanks to the
OneTouch unlock feature of its shutter
button you quickly get the sense that
these are both really really excellent
smartphone cameras picture quality in
broad daylight is quite stunning the
galaxy s4 zoom sensor isn't fully
utilized out of the box defaulting to 12
megapixels to preserve a widescreen
aspect ratio and the Lumias 41 megapixel
sensor is also reined in by the pure
view pixel sampling producing more
manageable 5 megapixel shot this
reduction in resolution doesn't do
anything to hurt the performance in
either case the cameras producing photos
rich in color and sharpness the Lumia
tends to favor higher saturation and
contrast and most outdoor settings while
indoors under various forms of
artificial lighting results are a little
less consistent zoom performance is
where these devices vary most notably
which should be no surprise considering
one of the phones is called zoom and yes
indeed it's the Samsung phone that wins
the day here the galaxy s4 zoom makes up
for the absurdity of its gargantuan lens
with 10 times optical magnification
beating out the lossless digital zoom of
the Lumia 1020 it's really quite
stunning to have this kind of MAG
ability on something called a smart
phone no matter how much of a wink and a
nudge that term comes with in this case
the galaxy s4 zoom might be something of
a one-trick pony but that trick is a
very impressive one indeed
back in Nokia's traditional stronghold
night shooting the Lumia manages to
extract more light from photos but
that's not always a good thing
shots are also considerably more noisy
with Nokia's camera compared to
Samsung's now keep in mind these
examples were shot with essentially out
of box settings on the Lumia and a
simple night mode option on the zoom any
degree of tweaking with the manual
settings could help these out so it's
interesting to see how aggressively the
1020 tries to pull light from a scene
even in automatic mode and the Samsung
phone zoom is no less impressive at
night time shooting low-light video with
each at a concert the zoom managed to
pull a bit more light from the scene and
obviously was the preferred choice for
magnification audio output was also
higher on the Samsung phone probably due
to Nokia's special acoustic filters
meant to even out the sound of live
events just like these
in every other department these devices
behave exactly as their forms suggest in
areas like voice calls messaging
browsing gaming and so on the Lumia 1020
mostly outperforms the zoom that's
primarily thanks to its superior
responsiveness the Zoom is kind of a dog
when it comes to software but it
shouldn't come as a surprise this is a
case where you can definitely judge a
book by its cover and in that sense the
1020 is the smartphone the zoom is just
a camera that happens to act like a
phone ironically the thing we discussed
the least in this comparison is going to
be the factor that matters most the
platform because Android or Windows
Phone is the question you're going to
have to answer first on the bright side
there are plenty of comparisons at
PocketNow and elsewhere to help you
answer that question and either way you
go you'll be getting the very best
optical performance the ecosystem has to
offer if that's your primary concern we
think you'd be pretty happy with both of
these products and we hope you enjoy
whichever one you pick up if you want to
see more in these phones folks we've got
it full reviews of each as I mentioned
before and a recent review rebuttal
featuring the s4 zoom as well as a lot
of comparisons recently featuring the
1020 still everyone's favorite Windows
Phone super camera phone toss us a like
if you enjoyed the video before you go
anywhere leave us a comment down below
let us know which one you picked up
which one you would advocate picking up
as we go into the holiday season but
most importantly thank you very much for
watching it's been Michael Fisher with
PocketNow we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
