pocket now calm the motorola droid razr
and droid razr maxx now have ice cream
sandwich and with it a less intrusive
version of motoblur isn't any good let's
find out in this video alright let's get
start started we'll go right to the lock
screen which has that updated Ice Cream
Sandwich look and feel you can drag it
into a variety of apps this is most
likely configurable now so you can set
your favorite apps there and up here if
this thing would go away we've got what
looks to be a quick toggle yes between
vibrate and to sound on so that you can
quickly without having to unlock the
screen go into a different profile so
let's unlock the display here this is a
widget actually had it earlier so I
haven't added any apps onto this yet
it's completely stock we're just going
to move around and see the fluidity of
the interface or to see what the various
components look like so the notification
shade slightly different than stock Ice
Cream Sandwich it looks a little bit
different but we've got that
functionality where we can swipe off
individual notifications and we can also
jump into settings from here which is
always nice and we've got the Ice Cream
Sandwich style toggles and what is
really a nice looking settings menu it's
kind of a combination between what HTC
Samsung likes to do with their lots of
color in in the settings and what stock
ice cream sandwich looks like which is
no color at all so kind of a nice
combination of both it's really compact
if we go to about phone we are on for
point 0 point for so the absolute latest
version of ice cream sandwich no word
yet if this is going to be upgraded to
jellybean although certainly the
development community will make it
possible once Android source code is
released so we've got a lot of typical
ice cream sandwich stuff here to look at
we're not going to go through all of it
let's go back to the home screen and
jump into the app tray and the app tray
Motorola kept it pretty much stock which
is something we always like to see so
we've got the sort of pagin aided app
tray that when you get all the way to
the right it jumps to the next tab here
which is widgets and from here of course
we can tap and drag a widget to the Home
screen
no resizing of widgets here which isn't
stock functionality anyway nice cream
sandwich but some third party lawmakers
have it just keeping it simple this is
very familiar so you can add a variety
of shortcuts to this kind of nice
looking actually a quick dial widget
that you can move around but of course
you can't resize as mentioned we get a
choice of one two three four five home
screens no more no less you can't do any
pinch to zoom or really homescreen map
management and from here we can also
look at the multitask you I but first
let's jump in the camera get some more
programs into memory and let's see what
they did Motorola did with the camera
app it's definitely not stop Ice Cream
Sandwich so over here oh that's a really
fast way to toggle between camera and
and the camcorder not as fast or as
intuitive as the HTC Sense counter which
puts the video recording and the photo
button right in the same right on the
same screen we can flip to the
front-facing camera here oh hi how you
doing that's a beautiful shot and from
here we can do a bunch of effects it has
1080p resolution of course and so on and
so forth oh that's really cool it does
that go halfway oh no it's either out or
in that would be cool if you can kind of
select how far out it goes let's go back
to the home screen there's a little bit
of lag so as you can see i press the
home screen button well maybe we can
recreate it go back into the camera app
bring this around okay press the home
button yeah there's still a little bit
of lag here which is kind of to be
expected unless you're running jellybean
really it definitely feels a lot faster
than gingerbread at least so let's press
on the home button and see the multi
task queue I kind of got that that
animation there and of course if you
absolutely despise animations you can go
into dis way and is there an animation
setting here no it's actually in
development sometimes they keep it out
of there so we can go to developer
options and we can go to window
animation scale animation off transition
off and now things are a little bit
faster
it's a really good tip for any device
running ice cream sandwich turn off the
animations if we go into the multi task
list it still animates a little bit
regardless of whether you choose that
and you can swipe things off the screen
let's jump into the browser real quick
see if there are any changes so far it
looks relatively fluid okay so wants to
go on a Wi-Fi network so far this looks
like the stock ice cream so much web
browser and we can confirm confirm that
in a minute let's go to pocketnow.com
keyboard also looks kind of stock-based
cream sandwich but the keys are actually
a little bit taller on them so it might
be familiar to some so we'll go to
mobile site all right now we're over 4g
LTE so we've got a Wi-Fi light
connection basically it's quite fast
around here so switch the desktop view
see what it's like panning around a
complex web web page and we've got our
tab management here again this is stock
ice cream sandwich well go into the
settings in the browser and see yep it's
got the labs it's got the quick controls
this is this is the stock ice cream
sandwich browser which is great because
it's it's pretty good so you get those
quick controls see how fast it goes in
the landscape okay so that wasn't that
fast let's move quickly around the page
a little bit lag of lag when you when
you first give that a lot of input who
knows maybe that's by design what's
pinch-to-zoom a little little crazy here
with how it just did that and I'm not
really overwhelming this but if I just
move up it lags okay it's good there
yeah so you know this is definitely a
step up from where it was before the
droid razr was always kind of fast but a
little bit laggy and now it's just a
little bit better at least it's got the
the ice cream sandwich stuff like the
improved app drawer and better
notifications and the multitask you I
and all of those other things so a
really relatively good upgrade you know
if I was on verizon I definitely be
interested in getting jelly bean on my
galaxy nexus it's got a higher risk
display it's faster with jelly bean it's
much faster and
and that's and that's a great device but
of course if you've got a droid razr
already there's no reason not to upgrade
to ice cream sandwich it's an
over-the-air update and it's really easy
to do so that was a quick look at ice
cream sandwich here on the droid razr
this is actually the droid razr maxx
it's got the bigger battery but they're
both the same in terms of performance if
you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now
