pocket now calm and this is the software
review of the highly anticipated dell
venue pro running Windows Phone 7 let's
get to it so in this video we're going
to talk about Windows Phone 7 in general
you probably know it already you've seen
it a lot we're going to compare the dell
venue pro with the Samsung Focus another
windows phone 7 device to see if there's
any differences in performance between
the two then we're going to do a web
speed test across an Android device
windows phone 7 and an iphone to see if
the if the dell venue pro performs well
when browsing the web so first let's
talk about the functionality of the
slider obviously the dell venue pro has
this awesome slide out keyboard which
you can use to turn on the device and
unlock the screen now that's a good
thing because the dell venue pro is
power button is awkwardly placed on the
top and it's really difficult to reach
for especially since the device is so
tall so it's nice to be able to slide
slide open the keyboard flip up the
screen and get into the phone quickly
like that now unfortunately the the
slider doesn't have any other
functionality meaning you can't answer
call with it you can't end a call with
it which is quite annoying another thing
i've noticed after using this device is
that when i've got the keyboard open and
my fingers are down here sometimes there
are elements at the top of the screen
that I must reach for and because the
device is so tall here's a perfect
example right so I want to start typing
up there so I've got to take my hands
move all the way up there and start
typing it's kind of inconvenient having
the device be so big but if you're
getting the venue pro you probably don't
really mind that the device is so tall
now another inconvenience about the the
keyboard is that it's not really well
integrated into the operating system but
this is just a thing with Windows Phone
7 so you'd think from here the Start
screen you could just start typing and
something would happen while nothing is
going to happen if we go into the People
Hub you would think that you could look
up contacts just by typing them so let's
say I want to find Evan so I type Evan
nothing happens so I've got to hit the
search button and then died 11 and there
we
so it's not perfectly integrated with
the operating system but it comes in
handy when you're typing messages or
doing a variety of other things the
keyboard is really good but I got to
tell you the on-screen keyboard I think
is even better the windows phone 7
on-screen keyboard is so good on certain
devices like the Samsung Focus because
it's big it's easy to use but on the
dell venue pro thanks to the larger
screen the 4.1 inch display and thanks
to the curved glass display which I do
think helps a little bit typing with the
on-screen keyboard is a really good
experience so so we type a new message
we could say you know this is a test
fast speeds right very accurate let's
delete this and by the way when you have
the keyboard open it suppresses the
on-screen keyboard here's the on-screen
keyboard this is a test I think I can go
even faster with the on-screen keyboard
than I can with a slide-out keyboard but
it's nice to have for very long emails
because you get that tactile feedback
now let's go back to the start screen
the screen sensitivity is really
fantastic the device port performs
buttery smooth very well there's some
included applications on here that come
with the venue pro they're mostly
t-mobile programs like family room here
we're not going to get too much into
them so this will help you you know
coordinate your family life if you if
you've got a family on a tmobile plan
let's see what else we have that was
included on here my account which will
let you see sort of your minutes and
your balance and that sort of thing a
finance application was added TeleNav
GPS t mobile TV that's Twitter that's
not included I added that so really just
t-mobile programs were added to this
other than that it's a standard Windows
Phone 7 installation and it's fast so
speaking of that lets compare the dell
venue pro performance in opening apps
and browsing the web with that of the
samsung focus another windows phone 7
app which we thought was the fastest
windows phone 7 app but it turns out the
dell venue pro might actually be a
little bit faster now should mention
that the samsung focus here has been
used as a daily device for a couple of
months so it's possible that it's slowed
down a little bit
by added programs but Microsoft would
argue that Windows Phone 7 is not going
to slow down if you add more programs
who knows just telling you that so let's
move around and kind of get a general
sense for how both of these devices
perform and now it's really hard to tell
just by flicking around like that but
let's open twitter at the same time that
wasn't twitter so let's move this up a
little bit or an open twitter at the
same time it's the same up-to-date
version of twitter let's see which opens
faster dell venue pro got the splash
screen up first time line up first dell
venue pro one in that situation okay
let's see how long it takes to launch
internet explorer okay in that case the
samsung focus one let's go to a website
here we'll go to engadget okay so I've
got any gadget here let's tap the Go
button the same time hopefully looks
like we were a little slow on this side
that's ok we're going to tap on the same
link and try to get them to race let's
see here okay and they're off okay looks
like the Samsung Focus was actually
faster there okay let's go back the same
time Nexus test post here and let's see
here it looks like dump on your pro
finish there so it's kind of a back and
forth here but overall the dell venue
pro is opening up programs faster let's
see how fast it gets into the music hub
boom okay samsung focus was a little bit
faster there let's scroll down see we
can jump into the calendar what going to
the maps application kind of doing a lot
of misc press is here so let's swipe
over launch into the calendar on both
okay so faster on the dell venue pro so
both of these devices perform very very
well they're very fast devices i'd give
the edge a little bit to the dell venue
pro it just seems to open up screen so
incredibly fast moving around the
operating system i'll tell you if
microsoft added copy and paste and fast
app switching this would really be an
awesome device it already is but it's
got some untapped power there that could
really be taken advantage of
if if the operating system could support
those advanced features really good okay
so let's compare the dell venue pro with
some other operating systems here in
terms of the internet browsing speed
we're going to talk about android 2.3
here on the google nexus s and also of
course the iphone zoom out a little bit
so we can get all of these in the frame
okay so we are going to go to the same
website on all of these they have no
other tabs open let's start off with
good old pocket now okay so it's going
to be pretty much impossible to do all
three at the same time but maybe we'll
get lucky today let's try this we're on
the same Wi-Fi network by the way pretty
good it looks like it's actually
launching opera mobile okay fair i've
been using opera mobile as a default
browser here in on the nexus s with
opera turbo turned on certainly we
should turn that off okay and so let's
click on these top links here if
possible see which is faster ok so the
iphone was faster followed by the dell
venue pro followed by the nexus s let's
go to the bottom of the page so we can
flip open the full desktop version of
pocket now sort of a more graphic
intense version of the site so even get
this at the same time okay maybe not at
the same time but we'll see how how this
comes up obviously the dell venue pro is
holding its own it was the last to go
there and
alright it looks like the the Nexus S
finished first followed by the venue pro
looks like the iPhone is struggling a
little bit to keep up so let's move
around on these pages and see what it's
like as you can see the dell venue pro
is showing us a little bit more text or
pretty much the same as the nexus s the
iphone sort of started out in a more
zoomed out view see how smooth scrolling
is very very smooth on the dell venue
pro although it's equally as smooth on
on these other two devices web browsing
has really come a long way on
smartphones just really good performance
on the dell venue pro in terms of
internet and things like that so we can
move in zoom around the screen just
really good all-around performance
especially on the web so let's just dive
into a link here and watch it load of
course we have the full screen browsing
if you go into landscape which is a nice
addition although we still see the
progress bar at the top
and and there we go it's loading in
loading quite fast so overall the
software on the dell venue pro is is
great it's running Windows Phone 7 which
is a fast beautiful operating system the
device itself is fast we wish there was
more functionality with the slider so
that you could just start typing say on
the Start screen or so that you could
answer calls and end calls with it it's
a really awesome form factor that we
don't get to see that much so the dell
venue pro gets very high marks it's
potentially the fastest windows phone 7
device we don't have benchmarking tools
yet for windows phone 7 so it's hard to
say that scientifically but as you saw
compared to the samsung focus most of
the time it opened up screens faster it
loaded pages faster and overall it is a
powerful device with the great software
offering and the power of Windows Phone
7 so be sure to check pocketnow.com for
