calm and in this video we're going to
talk about how you update third-party
apps in windows phone 7 and compare that
process with android and the iphone so
let's get to it okay let's first start
off talking about android how you update
applications in android you actually get
a pulldown notification that will tell
you how many updates you have available
right now there is no notification
because I've just acted on one tapping
on the notification will link you right
to the android market here where you can
see a list of your installed
applications and whether any of them
have an update so launcherpro up here
has an update so i can update all of my
applications at one time if there's more
than one that has an update or do it
selectively but it works through the
notification shade that's basically how
you know there are updates available the
iphones a little bit different and it
actually works much like it does in
Windows Phone 7 so we have the App Store
notification up here that says to
implying that there are two updates
available tapping on the icon will bring
us right to the updates tab of the App
Store and it'll show us how many updates
are available trouble with this is that
once in a while the number will be lower
than the actual amount of updates it
doesn't update that often for example
you may have a two but there's actually
four applications that need to be
updated anyhow from here you can update
all of the apps or you can selectively
do so by tapping on them individually
and installing the apps now in Windows
Phone 7 as mentioned it's very much like
the iPhone so if we unlock the screen
here the live tile shows you that you
have one update or two updates depending
on how many there are if you tap on the
marketplace icon down here in the bottom
left corner it says one update tapping
on that will bring you into the app
updates screen and from here like on the
iPhone you can update all with one click
or you can tap on individual apps
unfortunately you don't get a changelog
and update apps individually from here
so a simple straightforward way to
update apps in windows phone 7 which is
nice because they're really trying to
woo developers have lots of third-party
apps that will hopefully be updated on a
regular basis if you like this video
please give a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
