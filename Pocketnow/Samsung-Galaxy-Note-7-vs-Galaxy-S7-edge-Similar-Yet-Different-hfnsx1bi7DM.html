Note seven is just in s7 edge with a
stylus and spending an extra hundred
dollars is probably not worth it
at first glance I would have probably
agreed but it turns out that this
comparison is not that simple I'm how
you met me that I was pocket now when
this is Galaxy Note 7 versus galaxy s7
edge
brought to you by D brand pocket aus
galaxy note 7 coverage is made possible
by D brand manufacturer of precision cut
vinyl skins for smartphones tablets and
other gadgets go to D brand.com slash
galaxy to pimp out your new galaxy note
7 the debate over which are the best
phones of 2016 is so far owned by
Samsung and you're pretty much looking
at them front and center
Samsung has taken over 2016 and this
time not just by the power of marketing
these two devices are probably the most
feature packed phones money can buy
right now so the question left this
which one is better
regularly answering that as a matter of
price or features but both devices were
designed to serve different market
segments for starters what you see here
is a very beautiful ends much friendly
blend of Gorilla Glass and 7000 series
aluminum the badass finish of the Onyx
black galaxy s7 edge is just this much
of a head turner as the coral blue of
the galaxy note 7 the differences lie in
size feel and materials the note 7
rounds to being around 3 millimeters
taller one millimeter wider zero point
two millimeters thicker and twelve grams
heavier than the SM Edge the metallic
seam is actually just this thick on both
but a minor angle on the SM edge makes
it feel sharper in the hand than the
note which feels like if you're holding
pure glass and that's not just any glass
as the note 7 uses the stronger Gorilla
Glass 5 compared to the fourth
generation on the s7 edge both Galaxy
sport gorgeous quad HD Super AMOLED
displays with curves on each side but
the added size of the note allows a
larger 5.7 inch unit compared to 5.5
sighs isn't the only point in favor of
the note as an MD ni chip also provides
more efficient HDR playback here
compared to the SM edge each is also
powered by similar specifications being
a snapdragon 820 processor or Exynos
88-90 along with 4 gigs of ram
expandable storage is also standard but
the note 7 wins this one would double
the base storage at 64 gigs and newer
specifications like USB type-c even a
fast and wireless charging remained
standard and regular charging isn't
really any faster over USB see there's
also ip68 water and dust resistant on
both devices for up to 30 minutes under
a meter of water even the cameras on
both devices are the same specifications
of 12 megapixels with face detection
autofocus MF 1.7 aperture at the back
and 5 megapixels at F 1.7 at the front
photos on both devices are just the
stunning during the day with amazing
color saturation deep contrast in detail
and both cameras enjoy the same exact
capabilities at night there are some
minor software differences between them
both where the note 7 favored swipes to
navigate between menus and the s7 edge
is more about buttons but what you care
about are there stills and both devices
deliver just as well even video
recording provides the same level of
saturation detail and even stabilization
and even though the note 7 includes HDR
video recording it's really hard to tell
the difference when you are or if
there's any benefit whereas in some
cases we've even noticed her in warping
when you walk that you can't really see
on the SM edge now when it came to
endurance results were mixed over Wi-Fi
and streaming our podcast for 30 minutes
the galaxy note 7 came on top on three
tests with a larger display and a
slightly smaller battery this is quite
puzzling as the s7 edge has been the
historical king of battery averaging six
hours of screen on time over four on the
note seven and yet it seems that
software updates have left the galaxy s7
edge behind at least 5% when compared to
the note 7 and recent testing
obviously Network and data speeds are of
influence but both devices perform
compare ibly given Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
aren't the best networks in this area
the speaker on the s7 edge is also
slightly louder than that of the note
though both have the most terrible
placement and smartphone history really
you won't notice that much of a
difference when using them in day to day
Sony is streamlining the hardware and
features up now these are the only two
departments where the SM edge wins
anything though the note 7 continues to
pull punches with an Irish scanner for
added convenience and biometric security
and last but not least yes the S Pen
these two separate hardware features
enable software that sets the notes of
an apart so your folder gives the Irish
scanner more value as this means that
whatever's in it can only be accessed by
you and that even includes separate
copies of applications for other logins
we have a separate video that details
everything the Irish scanner can do in
addition to secure folder and as for the
S Pen there is also a separate video
where we pretty much took 5 minutes to
describe all it can do this is not just
your average stylus to write on but a
Productivity tool like no other that
lets you take notes with the screen off
in addition to other very useful
features that you can only get on a
Galaxy Note and then there are other
differences like Samsung's new grace UX
only being part of the note 7 even
though both devices run marshmallow the
new refinements include a frictionless
experience with more subtle icons a
better looking settings menu in a
drop-down menu more enhancement to the
keyboard and even a blue light filter
making it better for you to use this
phone at night even the unique edge menu
of the s7 edge is no longer unique as
the galaxy note 7 brings that exact same
menu and addition to the same options to
get additional ones to the store
and if we were to compare other features
like for example the theme store or even
the always-on display the Galaxy Note 7
offers more options sure this is just
the software update away for the S of an
edge but it's not like if Samsung has
ever had positive fame in that
department and even using both phones on
a day to day basis feels the same yet
different both devices are just as fast
and snappy both include game launcher to
enhance your gaming experience and save
you from the capacitive keys and both
devices support the new Vulcan API for
more efficient gameplay overall the
biggest question left is if the hundred
dollar difference between each of these
devices is really worth taking the
plunge for a note 7 over the galaxy s7
edge some of you even argue that you
really don't need an S Pen or an iris
scanner which are all valid points you
actually don't need any of these
features but here's a thing for those
extra hundred dollars you get a stronger
glass body a future-proof USBC connector
new software rich tone HDR video 64 gigs
of storage instead of 32 a newer phone
that's not due for a change into late
next year and will receive software
updates sooner hopefully oh and then I
mentioned that you also get an iris
scanner in an S Pen usually competitors
like Apple only give you added storage
for $100 so in my opinion this is really
no topic for debate just get yourself
the newer galaxy note 7 and set yourself
apart from the crowd with this new blue
coral finish which is just gorgeous this
