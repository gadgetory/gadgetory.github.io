straight year that it can do some
seriously cool smartwatches but this
year it seems that it finally walks the
talk when it comes to its features
I'm high-net-worth pocket now let's have
a look at the new Casio WS DF 20
as much as I really wanted to like last
year's wsd f10 the behemoth of a watch
was really lacking in core features that
truly made it a SmartWatch for the
outdoors at the booth we were told that
this would be the outdoors dreamboat but
its act of hardware really set it aside
as a unique Android we're offering but
that was really it in 2017 the new WS DF
20 is a different story
sure externally it's very similar to its
predecessor sporting the same charging
mechanism gigantic vessels about the
only way to tell them apart is because
the text on the ring is now even larger
and even the difference is internally
our meter as we've got a ton of the same
sensors the only one that's now built in
that was really missing in the previous
one is the GPS because hey if you want
to go outdoors you just need a GPS
thank you Casio the company has also
enhanced that software to truly take
advantage of the new antenna so now you
can download your map leave your phone
at home and set all the walking points
you like for the next hike or some cool
new features like for example the fact
that the watch remembers where you like
to fish and then suggests fishing times
depending on its atmospheric conditions
since its sensors are able to detect
this and yeah you can trust that this
watch has everything but the kitchen
sink and if you notice differences in
the software that's because this is
running the new Android wear 2.0 so now
you can have standalone applications and
that's really what makes this watch be
able to do what it does in addition to
watch complications
you can now respond to messages even
with a keyboard Casio wsd F xx slated to
launch in April at the same $500 as its
predecessor if you're wondering why it's
gonna take so long that could be because
Google might be actually wanting to do
its own thing only time will tell for
now and while we wait make sure you

what you saw I am hi Mary thank you very
much for watching we'll see you on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
