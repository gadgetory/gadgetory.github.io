be spending a lot of time in close
quarters with your family and you may
need a way to pass the time without
killing each other or going crazy I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
these are the best classic board games
for iPad board games are a great way to
pass the time either with friends or
with family and as many of you head out
for the holidays there's a solid chance
you're going to need some form of
entertainment to keep your family from
going crazy if you forgot to pick up the
family favorite board game or stop at
the store to pick up one on your way to
Grandma's house
fear not many of the greatest classics
are available for iPad in the App Store
we sifted through some of the top rated
and picked some of the best classics
available Settlers of Catan is a
fantastic board game one of my personal
favorites USM games brought the classic
turn-based strategy game over the iPad
in Catan HD captured the fun and
challenge of the board game to near
perfection choose two star points for
your settlements and earn resources
based on the number of each die roll
which corresponds with the hexes
adjacent to your settlement for instance
if a six is rolled and your settlement
is on the corner of a forest hex labeled
six you will get one wood ration for
that roll use resources to build cities
roads and new settlements earned victory
points by building settlements cities
the longest road and or acquiring the
largest army first attend victory points
wins the game Catan HD for iPad can be
played as a pass in play or against
local AI and costs $4.99 a fraction of
the cost of the actual board game it's a
steal another great digital adaptation
of a classic board game is Ticket to
Ride although it's a lot newer than the
rest in our list it's still a new
classic game play is extremely simple to
learn choose at least two railroad
tickets to begin the game and play
combinations of like colored train cards
to connect your selected train stations
some rails are color agnostic some only
accept cards of a particular color the
longer the individual route the more
points it's worth once the player nears
the last train cards each player will
take one more turn based on the value of
the ticket connecting the selected
cities earned bonus points for failing
to connect them for result in a loss of
points the player with the most points
in the end wins
ticket to rag can be played solo against
AI online locally across multiple iPads
or as a pass and play game it may be
$6.99 but it's still far less than this
board game counterpart we're currently
addicted to this one if you're into
something a little more traditional
Scrabble is a great option if you're
unaware of how the game is played letter
tiles with designated values are played
out from the center over a grid
consisting of letter and word
multipliers the player with the most
points when all letter tiles are used
wins the gameplay is smooth and includes
an online multiplayer mode though the
game itself is rather expensive at $9.99
popular Scrabble lookalike words with
friends HD offer similar functionality
for only $4.99 chances are your friends
are playing Zynga's version if you're a
turn-based strategy expert in Catan or
Ticket to Ride doesn't grab your
attention the classic game risk should
your troops are deployed around the
globe and you must hold your lines and
advance on your enemies by drafting and
deploying new troops attacking and
fortifying to overtake the globe the
first to control the entire map wins
it's straightforward and the controls
are incredibly easy to learn you can
play single-player pass and play or play
on a local network best of all it's only
$0.99 and it's well worth the buy
battleship is another great buy gameplay
is simple arrange your naval fleet in an
attempt to dodge enemy fire sink your
enemy ships before they sink yours there
are three different play modes classic
salvo and super weapons each are
available in multiplayer mode as well
the graphics aren't the greatest but the
gameplay is just as addictive as the
classic board game and it's only $0.99
it's a great way to appease that
nostalgic itch finally a card game no it
isn't technically a classic board game
but we'll let it slide phase 10 is a
unique card game in that you must
complete ten phases each phase has a
specific hand of cards you must acquire
to play the phase phase one for instance
is two sets of three light numbered
cards the first to pass through each
phase wins points are required by
leftover cards from each round if two
players pass phase 10 in the same round
the player where the lower score wins
unfortunately there is no multiplayer
in phase 10 so you'll be stuck playing
this one solo fortunately though it's
only $0.99
