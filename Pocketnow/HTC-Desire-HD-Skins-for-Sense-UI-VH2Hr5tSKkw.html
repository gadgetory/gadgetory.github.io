pocket now calm the HTC Desire HD will
have skins so that you can finally
change the look of the sense user
interface for Andrea in case you want it
to be a little bit different and unique
this video we're going to talk about all
of the different skins that you'll be
able to choose from when the HTC Desire
HD comes out let's get to ok so again
we're running the HTC desire rom on the
HTC hd2 here i'll put a link up on the
video to our previous walkthrough of the
desire HD rom which also includes a link
on how to get it going on your HTC hd2
so this first skin here is called metal
because it looked kind of like silvery
brushed metal so if you look around the
clock we can kind of see the brush
metal-look the top bar is silvery if we
pull down the notification area we get
sort of a metal like look at the bottom
the little launcher down here is curved
and it kind of has a shine like metal if
we swipe to certain widgets will get
that metal look continue we go into
something like the clock here these
buttons down here are now rectangular
whereas in the default HTC sense they're
kind of bubble ish shaped so let's dive
into another skin so I'm going to go to
the personalized button and choose skin
and this is the picker for the different
skins really cool here's another one
called slate we showed this in the
previous video so we'll really quickly
review what it looks like and these
skins take about 10 to 15 seconds to
launch obviously on the desire HD that
will probably be less because everything
is optimized this is obviously running
on an hd2 which is not intended to run
android so here we are have the slate
interface so you get a rectangular
launcher down here a lot of people will
like this because some people think that
the curved sense launcher is really a
waste of space because it doesn't line
up nicely with the icons we've got kind
of a slight like look to the clock here
we put on the shade we get a different
style to the bottom if we swipe to the
left to go to a widget we get you know
the slight like look and if we tap on
the clock and we bounce back into this
sense interface we still have the
rectangular slider there so let's change
it again to the other skins
available this one's pretty cool it's a
little bit a little bit tacky but some
people may enjoy it because it's very
different it's the wood theme and it
looks like wood quite simply so here
it's loading so this is very much like
the slate theme in terms of what it puts
here on the bottom it's just a
rectangular launcher it's not the curved
one if we pull down the notification
area the bottom of the tray is a piece
of wood or it looks like wood the
background of the clock is wooden if we
swipe to the left the french stream here
has wood as its borders if we tap on the
clock again we see wood so an
interesting way to spruce up sense UI
again it's a little bit tacky but it's
very very different let's jump back into
the skin chooser here this one is very
very interesting I think a lot of
teenagers would like this it's called
blackboard it's very almost gothic and
actually kind of surprising that HTC has
this because it's not very elegant as
you're going to see in the same so it
looks kind of cartoony they change the
system font so look at the clock it
looks like it has a white chalk border
if we pull down the notification tray we
get sort of an industrial looking bottom
area here and up here it looks like
white chalk has been drawn on the
outline where it says the carrier flick
it back up we swipe to the left the
friend stream really hasn't changed that
much it doesn't have any blackboard like
border and if we tap on the clock we are
taken into the sense interface and we do
have chalk outlines here below on all of
the buttons okay let's finish up looking
at these different skins here and by the
way the idea is that you'll be able to
get even more skins down here with the
get more button and you'll go to HTC
Sense calm right now if you do that it
doesn't work so it's trying to load
skins from HTC hub and it doesn't work
and finally we have the default HTC
Sense skin that everyone's used to it's
been on the desire the droid incredible
and a lot of other phones that are out
there we get the animated wallpaper the
curved program launcher here and pretty
much what you would expect from HTC
Sense so that was a look at all the
skins that will come on the HTC Desire
HD it's really nice than
she's finally letting us change the look
of the sense interface even though it's
not dramatic it's a nice touch to be
able to change things and we're looking
forward to be able to go to the HTC hub
to get more skins beyond what's
pre-loaded on the device please give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and thanks for watching again I'll put a
link up on the video right now to get
back to the previous video where we did
a more comprehensive walkthrough of the
new desire HD rom that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
