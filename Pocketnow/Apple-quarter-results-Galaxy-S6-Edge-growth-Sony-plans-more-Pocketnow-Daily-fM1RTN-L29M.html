once again doesn't disappoint Samsung
reportedly invests heavily in making
more curved galaxy s6 edge units and has
sony lots of mind or is it just shifting
at six period focus again i'm high
memory betta and can you imagine how
many economies would be saved of apple
would share some of its revenue this is
 out daily the official new suit
i have there with facebook as the
company has just launched its own video
calling service for facebook Messenger
it works pretty much like what you see
with apples FaceTime with skype video
crawling the only problem is that it's
only available on certain countries
links in the description you'll have the
full list of countries and for the rest
will just have to wait up next let's
talk about Samsung is we've got credible
sources claiming that the company is
investing in a third facility to build
more galaxy s6 edge displays as
currently the company cannot meet the
man apparently this new facility will
allow the company to double its
production of the galaxy s6 edge to up
to 3 million units i believe it is which
is significant for the company's growth
and specifically in this edge design as
the Galaxy Note edge did not see this
amount of success it seems that people
are willing to pay for it now company
that continues to struggle in focus when
it comes to its smartphone lineup as
Sony the company is apparently working
on a new project with this new project
involves building extremely affordable
smartphones for India azines of that is
the company's new focus it seems that
this device will cost me do 125 and a
hundred sixty dollars a complete
departure to Sony's current strategy
which is the focus on the high end yeah
we know that the company acknowledged
that the low end makes more money than
the high end it's just interesting to
see that they're finally doing something
about it now there is one post on the
website that is up for much debate and
it is a comparison in sales for Android
wear and the Apple watch we've got a
couple of companies of credible sachar
claiming that Apple was able to sell
more Apple watch units in one day of
pre-orders than android wear was able to
sell in a full year just give you an
idea all Android wear devices combined
last year sold seven hundred and twenty
thousand units compared to the Apple
watch which sold one point
three million units on the day of
pre-orders alone and then that includes
almost every other person that said oh I
won't get the Apple watch because the
model that I want is not available until
June so yeah there was a lot more
opportunity there um yeah interesting
what do you think it was a comment down
below and finally for the very hot news
of the day apples quarter results are in
and now the company is not dying the
company sold 61 million units of the
iphone which is definitely down compared
to last quarter 74 million but then
again because of this particular quarter
when compared to last year yeah it grew
it grew 58 million in revenue which is
interesting and even the neckline of
grew apparently the company sold for
point 66 million max which is a ten
percent increase compared to the same
quarter last year the only product
that's on the client is the ipad 12.6
million units which is a twenty-three
percent decline to last year and yeah
apparently China is the second market
for apple now now Europe is third that
is another change which is really
interesting but it does lead me to the
question of the day why do you think
apple is not selling ipads lately i mean
yeah sure 12.6 million units is a crazy
amount of iPads but why do you think
tablets are on decline in my case i do
believe that it's because people have
found that tablets don't have as much
functionality as people need but leave
us a comment down below is your opinion

gonna get the news earlier before this
