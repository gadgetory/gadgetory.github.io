today we got something special they said
it couldn't be done but we're gonna
prove them wrong it's Android 2.2 Froyo
running on the g1 let's see how it's
done alright what we've got is a
t-mobile g1 very very well used got all
kinds of battle wounds and what I've
done here is I have booted up into the
raw recovery and this is version 1.6.2 I
know he's got a 1.7 out right now but
we're going to do this with 162 what
I've done is I've loaded up my sd card
with the RC one candidate of CyanogenMod
six-point 0.04 the g1 and I've also put
the frf 91 google apps package on here
as well so we can flash the google apps
back on there when we're done as well so
we're gonna go ahead and select the
signage in mod 6 we're going to hit the
HOME key to continue and there we go
it's installing at this point verifying
the package and it's going to go through
and flash this this is going to take a
couple minutes when we're done with this
we're going to flash the google apps and
then we're gonna boot up for the first
time into Froyo now you'll notice I
didn't say I was gonna wipe in there
that's because I found that going from a
five point zero point eight CyanogenMod
ROM which is on here right now up to a
six
it hasn't required me to wipe so far but
if you run into problems make sure you
wipe wiping is always a good thing so
let's go ahead and let that run off
camera and I'll be right back okay with
quite a bit of troubleshooting I went
ahead and got the ROM in place and turns
out my problem was with a bad SD card
more specifically with problems on the
SD card I was able to backup all the
data luckily and reformat a tree
partition it and go ahead and download
both the rom file and the google apps
kit wiped the phone because I did
already installed it from a bad or a
corrupt rom file because it was on that
bad SD card once I did that everything
just lit up and was working great now
the bad news is that meant that I spent
most of the night re downloading most of
my wife's apps this is my wife's phone
configuring everything and setting it
all up but you can see here this is the
HTC dream we are running Android 2.2 and
the kernel version is 2.6 point 34
CyanogenMod running CyanogenMod six
point zero point zero D S which is dream
and sapphire now rather than the Nexus
One and it is release candidate one with
Froyo build frf and 91 that's the latest
one to date so overall really great ROM
it is still a release candidate there
are still some issues but nothing more
than you'd expect in a normal
off-the-shelf ROM and it's definitely
better more stable and faster than the
stock one point six that the phone
originally came with or rather that this
phone originally came with so really
impressed with it you can see here I've
already loaded up the launcher Pro app
down at the bottom and I showed you
videos about that in the past
it comes with ADW launcher stock which
looks almost exactly like the launch or
two app which is the stock launcher app
for Froyo but launcher 2 is just too
slow for for this hardware now a couple
things to keep in mind in this version
JIT or JIT as Google calls it is turned
off now that's where you get a lot of
the speed you can go in and turn that
and turn that on
along with cop cache if you want to but
on some of the phones and I forget if
it's the 32 a or b they're just not
quite fast enough to be able to run the
JIT compiler so even with the 3d gallery
the phone is still a very responsive
it's very very nice given that this is
the latest version of Android and the
earliest Android phone that was
commercially available I'm very
impressed
it is still a release candidate which
means that there are still some bugs I
would highly recommend if you go this
route that you do a nandroid backup
first and then wipe everything before
you install your new ROM and the the
Google Apps you will need to have danger
SPL on it of course you don't want to
follow those instructions to the
I'm not going to go into those details
in this video those will be on the page
that I'm going to link you to to get the
two files that you need to install this
but if you want to breathe new life into
a really old phone and really make it
just about as full featured as a nexus
one there's no better way to go than
with CyanogenMod and fitting all of that
Froyo into the g1 framework well people
said it just couldn't be done and my
hats off to cyanogen and all of his team
members for proving them wrong so with
the first look at Froyo on the g1 I'm
