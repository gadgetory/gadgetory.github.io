to do when you get your live view is
charge it up using this microUSB port
down at the bottom now I've done that
just for a few minutes here so we might
not be able to run through everything I
want to in this demo but of course you
should do that for about six to eight
hours just to get a full charge on the
device the second thing that you need to
do is decide if you're going to wear it
as a clip you can see the little
spring-loaded clip here or if you aren't
going to wear it as a watch and what
I've done here from the last video is
I've gone ahead and put those a little
Wachee Springs in and that's the
technical term I looked it up on
Wikipedia and if you found it on
Wikipedia it must be true now I have
decided that I want to wear the watch in
this fashion which means the band goes
up that way and I put and tighten it
back around this way and that matters
because this this little frame here the
clip that the device is gonna go into
has a top and a bottom you can tell the
tell them apart because the bottom has a
little bit of an opening down here and
that's I assume to accommodate that
microUSB port if you can see that a
little bit better up here it's right
down in there you can see that little
teeny divot and up on the top is this
little grippy spring so next thing you
need to do is get the clip off and the
way that I found to do that is you open
up your micro USB door here and you
wedge your fingernail in there and just
kind of run it along that seam and it
just pops right off just like that so
now we can move that to the side close
our little door up here to make the next
step easier and in the process I've
turned on the device and what you do
next is just align it and snap it down
in place now it's a bit thick for a
watch but compare that to the other Sony
Ericsson watch that I've been wearing
and you can see it's just marginally
thicker if if that it looks a little bit
thicker but that's because the band
isn't all designed to make it look nice
like a watch
now this watch is also a Bluetooth watch
I've shown it to you in previous videos
and it connects up to my android phone
using open watch open watch is cool it's
not that open because it's not open
source but you know you can write
plugins and stuff weird and I've been
really happy with it but it's got this
analog display which I don't really like
if I want to look at the time in digital
I have to push that button twice and
there it shows me the time and the
battery and that it's connected to be a
Bluetooth so you know it does its job it
shows me email and incoming calls and
whatnot right down here on the bottom
but that's about it
this on the other hand is less a watch
and more a information display so let's
see how this is going to work together
and this should be fun because you know
live stuff always is now I've gone out
to the Android Market and I've
downloaded the live view application it
is a free app in the marketplace to
search for Live View and the first thing
it does wants me to connect my live view
or the watch to my phone so let's go
ahead and do that say ok and I'm going
to turn this on
here's our first boot and now this is
asking me to connect my device to the
live view so let's go ahead and manage
we're going to search for it and this
takes you over to the Bluetooth settings
so this is really a bluetooth device you
can see down here that I have a new
device at the bottom I'll see if it
comes up with a name rather than just a
MAC address and yes it says live view
right there so we will select that and
it says two pair of live you confirm
that it's showing the passkey is 0 5 2 7
7 5 0 yep that matches so we're going to
say pair and there's your watch display
and I think I just ran out of battery
life but now you can see how to to go
ahead and do the pairing with the device
which is kind of neat so let's go ahead
and throw this back on the charger see
if we can get some more juice and finish
up with the rest of the cool stuff that
this device can do now once it's paired
I have an option to search for another
live view device and it shows me the
live view devices that I have connected
the live view in this case has the MAC
address at the end and shows me there I
go I've got it all set up it's over on
the charger off camera right now so
let's just go through the software part
and see what we can do first thing is
I've set it to vibrate whenever I give
receive a notification which is the same
thing that that Sony Ericsson watch did
under notifications says the device
memory will be cleared and content on
the phone is not going to be affected
that's fine it's a new device so it goes
ahead and it resets all of the
notifications on the watch or on the
live view so that you're not gonna have
stale information over there which is
kind of good let's go in now to
customize tiles and this is really the
interface of the device with that you
can show text messages unfortunately I
don't believe that's going to include
Google Voice text messages you can
display incoming calls missed calls you
can hook it up with Facebook which I've
already done
I've already linked my Facebook friends
select Facebook activities in here
notifications and inbox is what I want I
don't want to pull in the newsfeed
because I have an awful lot of friends
on Facebook and no I'm not being any
kind of bragging about that most of the
people I don't know who they are
anyway back here we can send our update
frequency and I've set this to every
half an hour and that's basically
because I don't want this polling
Facebook and using up all that basically
all the battery life that it takes to go
out and pull every 15 minutes or or
whatnot and I might scale that back my
facebook app I have that set to about
every four hours every six hours I
forget which but every 30 minutes should
be good and then we can delete the
account if we want to which of course we
don't want to do next is Twitter and in
Twitter same thing link Twitter friends
which I've already done
update frequency I've set to every half
an hour
type of Facebook and then of course we
can delete the account moving right
along
RSS I can add an RSS feed so this is
where you can go in and you know
subscribe to the pocket now RSS feed and
get notified on your phone whenever you
well notify it on your watch rather
through your phone whenever PocketNow
posts a new article which is quite
frequently we're up to what 20 some-odd
plus a day so hey that's awesome news
coming at you from all directions
calendar this is one of the things I
really like your watch now displays
calendar information so if you've got an
upcoming appointment your watch will
remind you it's awesome it's great
manage plugins we'll come back to that
in just a minute and then focus
application the focus application I have
no idea what this is but I assume that
you can set the default view and we'll
we'll follow up in at the the article
that's gonna accompany this video if
that's not the case but I've set it to
all events for right now and then
plugins yes there are plugins available
for this and I've gone out and
downloaded a couple from the market
already I've downloaded a weather
plug-in which just like you would
imagine shows you the current weather so
that's very nice I've got that set up
and then Gmail as well so if I have an
incoming Gmail rather than just a
regular email it'll show me here I can
set the snippet length that's the amount
of characters in that email that's gonna
be sent to the device so right now I've
got that set into like seven hundred and
fifty and you can go up or down from
that so that's really cool you can
actually lead part of the email on the
phone or rather on the device without
having to go to the phone to get it lets
you select your gmail account if you've
got more than one you can go ahead and
do that and then select various labels
and whatnot then it shows you that this
is version one point three point two and
it is enabled so plug-in architecture
that's really cool there's even an open
watch plugin so you can use some of your
open watch plugins with this through the
open watch plugin I haven't gotten into
that too much and I might be wrong on on
how that exactly works but it's really
really cool
so coming back here I think we've
covered everything if we go to menu
has an open-source licenses so not
really a menu but a you know this is
open source type of stuff they're using
stuff from the open source which means
that this may be actually more open than
the open watch program it'll be
interesting to see what we do there but
once that's running it's running and
you're good to go you don't have to have
a status indicator up here anymore in
fact I'm going to go ahead and turn off
open watch and use this exclusively for
the next few days and I'll let you know
how that works out of course we're gonna
have a follow up right after this to
show you some of the the interactions of
the device itself so make sure you stay
tuned for that
after a full amount of charging here's
what we've got now remember the Y view
is first and foremost a watch or at
least that's my interpretation of it
unfortunately it doesn't do a very good
job as a watch because as you can see
here there's nothing on the screen
there's no day there's no date there's
no time so when when you want to see
what time it is you have to push this
button up here on the top and that
brings up the time the charge indicator
and the calendar date as well so if you
want to get to the tiles what you need
to do is push this button again and
that'll take you to the tiles now this
is a touch screen but not like you'd
expect you can't tap to take you into a
tile you do have this swipe gesture to
go across the screen but you can't for
some reason go back to the other way if
you see it's not going back it's
regardless of how I swipe it's going
forward so that's kind of dumb in my
opinion but if we come in here and look
there's our RSS feeds Find My Phone the
plugins let's go into plugins now this
is unfortunate you have a plugins box
and to get into it you have to push the
button again and that takes you into
plugins you can see I've got two plugins
Gmail and whether I want to go into that
I have to push up there again not just
tap on the screen and it'll go out
communicate with the phone and get the
current weather with kind of really bad
graphics I was expecting quite a bit
better graphics but that's probably
because the plug-in and the the plug-in
rather than the watch let's put it that
way
the text isn't as sharp as I'd like it
to
be and as far as I know there's no way
to get back so yeah in trying to go back
up to the top and this is not letting me
do it so I've got to let it timeout
before I can go back to something I hope
that's a drawback to the plug-in
architecture and I really don't like
that plug-in folder what I'd like to see
is those plug-in tiles be in line with
the watch it's not so you just kind of
have to live with it so since I can't
show you anything else here for a minute
I'm gonna go ahead and turn the camera
off and we'll come back when we can do
something else with it
and you remember what I said about this
device failing as a watch well what you
saw right there was a bunch of zeros and
dashes on the screen to get back I
actually powered off the device then
when I did that I severed the Bluetooth
connection between that and the phone
which is right over here
and then the time went out to zeros
which I mean come on keep track of the
time
if I'm out of range of my phone I still
want to be able to know what time it is
if my phone is turned off or out of
battery power I still want to know what
time it is
and please don't turn the screen off
it's just crazy but anyway let's get
back so calendar we'll go ahead and look
at calendar really quick I don't have
any calendar event so we can't do that
and now of course we're stuck at a tile
and yeah do you guys want me to continue
I mean if you want an in-depth look at
the UI of this device I'm happy to do it
it's just gonna take me a long time to
do because it's just it's not intuitive
it doesn't do what you would think and
you can see here even with the phone and
arm's reach away the device disconnected
I don't know why it just does that
bluetooth should go quite a bit further
than you know 10 12 inches and here you
can see my swiping problem and now it's
sort of thing the other way but not the
right way anyway just kind of crazy I
don't have any Facebook alerts I have a
couple events so let's look at that
here's a gmail I'd like to be able to
read more of this but you can see here
it's not reactive to any swiping at all
but push the button it takes me back
that's the behavior supposed to have so
all in all cool geek toy it fails as a
watch it's halfway decent as a geek toy
it's not as cool and as revolutionary as
we thought it was going to be but you
know it's still something neat
unfortunately it's not quite as good as
its predecessor made by the same company
so I'm probably gonna go back to my
Bluetooth watch to date rather than my
live if you watch but anyway let us know
what you think especially if you get a
live view are these experiences the same
as what you're getting are they out of
the ordinary let us know in the comments
