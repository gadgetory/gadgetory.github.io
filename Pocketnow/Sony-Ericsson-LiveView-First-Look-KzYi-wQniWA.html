to do when you get your live view is
charged it up using this micro USB port
down at the bottom now I've done that
just for a few minutes here so we might
not be able to run through everything I
want to in this demo but of course you
should do that for about six to eight
hours just to get a full charge on the
device the second thing that you need to
do is decide if you're going to wear it
as a clip you can see the little
spring-loaded clip here or if you are
going to wear it as a watch and what
I've done here from the last video is
I've gone ahead and put those little
wachee springs in and that's the
technical term I looked it up on
Wikipedia and if you found it on
Wikipedia it must be true now I have
decided that I want to wear the watch in
this fashion which means the band goes
up that way and I put and tighten it
back around this way and that matters
because this this little frame here the
clip that the device is going to go into
has a top and a bottom you can tell the
tell them apart because the bottom has a
little bit of an opening down here and
that's I assume to accommodate that
micro USB port if you can see that a
little bit better up here it's right
down in there you can see that little
teeny divot and up on the top is this
little grippy spring so next thing you
need to do is get the clip off and the
way that I found to do that is you open
up your micro USB door here and you
wedge your fingernail in there and just
kind of run it along that seam and it
just pops right off just like that so
now we can move that to the side close
our little door up here to make the next
step easier and in the process I've
turned on the device and what you do
next is just align it and snap it down
in place now it's a bit thick for a
watch but compare that to the other sony
ericsson watch that i've been wearing
and you can see it's just marginally
thicker if if that it looks a little bit
thicker but that's because the band
isn't all designed to make it look nice
like a watch now this watch is also a
Bluetooth watch I've shown it to you in
previous videos and it connects up to my
android phone using open watch open
watch is cool it's not that open because
it's not open source but you know you
can write plugins and stuff worked I've
been really happy with it but it's got
this analog display which I don't really
like if I want to look at the time in
digital I have to push that button twice
and there it shows me the time and the
battery and that it's connected via
bluetooth so you know it does its job it
shows me email and incoming calls and
whatnot right down here on the bottom
but that's about it this on the other
hand is less a watch and more
information display so let's see how
this is going to work together and this
should be fun because you know live
stuff always is now I've gone out to the
android market and I've downloaded the
live view application it is a free app
in the market place to search for live
view and the first thing it does wants
me to connect my live view or the watch
to my phone so let's go ahead and do
that say ok and I'm going to turn this
on here's our first boot and now this is
asking me to connect my device to the
live view so let's go ahead and manage
we're going to search for it and this
takes you over to the Bluetooth settings
so this is really a Bluetooth device you
can see down here that i have a new
device the bottom i'll see if it comes
up with a name rather than just a mac
address and yes it says live view right
there so we will select that and it says
to pair with live you confirm that it's
showing the passkey is 0 5 to 7 750 but
that matches so we're going to say pair
and there's your watch display
and I think I just ran out of battery
life but now you can see how to to go
ahead and do the pairing with the device
which is kind of neat so let's go ahead
and throw this back on the charger see
if we can get some more juice and finish
up with the rest of the cool stuff that
this device can do now once it's paired
I have an option to search for another
live view device and it shows me the
live view devices that i have connected
the live view in this case has the mac
address at the end and shows me there I
go I've got it all set up it's over on
the charger off camera right now so
let's just go through the software part
and see what we can do first thing is
I've set it to vibrate whenever I you
receive a notification which is the same
thing that that sony ericsson watch did
under notifications says the device
memory will be cleared and content on
the phone is not going to be affected
that's fine it's a new device so it goes
ahead and it resets all of the
notifications on the watch though or on
the live view so that you're not going
to have stale information over there
which is kind of good let's go in now to
customize tiles and this is really the
interface of the device with that you
can show text messages unfortunately I
don't believe that's going to include
google voice text messages you can
display incoming calls missed calls you
can hook it up with facebook which I've
already done I've already linked my
facebook friends select facebook
activities in here notifications and
inbox is what I want I don't want to
pull in the news feed because I have an
awful lot of friends on Facebook and no
I'm not being any kind of bragging about
that most of the people i don't know who
they are anyway back here we can set our
update frequency and I've set this to
every half an hour and that's basically
because I don't want this polling
facebook and using up all that basically
all the battery life that it takes to go
out and pull every 15 minutes or or
whatnot and I might scale that back my
facebook app I have that set to about
every four hours every six hours I
forget which but every 30 minutes should
be good and then we can delete the
account if we want to which of course we
don't want to do next is Twitter and in
Twitter same thing link Twitter friends
which I've already done update frequency
I've set to every half an hour just like
a facebook
and then of course we can delete the
account moving right along RSS i can add
an RSS feed so this is where you can go
in and you know subscribe to the pocket
now RSS feed and get notified on your
phone whenever you notified on your
watch rather through your phone whenever
pocket now posts a new article which is
quite frequently we're up to what 20
some-odd plus a day so hey that's
awesome news coming at you from all
directions calendar this is one of the
things i really like your watch now
displays calendar information so if
you've got an upcoming appointment your
watch will remind you it's awesome it's
great manage plugins we'll come back to
that in just a minute and then focus
application the focus application i have
no idea what this is but i assume that
you can set the default view and we'll
we'll follow up in at the the article
that's going to accompany this video if
that's not the case but I've set it to
all events for right now and then
plugins yes there are plugins available
for this and I've gone out and
downloaded a couple from the market
already I've downloaded a weather plugin
which just like you would imagine shows
you the current weather so that's very
nice I've got that set up and then gmail
as well so if I have an incoming gmail
rather than just a regular email it'll
show me here I can set the snippet
length that's the amount of characters
in that email it's going to be sent to
the device so right now I've got that
set into like 750 and you can go up or
down from that so that's really cool you
can actually read part of the email on
the phone or rather on the device
without having to go to the phone to get
it lets you select your gmail account if
you've got more than one you can go
ahead and do that and then select
various labels and whatnot and then it
shows you that this is version 1.3
point2 and it is enabled so plug-in
architecture that's really cool there's
even an open watch plug-in so you can
use some of your open watch plugins with
this through the open watch plugin i
haven't gotten into that too much and i
might be wrong on on how that exactly
works but it's really really cool so
coming back here I think we've covered
everything if we go to menu
has an open-source licenses so not
really a menu but a you know this is
open source type of stuff they're using
stuff from the open source which means
that this may be actually more open than
the open watch program it'll be
interesting to see what we do there but
once that's running its running and
you're good to go you don't have to have
a status indicator up here anymore in
fact I'm going to go ahead and turn off
open watch and use this exclusively for
the next few days and I'll let you know
how that works out of course we're going
to have a follow up right after this to
show you some of the the interactions of
the device itself so make sure you stay
tuned for that after a full amount of
charging here's what we've got now
remember the live view is first and
foremost a watch or at least that's my
interpretation of it unfortunately it
doesn't do a very good job as a watch
because as you can see here there's
nothing on the screen there's no day
there's no date there's no time so when
when you want to see what time it is you
have to push this button up here on the
top and that brings up the time the
charge indicator and the calendar data
as well so if you want to get to the
tiles what you need to do is push this
button again and that will take you to
the tiles now this is a touch screen but
not like you'd expect you can't tap to
take you into a tile you do have this
swipe gesture to go across the screen
but you can't for some reason go back
the other way if you see it's not going
back it's regardless of how I swipe it's
going forward so that's kind of dumb in
my opinion but if we come in here and
look there's our RSS feeds find my phone
plugins let's go into plugins now this
is unfortunate you have a plugins box
and to get into it you have to push the
button again and that takes you into
plugins you can see I've got two plugins
gmail and whether I want to go into that
I have to push up there again not just
tap on the screen and it'll go out
communicate with the phone and get the
current weather with kind of really bad
graphics I was expecting quite a bit
better graphics but that's probably
because the plug-in and the the plug-in
rather than the watch let's put it that
way the text isn't is sharp as I'd like
it to be and
as far as I know there's no way to get
back see I ain't trying to go back up to
the top and this is not letting me do it
so I've got to let it time out before I
can go back to something I hope that's a
drawback to the plug-in architecture and
I really don't like that plug-in folder
what I'd like to see is those plug-in
tiles be in line with the watch it's not
so you just kind of have to live with it
so since I can't show you anything else
here for a minute I'm going to go ahead
and turn the camera off and we'll come
back when we can do something else with
it you remember what I said about this
device failing as a watch well what you
saw right there was a bunch of zeros and
dashes on the screen to get back I
actually powered off the device then
when i did that i severed the bluetooth
connection between that and the phone
which is right over here and then the
time went out to zeros which I mean come
on keep track of the time if I'm out of
range of my phone I still want to be
able to know what time it is if my phone
is turned off or out of battery power I
still want to know what time it is and
please don't turn the screen off it's
just crazy but anyway let's get back so
calendar will go ahead and look at
calendar really quick I don't have any
calendar event so we can't do that and
now of course we're stuck at a tile and
yeah do you guys want me to continue I
mean if you want an in-depth look at the
UI of this device I'm happy to do it
it's just going to take me a long time
to do because it's just it's not
intuitive it doesn't do what you would
think and you can see here even with the
phone and arms reach away the device
disconnected I don't know why it just
does that bluetooth should go quite a
bit further than you know 10 12 inches
and here you can see my swiping problem
now it's laughing the other way but not
the right way anyway just kind of crazy
I don't have any Facebook alerts I have
a couple events so let's look at that
here's a gmail I'd like to be able to
read more of this but you can see here
it's not reactive to any swiping at all
by push the button it takes me back
that's the behavior supposed to have so
all in all cool geek toy it fails as a
watch it's halfway decent as a geek toy
it's not as cool and as revolutionary as
we thought it was going to be but you
know it's still something neat
unfortunately it's not quite as good as
its predecessor made by the same company
so I'm probably going to go back to my
bluetooth watch to date rather than my
live if you watch but anyway let us know
what you think especially if you get a
live view are these experiences the same
as what you're getting are they out of
the ordinary let us know in the comments
