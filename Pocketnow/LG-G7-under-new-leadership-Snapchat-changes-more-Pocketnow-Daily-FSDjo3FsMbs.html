leadership as there is a recent
corporate change the Apple watch finally
gets an fda-approved band with an EKG
and snapchat gets a major overhaul
because I guess it's really a need I'm
high metal II that and one thing that
was really in need was for me to bring
all the studio equipment to my apartment
given everything that's going on and on
dudas I'm really sorry about yesterday
it's just really bad let's go through
the news this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with some
interesting deals from Cricket Wireless
as the company is offering four lines
for $100 yeah four lines for $100 but if
you're asking what the catch is follow
the link in the description one of the
things is for example that you won't get
full data speeds so again if you're
interested the deal is great for prepaid
you can learn more in the description
now one of the things that we're still
waiting for is the Google home max and
it seems that Best Buy is already
listing it for December 11th for those
of you that don't remember this is the
speaker that's going to compete with the
home pod and actually launched before
the home pod so let's see just how great
it is now about snapchat as the company
is planning some major changes to its
user interface and it's very needed
first of all it's going to separate
social for media to your left you will
find your contacts and your friends to
your right you will find everybody you
want to follow you can follow me though
I'm not really that much on snapchat but
yeah these changes are coming let's see
what else they're gonna change probably
some new spectacles that actually look
good and for those of you that didn't
know the Apple watch ever since its
inception wanted to become a fitness and
health product obviously the problem was
the reliability of the sensors up to the
point where it's not until now that
there is an FDA approved ban it's called
the cardia ban that costs $200 and then
you pay $99 for the service every year
and what you're getting us a full-blown
EKG and there are people out there that
actually need this for those of you that
feel that this is pricey I do agree but
then the links bracelet from Apple the
one that I'm wearing but the original
one that ones 500 bucks so this one
actually has functionality for that
money and finally the very interesting
news today have to do with LG as the
company has made a significant change in
its mobile division we've got a new
president of mobile we've got new
leadership as well the interesting part
is that we don't really have much of a
resume from the people that are coming
in all we see at this that the president
has a lot of experience in R&amp;amp;D which is
great I mean LG has done an amazing job
even though their smartphones are very
underrated and I feel they're very
underrated not because of the quality of
the products but because of the quality
of their marketing so hopefully this
this change but it leads me to the
question today what would you like to
see in devices like the LG G 7 that
we're expecting to launch at CES 2018 in
my case I don't mind that keeping the
design if they go oled with a better
OLED and also bring the camera
functionality able to be 30 that's just
me leave us a comment down below we'd
