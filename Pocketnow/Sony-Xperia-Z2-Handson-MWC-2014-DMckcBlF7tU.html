Hannah behind the camera we're in
Barcelona at the sony booth and we are
checking out the Sony Xperia z2 aka the
serious as the league's have been
mentioning it let's take a look so at a
quick glance you might think that this
is the Xperia z1 or the Xperia z1s but
you might see the smaller bezels on the
sides that's why that's because the Sony
Xperia z2 here has a 5.2 inch display in
comparison with a 5-inch display on its
predecessor the z1 resolution is still
the same we're talking about full HD
1920 x 1080 and it is still the same
sandwich glass construction so we're
having a glass front glass back panel
sandwich between a mold of aluminum and
plastic now if you guys remember the z1
had aluminum casing the z1s had a
specific plastic casing for tmobile and
the z2 is using a special aluminium and
plastic combination this phone is also
rated ip55 and 58 for water and dust
proofing so you can submerge it to 1.5
meters of fresh water still no salt
water compatibility behind the glass we
have the brand new Snapdragon 801
processor which is blocking a two point
three gigahertz this is a force the quad
core version 3 gigabytes of ram 60
gigabytes of internal storage and we'll
split to the side so that we can see the
microSD expansion right here under this
flap which should always be closed if
you want to keep your phone from getting
flooded typical power button volume
rockers and the dedicated camera shutter
release focus gate flipping it to the
back you'll see the same 20.7 megapixel
camera with G lens we're being told that
the camera is the same rating in terms
of metal pixels but it's got a bigger
sensor compared to the z1 in order for
you to take better pictures well stood
on the back same call outs for NFC sony
logo and the xperia branding
and turning it to the front we'll take a
close look at the software but before we
do you'll see the LED notification right
here on top which glows in green when
you're charging and probably it will
glow in different colors when you get
notifications to point 2 megapixel
webcam on the front and we forgot to
mention there's a 3200 milliamp hour
battery let's talk about software let's
go into settings first and see what
exactly is running on this go to the
about phone and this is Android 42 42 so
it's the latest version of Android
powering it of course we'll see Sony's
proprietary UI on top of it with which
you gettin used by now from busy ones
you wanna see one compact it is snappy
you can add the home screen so nothing
fancy on this end of the world going to
the app drawer you still have the same
typical scrolling between the apps and
once you scroll we have your other
options let's jump real quick into the
camera application see what's changed
it's the same fluid frame rate I'm not
sure if you can see this but this is
very very very fluid of course the modes
are approximately the same this is
intelligent auto mode or superior auto
in which the camera software chooses
exactly what the settings should be for
those specific lighting conditions then
you can flip the manual in which case
you have many settings in addition you
can go as high as 20 points under
megapixels 15.5 meta pixels is something
new which wasn't under z1 then go to the
typical 8 and as low as 2 megapixels
flash for automatic and other settings
white balance and you can manually
select the senior so this is just a
quick quick look we're hoping to get
this phone in our labs really really
really soon until then I've been Anton
