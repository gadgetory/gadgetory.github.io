go on a slower refresh cycle Samsung
seems to be already geared up for its
next batch of Fitness wearables and the
one plus three might now throw an extra
leg on the spec race I'm hi Mary Venna
and for those of you that are asking why
I'm wearing sunglasses I developed the
love least I on my ryan eyes just bear
with me this is parking out daily
the news today begin with the rumors of
the gear fed to we hear specifications
of the 512 megabytes of ram 2 gigs of
storage and apparently all the bells and
whistles of a typical fitness tracker
and we also hear probable dates
apparently there will be an event
happening in New York City on jun 2nd so
stay tuned we cannot wait to tell you
what happens with this new wearable and
speaking of wearables a Qualcomm has
wanted to get into the race for wearable
processors for a while the scent of
Dragon 400 is definitely dated and we
now hear that the company is announcing
the new Snapdragon 1100 Snapdragon where
1,100 the whole idea here is that this
is a smaller processor the whole idea is
to fit better into just fitness trackers
or smart watches that are focused on
kids let's just wait for the other
processors to actually be launched in
products we've been waiting for that for
a while and for those of you that are
wondering which is the US carrier that
has sold the most smartphones lately
believe it or not it is no longer
Verizon and it wasn't AT&amp;amp;T either it was
tmobile t-mobile's market share for q1
was twenty two point nine percent of the
market share compared to 22 from verizon
twenty percent for AT&amp;amp;T and then sixty
percent for sprint so for those of you
that are complaining about all the
tactics that sore brought to the market
by john ledger the guy does sell it does
work it just tells us that there is a
lot of change required by other carriers
not necessarily just in spectrum but
also in focus now this is rather
interesting we saw the reason
certification of the one plus three on
Tina but the documents also reveal that
there is not just one variant apparently
there is also another variant with the
larger specifications we're talking
about sixty good bytes of RAM just like
we saw on the ZTE axon seven so things
are gearing up rather interesting we
wonder if that 1080p is also going to
make it to that phone as well and
finally the very interesting rumors
today have to do with analyst claiming
that the iphone 7 will not be about a
dramatic change in specifications or
design according to these recent analyst
predictions it seems that the iphone
cycle is going to change into three
and this is rather interesting Apple has
kept the two-year cycle for the longest
time but we have heard rumors that the
2017 iphone is the one that's bringing
viola display and the new tactic engine
and just about everything so it leads me
to the question of the day do you think
that apple would make a smart move and
changing into the three year cycle or do
you think the two years should be the
way to go in my case I think one year
should be the way to go but leave us a
comment down below we would love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
