happening to huawei it seems that the
huawei mate X is still on track for a
launch now it seems serious about the
drone idea we finally actually have a
design for product and we get more
information on what to expect for the
differences of the Galaxy Note 10 and
the Galaxy Note 10 throw I'm Jaime
mettle be better here in Chicago
actually to try out real 5g like the
real deal
this is bogging out daily brought to you
by the one plus seven probe the official
dish today begin with deals of you are
in the market for an Apple watch
I love Amazon guys I mean their deals
are just crazy for Apple products which
is something that's not easy to find
right now Apple watch series for $50 off
but the pending on the variant you can
actually find it up to $70 off and yes
series four is the one I do recommend
obviously if you can make the jump for
the stainless steel variant that's gonna
be more durable and don't forget to get
AppleCare with this it's only 60 bucks
and it's kind of worth it given all the
wear and tear that you're gonna give a
watch you can learn more in the
description and since we're talking
about Amazon how about if we've
discussed the fact that their drone
technology and their whole ideas were
actually not fake the company has pretty
much just showed us a design that's
actually a blend between a helicopter
meaning a drone that's a quadcopter and
you know the whole concept of the fact
that it has our dynamics like a plane so
it actually can deliver packages I
believe between 10 and 15 pounds and
could fly for 30 minutes or so I mean
the design and the whole idea looks very
promising obviously this means that not
every package will be delivered through
drones which is great I can't imagine
with all the packages that are delivered
in my neighborhood alone I can't imagine
the amount of drones that would have to
be flying all around so I don't know I'm
kind of skeptical we would love to do
what you think about that in the
comments so listen to this I mean seven
years is what it took for a gang of
thieves to be caught as they have still
in pretty much 19 million dollars worth
of iPhones this is a big story right now
this is a gang based in New York City
they would make small down payments on
cloned card
and be able to go all around the country
and get iPhones and iPhones and they
would send different people to be able
to get them and they have finally been
caught 19 million dollars worth of
iPhones across seven years not exactly
sure how that's going to pan out over
time I do know that each of them is
facing a fine for $100,000 which is
crazy considering the fact that it was
19 million wide just a hundred thousand
you know using clone cards and
everything that alone is even worse
thing about it is they're all pleading
not guilty
obviously Bates everybody's right we'll
see how that story ends up now for those
of you wondering what the future of the
huawei mate X is which I am the first
person interested in knowing it seems
that the product is gearing up for a
launch I mean Huawei recently is out of
it they have up to 90 million phones
already connected to emui nine and now
they ran some 5g tests they got one
gigabit per second down on this mate X a
hundred megabits up on there 5g
connection in China so it's going to
happen it apparently will happens in
signing with in June but we're not
exactly sure what markets that's going
to launch I you know I'm not gonna lie
that I really wanted that made X I still
do so I'm hoping that if we do get a
shot at having some time with it we'll
keep you posted and finally the hottest
news today I have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 10 and its differences with
the note pro we've been covering this
and we've seen polarizing rumors and now
we see that for example the similarities
will be that infinity Oh punch OH which
is sad because I actually wanted to have
a dual camera with a wide-angle ultra
wide meaning and it seems that
similarities will also be store in
specifications but apparently there will
be some substantial differences there
were rumors that these models would not
bring buttons that it would be
capacitive buttons apparently of one
will bring buttons the regular area the
other one the pro will bring the
capacitive buttons it seems that both
are ditching the headphone jack which is
really concerning even more interesting
is that for those of you that were
wondering about the whole cameras
apparently only the note Pro is going to
have
quad camera system that includes the
time-of-flight sensor then we have
Tribble cameras on the note 10 and
obviously differences in screen sizes
and battery it seems that the note 10
the regular is gonna be actually smaller
than the note 9 which is interesting let
us know in the comments down below what
would you prefer if you had to pick
would you go for a larger note 10 pro
with everything even if you're losing
buttons and stuff or would you prefer a
smaller galaxy note because I'm not
gonna lie I'm really enticed for the
smaller galaxy note I think that that
would be a really good hit that's my
opinion let us know what you think in
the comments down below and folks this
episode of the park and daily is brought
to you by the one plus seven pro this
phone has proven to be a true game
changer thanks to its natural is fluid
mo LED display at ninety Hertz it's new
triple camera system and it's fluid

very affordable price follow the link at
