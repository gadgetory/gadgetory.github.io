exchanges are already on their way spec
details of the Google pixel smartphone
spell some sort of water resistance and
boy howdy do we feel ripped off by the
cost of certain smartphones I'm hi Mary
Vera I actually went to my first ever
professional baseball game and the Mets
lost but anyways this is parking out
daily brought to you by Autodesk graphic
the official news today begin with some
new software that's available for those
of you that been living under a tree and
don't know what Google aloe is it's
pretty much the company's new messaging
service it tries to compete with
snapchat I message just about everything
you can think of as Google usually does
with the services and even though we
still haven't really confirmed just how
great it'll be because obviously it
requires massive deployment so far our
hands-on experience has been okay we'll
keep you posted as we learn more and
speaking of Google the company is
apparently up to some controversy as
we've seen some new betas for the
company's new google application for
android and it seems that google now is
no longer going to be called google now
it's just going to be called the feed
and then other services obviously also
get renamed like for example Google now
on tap is apparently just going to be
called screen search and you know these
new names actually make a lot more sense
than Google now I wish google would
figure out something different but stay
tuned and yes believe it or not we are
going to continue talking about Google
as we learn about some leaked
specifications of the Google pixel
smartphones and even though ingress
protection is pretty much the standard
for black ships this year well it seems
that's not going to be the case
necessarily for the Google pixel
smartphones remember these are being
built by HTC apparently these will share
the same IP 53 water and dust resistance
meaning you can splash the phone but not
really get it wet all right we'll see
and for those of you that are wondering
exactly why you pay so much for
smartphones we asked ourselves the same
question every time we get statistics
over how much it costs to actually build
them for those of you wondering with the
iphone 7 Kos apparently it only costs
200
twenty-five dollars to build and then
the case of the galaxy s7 which is
actually an older device that one cost
255 so for those of you that think that
apple is giving you the most premium
hardware that's pretty probably the case
should i say though let's just remember
that the specifications and the
processor a lot of the things are
actually a little more advanced on the
case of galaxies side so that makes you
wonder exactly why these company spends
so much in crazy marketing just to
justify the seven hundred dollar price
tag and finally a very hot news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note
seven great news for those of you that
are wanting to exchange for another note
7 you can actually do so starting today
in the United States and if you're just
interested in buying another note 7 or 1
notes of it for that matter then
carriers like Verizon and Sprint are
already selling the phone as new which
is great news obviously it will take
some time some phones are actually
getting a software update just to know
if they're getting the green battery
indicator just to confirm if that phone
is safe or not but hey it leads me to
the question of the day are you going to
buy a galaxy note 7 after this whole
fiasco are you just considering any
other smartphone in my case I'm
currently testing the iphone 7 plus but
you can bet i'm going to go swap by no 7
