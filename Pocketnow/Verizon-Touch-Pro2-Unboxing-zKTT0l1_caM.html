pakka calm and this is the unboxing
video of the horizon touch pro2 so let's
get started so just a pretty simple box
of course we have the device on there
and let's see what's on the back okay so
we have the keyboard that's nice and
then just proof of purchase information
and just some information over here and
let's see and then it just states what
is actually inside of the box so open up
the box right now and here's the device
will set that to side for just a minute
okay so open up this let's see oh wow so
that's interesting it actually comes
with the adapters for European and Asian
and of course worldwide plugs so that's
a great thing to have actually is a
device like this the the sprint version
did not have this although it does have
the same LLC and stay in the USB charger
open up this versus a second the same
charger that you can actually just pop
it off and then put in another adapter
so if i wanted to i think put in this
adapter here believe this is for asia
i'm not too sure let's see here clicks
right in so that's nice it's great to
have that feature with that adapter at
least okay so we'll just move on and see
here we have a USB to proprietary HTC
jack so that's good of course it's a
mini USB jack there and we have an extra
stylus so that's great in case you lose
yours let's see here on the battery open
up the battery
and it is a 1500 milliamp battery so if
you can see on there okay so I'm just
going to move some of this stuff to the
side let's see what else do we have more
paper wonderful okay so we have some
documentation open up this see what's in
here we have a piece of paper we have
our CD or verizon getting started CD and
then our vzaccess manager which allows
you to connect your device to your
computer to use over to let's say you
wanted to tether your device to your
computer you can do that with that
software let's see what's in the box
warranty information driving
responsibility great let's see here
looks like a manual actually full-color
manual that's cool although how often do
you actually use it if you're watching
this video most likely you won't even
need the manual because you're probably
pretty smart tips hints and shortcuts so
this gives a little bit of information a
little bit helpful information about
your device so as you can see it has
cdma and gsm so that's great we're just
set that off to the side and we have a
global support guide so that also gives
you some numbers if you're outside the
United States as you can see here some
prefixes for other countries so that's
kind of me if you are traveling outside
the United States so let's look at the
device open it up here
very nice looks pretty similar to the
other HTC touch pro tues let's look on
the back oh it has this cool little
world you can see it actually the globe
etched into the back open up the device
very nice tilting keyboard of course
nice keyboard grade and of course our
verizon gsm chip when you're traveling
outside the united states and that is a
vodafone chip as well a sim card see
here sell vodafone great so just a few
things that are lacking from the box we
do not have a screen protector so unless
you're super careful you may want to
purchase one of those it also does not
come with stereo headphones so even
though this device does have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it doesn't
come with any headphones or a headset it
also does not come with a case and be
sure to stay tuned for the hardware and
software tours coming up next thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
