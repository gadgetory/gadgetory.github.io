out to select Nexus devices I'm Joe Levi
for pocketnow.com and will go hands-on
with the Nexus 7 and the latest version
of Android right now this is my Wi-Fi
connected Nexus 7 and as you can see
here everything looks pretty much the
same as it always has the difference is
this is running Android version 4.2.2
which is build number JD q39 another
item to note while we're on this screen
it's still running kernel version 3.1 so
not a lot of changes there so speaking
of changes what changes are in here well
first and foremost all we know we don't
have an official changelog yet is the
update said that includes performance
improvements and stability improvements
so as far as performance goes benchmark
scores were about the same maybe a
little bit slower than they were with
the original version of Android that
came on the Nexus 7 which was 4.1 it's
about on par for 4.2.1 but not an awful
lot of changes here as far as stability
goes some people especially on their
Nexus 7 we're reporting problems with
random reboots we've only run this for a
couple hours but so far haven't noticed
any lags or any hang-ups or any random
reboots or anything weird so perhaps
that was taken care of another thing
that was potentially updated although we
don't have official documentation to
this this Bluetooth there is a known bug
with Android version 4.2.1 with
bluetooth streaming if you want to
stream your audio over Bluetooth a 2 DP
and you change radios basically 3G to 4G
or whatnot or down to edge it'll screw
up your Bluetooth playback I mean just
it's awful that hiccups it's crappy and
it's well known and if you use that you
hate it and you know exactly what I'm
talking about if you don't know if if
you don't use that you don't know about
it and it's not a problem but some
people are reporting improvements in the
Bluetooth stack in 4.2.2
but the problem may not be solved
because they're still seeing those
hiccups
especially when changing radios
everything I've shown you here has been
on my Nexus 7 and it's the Wi-Fi version
Wi-Fi seems to be getting the updates
before the GSM versions of the Nexus 7
just FYI
the other devices that are getting in
the Nexus 10 we've seen reports that the
Nexus 10 is also getting the update if
you want to check and see if you are in
queue you simply go in here to settings
about tablet system updates and check
now if that says you're up-to-date it
means that your particular batch or your
particular country is up to date and the
new update hasn't been released for your
particular device or in your particular
location so just be patient unless you
don't want to and then I've got a trick
for you if you have a Galaxy Nexus the
GSM version specifically the Google
version you can also get this update if
you've got the Samsung version who knows
when
but you can convert your Samsung Galaxy
Nexus over to a Google Galaxy Nexus by
just converting from hyuk-joo to talk to
and and and you can get update straight
from google it does require a wife of
the device though so just be aware of
that mm kind of conspicuously absent is
the Nexus 4 we don't know why but the
Nexus 4 hasn't gotten this update just
yet at least not as of this filming if
you have a nexus 4 and you've gotten the
update let us know in the comments we
want to know that'll be awesome
we haven't seen anything else but one
last thing to show you is if you take a
look this is the Chrome browser and this
is one of the biggest complaints that
people had when going from the Android
version that came with the Nexus 7 up to
4.2.1 so it came with 4.1 we upgraded a
4.2.1 and all of a sudden the Chrome
browser got super laggy and it was just
a terrible experience and it made some
people go to other other browsers as you
can see here were resuming we're
scrolling and it's it's doing pretty
well I haven't noticed much of that lag
even when changing to other tabs and
whatnot
inside the Chrome browser it still has
its areas where it's a little bit slower
than the stock browser browser that
you're familiar with from other versions
of Android but all in all it's an
improvement tell me what you think if
you've seen different
in your browser and on your device in
the comments over at pocketnow.com if
you liked what you saw give it a thumbs
up and if you want that tip or trick on
how you can get this right now we've got
instructions and source files for you to
sideload Android 4.2.2 on your Nexus 7
Galaxy Nexus or Nexus 10 over on the
article at pocketnow.com there's a link
right down in the bottom for you to get
all of those so head over and do that
right now no root no voiding of
warranties required for pocket now
showing off Android 4.2.2 I'm Joe Levi
