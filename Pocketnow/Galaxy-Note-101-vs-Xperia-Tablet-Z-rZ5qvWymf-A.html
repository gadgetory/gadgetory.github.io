Android tablets but which one is better
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014
edition versus a sony xperia tablet z
what happens when two smartphone
manufacturers with two distinctly
different design languages tried their
hand at the most high-end tablet
possible two very different tablets are
made the question remains which is the
better tablet this time we're taking a
look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
2014 edition and Sony Xperia tablet Z
let's find out which is the better buy
from their internals to their outer
shells the materials used to compose
their chassis to the resistance to the
elements these two tablets truly have
very few likenesses the Xperia tablet Z
like its smaller relatives the Xperia Z
Z 1m z ultra pairs hard edges sharp
corners and an expansive flat back the
inset metallic trim lines all four edges
and is protected by a grippy matte
finished plastic everything about its
build quality feels superb and premium
the Note 10.1 while it certainly feels
higher quality than its Galaxy Tab and
Galaxy Note tablet brethren is not as
premium the faux leather backing is nice
but doesn't scream quality like other
like priced tablets it's plastic chrome
trim is lined as to resemble the pages
of a closed notebook however Samsung has
managed to pack more into a smaller
package the tablet Z is anything but
modest in size at 266 millimeters wide
it's markedly wider than the new Note
10.1 by 22 point nine centimeters only
0.6 millimeters separate them in height
yet the tablet Z is incredibly thin 6.9
millimeters the Note 10.1 is a full
millimeter thicker smaller it may be but
lighter it is not the Note 10.1 measures
540 grams while the tablet Z is 45 grams
lighter external differences are only
the beginning of the contrast between
these two tablets in February when the
Xperia tablet Z was announced its
internals were acceptable it's powered
by the Snapdragon s4 pro a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Krait CPU and Adreno 320 GPU
it has 2 gigabytes of RAM 16 or 32
gigabytes of fixed storage for the micro
SD card slot and 8.1 megapixel primary
camera and a 22 watt hour six thousand
milliamp hour battery the Galaxy Note
10.1 2014 edition is less reserved
filled with some of the markets most
recent and impressive specifications
it's powered by Samsung's in-house
Exynos octa-core 2 quad-core CPUs one
clocked at 1.9 gigahertz and the other
at 1.3 it has three gigabytes of RAM 16
32 or 64 gigabytes of fixed storage for
the microSD card slot 8 megapixel camera
and a 31 watt hour battery at 80 to 20
milliamp hours the tablet seat comes
with NFC the Note 10.1 does not but it
does have Wi-Fi AC whereas the tablet C
does not and both come with IR blasters
along their top edges and the displays
the Note 10.1 Super Clear LCD has a
higher resolution 2560 by 1600 pixels
and therefore a higher density of 299
PPI the tablet sees 10.1 inch reality
display has a resolution of 1920 by 1200
pixels and a density of 224 PPI it's not
quite as sharp which really only matters
when you're dealing with content higher
than 1080p but the tablets these colors
are more accurate it has slightly better
contrast and marginally darker blacks
though the Note 10.1 does offer wider
viewing angles there's not much else to
say beyond the fact that they're both
great each tablet however has a unique
trick up its sleeve the tablet Z carries
a rating of IP 57 for dust proofing and
water resistance it can survive a dip in
water for up to 30 minutes at a depth of
1 meter the Note 10.1 comes with the S
Pen and inductive stylus which utilizes
a Wacom digitizer and comes with its own
feature set so which of these two
tablets takes the crown and hardware
neither actually the tablet Z has a
higher quality build and resistance to
water and dust it also has a more
accurate display but the Note 10.1 comes
with the S Pen is more compact as more
powerful internals and has a higher
resolution display we'll call it a draw
the firmwares on these two devices
aren't all that similar either the note
10.1 as we all know by now is running
the most current version of Android
version 4.3 of course that's beneath all
of Samsung's alterations meaning it only
has a loose resemblance to stock Android
visually the software on the Xperia
tablet Z shares a lot more in common
with the native Android UI though it's
still running Android 4.2.2 the tablet C
uses very dark Grey's with slight
deviations from stock Android the major
changes on the surface at least are
Sony's icons widgets and wallpapers
position of the notification shade and
other slight modifications such as
animations or the appearance of the
recent apps page TouchWiz on the note
10.1 is much brighter and more vibrant
it uses light grays and various UI
elements such as the notification shade
and Settings app virtually no UI element
has gone untouched by Samsung's
developers the Settings app is tabbed
and paginated the home screens and pages
of applications endlessly scroll in a
carousel like manner and the
notification shade spans the entire
display appearances aside what each
brings to the table however isn't
radically different though the Note 10.1
has a notable leg up both devices offer
floating applications which is
particularly useful on a display this
size press the recent apps button on the
tablet Z and seven pre-installed small
apps as Sony calls them anyway are
available pressing the expand button in
the far left corner will show more and
tapping the plus icon will allow you to
download more from Google Play or turn
your favorite widgets into small apps
the selection of floating applications
called pin windows on TouchWiz aren't as
broad and you can't create your own on
the fly out of your favorite widgets
you're accessed by pressing the S Pen
button and hovering it over the display
select pin window and draw a rough
outline of the size of the window you
want and then select one of the seven
applications the difference here is that
floating applications on the Galaxy Note
10.1 can be open to top 2 more
applications using the multi window
feature and multiple floating
applications can be opened at once on
the note only one can be opened at a
time on the tablet Z it's a tough call
here we don't mind the software on the
Xperia tablet Z like pure stock Android
it's lightweight with its fair share of
value adds and there's something to be
said for that but even while TouchWiz is
an over encumbered UX the optimizations
and ability to run to full application
side by side far outweigh the frequent
performance troubles it brings it's
simply a better UI and UX for a tablet
performance the most part seems
comparable between both tablets the
standard subset of actions was back and
forth between the tablet Z and
Note 10.1 sometimes opening applications
was faster on the Z sometimes switching
apps or returning home was quicker on
the note 10.1 and vice versa but there
are some things that we can quantify the
Note 10.1 has an additional gigabyte of
RAM meaning it can keep more in memory
through switching multiple applications
the tablet Z will run out of memory
first forcing it to close some apps
while the Note 10.1 can keep them open
both tablets also handle graphic
intensive gaming exceptionally well and
performed well in benchmarks speaker
performance is a place neither tablet is
particularly great the tablet Z isn't
bad but its speakers are rather tinny
and although they're difficult to
entirely cover on accident'
they're quite easy to muffle the same
can be said of the Note 10.1 but its
speakers are far louder and produce a
more full sound battery life is still a
bit uncertain for the Note 10.1 while
we've done our fair share of testing we
haven't quite put the tablet through its
paces just yet but the tablet Z fared
pretty well in our full review lasting
through an entire weekend on a single
charge
it's 22 watt hour battery manages to
power the tablet with sufficient stamina
and incredibly well on standby
especially with the power saver mode
turned on the Note 10.1 with its 31 watt
hour battery easily manages to last two
days on a charge but of course for
heavier usage you may need to charge
more often the camera situation is
effectively the same as it always is
when it comes to tablets although fitted
with 8 megapixel cameras their
performance is second-rate both devices
provide images which are filled with
noise black detail sharpness contrast
and accurate colors we give the image
tinting edge to the Galaxy Note 10.1 but
rest assured neither tablet takes great
photos what we want to know is at the
end of the day which tablet would you
choose for us it's pretty
straightforward we can make better use
of the 10.1 inch display on the Galaxy
Note 10.1 with its s-pen and multi
window features but that doesn't mean
the tablet Z is a bad choice both
tablets are on par with one another in
most areas or offer a fair trade-off
where they're not if you spend a lot of
time around water or dust go with the
tablet z from sony if you need more
multitasking features get the note 10.1
