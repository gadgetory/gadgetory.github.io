its screen size and launch date other
galaxy s5 rumors go in detail on the eye
or scanner if you want an LG G flex on
AT&amp;amp;T your weight is now over I'm hi Mary
better and the faster I recorded it at
this video the faster Monday will be
over you know I hate that thing this is
parking out daily let us begin today
with some official news as AT&amp;amp;T has just
decided to follow on Sprint's footsteps
there now launching the LG G flex
pre-orders pre-orders for now and you
can pay the same premium $300 after a
two-year contract for the phone but the
biggest issue is that at least on sprint
you know when you're getting your phone
which the problem is AT&amp;amp;T is not
providing any dates but again if you
want the LG G flex on AT&amp;amp;T this is the
only way to get it for now and speaking
of AT&amp;amp;T let's talk about HTC has more
credible sources kind of confirm that we
are getting an HTC One plus or whatever
they're going to call the m8 which is
the code name in AT&amp;amp;T we are expecting
for this phone to be announced very soon
and he has AT&amp;amp;T is going to be one of
the carriers it's going to be using it
we're just hoping that they don't make
it another exclusive like would happen
with the one initially but yeah we are
expecting afraid TNT we get details on
the fact that it's going to have a
bigger display and then it will be
running hit cat out of the box so stay
tuned for that and for those of you
waiting for more details on the Sony
Xperia z2 we get more details on the
specifications and it's pretty much a z1
Snapdragon 800 processor we get almost
everything I guess the only differences
are the fact that this phone is going to
be launching with KitKat and the fact
that for those of you that we're waiting
for 2k display on this z2 you're gonna
have to wait it's pretty much gonna be
the same z1 we just don't know any
specifics on design just yet except for
the fact that apparently the back is not
going to be made of glass but let's see
what we get in the end we're just
expecting this to be a US carrier
variant but NW will probably tell now
let's talk about Samsung in the galaxy s
fine we get to leaks that are very
interesting first of all we get another
screenshot of the magazine UI for the
galaxy s5 which is great we did love
that at CES for the whole tablet
ecosystem but aside from that we get
more details on the specification on
this phone first of all apparently we
are getting a 20 megapixel camera like
the Sony phones and not really the 16
megapixel I so self camera that we've
been hearing for years already so that's
one thing that's baked another thing is
that apparently we are definitely
getting a 2k display aside from a
twenty-nine hundred million power
battery etc etc let's just hope that
they figure out better build quality on
this phone but stay tuned for that and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day we get more details on the
iphone 6 or should we say i phone sixes
as apparently we are getting two phones
again and this time we're not talking
about the whole iphone 5c iphone 5s
thing apparently we are getting a 4.7
inch iphone 6 which sounds interesting
until you start hearing about the fact
that it's going to keep the same
resolution as the current iphone 5s so i
don't know how apple's planning to sell
us the fact that that is still a Retina
display but even more interesting is the
fact that apparently we're getting a 5.7
inch tablet from apple and we're still
wondering exactly what they're planning
to do with that phablet so that makes
the question of the day are you
interested in the phablet from Apple is
that something that you're waiting for
because in my particular case after the
disappointment of the original iPad Mini
i'm not sure that i really want this
phablet I mean Samsung already owns
Wacom what are they planning to do for
the styles and everything what are they
planning to make this thing different or
unique leave us a comment down below
