next big thing in mobile silent circle
has tried to solve certain assassin ease
with its niche black phone bp1 back at
MWC 2014 fast forward to this year and
the company is at it again with two
products sort of I'm home it'll be
better with parking now and let's have a
quick and limited look at the brand new
black bone VP 2 now disclaimer guys just
like we couldn't turn on the black phone
VP 1 during our hands-on video last year
because it was using pre-production
software this year's black phone VP 2
has taken another step back as the
device on displays aren't really ready
to do anything but show as a demo now
not everything is negative black vote is
acquired the partnership that it had
with geek phone last year so the cheap
looking finish of the black phone BP one
there's no more the new black phone VP 2
sports a more refined glass on glass
design that should be more appealing to
the enterprise users at targets with a
very elegant metallic finish on the
sides the design continues to be
obviously black and these tethered units
were actually intentional as the logo on
the back is not yet final the black
phone VP 2 also receives a spec bump and
a lot of the things that we complained
about last year we receive a qualcomm
snapdragon octa-core processor of
undisclosed the clock speeds and
apparently it is a 64-bit processor but
we can't really confirm that yet it
supports a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS display
three gigs of ram 32 gigs of expandable
storage and a 13 megapixel camera at the
back with a 5 megapixel front firing
shooter it also has a 3060 milliamp hour
battery in addition to Gorilla Glass 3
on the front and back the phone will run
on private OS 1.1 which sadly doesn't
seem to be based on Android 5.0 lollipop
at least on this first generation unit
that they used to show this off the
changes in the OS don't really seem
substantial to what we saw on our black
phone bp1 review a few months back but
the black phone team did spend a good
amount of time showing us just how cool
this new silent spaces feature is
now you have the option to switch
between the private UI that's full of
all the security burdens that you can
think of or set up a private profile
that doesn't really require all this
hassle and even cooler is that you'll
notice that it takes no time to switch
between one profile and the other even
though you will be required to have a
password for the security profile which
makes sense the one product we wish we
could have shown you is sadly not here
which is the black phone plus the
company's tablet I guess we'll just have
to wait for these products to be ready
in the summer and show them off to you
and our full review for now this has
been hi never better with pocket now
make sure you follow us on social media
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
