start the song any ideas no it's never
funny when you plan it you know what I
mean it comes across as scripted what if
I start with some beatbox beatboxing
punch that would be funny for it for a
lot of people so I would set that could
definitely work maybe we can we can win
some more listeners from the other side
not the windows and the Android and the
iOS side but the music part that's a
good point let's just let's just jump
right in everyone welcome to episode 15
is that is that right around 50 now
mmhmm yeah 15 of the pocket now podcast
I will be your host Brandon minimun
editor-in-chief of pocketnow.com I think
it's the pocket cast isn't it not the
podcast well I I think that it should be
just the podcast I don't think anyone
knows what a pocket cast is so you know
podcasts like that was our thing that
doesn't differentiated us from the rest
of those those other podcasts out there
I agree with eben all right guys are
ganging up against me will introduce
yourselves and we'll get started here
uncomfortable silence I'm Evan blast hi
guys and this is an zombie nod hello
everybody we decided in this episode to
have everyone introduce themselves so
that I didn't have to say any weird
comments and make people feel
uncomfortable so uh so so we did it that
way and I think next time we'll go back
to the way it was did I pronounce my
name right did you pronounce your name
right yeah so so tony is a last name
that's difficult to say because it has a
character that we don't have in English
and I've been practicing in and Evan
tried it too and we couldn't get it
right but Tony have you had so your last
name again it's much yes and it sounds
like he's just saying Nagy ears or
something like that but it's something
more like that it's more complex than
that there's a very subtle sound that
you have to have to get right let's get
best this moon all right let's get past
this all right so let's get started a
lot to talk about we've got the windows
from seven event tomorrow and it's kind
of strange because most people will
listen after
tomorrow today's Monday tomorrow's
Tuesday so you'll be able to tell
whether our predictions were we're on or
if they were totally off probably by the
time you listen to this we'll be in New
York adam lane and i will be there
recording videos taking pictures of
whatever microsoft has to offer the idea
the word on the street is that they're
going to be talking obviously about
Windows Phone 7.5 mango we know about
the things that are big about ie9 fast
app switching and then there are a ton
of other things in fact Steve Ballmer
came out and said over 500 things that
are new with Windows Phone 7.5 or
they'll probably just he'll probably
call it 7.5 instead of mango some other
news that sort of didn't shock us what
surprised us a little bit was that there
was going to be new hardware talked
about yeah what's that all about I
haven't even had a chance to look at
that story yeah so so so bombers or the
rumor actually the wmpoweruser was that
there were going to be nine new devices
talked about or even shown it would be
more interesting and my hunch is that
these devices will obviously be running
mango but they'll also represent the
next chassis of Windows Phone 7 going
towards the higher with dual-core
processors more RAM allowed maybe a more
robust dedicated GPU maybe even higher
screen resolutions I mean how awesome
would it be for Microsoft to one-up
Apple beyond the 960 x 640 display and
do something that's even more incredible
than that and Windows Phone 7 would look
awesome with a higher resolution screen
it's a very graphic intense you I what
do you guys think it's going to happen
tomorrow well I'm not sure windows 17
supports a higher resolution than wvga
which have we have right now but I am
highly excited about this rumor of new
devices and from what I've heard is that
Samsung is trying to somehow make a
windows phone 7.5 variety of the samsung
galaxy s2 and I'm excited not not
because of the CPU and the huge rambut
of the super amoled plus screen
could you guys imagine that on windows
phone 7 when you have all those blacks
behind the tiles it would look fantastic
that's a good point I mean windows phone
7 makes especially good use of AMOLED
displays which are best suited when
there is a lot of black on the screen so
having a super amoled plus from the
galaxy s2 that would make it just the
tiles like pop off the page I think I'm
sorry go go on go on even I think you
definitely need some I mean 7 devices
where what would you say nine devices in
tomorrow 99 yeah that sounds like a lot
to me baby I mean you definitely need
some hardware tomorrow because for for
the mainstream press you know an
iteration you know a point five
iteration that doesn't make a great
headline for you know the average
readers you know in USA Today or or the
new york times but it's better it's
better to have that you know microsoft
announces new devices running on you
know upgraded OS that's yeah yeah
absolutely i mean it's much more
tangible it'll be much more impactful in
terms of the press response if there is
divisive if their devices to take
pictures up in to get hands-on time with
another interesting thing about the
event tomorrow is that it starts at ten
a.m. and the windows phone seven launch
event in october started in the evening
as i remember one hundred percent sure
on that and i don't think so i think it
was a day event as i recall okay so as
you were there so maybe you were just
drunk and there's plenty of you know
free free drinks to go around courtesy
of microsoft but yeah I curious as to
whether that was an all day event I rank
it Brendon I think it makes sense to be
at ten a.m. in the morning because from
what we've heard there will be a
simultaneous event in london and in
poland enforce show so i think thats an
am translates to 5pm or something
similar in in europe that would make
sense what's also interesting is that
there's no in the invitation that we got
for the event tomorrow there's no
specifics on timing
it's just you know VIP preview event for
windows phone 7 there's no keynote
mentioned or anything like that I just
dealing with life to be invited getting
back just for force a half of the second
for these nine rumored devices i think
this number nine makes a lot of sense
because if you remember back in October
when Windows Phone was launched Steve
Ballmer came out with nine devices and
they are emphasizing that windows phone
7.5 is not going to be so much of an
update to an existing Windows Phone but
they are trying to present it as a whole
new concept maybe not in a whole new
platform but a whole new approach to
Windows Phone 7 so it's gonna be
definitely a launch event and these nine
devices make sense my question is where
do you put those or that nokia windows
phone 7 which hopefully will come out
this year do you think that that the
event tomorrow might a shed some light
on on the nokia device i mean at least a
reference to that yes but i don't think
there will be any announcements or any
device is shown because Stephen Elop
said that one of the main ideas and
policies he's trying to implement with
Nokia is to reuse the time between the
announcement and the effective
availability date of a smartphone really
good luck with that I think they'll do
manage to do that oh I mean they'll do
it but that that's how stuff gets leaked
you know that I think the smartest
companies are ones who announced the
hardware far in advance you know so far
in advance that that that really there
aren't enough prototypes out there or
any renders out there to really get
leaked out doesn't that kill the
momentum over time I don't know I asked
gasps Steve Jobs in the and the iphone I
mean the first up first iphone was was
introduced months and months ahead of
time you know it seemed like an eternity
between the announcement and you know
what it they just filled up you know all
the the papers in the magazines and
obviously online was just filled with
with iphone speculation all the minutiae
you know every
little thing was analyzed it this is an
interesting topic the time between
announcing a device or or technology
even and when it's released I was
reading an article today about Dell and
sort of Dell's failure to bring to
market a very innovative product and I
was I thought back to that really thin
crazy laptop that they released i think
is the adamo XPS is that right adana
yeah and that thing was announced or at
least leaked a long long time before it
was actually released and then by the
time it was released there were already
laptops on the market that were
extremely thin but what happens is that
this lag time has to be short enough to
wear a competitor can't get in there and
eat you to market I mean in the case of
the iphone every iphone release is so
far ahead of work the current market is
that apple's confident that a company's
not going to release a phone with a 960
x 640 display before the iphone 4 it's
released for example and I feel like
apples also shorten that time itself you
know it you've never had to wait you
know months and months like like with
the first iphone it's only been a couple
months at most yeah i mean i think i
think that's on purpose because of this
reason that people are starting to
anticipate where Apple is going to go
next you know if they release the eye if
they talk about the ipad 3 which is
going to have a you know ridiculously
high resolution screen that's a very
predictable move and so it's very
possible that samsung and other
companies are already retooling to to
come out with a counter to that product
and if there's a big enough time window
no release it before the ipad 3 comes
out so you know as you say a van apples
anticipating this and they're they're
closing their windows between when they
announce the product and when they
release it sometimes making it as short
as you know a month or two right but
that that's really when you risk getting
into you know having your stuff leaked
out and having the the surprise gone
that's true no you Apple especially is
really a big on you know controlling the
message and
the timeline and when everything gets
out so when when you disrupt that you
know that that's a huge blow to their
marketing strategy well apples always
been a special case but let's try to
make an analogy with the Thunderbolt now
now that one hasn't been announced
officially but we had lots lots of leaks
and the rumors about the announcement
date and the more time between those
rumors and the actual announcement I
think the momentum got killed and I
think sprint is heading towards the same
thing with the evo 3d I mean we had the
announcement and we still don't have any
details a super when that device will be
ready I think there's a there's a lot of
people anticipating it because it's a
new technology yeah I mean and it really
represents you know HTC's return to to
you know the top of the heap in terms of
technology for a while they sort of
falling back there you know lower screen
resolution than the motorola less
processing power than LG so I don't
think HTC and sprint gave other
manufacturers enough time to come up
with a Q HD 3d display I mean only a
couple companies are doing 3d right now
and they're sticking to WB GA and that
HTC's pumping that the qhd is just so
it's kind of another ball game yeah so
Brendan should we enumerate all the 500
the features which will be announced
tomorrow or believe that until tomorrow
for boomer better uh well I hope I hope
tomorrow they don't enumerate all 500
features that might get a little boring
hopefully to stick to the major ones and
let the other you know 475 be AP a
surprise or one of those you know you
booth I think one of the one of the
interesting things about these these
updates is that you get this ant new
versions of Android and other other you
give this a new versions of HTC Sense
it's kind of a nice little discovery
find something new and something you
might not have heard about I mean HTC
does this all the time they have got so
many little features in their new phones
in the version of sense you know
something as simple as
turning your phone over to silence the
ringer they generally advertise that and
yet you can discover it through the
settings and you're like oh wow is
little bonus anyhow let's uh let's move
on speaking of Microsoft there were
rumors of Microsoft potentially buying
Nokia's multiple unit which would be a
pretty remarkable thing in the industry
Jimmy even huger than then nokia you
know going with Windows Phone 7 what do
you think Microsoft would do with Nokia
and they were to buy it or than the
mobile edition oh there's so many jokes
you can make their manager but but
realistically I think it wouldn't be a
bad synergy they I think they would
obviously be looking for that vertical
integration that that Apple has with you
know the iPhone and iOS and and it would
it would really be who them to to be
able to control the the hardware and the
software experience but um this is
something that we haven't really seen
before which is on which is sort of on
I'm you know a synergy of the two two
types of of strategies with cheese or
vertical integration or licensing yeah
we yeah we spoke about this last week
and it's interesting that we spoke about
his last week and then this news breaks
of Microsoft you know potentially the
but this is totally room in its most
likely not going to happen at this point
I don't know elder mertes and he said
they're they're in talks I mean if he
says it you know he's he's he's got he's
got tentacles pretty deep into these
companies who sent her nokia are you
saying that he's some kind of fish he's
got tentacles possibly I've only seen
one picture of a minute and it was only
from the waist up so don't know is a
squid and fish by the way I don't think
so what would that be called
any rating biologists tomorrow's towing
you know what no anyway well Tony what
do you think the implications of
Microsoft buying up Nokia's new mobile
division would be well I have two
observations here the first one is the
following if and if Microsoft would
purchase Nokia's mobile division that
would mean Microsoft will be a hardware
manufacturer they would produce windows
phones just like they produce zooms
having a unit to produce your phones
would indirectly give you a competitive
edge compared to the other OEMs it's
normal that you would try to push and
the focus more on your own division than
other OEM so I don't know how would the
the other Samsung LG dell acer respond
to this this is number one and number
two I've read a very interesting comment
on our post and the commenter I'm sorry
I don't recall your name but I will look
it up he said why would you purchase or
why would you buy the cow when you can
milk it for free haha and you can think
about this I mean microsoft has OEMs
nokia will be from this point of view
just another OEM and they still have
controlled via their hardware
requirements would it make sense in this
in this whole image for microsoft buy
Nokia's mobile unit they have complete
control over what hardware is
manufactured and what hardware is
running Windows Phone right but they
don't have necessarily control over what
goes on inside nokia internally in terms
of release schedules and absolutely i'm
pushing out updates whenever you have
another organization get involved it's
going to be more red tape and more
bureaucracy so theoretically if you can
get everything you know all under one
roof um you know like brandon always
wants me to come into the office because
you know you get more done in person and
and i think apple has has shown that you
know with their you know their they've
just done a really good job and
this has been true going back to to the
original Macintosh and the you know the
Apple computers where you know having
everything together making the hardware
and the software you're able to to do
things that that that you can't do with
the licensing arrangement I agree but
the Microsoft acquiring Nokia's mobile
unit and transforming it to its own
mobile unit I think would alienate
alienate am i spelling that's right lien
8 yeah the other OEMs which wouldn't
it's not the worst part the worst part
is that I don't think Microsoft would
even care with Nokia on board I mean
it's the number one full manufacturer
today well okay let's well let's pull in
some stats here then we were gonna
discuss this later but but maybe we
could bring this in now how how you know
it doesn't seem like Windows Phone is
doing all that great what did what was
the number one point six million of all
the different models yeah they yeah q1
and now is that sold to consumers or
sold to retailers I think it was
consumers reported by Gartner yeah okay
so I mean that you know I don't know how
that compares against the the other
platforms it doesn't seem like a lie
well it compares like this android is
activating 400,000 today so a q1 for
Microsoft equals four days of google
android okay so i mean it would almost
seem like Microsoft could could you know
retool and let and let these uh whoever
wants to leave Leave it's like you know
Samsung you only want to make android
phones you know we don't we don't really
need you making windows phone 7 you know
we make our own and and they're a lot
better interesting very interesting well
let us move on and we'll see what
happens with microsoft and nokia nokia
nokia why don't you put the I a together
nokia anyway so news that AT&amp;amp;T is going
to enable sideloading for three of their
android phones inspire 4g the area and
the captivate you know it's really
frustrating
an ATT phone at times because if you
download an app from wherever XD
developers or other other forums out
there and they're not the apps not
available in the marketplace you can't
do it because your phone cant sideload
apps it's well you can jailbreak and and
do it right of course you can jailbreak
you can you can I mean that's the only
way really to sideload apps on 20 AT&amp;amp;T
phone but most people don't want to
jailbreak or or root is the term is for
Android so this is good news that AT&amp;amp;T
is going to stop implementing this
policy but why did they do it in the
first place why they stopped sideloading
I think because of security reasons it's
well known that with or without malware
the idea that applications on the
official google android market are
somehow approved or somehow official now
yeah I I brought them all we're here
because we've seen malware in the google
android market but the general idea is
that if you purchase an application from
an unknown source from outside of the
google android market let it be another
third-party market or the APK from XDA
developers it's not going to be safe and
I think that would impact somehow or at
least AT&amp;amp;T thought that it would impact
on your security and maybe who knows on
their network security and then they
learn that stuff inside the market
wasn't safe either yeah absolutely I
mean it's true you know you the android
market is much more of a wild west than
the app store it's a lot easier to push
up malware right but now talking about
malware I'm talking about the rooted
devices this is a little bit off topic
we had a news story this weekend that
you know the movie rental service google
started in the android market well it's
it turns out it's not supporting rooted
devices so another security hug for a so
called open platform right but i think
that's only temporary i'm sure it'll be
a solution that will i hope so that will
you know
check the the servers into thinking that
the device is not rooted yeah but
officially they don't support that ah
well you know it's funny because all the
other carriers and have some floating
nav um my theory is that yeah it has to
do it security but it also has to do
with um people messing up their phones
and calling into AT&amp;amp;T customer service
which of course costs 80 money ought to
have to feel those calls and it's just
reducing one layer of complexity on
devices that are pretty complex and
compared to the feature phones with a
self well I think I mean the only reason
they're turning it on now is for the
amazon appstore right yeah that seems to
be one of the reasons but of course
that'll allow people to install a host
of other apps to their right but it
seems like you know maybe eighteen t
hasn't changed heart as much as you know
this is something that that they got
pushed into unfortunately they can't
they can't prevent certain apps for
being sign loaded so it's just you know
it's either All or not even if you take
Google Android unrooted it it will not
allow you stock to to install unknown
application you have to go deep inside
settings application and then check that
I think it's called unknown sources for
you to be able to install downloaded
apks from outside the marketplace so
it's it's a protection which you can
disable of course but I think AT&amp;amp;T went
to the next level with this yes in the
very good let us move on next thing we
are talking about is the HTC holiday and
the lead or is it the web I think it's a
lead HTC lead and HTC holiday we talked
about this kind of gave a hint of it
tipped as a tease 4G LTE launch devices
which would be very significant you know
both are quite impressive devices that
the holiday is the one that we're sort
of drooling over with the 4.5 inch qhd
display with dual core processor is a
gig of ram
and simultaneously in terms of 18 tlte
18t demonstrated real world 28 megabits
per second down for their LTE network so
to answer the question what can 18t do
to make their network better than
verizon's even though they're launching
it a year or more after is make it
faster and of course verizon's network
is capable of much much faster speeds
than you see today it's very possible
they could you know turn up the knob by
the time 18 so that all it takes they
have a knob and they just keep it turned
down to started to toy with us yeah
they've got this red zone and uh you
know the marketing director says turn it
up to red 18 cheese going faster and
then the engineer says we're giving her
all she's got she's gonna blow and then
the marketing guy says I don't care and
the hamsters are running on that circle
on that whatever they got they're
running on they inject the hamsters with
some steroids to increase their
performance on the treadmill which turns
up yo te our general um but yeah so this
this holiday season could be the could
be the time when we see these high-end
HTC phones running on AT&amp;amp;T LTE maybe
even sooner because I don't know I don't
remember where i read some rumors that
AT&amp;amp;T might turn the LTE switch summer in
June yeah I thought our they were the
first device those were supposed to come
the summer mm-hmm better he then bet
that and getting just for a second back
to those beads as we mentioned in our
post those speeds are let's say lab
tested when millions and millions of
people will try to download and upload
on the LTE network world at 28 megabits
per second still be 20 megabits per
second or would have dropped you 3g or
4g it'll actually get faster that's what
a tease special sauce is the more people
that are on it somehow increases the
capacity is that it go do they know that
yeah it's obvious oh come on now I'm
gullible that the thing that I think LTE
has better what's the word resistance
to it obviously as higher capacity by
design but you know everyone saying that
Verizon's 4G network right now is
blazing fast new 20 megabits per second
down on laptop card like 12 to 15 on a
phone people are saying that that will
soon to great as people get on the
network well I've got a thunderbolt
right here and granted you know not many
people in the surrounding area probably
unhealthy e but probably more than when
the Thunderbolt came out a few months
ago and the speeds are still rocket fest
so hopefully these theoretical maximum
turn out to be very close to to
real-world expectations unlike 3g where
you know performance degrades
tremendously when you get a lot of
people on a network especially when
you're on AT&amp;amp;T in New York City Las
Vegas or San Francisco mm-hmm how much
is on with verizon how much does 4g cost
you know how much it costs some extra
per month Oh over and above what a 3g
contract would I think they've got an
extra I think it's you know only ten
bucks or so kind of like sprint does
with their premium data fee or whatever
but everyone has to pay the premium data
fee now you know even if you don't have
a wimax device really yeah yeah so so
it's the smartphone feet yeah smartphone
fee it should be the same on verizon I
mean I love how Tony knows what's going
on in America better than us Americans
do you know right that is kind of funny
um all right very good but this move on
what is next on the agenda HTC breast
song that sounds very French or maybe
I'm just making it sound French oh
you're right yeah he was a French
photographer oh don't you read all my
posts Brennan I Reno 99% of them uh yeah
but this is this is good sort of
validation we we were talking about this
HTC breasts on a while ago and then
you've been you've been following this
uh most closely you want to
yeah I mean it's uh you know we we were
tipped to a video a commercial for this
phone which which probably is not going
to look like um the one that's in the in
the ad that that was posted but done
it's pretty clear that they're they're
coming out with 16 megapixels and it's
coming to t-mobile we learned thanks to
the this is my next site yeah so I think
the big question on everyone's mind is
how are the optics can be you know
because you know you can have as big a
sensor as possible if you have a little
you know in the whole plastic lens then
it's not going to look great so you know
what are they and I have a feeling that
day they are going to do something good
here it you know that that's going to be
the main selling point of this phone and
it sounds like it's going to be you know
a sort of a flagship device on t-mobile
and for for windows phone 7 as well I
don't know if this is a phone that has
the fantastic imaging capability in
addition to dual core processor big
bright screen I think would be great but
it would be kind of disappointed if the
only sort of selling point of this was
the crazily high resolution camera and
then they left all the other specs to
attention to be like last generation
that's true I think at this point we
just don't know yeah so so that is very
exciting in and also correct me if I'm
wrong but Windows Phone 7 shouldn't be
able to support sensors that high so
this could be part of the next work you
know round of requirements for chassis
three yeah I don't think there's any
doubt that it would be a mango device
make me money maybe we'll see you
tomorrow that would be awesome I'm not
an HTC hater but ok I am yours a hater I
am but only from the imaging point of
view because I'm really not excited
about this
device i've been using HTC smartphones
since the HTC p 3600 the trinity and
believe me all of them made lousy
pictures if somehow they managed to to
match the sensor with the optics to
deliver good image and quality then i
will be definitely in but from my
subjective point of view I'd say number
one imaging quality is the nokia n8 with
those carl zeiss optics and believe me
or not the Apple iPhone 4 takes
fantastic pictures with only 5
megapixels of its camera so regardless
as you said Evan 16-megapixel doesn't
mean anything if you don't have the
optics I'd go with 5 megapixels and
fantastic optics to have a 2000 or
something pixel wide image but that
would be sharp crisp with all the
corners of the image in focus because
with the HTC devices now on the market
you have the center and focus and all
the edges are blurred colors are washed
out so I'm not excited pink for things
like it to add a little bit of little
pink tunes to the photo Oh a late lately
the galaxy s2 2 I see these balloons
floating across my window I think so
three year old somewhere it's very upset
right now oh why don't you catch them
like that they are like a thousand feet
in the air so pop them and these windows
don't open so uh huh yeah you know
imaging on a camera is very interesting
the iphone 4 probably takes the cake as
having the best optics in terms of the
video capture and the photo quality but
not too far behind and this is all sort
of my opinion is the Samsung sensor I
mean ever since the omnia two they've
been really killing their cameras and
the galaxy s 2 s camera i think is
perhaps better than the iphone 4 and it
takes video at a higher resolution even
though it's not insanely amazing quality
just in the saturation is what the
colors contrast looks good but we're
seeing a turning point i think in optics
and uh you know yes I supposed to look
really good what's happen the Ark is
supposed to take a really good photo at
the ark the ark as well that's what I
was supposed to say that I think
sony ericsson comes in close third or
maybe even second with those exmor r
backlighted or back-illuminated sensors
they just take fantastic pictures yeah
how important is photos photo taking and
video taking are you on your phone you
haven't you guys take pictures in true
video for me for me it's important
because I like to take pictures while
being out regardless if it's in the park
or or grabbing a drink with somebody and
posting those pictures on facebook but
lately I'm skipping many many pictures
because they don't even look well on the
smartphones on display but since i got
the Apple iPhone 4 and this guy's I'm
not turning to Apple but it's just got a
fantastic camera and the pictures look
great and if you have a post processing
application like camera plus or I don't
know Photoshop Express you can be very
creative and taking pictures and
uploading them to your social page what
about you add um I barely ever leave the
house so I I take a picture like once a
month but you know when I when I do use
it I want it to be good so it's it's a
fairly important feature yeah it's a
bragging right to you know you got to
have more megapixels then then your
buddy's phone um oh yeah I take a lot of
pictures to you know just just the other
day they're building a what they call it
Whole Foods near me and they're doing
some construction and there's just I I
like to take pictures there's some crazy
construction equipment I got real close
with the you know the samsung galaxy s2
and I took some really cool pictures my
problem is that I want the phone the
picture is to be instantly available
somewhere in the cloud and on an android
phone you can have picasa web album sink
which is awesome take picture boom
that's online i would like it a little
bit better if it went to like a dropbox
folder on my on my desktop in the case
of of Windows Phone 7 you can have it
automatically update to or upload to
think it's called like I drive skydrive
yes and in on the iphone that's really
the worst of all it takes some of the
best pictures but you have to
unless there's some other method that I
don't know about you have to email
pictures to yourself and you can only
email like five at a time and they're
like you know two megabytes each or your
mobile be synced up yeah you could
upload them to your eye dr if you pay a
hundred bucks for the service all right
so all right so how does it work you pay
out your bucks and you take a picture
and is it just boom like that uploaded
or do you have to do something I don't
know why haven't these along with will
be the point of having to manually sync
your photos you bought it I mean there
won't be good point that's that's what
we're trying over here so yeah I have to
imagine mobileme is it is an automatic
sync now I don't know if it does it you
know are you saying you want it
immediately uploaded or you know can you
wait 10 minutes until the next you know
sync goes through yeah 10 minutes is
fine so yeah I think that's what that
backup service does you know what I want
I want a second with my desktop like a
widget that has keeps an active like
tally of all the pictures on my phone
and it's sorted by date or I could press
a button and sort it by like by name of
my size and just like that you take a
picture boom it shows up on your desktop
I think you'd want something like the
king studio the Kin studio well I mean
HTC Sense calm will do the same thing
and you know as we talking about mm-hmm
Picasso will do well the kid this the
kins studio didn't make a nice little
desktop folder or whatever you have to
login to the kids to your website there
must be some piece of software out there
may be one of one of our listeners will
hook you up I'm sure that there's a sort
of roundabout way you can do that maybe
with some sort of i'm sure picasa web
album has an api and you could build a
widget they're like you know there might
be us already a widget using windows
windows 7's or the desktop widget
framework is that phone i don't know i
don't use it yeah I don't think maybe
we'll do any I'm moving on Apple is
proposing a
sim card format that is smaller than
micro sim oh no and of course micro sim
is just basically a sim card with the
plastic cutaway it's really the same
thing but they want to make something
even smaller because they're starting to
become limited by the size of a sim card
and so awesome though that that tiny
little thing is is limiting the size of
our devices it really is amazing any
detect these things so full and what's
what's interesting is that you know sim
cards have been around since gsm
networks have been around i mean that's
that's how the phone knows what account
it should use and LTE networks next
generation networks also use sim cards
and if you think that we come up with
something else rather than the sort of
archaic little card you've got plug in
phone to get it activated um I mean it
makes sense for a lot of people you know
you can you can move seamlessly among a
lot of phones and especially if you
travel a lot you know it's great because
your phone can then you know be used on
different networks some cards are great
I mean anything you replace it with is
just going to be something else that
that goes into the phone how else would
you do it well that's the question how
else would you do it you could you could
implement a chip right on the main board
and you could be able to flash that with
your number or maybe I'm saying
something stupid which is technically
not possible at the moment but the way I
see it chips are very small you can have
one soldier right on the on the main
board when you buy the phone you're
being attributed a number you flash that
number or your carrier flash is that
number to your chip and there you have
it your SIM card yeah don't think people
want to have to be reliant on carriers
to do that for them now I think you know
for instance if I if I want to switch
out phones here here at home I don't
want to have to rely on the carrier to
support the activation over you know for
me to change phones I just want to be
able to do it Chris a lot so the sorry
sir the user could do it maybe through a
unique maybe 16 digit code you dial into
the dialer you press dial and it
reprograms your onboard sim card and
then you're probably thinking
then that creates a lot of opportunity
for people that want to sort of steel
the numbers but maybe there could be no
way for you to access the number your
settings or anything like that and kind
of like a credit card number you keep it
to yourself and it would be your own
number that would authenticate your
phone number on a given gsm or whatever
LP phone mm-hmm well I don't think those
those micro sim cards are putting so
much thickness into devices everybody
who's got an iPad or an iPhone 4 knows
how small these micro sims are and only
if you take a look at the holder the
part which inserts and ejects the card
from an to device it's so small let's
add a one or two millimeters for the
part which is inside the hardware to
which the sim card connects if you have
a smaller sim card then it will not be
thinner and the whole idea is to make
smartphones thinner so I'm not buying
the story they'll be awesome if they
built the same part into storage like a
microSD kenna format that me speak yeah
I ditched the the SD cards I'd go with
NAND memory 64 gigabytes 32 gigabytes
128 gigabytes and that would save you
some space you guys remember mini SD
parts no no still have a couple they
were around that standard was around for
like a year and I had one phone it was
the HTC tornado than head of a mini SD
slot I think I had to handset i think i
had the i believe but kaiser was mini SD
and um I believe the hermes was and my
Trinity was many as d tuya Wow so yeah
that was a short lip standard and of
course now everything is micro SD even
the feature phones there's a small
number of them have microSD expansion
zone as a tomb sorry which salmon
I'm sorry I'm in Apache not Kaiser yes
cool and the the final thing that we
wanted to talk about today and we've
already hinted at it was like Google
movies you know the movie download
service the google is rolled out is not
going to work or not working currently
on rooted android devices but your bag
is the question do you guys or would you
guys watch movies on your your android
phone i have i've been at places where
my my phone was my only screen and yeah
i watched several full-length movies but
in general I you know I think people
wanted more is like and we were talking
about this the other day we're ending it
as a continuous thing where you know
you're you're watching the movie on you
on google TV and then you know you can
you can wash it off and on your phone
like on the subway and then you know
start watching on your computer or on
your yeah cuz everyones we watch it work
you're breaking up a little bit of it um
I first re thats that's the that's the
point i think is what screen do you have
available if I'm in a situation where I
want to watch a movie I'm gonna bring
the ipad you know i'm not going to bring
an android tablet because i don't have
one and yes i know i don't like hung hom
that much right now so the ipad makes it
so incredibly easy just like i mean it's
it's a case with any of these download
stores right you pay between two and
four bucks you download it you have a 24
hour to window to start it or no you can
start it within 30 days and then you've
a 24 hour we go to watch it Tony do you
watch you watch movies on your on your
phone you know I've been traveling a lot
in the past five years and I've always
somehow managed to to bring one of my
laptops with me but nowadays if I go
somewhere the only movies i watch on my
smart phones are some youtube videos and
those take it anywhere between two and
five minutes but if if I'd go to watch
movies while being mobile i think i take
the ipad 2 and anything less in diagonal
than the ipad is
think not only bad for your eyes but
renders your movie unenjoyable mmm from
from my personal point of view just wait
till that p 9 30 from LG comes out with
done 720p those pixels are gonna be so
tiny wow that's gonna be the Irish
display there's quite a bit of debate
though on whether or not that that is a
phone that bye-bye model number naming
convention it should be a phone p 9 30
you know isn't the same the same line as
p970 which is the optimist sub black and
p920 which is the 3d and the 990 which
is the 2x hmm but then if you look at
the number of characters it can fit on
the screen it's not a lot it's even less
than 10 most phones so there's there's
something a little bit screwy going on
it that we're not quite sure yet okay
spoiler alerts this is going to be the
google nexus 3 and it's going to run
google ice cream sandwich and it's going
to be out summer in autumn that i've
heard that a few times well I well I why
do you think they would bring LG in for
the nexus 3 i would think that they'd be
happy with samsung could you repeat that
please you were breaking up answered by
the lever you said you said why why
bring LG into the nexus branding i mean
and not stick with samsung well because
we got the initial nexus with HTC we got
the second nexus with Samsung and I
don't think google it wants to tie
itself too much to one manufacturer and
doesn't want the others to feel
neglected so I think all the Nexus is or
the next to see I don't know how you say
the plural will be manufactured like mex
I will be manufactured by a mother OEM
you know it's interesting Google's
promiscuity is is might be attributed to
the fact as you mentioned Tony that they
want to work with every OEM show every
OEM love and give them the chance to
view the next Nexus I'm waiting for the
google nexus 5 made buys
siiii or she way we oh yeah right I mean
I know what interesting thing that I'm
sorry to turn our face it's Huawei that
the the best thing I learned at ctia
Huawei yeah that's pronounced Huawei
well we my way yeah but that makes that
makes total sense um a lot of people
were going crazy when google announced
they would have a you know a nexus brand
you know what about the partners well
okay well we'll rotate to the partners
every year and everyone will get a
chance to showcase a really hot android
device and the nexus brand has proven
very strong i mean the nexus one was and
still is incredibly popular popular it's
a great development platform the Nexus S
is is still going strong and still for
sale it's it's it's on sprint now as uh
as a pretty high-end device running on
ltd though and I can't eat soon what's
that heaven as I said I'd be on AT&amp;amp;T
soon yeah and it'll be available on ATT
a lot certainly and I was going to say
that if the next is three will be made
by LG the nexus 4 will be made by
motorola yeah i agree that would be you
know is if all these companies
necessarily necessarily want to uh i
mean it seemed to me at least that that
the nexus one was sort of fun a boutique
device I mean it may have been cool you
know among among people who follow
clones but I don't know how many then
they sold to you know the average
consumer I wouldn't I don't think that
as a mainstream device that was all that
popular but don't think it was at first
but I'm not sure that that that
companies accept a company like Samsung
which kind of you know they come out
with so many phones and I guess LG is
another one of those companies that
comes out with just a ton of phones but
not as much as Samsung it's really um it
almost it almost doesn't matter if they
sell tremendous number of Nexus is
because they hold a big press event each
time a new Nexus is released the google
partnering with x brand and it gets a
lot of attention it's written up in the
New York Times and The Wall Street
Journal everyone cares a lot so
yeah and they're featured in every show
where a project failure I mean if you
were company with you man it you man
your foot back to a product that you
know how is not going to sell a lot just
so you can get a little bit of press
especially if you're you know company
like LG who who doesn't really need you
know a day of press in the Wall Street
Journal it depends on what a lot is I
mean we don't know what what is
considered a mega hit 40 en on what's
considered a waste of time so but we
have to wrap up the podcast now thank
you everyone for or listening as always
and we will see you figuratively
speaking next time down all right hey
