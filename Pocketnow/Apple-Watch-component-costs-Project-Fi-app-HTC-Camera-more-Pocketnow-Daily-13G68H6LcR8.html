cheap watch the manufacturer will starts
getting serious about project file with
app support and Microsoft continuum for
phone sounds cool and all but there's a
catch I'm high Meadow iveta and because
tomorrow is Labor Day in my country I am
going to celebrate it by working this is
foggy now daily the official noose
adapter with Microsoft mainly with
things that were announced at Build
yesterday that we can cover because the
video is short starting with Microsoft
continuum for phones now keep in mind
continuum for phones is not like
continuity on Apple where you can start
something on your tablet and finish it
on your phone even though Microsoft does
have something similar the point here is
that you can actually use your phone to
run full almost desktop applications on
a computer screen with a keyboard and
mouse and using the phone as the
computer pretty much it's a really cool
feature the only catch is that you'll
require a new windows phone whenever
that launches for that to work other
official news have tablet statistics
they are continually on the klein but if
you're wondering which is the company
that currently owns the tablet market it
continues to be apple with twenty six
point six percent which is a decent
number compared to the nineteen percent
that samsung owns but that doesn't mean
that the market is not down this is
twenty-two percent down from what Apple
was doing a year ago and according to
analysts this has a lot to do with the
iphone 6 plus sadly i'll talk about
Google's Project why we are waiting for
that to launch on Sprint and t-mobile as
Google as the mvno and we are expecting
it to launch only on Nexus devices but
the application is now available on the
google play store and it works on every
phone not just google nexus devices so
we are wondering if google is thinking
about things twice and we will keep you
posted as we learn more i'll talk about
HTC as the company has pushed an update
to its camera application for android
phones and well first of all we do get
some new shooting modes for the HTC I in
addition to the One m8 but the cool
thing is if you have a One m9 you will
get raw photo support which is a great
addition something that we wonder if
will help the HTC One m9 s camera we
will keep you posted on that and finally
for the very hot news of the day we've
got the company's already tearing down
the Apple watch and giving us cost
estimates and it seems that it only
costs eighty three point seven dollars
to build an Apple watch at least when it
comes to components and this is very
controversial Tim Cook was actually
complaining about the fact that these
cost estimates are far from the truth
mainly because obviously they don't
include marketing in addition to
distribution and other things but yeah
83.7 dollars including the whole in cold
closure when compared to three hundred
fifty dollars at an Apple watch sport
costs and it leads me to the question of
the day do you believe that this is a
ripoff for Apple to charge you so much
for an Apple watch in my case I think
that that's the problem with first
generation products but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
