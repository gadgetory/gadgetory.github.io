complexity but simplicity that's what LG
said at today's unveiling of its new g3
in London find out why we think it's an
instant contender for smart phone of the
year in pocket now it's first hands on
most phones these days are built around
their display but that's more true here
than on most devices the g3 is five and
a half inch quad-hd panel features a
pixel density of 538 PPI and a max
brightness of 430 net's
LG says it's the world's first quad HD
aah IPS LCD panel for smartphones quite
a mouthful and in person there's no room
for equivocating it's a stunning screen
the casing surrounding it is almost
equally impressive something we've not
often seen from LG the bezels flanking
the display are very thin and the device
features the palm friendly curve rapidly
becoming the norm among flagships these
days but LG didn't soften other edges
the phone is eight point nine
millimeters thick and dominated by sharp
aggressive angles that counterbalance
the nice curve without making it
uncomfortable to hold lacking a more
suitable adjective it looks really fast
we're a little disappointed that the
metallic finish around back isn't real
metal but that helps the phone stay slim
it comes in at 149 grams which feels
just right here and the matte coating a
top it feels pretty good well better
than a glossy finish at least finally
the three button control collective
around back has been redesigned to give
more physical feedback to make it easier
to use without looking here's hoping
carriers don't muck it up this time
because the new buttons feel great to
use under the cover sits a removable
3000 milliamp hour battery with wireless
charging and a graphite cathode for
extended life and also buried beneath
the surface are the g3 s powerhouse
internals a Snapdragon 801 backed up by
either two or three gigs of ram
depending on the storage option you
choose the microSD slot can support
cards up to 128 gigs and the rear firing
speakerphone is a 1 watt module LG says
simplicity has touched every
corner of the new device including its
software load aesthetically we're not
sure about this the color palette has
been toned down favoring darker tones
that LG says are more professional but
the power I they're a little dull for
such a brilliant display also while the
interface elements have been flattened
somewhat they lack the modern Flair of
some competitors there are added
functional touches here though a Google
now like feature called Smart notice is
ready to provide and hopefully helpful
recommendations without you're asking
and a new security suite lets you
encrypt the device and lock or wipe it
from afar and it also includes the new
knock-on codes we saw on the Lucid 3
besides the new cleaned-up notification
shade our favorite customization so far
is probably the keyboard which can now
be resized dynamically if you've got
sausage fingers and it also now includes
intelligent cursor scrolling through a
long hold on the spacebar it's very
handy we're eating our hats as we said
we might on the pocket now weekly that
extra port around back is indeed for a
laser this laser is a focus assist tool
for the optically stabilized 13
megapixel camera enabling much faster
autofocus than competitors and making it
much more likely that you'll get the
shot if you're in a hurry
there's also advanced audio recording in
video mode which allows for beyond HD
shooting as well the LG g3 begins
rolling out May 28th in South Korea with
us availability coming to all four
American nationals this summer we'll
have much more on this device soon but
for now we'll say that it's potent
combination of specs and new features
combined with its good looks and a solid
selection of accessories make the LG of
very compelling Android handset at first
