Danny Webster here from pakman.com and
today I'm going to show you GPS weather
radar and what this param is going to
allow you to do is use your GPS chip
inside your windows mobile device to
lock on a location in your area so as
you can see here I have a radar map and
I'm actually going to zoom out so it can
zoom out all the way up to 3200 miles or
as close as 12 miles so I'm just going
to zoom up to 800 miles and as you can
see we are on the west coast near
Seattle that's where my location is and
you can see that there's some activity
over here near the eastern Washington
Idaho so it's a pretty good program we
can zoom all the way out so I'm just
going to zoom out 2/3 and 200 miles
so by zooming out all the way we can
actually see major highways and a half
of the United States I do believe that
this program does work in other
countries but remember that there has to
be a radar beacon in order to get radar
signal so we can also check other things
so if I want to change the view I can
look at the satellite infrared so here
we have the satellite infrared of half
the United States as well as some of
that Pacific Ocean and I'm just going to
change it to view the satellite visible
so these are actual clouds and here we
have the actual cloud cover from a
satellite view and it will give you the
time and date as and if you want to you
can actually loop it through but I'm
going to zoom in first so let me zoom in
to 200 and now I can select loop and it
will load that and so here we have the
cloud cover that's actually looped and I
can also change it to the infrared to
the radar as well so I can just close
this and go to update we can update our
location and radar if we wanted to so
it'll lock on to our GPS will just take
a second to lock under the GPS signal
get our longitudinal attitude and once
the GPS signal is loaded you just click
accept and it will input that data
directly into the current map and then
we have our current location as well as
the cloud cover
so I go into some of the settings we can
change your location we go through
switch different countries or recent
location so we can pick different ones
up for him to go to Mobile Alabama can
do that click OK it will load that and
here we have the radar map for Mobile
Alabama so the program is free and I'll
post on your parking out our comments to
how to get this it does require that you
have dotnet 3.5 installed so I will also
post a link on how to get that if you
don't have that installed on your
windows from advice thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
