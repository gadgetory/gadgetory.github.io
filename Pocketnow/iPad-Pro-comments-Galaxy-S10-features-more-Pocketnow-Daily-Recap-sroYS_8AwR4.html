a fork we need to get rid of these hime
as the type of guy jokes the amount of
ours that you use has nothing to do with
the Spanish language it's extremely
excessive barely there you need some
extremely excessive Spanish knowledge is
your name hi mary vera you need to say
it a few more times and get rid of the
meaningless content about phones that is
a good one that's right it's that time
of the week I am Jaime to be that aw
this is PocketNow and this is the
bargain our daily recap your comments
for last week so on Monday the topic was
the 1 plus 60 hour hands-on video was
already live at the time of the pocket
out daily I asked you what did you think
about the 60 we had 214 comments below
60 is an amazing phone however it makes
no sense to make the phone thicker with
no headphone jack that's a good comment
I get it there's a larger battery but
truly there should be add phone jack
indeed to be honest for the first time
underwhelm with the oneplus product I am
not there are a lot of cool things about
this phone that are I would say unique
particularly for the US market but I get
your point I mean not every phone is
gonna make you happy
the oneplus sixty looks good let's see
how it performs and how good the camera
and audio really are looks will not
matter if the performance is not there
hint hint the six killed it the 60
should be fine it's pretty much almost
the same phone then on Tuesday the topic
was the new iPad pro it had just been
announced I actually have to go pick up
mine tomorrow we had 430 comments I'm
running out of kidneys to buy Apple
products dude seriously this is like the
most expensive iPad ever like if you max
it out it's like $2,000 for that thing
that is stupid
dear Apple as much as I love your
products I do want to send my kid to
college PS I think I need the second job
to keep up all right you're not forced
to buy them you know I I still feel that
people don't need an iPad I need an iPad
for work and enables the audio of this
video but you don't really need an iPad
price aside these new iPads
to make the gap between the competition
wider you really think so I'm actually
trying to grasp what you're trying to
say with this comment because I do feel
that I've had serve a particular desire
not a need so I don't really think so
but I probably didn't understand what
you wrote correctly then on Wednesday
the topic was the honor magic - it had
just been announced I asked you what did
you think about this product we had 252
comments I think that price is very
honorable dude like seriously all that
for I think it was like 550 bucks that
is insane I got honor like seriously
they're awesome
forget multiple cameras just two good
cameras a headphone jack and a decent
battery and I'm happy true that but I
you know you always need a vanguard
product you always need a product that's
like this is where technology is and
then here's like the mid-range er that
everybody else is gonna buy so I feel
that these products are necessary it
keeps these companies in the spotlight
so I get the purpose why this product
exists next thing we know phones are
just gonna be one huge camera and
nothing more you never know dude I mean
the Nokia Lumia 1020 was pretty much
that
then on Thursday the topic was pressure
sensitivity on the galaxy s 10 there are
patents that show that Samsung is
working on something yeah sure how much
do you really care about that we had 310
comments
hope it doesn't activate Bixby instead
Google assistant which we already know
that it's going to do all right I didn't
miss read your comment but I get your
point yes but it's a Samsung phone so
it'll be Bixby sadly a programmable
button that we can assign any task would
be so much better yeah the beck speed
button sadly Samsung is not famous for
allowing that with the exception of the
galaxy active lineup depends on what
it's used for if it's necessary then I
don't see why Samsung won't use it yes
the question is what for I mean I love
the DoubleTap of the camera I just I
hate that I can map everything else and
then finally Friday rumors for the next
generation iPads
already begun and proof face ID improved
other things actually what do you
thought we had 312 comments I honestly
loved iPads but I haven't used the
tablet in years dude I get it like for
the longest time there was actually a
time where actually didn't even update
my iPad every year because I didn't
really find the use for it up until I
started using it for audio and then the
pro line I brought that keyboard and I
just felt compelled to use it as more of
a productivity tool it's been great for
me but I get it like for everybody else
you don't really need to buy an iPad
every year I'm not getting a new iPad
but I am interested in seeing what
direction they're taking we've seen
foldable phones become tablets like
seriously tablets need to either become
computers in my opinion or they need to
remain content consumption products the
iPad pro is like somewhere in between so
I you know that's the problem you can't
really use it for everything and that's
really what frustrates me even Chrome OS
does a better job on a tablet right now
that we've got the pixel slate then what
we got at least that's full Chrome
whereas on the iPad you don't have that
full Safari I use my iPad for everything
I'm just waiting for the day when iPad
has final cut pro along with other Apple
apps Adobe suits etc dude oh my god if
like if they gave me like an a' final
cut light where i could start working
which is pretty much the concept of
adobe rush where I could start editing
my video on an iPad and then I could
just bring that project that I'm
probably that I probably started editing
on my solid-state drive and then I just
connected to my computer to continue
dude if they would ever come up with
something like that that would be epic
that would be like the perfect usage for
an iPad but who knows that's it for the
pocket now daily recap thank you so much
