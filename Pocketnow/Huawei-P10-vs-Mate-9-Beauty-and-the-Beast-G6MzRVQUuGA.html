start tearing into review than other
comparisons in the hand the p10 gave off
a much better first impression to what
we saw on paper and in press briefings
I'm personally stoked to be using the
dazzling blue variant it would seem
Huawei is adopting something of the
tick-tock strategy we used to enjoy on
Samsung handsets the phablet released at
the end of the year representing the
Vanguard
tech platform and the phone following at
the beginning of the next year adopting
those tech improvements for those
curious you can pause the video here to
get the full rundown on the specs for
both phones and with that out of the way
if you've been following our May 9
coverage there won't be a lot of
surprises here looking at the p10 though
personally I already missed the IR
blaster where I use the mate 9 as a
universal remote otherwise we have the
same screen resolution the same chipset
same Ram our review units have the same
built-in storage same super chargers and
for the smaller p10 nearly identical
camera hardware from what we can
determine in our early testing with one
small trade the p10 loses the focusing
microphone audio trick from the mate 9
in favor of an enhanced Beauty portrait
mode we'll be trying to get our hands on
a p10 plus to do a more in-depth camera
examination but for those interested you
can check out our mate 9 real camera
review for a really deep dive into
camera technology spoiler it's a nice
improvement over the p9 and the honor 8
the p10 also delivers another baby step
exercise in co-branding both have light
badges on the back the mate 9 will
eventually adopt Amazon's Alexa and the
P tens photo gallery is augmented by
GoPro 4 built-in video editing and
sharing while we increasingly reaching
out to partners to flesh out the
software experience the head phone game
is also pretty similar where we might
see some minor improvements there well
within the margin of manufacturing error
a one decibel improvement to the noise
floor or two decibel improvement to
dynamic range where the p10 reproduces
more of the frequency range of 24-bit
96k files it seems to do so with a touch
more distortion and even disabling the
headphone DTS option we see more EQ
tweaking this is all adequate to good
performance but like the Maintenon
before it the p10 likely won't make our
I do file list at the end of this year
the major audio difference comes down to
speaker tech where the stereo speakers
on the main noticeably outperform its
smaller sibling
we're not surprised at all to see the
maintenance core a battery win as it has
a significantly larger capacity but the
p10 in our medias has posted competitive
numbers with other current flagship
phones the main differences between
these two won't be found in spec sheets
or benchmarks more they represent
separate philosophies we certainly
wouldn't call the mate unattractive but
the P series increasingly looks to
entice a more emotional response from
consumers the aesthetic attention to
details like syncing the camera module
flush with the rear housing offering
bolder color options and experimenting
with navigation controls it's overly
simplistic to call this a fashion phone
but it's easy to see a targeted focus on
different demographics and Huawei is
probably correct here unique doesn't
always have to mean some kind of new
tech feature appealing to a broader
consumer base showing off a shimmery
backplate which is virtually impervious
to fingerprint smudges is a unique
talking point for a lifestyle gadget
that this unique feature is also backed
up by top-tier performance and an
excellent camera is very encouraging in
handling both of these devices we're
hopeful Huawei maintains this split some
consumers will appreciate an everything
in the kitchen sink approach some folks
will want something which better
complements their personal style having
options for both with a heavy overlap of
hardware and software
sounds like a successful strategy to us
