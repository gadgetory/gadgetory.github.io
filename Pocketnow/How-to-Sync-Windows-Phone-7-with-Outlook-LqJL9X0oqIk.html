pocketnow.com and I'm going to show you
how to sync Windows Phone 7 without look
because guess what it doesn't sink
without look let's check it out
so first off you remember Windows Mobile
Device Center and ActiveSync on the
desktop for syncing the old classic
windows mobile devices here we have
Windows Mobile Device Center on Windows
7 and you know you could go in here and
you could choose to sync your contacts
or get all of this cool stuff and it
would sink up with Outlook sometimes a
lot of people there's a lot of horror
stories about people getting you know
duplicates or weird errors and a lot of
people really hated it and just kind of
wished it would die so with Windows
Phone 7 it is dead that's all gone you
don't get active sync on the desktop
anymore you sink with Zune instead but
guess what the Zune only syncs your
music your videos your pictures and your
apps that's all you get with the zoom
syncing so you're probably thinking well
wait a second what about my outlook
stuff I got all these contacts and all
this calendar appointments all those are
an out look at it how do you sync those
with Windows Phone 7 well turns out
Windows Phone 7 only syncs with Exchange
ActiveSync over-the-air to a server on
the internet so you've got to either get
yourself an exchange server or you can
get a nice free Windows Live Hotmail
account so if we can do one of those
over here so this is a free Windows Live
Hotmail account it's got calendar and
contacts and email and all that's in
this web-based thing but you still need
to get your Outlook stuff in there so
this is what you need
this is the outlook hotmail connector
you can download this there is a 32-bit
version and a 64-bit version so pick the
one you like or you need for your
version and you download it right here
and then after you install that you are
going to have in Outlook a new option
when you add an account so let's check
it out over here now over here you see
other and you see marks of Outlook
hotmail connector and this is where
you're going to put your information in
email address password and that's going
to set it up and I already did mine so
here I am in Outlook this over here
those are my personal folders that are
on my hard drive it's not syncing with
exchange or anything those are just you
know static on the hard drive and
there's my calendar
there's contacts another and I already
set up my hotmail account which is right
here and that creates a whole other set
of folders so we have another calendar
for my hotmail and another set of
contacts for Mohammed map so if I want
to get my calendar and contacts into my
Windows Live Hotmail account it's very
easy I'll just go over here and then
I'll click view change it to list so
that gives me all of my calendar
appointments and I can just select all
or if I don't want to do that I can do
them one at a time
and I will just cut if I hold down
control key it'll copy it to hotmail
whereas if I just drag it it'll move it
into the hotmail calendar and this
should be in there now there it is
okay and since Windows Phone 7 little
sync with your hotmail Windows Live
account this is how you get your
calendar and contacts into Windows Phone
7 for syncing and this will stay here so
whenever you want to add items it's just
as easy as you wouldn't Outlook there's
a new appointment no problem everything
is the same okay same with contacts just
drag and drop nope put it into the right
folder and that's it
not bad pretty easy not too painful and
that's your free easy solution for
syncing your contacts and calendar an
email with the Windows Phone 7
hope that helps that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
