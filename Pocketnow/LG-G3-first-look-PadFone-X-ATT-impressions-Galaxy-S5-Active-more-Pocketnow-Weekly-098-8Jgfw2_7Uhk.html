something simple LG beat the simplicity
drum harder than any other one at its g3
announcement but can the resulting
smartphone compete in a complex world a
world in which tablet phone hybrids
Apple beats deals and a windows phone
from the guy who fired steve jobs are
all in probably real things we'll talk
about all of that on episode 09 eight of
the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
audio podcast where we talk smart phones
tablets wearables and other gadgets you
dreamed of owning when you were young
from Boston Massachusetts I'm your host
Michael Fisher to my right and just
about 300 miles away his chief news
editor Stephen shank good morning to you
good morning I can tell you're facing
south from that exactly right actually I
think I am which is creepy and joining
us from over the border of our northern
neighbor Daniel Bader of mobiles here up
Daniel welcome back to the show thanks
for having me thank you for being here I
had a note to myself that I didn't write
down and it's crucial kids remember
write down the notes to yourself because
that's the only way you'll remember them
did i pronounce your last name correctly
Daniel you sure did with the low buddy
else does hey what do people call you
about her it's always better oh really
Wow yeah well I even tell them Darth and
then they figure it out I'm there but
everything everybody who tries it always
fails initially yeah how interesting
alright i'm glad i'm one of the one of
the few and the proud we have a diedrich
bader never ma drew carey and what not
oh yeah right yes I knew guys brother
from college out for your cornhole bud
that guy's a frickin treasure oh um what
I wasn't for some reason i also just my
mind just jumped in Napoleon Dynamite
but I think that it's unrelated he would
know he was in that yeah yeah yeah Roddy
the kudo guy yeah you think anybody
wants a roundhouse kick to the face one
where in these forget about it anyway
that's enough of that Daniel is here
listeners in addition to just because we
like him and and we like mobile syrup
Daniel is here because he was my seat
neighbor at the
LG g3 event in New York City ah yes and
yes along with um I got the guy from New
Jersey tech news NJ tech reviews who I
had met and I like but he is not on the
show so we'll talk to will talk only
about Daniel Rena its please yeah we got
our we were simultaneously exposed to
the wonderment that is the LG g3 this
new smartphone that either impressed or
failed to impress the tech press but I
think it's mostly in the camp of the
former I'm very interested in hearing it
in kicking this off by hearing your
impressions overall I just watched your
hands on video but but tell us what your
what your thoughts overall are on the g3
are you impressed in you I am I think
that it's probably a better phone the
Galaxy s5 uh Wow cutting right to the
heart of the matter overall I think it
is I think the g2 was a great phone with
a few flaws um the major one was the
usability the the backing was really
slippery like the galaxy s4 was yeah so
I think LG has been cribbing the thing
is what's interesting is that LG tends
to release their phones about six months
after Samsung and listens to the
criticisms at the Samsung flagships
receive and then just tweak their phones
based on what Samsung's done wrong you
and I think they've done similar things
with the g3 everything but the camera
impresses I think the fact that the
camera has not really been improved that
much as is disappointing the camera
optics mind you I'm not talking about
the software but we'll get into that
later sure um I do think that everything
else has been substantially improved and
I'm sure we'll talk about the screen
which is just gorgeous the screen is is
stunning there's no question I want to
talk about a point you raised in LG's
listening because this event was it was
really well-run I talked about this a
bit in our editorial round table but you
know LG did not pander to us there was
there was not know patronizing happening
basically they just kept the focus on
the device the whole time and it was
such a dense presentation that it was
actually pretty hard to take notes
curious for people who
weren't actually there in New York were
you guys seeing a live stream of the
London event was there something special
happening Justin on the stakes there in
New York no yeah like yeah we we were
basically ushered into a room with a
beautiful view but basically it was just
a room with a bunch of chairs and three
big old TVs okay oh but they were curved
oh well them wasn't gonna sell you
got all three is curved ones yeah I did
and I wanted to sit by the curved one
but we had to be in the back because the
demo units were on another floor
entirely you had to like get into the
elevators really quickly to go do that
let's just take a second to talk about
the logistics of various and york-based
events because everything in downtown
Manhattan is compact right okay so every
time we'd go to an event there you
always see these companies trying to
work with what they have so in some
cases you know they rent out these big
warehouses and they try to do it up and
make them pretty but ultimately they're
just big echoing noisy warehouses but in
this case they actually separated it on
two floors as Michael said would any
sense it does make a degree of sense
except for the bottleneck that were the
two elevators where everybody tried to
graham themselves in their sweaty you
know it was like teenager like you know
I just felt everybody's got like a bag
of gear everybody's got a tripod some
dudes have really big old TV cameras and
yeah those elevators are about the size
of the sound booth I'm in right now
which is 46 it's ridiculous exactly yeah
see Michael from you're on the street
the editorial round table you shop with
us I assumed you were out in like a
warehouse in Bushwick somewhere right no
II think it was it was actually quite
posh but Daniel makes a good point about
about events like that because it no
matter where it is it is somehow
inconvenient like this was well done
with the exception of that bottleneck
and that's why I moved to the back of
the room and didn't get the curved TV
treatment I wanted to be first the demo
devices but the thing is I had to go
outside and do that hang out from the
side literally from the sidewalk on a
cellular connection because it is always
loud regardless of the event sighs and
there's nothing you can really do about
that one thing that every company does
have control over though is lighting and
lighting is never good enough at these
things Daniel I noticed that you
filmed your hands on outside yea which
was a very smart yeah yeah yeah except
when the rain started spitting on me so
that's the red you see an edit I changed
I just basically put my back to the
outside but you know what I I had a I
had a decent camera with a prime lens i
was able to kind of get the everything
was fine except for audio because it was
loud but there was really no where else
to do anything because and the other
thing is that they started tearing
everything down about an hour after the
presentation so we were busy yeah it was
it was in that sense not very well run
but let's get back to the phone yeah I
have a point to make a video though
about the lighting situation because
like normally it's very dark it's very
you know blue and they try and do
dramatic stuff LG had these beautifully
day lit rooms it was great but they
still found a way to make it dark by
bringing shades down over all the
windows so I'm just addressing a couple
comments in this last hands-on video for
the g3 which called at the low frame
rate and the reason for that is I had to
open the aperture so damn why to my
camera to allow enough light in that the
frame rate just dropped through the
basement there's nothing I can do about
it you know I accept I'm kidding I'm
lying to your face there is something I
could have done about it I could have
been smart and gone outside but I'm not
Daniel good call there brother thank you
sir let's get back to the phone as you
suggest so I am interested Steven before
we steamroll over you completely like
from a from a foreign persons
perspective and by that I mean someone
who wasn't at the event what you know
what were your feelings on the phone
after seeing all the live coverage you
know the actual the presentation itself
I don't think I was quite as enamored as
as you were with how LG pulled it off I
mean it was it seemed a little dry
almost they I'd River them washed
through I'm one of those few people who
enjoys the spectacle of that Samsung has
been known to bring in the past I don't
mind the a tricks and all that and I
think for the features at least it makes
me pay more attention to them and I know
that the LG was trying to emphasize the
simplicity of the g3 how it's not all
about these gimmicks and whatnot but
how many times did they say simple in
the presentation oh oh my god man who
just get Achilles feet over the head
with that theme I wanted to send some
snarky tweets but I was too busy taking
notes and you were too busy live
blogging then but so like at the at the
end of the day Stephen when you had been
presented with all of these facts and as
I say it was a very dense presentation
you know what was your take on the on
the device where you do were you
impressed I mean I like it it's at this
point seeing as many phones as I have
it's hard you really you know blow me
away it's it's what I thought it would
be it seems incredibly solid um I'm
still not sure that the public's gonna
respond to it in quite the way that LG
is hoping I'm worried that it's still
gonna look a little big compared to and
I know we saw your your your comparison
video I think we're gonna talk about
that later Arison yeah yeah talk about
it now it's fine yeah I just sighs
relative yeah I still think that it's
pushing the limits of what people are
gonna be comfortable with and well you
know I'm worried about that but the
design I like I think okie you know made
a lot of smart improvements over the g2
and that's impressive considering and we
were saying earlier about how he likes
to take a few months and respond to what
Samsung did this year they you know push
the launch up significantly compared to
the past yeah so there's been less time
to you know see what Samsung's done and
learn from that so this is more LG
taking initiative and I like that and
taking notes on feedback from the g2 I
think yeah because I you know we saw a
lot of stuff solved here in both
hardware and software of going from the
g2 to the g3 but i'm going to say you
know I don't think the size Gulf is too
big here between the g3 and the galaxy
s5 and i think that the added aesthetic
punch that the g3 brings is actually
really going to you know it is going to
serve it well because you look at the s5
next to the g3 and it's just it's sort
of like it's sort of like one of them is
a like a demo model or like a ruler like
reference hardware and the other one is
the finished product like the galaxy s5
is so unremarkable by itself that when
you put the g3 next we like oh well I
know which one I would pick if I'm
looking if I'm shopping on looks right
and
you know the the 2k display certainly
helps with that by the way it is it is
2k right yeah like it's actually
officially to I was counting the pixels
and then the run down in the spec stuff
and I was like wait a minute because we
got 4k cameras and 2k displays and I'm
picturing you hunched over your desk one
of those magnifying lenses on it up like
a swing arm like 120 yeah yeah it's like
tethered to my headband yeah no it's um
so I think that it's definitely has the
aesthetic edge over the s5 but I'm
interested in that conversation because
I think for all the great stuff HTC did
with the One m8 it's the the real
important comparison is g 3 vs s5 and I
wonder what your thoughts are Daniel on
on how this is going to do relative to
that because it builds on a rather solid
foundation with the g2 but i don't think
the g2 did do well in sales well it
certainly did better than the HTC one m7
I mean yeah I think a lot of phones dead
right most phones did but LG is still a
comparatively more successful
manufacturer of android phones than sony
we know that we know that it sells what
is it 15 to 20 million smartphones a
year most of which are probably low-end
devices for developing countries but
still they they have a much higher
budget for sales than most other
companies because they are one of those
tables there this huge South Korean
company that has their hands and
everything sure I think that for for
their purposes the LG g3 is just another
showcase of all the vertical vertically
integrated portions of LG as a company I
mean hoeing an LG chemical for you know
for their battery under its know which
is always amazing I mean you were
telling me that the g flex has the best
battery life of any phone you've ever
used which doesn't surprise me Tom using
the screens are always better they
always have an amazing relationship with
Qualcomm which is something that you
can't I mean even though Qualcomm has a
great relationship with every OEM in the
day of you know they're best friends
with with the carrier with the
that they're working with obviously but
I think in particular they work with HD
with the LG quite closely you know it's
interesting you mentioned Qualcomm there
because it seems like one of the big
complaints that I saw from as we were
getting all the rumors leading up to the
key 3 launch a lot of people were upset
that we got this 801 rather than 805 yes
the height of absurdity to me well you'd
have to find something to complain about
right no but the 805 the 805 is may not
ever actually come to market it doesn't
seem that yet but it's a very very
iterative purpose it's a purpose based
chip it's meant for 4k type devices so
we're we're probably not gonna see it in
any substantive form in smartphones I
don't think I think that they're gonna
jump over the 805 and go straight to a
10 the attack yeah because that's the
857 base in a 53 based chips that will
usher in the 64-bit you know android you
know revolution so to speak don't it'll
would show nobody cares about really I
don't think anybody's proven that
anybody gives a damn about 64 bit but no
not if not unless it actually improves
performance but I think in terms of
aesthetics LG has a far better handle on
things than Samsung because Samsung has
a need to maintain the status quo they
have this galaxy design that is so old
now it's so ugly but they have to do it
because that's the most recognizable
Android brand out there LG has more room
to work with yeah I guess so but do you
you don't think that Samsung could could
change it up I don't want to change the
discussion make it about samsung but I'm
just saying I don't think they have to
stick with that design I think they
choose to because it's a very safe bet
but I think they could they could be
bolder than they have been and when we
might we might see that going forward
but I'm you know I I agree that that
these LG phone the flagships tend to be
a showcase for all the different parts
of LG it's a really good way to look at
it but I have to say that the g2 went in
your hands on when you were holding it
up next to the thing I think this thing
really destroys the g2 in terms of its
fit and finish its feel in the hand it's
its appearance and to say
nothing respects me in specs that's
guaranteed but what would certainly hope
so right well yes but we don't you know
we don't see that on the Samsung side
right it's like I the s4 is basically
the the s3 except more boring Oh the s5
is like an s4 with greater capabilities
but the thing you know and whereas LG
has actually taken the feedback on the
particularly in the aesthetic side and
said all right we're going to make this
better looking I I just love the
confluence here of the I wish it was a
real metal on the back but they've got a
matte finish over it not glossy so it
doesn't feel like the tacky nonsense
plastic of the g2 which I always hated
and this thing looks like it was made to
last were it looks like it was made to
to be looked at and to have people say
wow what is that whereas the g2 kind of
just faded into the background and was
not remarkable mm that aside I want to
ask one more thing about hardware and
then one talk about software do you
think it was a mistake to sacrifice the
water resistance that would have made it
truly you know stand on the same deck as
the s5 anybody can answer that it's a
general question or do you think don't
know don't care I think it got to the
point so quickly where waterproofing
became ubiquitous that we already
stopped caring about it like when it was
just on you know maybe you know one or
two phones oh honey that's a neat
feature and now everyone has it we
should have expected it but at the same
time we're not even though you know the
gs5 is waterproof I don't think that
most users are going and you're throwing
it are using it for underwater
photography or crap like that I think
we've already sort of moved past it if
it's there it's nice if it's not we're
not gonna complain about it we're just
going to be a little more careful with
our homes no no you know I was out in
public using the galaxy s5 shortly after
it launched and I was like dropping it
in lakes and stuff and I like to do this
stuff in public because you know
whatever it's a lot of fun and people
were stunned at what I was doing like I
mean just passers-by on the sidewalk
were like a detected strap his phone and
like it's okay it's waterproof and
they're like like their heads explode
and this happened more than once and
that you know this is a population that
is not you know I'm not I'm not living
with it with a bunch of bumpkins like
this isn't an intelligent engaged
populace being like I never knew that
wow really so it most of them have
iphones though uh it's Boston so pretty
much everybody has an iphone yeah I'm
like I'm an ivory tower up here you know
I'll pish-posh know so many of these
markets have long said waterproofing now
no one yeah exactly well that's what I
mean it was it was a nice shot of
perspective to as a reminder that you
know we really exist in a very hyper
aware bubble within the greater world so
i don't know i think i think that
waterproofing thing and that said I
don't think Samsung is necessarily
leveraging that in its advertisements
very much yet and that's why a lot of
people were surprised so maybe that
speaks in favor of LG's decision here
maybe LG is like you know we don't think
a lot of people are basing their buying
decision on that so we're going to go
ahead and make this thinner and lighter
instead and they didn't I mean it's
eight point nine millimeters it's the
same width it's the same thickness as
the as the g2 what what's so interesting
to me though then our you're right I'm
sorry is that if they if they really
wanted to make it waterproof they
wouldn't have added a removable backing
and removable battery because Samsung
made the very difficult decision of
putting a tab over its USB port in order
to prevent water from coming in which is
probably the most annoying tab I've ever
used in my life and I hate charging the
gs5 for that reason I mean I just let it
die I'd rather let it die hard it so
there's no I think this you as me but
the feline over USB flaps has always
escaped me I've never had a problem
maybe it's blows eat them well me I know
everyone does with me and maybe it's
because I was a nextel phone carrier
forever and they always had flaps over
their ports to prevent dust and all this
crap from getting I always thought there
was smart idea so I've always been used
to them but apparently I'm the only one
so I understand anyway what you're
talking about but yeah you think that
would have impacted it pretty severely
you think you would be hating on the g3
a lot more if it had had the flaps
necessitated by a waterproof rating well
no I just think that it would have
interrupted that aesthetic that LG's
trying so hard that smooth sort of
pebble like finish the soft curves the
you know if it you know chamfered edges
if it has that sort of thing I don't
even know what that that that term means
everybody throws it around
I'm the chamfered edge I've a chance to
talk about chamfered edges how's your
chapters today oh they're so edgy ya
know I like to back when the one m7
launched in the iphone 5 2 we were like
oh yeah how was it what are synonyms for
chamfered Oh bevel bevel that's what
will you that'll be yeah exactly yeah um
I don't know I just think that the g3
looks a lot better than most phones out
there except for the m8 but I mean as we
know ma doesn't necessarily sell on the
virtue of its aesthetic so you know what
else you know you have to have something
else right well and I think I i think
the m8 is probably selling a lot better
it's already it's definitely selling a
lot better than the m7 did already I
believe I don't have the link to back
that up like citation needed but i think
it's easily set as much i think yeah
yeah so you know but i agree I you know
and that's why I say so maybe that's an
interesting comparison for for another
day i'm really looking forward to
getting this thing in the review booth
by the way we don't have one yet which
is why we haven't had videos up yet but
very soon we're getting one so it's
gonna be interesting to do that
comparison versus the 18 I just continue
to be much more fascinated by how this
is going to play against the s5 the kind
of raining contender in the space and I
think it's going to do better than the
one I made because we saw those
commercials we saw the at first I
thought they were maybe just for us they
were just for the announcement but no LG
is going to use those in broadcast I
think and they're really effective
they're like here's it got you know an
upbeat tips to like tempo they've got a
kind of not annoying music but it makes
you pay attention and they're like 15
second spot so like here's how to use a
feature on the g3 you know and then
there's like a one the answer is one
sentence it's like do this done you know
it's quick it's light its it has a
little bit of a smirk to it but it's
also accurate because they did simplify
a lot of a lot of the experience so if
they can use those effectively I think
they have a good marketing campaign on
their hands go ahead too yeah I think
there's a solid chance that the the g3
will outperform the One m8 when it comes
to retail sales but at the same time I
don't think it's going to make much of a
dent in the interest in the galaxy s5 I
guess it depends on how serious LG is
about
right i mean do you mentioned before
Daniel that LG is a is a massive Empire
they have their fingers and a lot of
pies from refrigerators to TVs to
washing machines how serious is LG's
mobile division about making a huge dent
here obviously they're not this isn't
just a hobby I mean this is a 2k screen
they've got some great specs in this
thing to have a frickin laser mm-hmm you
know a glad questions about that laser
we talk about that some point shall we
talk about the laser well again the
laser is a good example of the device
it's a technology that LG developed for
one of their roomba competitors that
never got used and you know this is a
company that makes freaking robotic
vacuum cleaners that they just throw
away features though we don't need that
we have another laser-type technology
that we can use let's put it on our
smartphone you know it's like this is
this is something that you know the g
flex is a prime example of an experiment
that they decided to make appropriate to
a product in that should not have even
though it has its virtues the g flex is
not a finished product by any means it
is not i agree with you so I was too
effusive in my review I think I scored
it a little high but because but I I
truly was in love with it because I
using it does feel like holding a slice
of the future you got hit by the dazzle
I did I did even even if it is a little
bit on the on the prototype east side in
all the ways that we've already covered
but i will tell you that i was using the
g flex at this launch because i knew i
was going to compare it with the g3 just
quickly so I was like why don't I pop
the sim in the g flex and use that and
also the battery was excellent so i mean
i'm riding in an elevator after the
event and I've got my like LG tag on or
whatever and these two guys hotel member
staff members are in the hotel in the
elevator with me they're just staring at
my phone and I'm used to this with the g
flex because it does catch your eye with
the curve but they're like oh is that
the look it's curve did it come that way
I'm like yeah I didn't bend it like it
came came curve and like oh yeah that's
uh I've heard about that that's from
Samsung right haha and I'm like wearing
the LG tag and the other guys like no
dude like you points it as like oh sorry
it just seems like everything comes from
Samsung I'm like yeah I think that's the
that's the uphill battle it seems like
vs apple right right exactly
so I think they have a story problem
there that but I'm sorry I didn't mean
to hijack your point about the g flex
but no no I mean what the only thing the
only reason I bring it up the g flex is
Rogers is one of the biggest carriers
and candidates though it has nine
million customers it's probably the most
well-known and when 9 million will we
only have 30 million people here so 9
million is if you can ask what the
population of Canada but wow I didn't
know they're the only 30 million people
in Canada that's Chris right so when you
look at Rogers homepage you have three
phones on their feature devices you have
number one the LG G flex because it's an
exclusive you have the HTC One m8 and
you have the galaxy s5 but the LG G flex
is being pushed as hard or harder than
the other two devices in their stores
because obviously it's an exclusive but
because they also agree with you it is a
slice of the future and I think that
that mean you you cannot kid yourself
for a second better devices don't
necessarily sell better it's due to the
carrier if the carrie wants to push a
certain product they're going to do so
and that's how samsung initially became
successful is that they teamed up with
carriers on exclusives if you remember
the first generation galaxy s phones
they were all different on every single
US carrier made a different variant
different cousins to I'm the difference
well thank God we have today's those
different or whatever yeah yeah yeah
exactly epic and they did that in order
to appease the carriers to sell them in
prime spots in their carrier stores yeah
and once Samsung got big enough than
they once the gs3 came out they didn't
need to do that anymore but LG's in that
same position last year they created a
special version just for verizon with
new buttons on the back and with
wireless charging because verizon wanted
to differentiate themselves and this
year they didn't do that why because it
needs ooh that's true yeah you know
they're they're building themselves up
in the same way that that Apple and
Samsung before them have done no I agree
with that I think that's a favorable
change certainly but carrier interest
here in the US seem remarkable
strong the day of the launch we got
announcements from all for the big guys
saying that they'd be carrying this guy
at some point we don't always see that
when a high-profile phone launches how's
the interest I mean in Canada are there
are they carry are similarly really
excited for the g3 to arrive we have not
heard a peep I we were to god there's no
not a single carrier has told us that
they're carrying it yet we know because
a leaked product code came out that is
coming out in rogers and bell but and
it'll probably come out in rogers bell
and telus which are the three big
carrier there's no official
announcements yet nothing yet no well
well yeah we got some some leaks on
pricing which we're gonna talk briefly
about in a second here too so that is
interesting though how different at
different countries carriers handle the
thing and you know i will say that not
it's not always the case that a carrier
pushing a handset will will result in
massive sales i mean we've saw eight
we've seen eighteen t throw their weight
behind the Lumia line more than once and
i don't really think that's worked out
you know terribly well certainly it was
it was a favorable impact but i don't
think it was significant it continues to
tickle me how at least on the television
shows i watch everyone's using a Lumia
handset this is not reflecting reality
brother placement is crazy although the
unengaged illa the there's the g flex in
there with a big ol LG logo oh yeah i
love that the logos and product
placement devices are like six times the
size of the the actual weapons did you
do either of you watch justified as a
girlf yeah so did you notice did you
notice that in every season up till now
everybody uses a flip phone or a
blackberry but all of a sudden in this
past season everybody in the show uses a
sony xperia awesome even even the bad
guys use Sony Xperia folks i spaced that
i'm gonna to pay attention to what about
Captain America to like they were all
HTC phones but they were different
generations depending on whether you
were good or bad like if you were you
used an old school one x+ or whatever
and then if you were bad you used to m8
or something and then you've got but
that's another example speaking of HTC
this another example to carry are
pushing a phone and I'm not
it's doing it any favors Sprint's
commercials for the Harman Kardon
addition when I made our effing
ridiculous I have not seen these you are
you lucky count yourself among the lucky
few who've not been exposed to these
monstrosities do yourself a favor if you
want to like blow your mind go just
YouTube it's just google like sprint
Harman Kardon commercial and feel your
brain ooze out of your ears as it tries
to get away nonsense so I you know
carrier secure endorsements or a missing
mixed bag sometimes let's let's talk
about the software in the g3 before we
sort of move into two other stuff
because this was a big complaint that I
had on the g2 which was ugly software
that LG had somehow made even more
complicated than it was on on the galaxy
s4 do you remember the notification
shade on the g2 like you'd drag it down
and you had to permanent sliders one for
brightness and one for like system
volume oh my sounds good I'm constantly
having to dig through menus to adjust
brightness when it's too right for me to
see any let me too bright outside I have
no probably want that persistent
brightness I have no problem with the
brightness slider but why is there a
persistent volume slider when I have a
volume key because the vine keys are on
the back okay yes that makes a degree of
sense to show you where the volume is
currently yeah I don't need to see that
all the time but the thing is there was
a shortcut right next to the volume
slider that looked a lot like the
settings cog which is normally next to
the brightness like so I'm always
tapping this thing and then I get the
volume that it was just a software was a
mess that's a bad one example of a
complete just an utter dumpster fire in
terms of software and I hated it and it
looks like this year they've well
simplified it but I'm seeing that in the
comments on our hands on that a lot of
people still don't like the software and
I think I might be one of them because I
eat while it is simpler yes I think it's
also quite mad they have this beautiful
2k display and yet LG has chosen these
colors that are really kind of dull and
don't stand out at all and there's no
way to select colors that do but Michael
they're mature
good point yeah LG's pitch on this if
you didn't watch the livestream was that
like we didn't want you know elementary
youthful you know young people colors
like primary colors and what they didn't
call it amateurish they call it like it
was immature or something like that they
just totally dismissed these neon
pallets of the zoo instead of candy
packaging it looks like tissue packaging
exactly yeah it's so i don't know i'm
not entirely sold on that in it kind of
makes using the phone dreary yes things
are flattened yes there are more
circular elements which I actually like
I think that's kind of the style of the
years to do circular widgets and stuff
but I'm not sold on the colors and I
think that was a misuse of that is a
misuse of this gorgeous display do you
agree am I making too big a deal out of
this guy's or do you agree well go ahead
Steven I know I don't have very strong
feelings about the softer on this not
having interacted with it nor with the
g2 so I'm of observer here what do you
think you've used this guy sound like
you've got out of you got something
brewing there Daniel okay i think the g2
was the worst software i've ever seen on
an android phone in my life I hated it
with a passion of a half of a thousand
Soren's but nice the g3 is it's better
but it's not the LG clearly does not
understand software engineering they
don't understand I mean they tout its
simplicity but as you said this is not
simple software this is better it's
better because it's not it doesn't get
in your way as much for example they
change the stupid virtual menu button
stupid virtual menu button to align
themselves with Google now so they at
least have that going for them but they
don't it the software doesn't seem like
it overpowers you in the same way but
it's still very samsung ask in the sense
that it wants to do everything for you
android is so good now it doesn't need
to do everything for you it's the reason
that I pick up my Moto X more often than
I pick up my gs5 mmm-hmm that's a good
point I even using my moto x
while and I miss it because of those
baked in features that are so good in
stock Android and the motor oil
enhancements but with LG you have this
skin that is aping functionality that's
already there like you have google now
on the device which is supposed to
anticipate your needs and throw
information at you before you ask for it
yet LG has built in this completely
separate thing what is it called quick
smart or something you aren't notice
yeah which does the same thing except it
has a different aesthetic I don't know
I'm over using that word today but I
don't care that like it accordions down
and it gives you the basically the same
stuff I mean why didn't we just had that
article talking about all the things we
wanted in Google now that weren't there
and I think we're getting some of that
with this og system it's you know it's
augmenting Google now rather than
replacing it yeah but you're still using
you like you have to go to two places
the information that you didn't ask for
it's not elegant by any means yeah I I
just don't I don't like redundancy when
it's not done right it's similar to how
Samsung and LG and actually a lot of OEM
just build a separate app well Google
alternative is already there just
there's an app stores or separate app
stores yeah yeah at least they're not
doing that yeah if you're gonna
duplicate something do it better and I'm
not prepared to say that LG doesn't do
it better than google now however I
gotta be honest with you guys I don't
think that LG is gonna do it better than
google now and I think this is one of
those things that's gonna hang around
for a generation maybe no one's gonna
use it and then it's gonna go away I
really love what LG is doing with the
telling you things about the phone and
this has been my my complaint about now
and the features it lacks there's not
enough tight integration with the phone
hardware itself and I just heard you
know the one feature how it can let you
know when you're running low on storage
space that's a huge problem for me I
never know where I am until the phone
starts yelling at me get him down to
like 100 megabytes left that's a good
point this is something that I would
expect now to be doing and if Google's
not going to step up to that LG by all
means please show them how it's done
that's just right but then then LG's not
not telling you that it's only going to
be notifying you on harbor issues so
Google now is more of a platform in the
sense that
it it provides your context-based needs
for kind of your wider life so weather
and travel and you know things that
you're looking up like search results
and stuff like that I mean it doesn't
really dig too deep into you into your
local life your local phone your your
phone storage your temperature or
whatever like that's LG's place to to
give you that information I agree with
Michael though if it starts getting in
the way of google now if you start
getting notifications on travel and you
know search results and stuff on from
both smart notice and google now then
i'll have a major issue with it i think
it's going to be critical how how LG
handles that that particular degree of
overlap but that's that's not the only
thing they introduced i'm kind of
looking at the list because i can't
remember they did hit on a couple things
what were the other two big features
they were calling out in the software
the keyboard account keyboard oh my god
the keyboard this is that i can't
believe i forgot this was one of my
favorite things they did someone out
there will correct me and I welcome it
because I would like to know but I've
never seen a keyboard that can be
dynamically resized like this where you
can just drag it up to whatever degree
you want and it'll resize to whatever
footprint you just selected like some
keyboards will go small and large or
they'll have detent for small medium
large whatever but this one you can make
it almost literally whatever size you
want without getting absurd and using
the whole vertical space the screen so i
mean i think that's amazing I think
they're the there's also the cursor
placement where you press and hold on
the spacebar and you can move the cursor
around very similar to the go-ahead that
no that's awesome like one of my biggest
complaints about the google keyboard is
how awful cursor control is and if
you're trying to edit any text its oh
yeah laying in the ass any time a press
and hold action is required to do
something i get really annoyed and
especially if it's text composition
which I usually like to be a very fast
thing so yeah having that built in there
I'm going to use my webos mentioned for
the podcast and say like I haven't seen
a smart integrate implementation of a
cursor control like that since the pre
we had that gesture area and you can
move them around so that was wonderful
and then what was the other one you can
didn't this just outright Steve
the blackberry flick stuff yes it was
pretty blatant you were sitting next to
me they announced that thing and you
were like oh come on well I mean as a
Canadian you kind of have a little bit
of national who's got to feel brighter
for blackberry I understand but not that
bad but but but blackberry partnered
with uh with somebody on that I always
forget the keyboard vendor they
partnered with cuz they kept with Yuki
was that swiftkey yeah yeah but so did
Samsung I mean even Samsung's built-in
keyboards pretty crappy even though it
has swiftkey in it gosh yet is there bad
because he's like when a company can't
properly translate the text in a dialog
box into English you know they're not
gonna do a good job on the keyboard and
that's always the case although right
now as soon as the reigning the reigning
bad actor and that in that regard but
we'll talk about that later so yeah the
keyboard is just a I think it might be a
home run and and it it learns your what
was what sides of the keys you favor as
I recall too right and they showed that
map up there where it was like the
software learns where you know if you
tend to like hit the outside of the f
key some other third party ones have
done that but it's still it's neat that
we're seeing this from an oem yeah
because as I said like on the last show
I think you know these out of box
implementations are important yes the
beauty of android is you can customize
it but it's very important for out of
box things to work very well and I think
the keyboard is critical and a lot of
people have gotten it wrong this is
gonna be sweet I'm very much looking
forward to using the keyboard on this
device at length I'm just looking at the
the presentation screencaps now how many
colors is this thing come again 55 I
think it's five ya allah did they have
like exciting the of course they have
exciting names for them but i can't
Steven you didn't put them in the news
post Aiden you didn't give proper
coverage to the you know flower violet
and you know it's like an adjustable
blame ya what are we missing in the
software gentlemen before we I know we
wanted to talk about the camera a little
bit I want to talk about my favorite
accessory ever but I want to ask I'm
curious you know what I'm talking about
did I don't because you've expressed
affinity for both that weird headphone
horseshoe and the circus listen the
tones came to me in a moment of need
says have we had a podcast since we did
we make front of the town's last week
Stephen where you here I know I wasn't
aware of them and then we learned about
it over the weekend because we missed
that announcement on Thursday yeah the
LG tone I don't remember his last
episode or the one before I'm sorry
everyone there just kind of bleed
together but we were making fun of the
LG tones really hard because Taylor had
some friends who wore them all the time
and I just thought they made everyone
look like an idiot and then LG of course
gives us LG tones in the gift and this
is in the swag bags from this event I
didn't realize we're talking about yeah
are the the earbuds on that today like
are they retracted do you pull on them
and they come back up into the horseshoe
or be so smart but no no I saw something
that made me think that L magnitude they
do plug into the bottom though don't
they oh I just learned that Thank You
Steven I didn't know why there were gaps
in the bottom of the horseshoe and now
and I don't read the instruction manual
so Daniel you apparently knew that I
didn't I mean I didn't read the
instruction manual good I'd like you
have confidence yeah they teach us that
schools not sure about on the US area
it's not covered in the Common Core no
so the anyway we just I just think that
tones are one of the oddest and kind of
ugliest-looking accessories out there so
we made fun of them a lot unless show
but when I had to do that hang out on
the street and I had forgotten my
earbuds Steve do but the tones saved
that entire editorial round table it
saved us the never-ending barrage of
comments we got in the HTC One m8 round
table where nobody can hear me because I
was using a non device speaker and mic
so anyway I immediately fell in love
with the tones because they saved my
butt but then I continued to use them
and despite some kind of crappy
Bluetooth reception ability I think
they're great if you put your phone in
your back pocket they will not be able
to talk to your phone but what yeah
agreed yes uh so that those the LG tones
I don't know why we started talking
about that lets someone take favorite
accessories yeah oh no god yes no so
those are my favorite accessories the
quick circle case got there
oh my god Daniel did you play with one I
didn't uh-huh ah you missed out I know I
didn't it I give her less about cases
let me tell you what you are wrong you
are one hundred percent because the
quick circle case makes that phone at
least seven percent more enjoyable to
use oh my god you close it and first of
all you get a nice preview of what the
Moto 360 is probably gonna look like
first of all because they have all these
little rock faces that kind of play
behind the window there but ever you've
got all these shortcuts that kind of
look cool and in addition you're not
always going to be confined to like the
existing shortcuts which is like LG
music player and who cares and you know
no pattern you can customize them right
you can but you well they're going to
release the SDK so if developers want to
write stuff and I really hope they do
and it's going to depend on how well the
g3 cells i guess and chicken and egg and
whatever but you're going to be able to
do other stuff inside that window i love
all i want is a rotary dial widget know
some of you notice makes my day one of
the first five thing yeah yeah yeah
actually i really want that now more
like a combination lock for unlocking
the phone oh that would be sweet iron
why don't you have a development house
weren't you know that's right it's call
ah well you know it's i made the point
in the hands on where i was like the the
a flip cover for the s4 or now the S
view cover for the s4 really made me
enjoy using that device more because
actually brought something else the
experience I could use the phone it was
almost like faking a different form
factor so for those of us who are
novelty obsessed and I'm happy to admit
that because I'm that makes me like most
of the world I think it really breathes
a little bit of new life into your phone
and the this thing the quick circle case
is just so much more interesting it's a
much more stylish implementation it's a
lot of fun so I recommend Daniel and you
get your hands on one because we know
how much it is I don't care it can be a
hundred bucks head by no okay i'm
getting i did rip the SVU case for being
70 bucks so I I don't know how much it
is do we do we get word on that because
we don't have pricing info of the g3 yet
Steven you want to talk about that when
we have some gay
at least what do they say yeah well so a
couple of these us so all the US
carriers have said the big ones have
said we're going to get this guy they
mentioned summer as far as availability
we don't have you know a month in
particular yet but a few of them have
these contests going now or they're
giving away a whole bunch of g3s in
advance I think t-mobile is calling them
beta phones I mean there these are
production models at this point it's not
like we're going to get another revision
of the hardware before the retail sales
begin but because it's a contest you
have to have all of these rules you know
the lawyers have to prove everything and
you know buried down there in the
details you have to explain what the
prizes are and what they're worth so
we're kind of getting it may not be
exact we're getting a a ver adrene value
t-mobile saying that their g3 is worth
650 dollars which sounds about right for
black ship like this because the weird
thing though is that sprint says that
its g3 is only worth six hundred dollars
so there's some theorizing that the
difference in price there might be ones
the two gigabyte RAM what's a three
gigabyte RAM I'm not convinced but I
think we're definitely looking at a
price around 625 650 in the US that's we
who knows what its gonna be on contract
I'm two hundred probably I doubt they
can do 300 with this guy even with the
2k display but no I see I disagree with
you I actually don't think that the
north american market is gonna see that
two gigabyte 16 gigabyte variant no I
would either expected it to I yeah I
just I think that they're gonna keep
that for for the like Chinese South
Korea Chinese sort of developing markets
that you know where they can charge 500
for it i just i don't i don't see them
offering to it's already it would
consume really not all know what
happened yeah exactly that's that's what
I was gonna say I just think that the US
customers are a little paranoid now
because no we saw with the gs5 last year
we get the the first one and then a
couple months later south korea gets the
fancy snapdragon 800 version
we're getting a little paranoid about
not getting the best out there yeah well
then that was started thanks to Samsung
splitting it between the the X and O's
like the octa remember that yeah and
then the end the the Qualcomm turned out
the Qualcomm one perform better at least
in my testing well yeah so I don't know
none of that pricing really surprises me
I think it will be a little a little
annoying if if we if certain carriers
here don't get both versions but I think
that is a likelihood I thought it was an
interesting choice of LG as a final
hardware point to slave the ram with the
with the storage options because that's
computer right like 16 gig gets you two
gigs of RAM and 32 gig gets you three
gigs of RAM is that correct yeah yeah
that's it's weird but um alright you
know I don't know I've never I don't
think I've really ever been hurting for
RAM on an android phone right at least
not in a while you know I don't
generally juggle like asphalt 8 and the
full office suite or the foot you know
whatever the equivalent is and you know
like sky gamblers air supremacy like I
don't do that i do one big thing at a
time so i don't know why i need a ton of
same time ram costs nothing I mean it's
like a five dollar different in
component costs when we're looking at
two gigabytes first enough I mean ten
dollars but it's sure been something
across millions of devices though I mean
you know that's a consideration or you
know anyway I wanted to keep the g3
condition confined to about a half hour
we're at the 48th minute but I think
keep it going I would like to wrap it up
a little bit I think there's a couple
things we missed lasers yeah the laser
thing the camera thing let's just touch
on that very quickly I'm confused about
this laser you guys have seen this thing
maybe you can clear this up for me yeah
so because are you confused like dude
are you asking does it shoot a beam of
light out that hurts other people no no
I had gone into this thinking it would
be like the focus assist i have on one
of my standalone cameras where it uses
you know a lens or diffraction grating
it projects a pattern out and infrared
it seizes with the camera and then based
on it can you quickly adjust the focus
of the camera when the pattern pops into
focus then it knows it's focused from
the presentation though I got the
impression this was working like a light
argh
where it wasn't shooting at a pattern it
was just a beam of light and then it
records the distance takes the being
around trip travel back to the sensor is
that what it's doing here is doing the
pattern thing no I believe it's I
believe it combines phase what does it
face something autofocus phase detection
oh that's what most phones use right
right so it combines that that's kind of
like the the standard and then it it
does the distance based laser whatever
like it ty it's basically it measures
the time that that laser takes to come
back and and you don't know how far it
is you don't haven't have an infrared
sensitive camera that you could check
this with do you I don't oh I depend
night vision goggles that would be uh oh
no I put them in storage mo no that
would be great i would love to see if
you would if you're talking about seeing
the the visible beam and a certain using
a certain wavelength about yeah i'll be
great but this is just an academic
concerning a port because that it
whether or not it actually improves the
oven bogus speed and how it does the
real thing it does i cook a couple shots
of the g flex using the g3 and I mean
she go it was very quick to focus i mean
it knew exactly what i wanted to do and
it took that shot very quickly did you
take any sample shots Daniel yeah I did
I thought it focused quickly but I
didn't think that it's improvements over
the gs5 and the HTC want to make were
substantial enough to claim you know
that we are the fastest autofocus camera
smartphone on the market like it's a
matter of 25 milliseconds at most I mean
those are under ideal light conditions
to excellent well what I mean do you
remember anything about the camera app
launch time though because i don't know
i didn't actually measure that not yet
me there i am and either yet you know
because that's the important thing the
pocket to picture time is important and
all of that factors into it the camera
launch time the autofocus the snap and
you know they said something about
shutter speed as well I think this
enabled everyone's doing faster shutter
speed now so I'm sure that this is part
of the club so I think all of that
together might result in faster pocket
to picture time but
we won't know until we actually get the
thing in our pockets but there's also
enhanced optical image stabilization
we're in a in a year where manufacturers
are still shrugging off Oh is if they
did before or actively like dismissing
it like HTC HTC is done in favor of the
duo camera which I didn't which is a
move I didn't think was a very smart
idea you have LG saying no OS is still
cool and also we're enhancing it what is
the enhancement do you remember it's a
very minor one between 0 is NOS plus
right I I don't even know I feel like
there was 20 something better and I'm
just 20 times better or yeah it there I
can't see it I'm kind of looking at the
the spec sheet here on a couple
different things and I don't know if
it's better hardware who the actual
component or if it's just being you know
faster and its response time to no
changes in the light position I yeah
it's unclear what they changed exactly
so if I said it's better you know I
think that the overall phone is bigger
so the part of the OS module is probably
a little bit bigger which makes it it
kind of stabilizes it faster if you had
if you can you know think of it like
that but I also think that o is is
necessary because they didn't actually
enlarge the aperture at all they kept
the accurate at F 2.4 which is smaller
than pretty much every other phone on
the market right now we're used to
seeing him around too yeah and which is
disappointing from the from our original
news post its it's vague but at least
it's something oh I asked it's an
upgrade from previous LG designs now
compensating for even rougher handling
so that appears to be the change here I
mean it's I don't know how they're doing
it mechanically but it seems like you
can maybe shake this thing a little
harder right which is good because you
know I i have to say that though i am
impressed with the fluidity that OS
offers in the viewfinder in the you know
kind of it makes the experience of
shooting a little bit smoother and
better sony is doing the same thing
basically the software and when i'm
really interested in is being on a boat
or on a train or another moving platform
and in the camera compensating for that
because right now I still see motion
blur
even the best o is Riggs like the the
one m7 and the Lumia 1020's that's funny
yeah so anyway by the way I still have
the 1020 somewhere it's my daily driver
but I haven't used a daily driver in
months for those who I I still
technically carry that in moto x and
lumia 1020 let's wrap it up on the g3 I
know we've got to get Daniel out of here
in just a few minutes before you go
Daniel because Steven will be sticking
with me I would like to ask you for for
your thoughts on the on the g3 I know we
don't have a review units yet but I know
and I know we sort of kicked off the
show with with general thoughts but do
you think this is going to be the
blockbuster hit that LG wants or is it
just going to be the g2 redux this year
it is the LG g2 redux I I think that
it'll probably sell twenty to
twenty-five percent better just like the
g2 sold twenty to twenty-five percent
better than the optimus G or maybe maybe
it that one sold probably more but i
really i think that LG does have an
issue competing with samsung i just
think that people think of LG as an
also-ran version of samsung and despite
the phone being as i said a better in my
opinion probably a better device overall
even though it doesn't have this
probably doesn't have as good a camera
or doesn't have what waterproofing I
still think that the aesthetics the
screen resolution I actually and I may
regret saying this I actually think I
like the software better on the g3 than
the gs5 I'm sorry don't hurt me minutes
yeah I just I'm looking forward to
playing with it i only got about ten
minutes with it and it was the korean
version so it didn't have a lot of the
us or canadian software tweaks on it yet
but i'm very excited about this phone
well i think you are certainly not alone
in that I join you in that excitement
and we we will be getting our hands on a
unit again shortly so let's revisit this
conversation in the form of a review
then you can find that at pocket now
when it goes up but you can also find
one I'm sure eventually at mobile syrup
Daniel tell everybody where they can
find you over there and end elsewhere on
the Internet
uh I am at journey Dan like journey man
with a D on Twitter and it just goes
cyracom last time you were on the show I
got the mobiles here yeah you are slow
to respond to these men journey dan and
journeyman I didn't well look at that I
can be dumb sometimes mobile syrup calm
journey dan on Twitter Daniel Bader you
are a gem for coming on the show thank
you for your time it is always great to
have you thank you so much for having me
starting to duck out early no worries
you enjoy hear the rest of your day and
enjoy your weekend you two guys thanks a
lot see you take care bye that was a
wonderful time folks we changed it up on
you a little bit we put the feature
first the feature quote-unquote we meant
to keep that g3 conversation a little
bit shorter but you know there's a lot
to talk about with that phone and it's
an interesting phone we have a lot to
say really is and I want to tell you
something a little more specific I just
got an email in the interim that
indicates that we that a g3 will be
coming our way very shortly so you'll be
able to cover that in the interim though
I have another device that I'm in the
midst of experiencing right now another
device that I got my hands on in New
York City on the same trip as the g3
this is the ax sous padfone x yes
finally making its appearance I have to
tell you that I did not know what to
expect listeners if you don't remember
what the PadFone is it's not the phone
pad it's not the big ol Nexus 7 with an
earpiece on it it's the convertible it
is the smartphone that if a 5-inch
smartphone that plugs into the back of a
tablet dock to become your tablet so
it's two devices in the same box and it
is finally being offered by AT&amp;amp;T many of
our European Indian and Asian and
African many of our non-us listeners are
wondering why the hell were making such
a big deal about this because like the
PadFone x was announced five months ago
what are you guys doing agency is the
only u.s. carrier to offer it and
they've just announced it it's something
is the
it's totally in the u.s. too isn't it
well the PadFone acts I believe so I
don't know that detail I just know we
saw it in Barcelona like vans ago and
we've been waiting for it and this is I
mean pad phones have been around for
years i think the were up to the third
generation is the third unit yeah then
the first gen had that crazy like VCR
door on the back were like it protected
the phone yes door on the back of the
tablet talk this is a somewhat more
efficient streamlined implementation
it's still pretty clunky when it's in
that in the doc but the phone is exposed
so that you can still shoot pictures
with its camera anyway the thing is yes
this is a Snapdragon 800 powered device
which is nice the software is not final
so it's buggy as anything and this is in
its going to get an update before
launches thankfully but through Jesus
yeah but the thing is it's not a
remarkable device I'm holding it right
now this is an audio only podcast
listener so you will have to imagine if
you will the most nondescript
rectangular black slab you ever saw in
your life for theirs there's almost
nothing special about it and that's
always been the problem with these pad
phones is there I mean just a one-trick
pony it's they plug into the tablet at
least with the PadFone X the specs are
pretty you know flagship level maybe a
mid last year flagship but still they're
up there cause it's just yeah i agree
but I've started to think of the phone
as like an entry-level flagship in
quotes okay you'd see that and the
reason for that is it's not a one-trick
pony anymore at least not the way AT&amp;amp;T
is positioning it because while the
retail price is still something like 549
I don't know oh yeah the on contract
that one contract you use on for a
two-year contract you get this thing
it's 199 yeah that's gonna be key to
whether or not this is accepted by
American smartphone users enough yeah
and never has just been affordable
before no and and i'm gonna i apologize
because i'm gonna maybe sound like a
commercial here but i mean i can't get
past that price point in my head i keep
thinking about i unboxed it so the
unboxing is that the link is in the show
notes you can look at you can watch the
unboxing and just kind of realize for a
second then when you open this box the
first thing that greets you as a tablet
the next thing that great shoe is a
phone and they knew of earbuds chargers
and whatever all of that is in this
same box you get you get a phone at a
tablet for 200 bucks and it's not like a
cheesy off-brand you know like right
right let's tablet it's like but at the
same time it's not really a tablet it's
just a dock so I'm having the most crazy
like brain explosion when I use this
thing because every time I use it i'm
i'm using it in tablet mode i'm
surprised when i'm not near a Wi-Fi
hotspot and it still works and i'm like
oh so my thought process is like oh yeah
that's right this tablet has a cellular
data connection oh wait no this is the
phone providing that and the phone is
fueling everything so you know when i'm
browsing on the phone and the browser
and i plug it into the back of the
tablet and the tablet screen comes on
and it it's what i was doing just a
second ago only bigger and it's just how
are the transitions there between when
you're when you were swapping the
plugging the phone into the tablet is
that isn't fast as it switches so that
that's a two part there are two answers
to that the first answer is it is about
three seconds for for transition it's a
little long well you know it I
understand that it has a lot to do so
I'm willing to forgive that and when you
use the ax sous apps like the calendar
the issues email app the browser the
transition is as close to seamless as I
think you can get it really flows quite
nicely to the point where Tony sent me
an email with an embedded spreadsheet
and it was I feel like I was in a
nurse's turn eighteen t commercial cuz I
I can't look at this on the phone is too
small that's how they all are it's like
one business guy wants to share this
presentation with the other guy let me
just show you this guy's like all our
pointing your eyes are bad I can't see
it on that small thing and there's like
let me show you let me pull out this
tablet from my backpack but that's how
it went and you know it blew up on the
screen and I was like wow now I can see
it on the tablet however if you do not
use the issues apps if you're using the
google standard editions like the gmail
app like hangouts like anything that you
actually want to use instead of the sort
of crappy azuz one's google play
services doesn't support that transition
so what happens is you're given a dialog
box on the device that you just switch
to that says hey google play services
doesn't support this do you want to
restart the app and then you hit the
button and it restarts the app so
that's all yeah and granted it is only
one step to basically accomplish the
same thing but it's an ugly step it's an
error step it's a you did something
wrong step or I've been worried that
something like this might i mean not
specifically this error but i may be
wrong about this but is the aspect ratio
on the tablet different from the phone
itself and could that be the source of
some of these troubles I don't because I
believe that the tablet is it's not 1080
I mean it's not a 1920 x 1080 it's not
well 20 x 1200 yeah right so that would
be 16 x 10 whereas the phone is 1920 x
1080 which is sixteen by nine right so
maybe that that is the core of the issue
i made a point to ask the asuste folks
in the attenti folks whether that would
be fixed by launch and no they're
basically you know android google has to
implement it within Android it's not
anything they can do about it so the
only thing they can do is pitch as
strong a case as possible to get you to
use the assu saps what do you think this
would have Google's gear when it comes
to tablet support by now but you would
you would think yeah but you know I
still think this is one of those wonky
things that Google looks at and it's
like it's cool that you can use Android
to do that but we don't really were not
interested in an edge case exactly but
at the same time like so I have that
objection I have some some concerns as I
said with with the aesthetics there are
the tablet sort of wobbles on a tabletop
it's you know it's it's just clunky it's
got this big phone in the back right and
it's certainly not attractive the
phone's battery is a little small
where's the tablet docks batteries only
almost 5000 milliamp hours so that's
that's a that's a benefit but you know
the phones matters a little smoke so
there are there are trade-offs however
every single time I think of a trade-off
I'm like but it's 200 bucks yeah I mean
they could probably get away charging
300 on contract and we'd still be
sitting this is a great deal for what
you're getting that's another point you
can spend another hundred dollars and
get a keyboard dock that really makes it
a whole that's like a laptop practically
exactly and the only I can't stop
thinking about college students and not
college students with a lot of money to
spend you know but like seriously you're
going back to school and it's like well
I want it I definitely want a tablet I
definitely want a smartphone I need them
why don't I just get both in the same
box and get the keyboard docks spent
three
bucks yet to your contract but also you
don't have to get a special data package
like the smartphones data package is
powering the entire experience so you're
saving money monthly as well like I said
I told you I was going to sound like a
commercial I just cannot stop thinking
about that and you know they weren't
aggressively drilling this into my head
at the thing they weren't like being
like but remember it's awesome I just I
kept saying and I'm like wait so hold up
you're not charging more for the data
package aren't you AT&amp;amp;T like isn't this
something you would normally you know
yeah nickel and dime was exactly but now
they're not doing that so I wonder what
kind of backroom deals had to be struck
in order to do that like this is only a
sous his third device on 80s network
penis is why it took five months between
the announcement this guy finally
Schilling going to be single day yeah I
asked why the timing was right now and
kind of got some you know non-answers
but they were very accommodating anyway
we're gonna review this thing early next
week I'm going to spend all weekend with
it I'll tell you what the biggest
surprise of it is is the camera the
camera is actually quite good I think
they've been talking about it was a
13-megapixel it's 13 megapixel but in
low light they're doing some crazy stuff
at I don't know that they're doing
anything overly complicated that much
just blasting the exposure up or
something like that but when you shoot
this thing in night mode and in reduced
light mode it's uh it's something yeah
it sure is off the top of your head
right curious thing you do not off the
top my head I'm sorry but it's it's sort
of like using the the Xperia z2 again
where that like just head out of this
world low-light performance the PadFone
is at least in the same league of course
it's a very noisy shot when you do that
but looks like a two point oh so it's
not that much different from what we're
used to I think it's got to be something
on software or just a really long
exposure because you do have to hold
still for a few seconds well that could
do it yeah so anyway um we're gonna talk
more about that but yeah I'm I I don't
want to talk about this for very long
because I know I'm gonna talk about it
more in the next show so let's let me
know yeah it's gonna be fun another
device just landed on a TNT in quite a
surprising turn of events isn't that
right Steven yeah oh we got the galaxy
s5 active dropped on us overnight and
this is just this is becoming routine
now with some of these follow-ups to the
the flagships we had the one mini 2 came
out of practically no we're a little bit
earlier this month still may isn't it
yeah little earlier at this month and
now the the gs5 I it lands on us and it
got you no wonder this might be in
response to that massive leak that came
out a little earlier and at this point
if Sampson was like well you know cats
out of the bag we might as well here I
think that is the case this got dropped
on us at like midnight Eastern last
night and I will tell you that I was
sitting I had just come from a party and
I was kind of winding down so I'm
sitting by myself in this like club and
there's you know neon lights all around
me I'm enjoying my drink and kind of
thinking about not cellphones and this
email comes in it's like galaxy s5 now
available for pre-order at AT&amp;amp;T I'm like
wait hold wait what and that I think the
tone of the release was certainly like
we kind of didn't want to do it this way
but here it is so I I do wonder if that
that is in a response to the leak but
maybe i'm just reading too much into the
pr copy maybe it's just maybe it's me
but have we heard anything about
international launch of this guy or just
a tease I don't think we have heard
anything about an international launches
I'm sure other than I will be interested
in in buying this phone yeah so it is it
is the one that we saw leaked by TK tech
news it is a beefier s5 and the thing
that I like most about this okay it's
it's a it's pretty ugly right but the
thing that I like most about it is that
it doesn't really appear to make any
spec compromises whereas last year's s4
active we've substituted an LCD for
AMOLED this does not oh yeah whereas
last year's s4 active did an 8 megapixel
camera to the 13 this is still the 16 of
the s5 the battery I think is the same
2800 milliamp hours in both right sounds
about in the right range needs gs5 yeah
and you know for that for kitkat LTE
obviously the i think the 800 hold on a
second is it a snap 800 2.5 you know
what they're not saying yeah then must
be inhale one yeah because it was
seasons at 2.5 right yeah yeah okay so
if we're assuming it's a it's an 801
anyway this is another device we're
going to have for in the office for
review so I'm very much looking forward
to this you you remember how much I
loved the s4 active last year despite
its compromises so and it corrected
title in this post oh all right yeah
please do unless the egg gs5 actor has a
hard rate monitor there's another one in
there to actually there this one also
has so the s4 active was only immersion
resistant and dustproof this one also
brings mil-spec 810g which is why it's
uglier it can withstand some more you
know bangs and such is there any mention
of 0 is in the sucker not seeing me the
book yeah I'm not seeing it either
cuz that's what TK wow that was that
kind of funny vit leaked video that we
sort of made fun of we were like hey man
like laurentian does not know is
necessarily at was a little we had a fun
exchange I'm Twitter about that I'm not
seeing any mention of no no I don't I
don't see it on the product page either
well yeah anyway it's engineered for
adventure AT&amp;amp;T is pitching it if you
want to buy one retail looks like seven
1499 move instant savings with contract
gets you down to 199 which i think is
the same price as the s5 is that we were
saying before yeah um so this you know
no real trade-offs I mean you can get
this for I mean you wanted nest five is
that could opposed to any more to have
this guy as long as you're not turned
off by V you know the aesthetics of it
which I kind of like yeah I like it too
beefy it's rugged and still got some of
those exposed screws on the back like we
s4 active had I love that industrial
look there's a yeah there's a button on
this thing that isn't on the s5 what's
it yeah about the volume rocker what's
that for yeah we saw that in those uh in
those videos this is a customizable
software button you can use it to you
know pull up the and some of the samsung
apps i think the default it pulls up one
of the it may be thought my head one of
their health apps where you can teach
other active thing or whatever yeah yeah
if you can change it and has you can
have a short press or a long press it
can be used to pull up different things
is this compatible with with AT&amp;amp;T is put
to talk oh I don't know I don't think so
I don't think that's the intent for this
but yeah that's why I was wondering if
you can slave it to that but I don't see
any something cheery I'm the reason we
couldn't yeah interesting stuff well
we're gonna bring this to you too I
could I could talk for it you know me
have been rugged phones I could talk
forever about this but let's keep on
powering through I think that's pretty
cool we've got to talk about this next
thing briefly this was another
unexpected drop this one from HTC it
looks like what was the story here
Steven Chu HTC China went and released
some news that maybe it was a little
early or something like that so that we
can follow in this one m8 ace for the
past couple months and the story behind
this guy has been a little tricky to
wrap our heads around because we hearing
so much information not all of it has
aligned precisely but we were expecting
some sort of cheaper version of the One
m8 for release in China and we saw some
hardware leaks they just look weird then
we saw some ones that looked a little
more traditional a lot like the one m8
itself but with a few aesthetic changes
replacing the metal or plastic dropping
the duo camera in favor of a big 13
megapixel camera and moving the the
flash to our one of the the way at the
depth sensor was um oh yeah that's right
i can see that yeah flat is above their
yeah um and then a little earlier this
week we got all these leaks where it has
looked like official promotional
pictures describing the features of this
guy and then sure enough yesterday we
saw HTC China publish these are very
same images on its own website and it
made an announcement on Weibo the big
Chinese social site about this contest
it was running at giving away a bunch of
these phones sales haven't started yet I
think they're still probably a month
away but it's confirmed we're still not
exactly sure what to call this thing
though you know a bunch of translations
have been made for the Chinese character
that HTC has been using here with a Boog
edition fashion edition and until we get
some sort of you know
and i think tim is we're going to get an
announcement it makes you see telling us
what to call this guy in the west unless
it's you know intended for release here
which we still don't know but yeah it's
confirmed this thing exists although
this raises the question then there was
another thing we were looking at this is
the phone who's similar in layout to the
one and mate but the top and bottom
where we have the so the grills on this
thing pretty much match the 1n mate but
we've seen these images of one where the
grill sort of extends across the whole
to write the entire material there right
right and there was an initial leak that
was we didn't know what we were seeing
but then it popped up again more
recently from china's version of the FCC
and that's not what this phone is so we
still don't know what that guy is that
was weird i was cheese man icc is well i
have you know they're possibly
fulfilling that promise of more devices
at more price points instead of just
relying on the single singular flagship
to drive the whole thing they're gonna
you know broaden their portfolio so and
we've also had the be to the new
butterflied is probably gonna pop up
yeah somewhere in asia at some point
which looks slightly different from all
of these ones about there's a lot to see
on that i think so i think until we know
more let's move on to something that I
found very interesting until I realized
the damn video is private what in hell
they made it private yeah so we were
looking this is a wearable thing guys
you know we love wearable in it yeah
weird wanted to see we wasn't blowing up
this week I mean I've been covering more
wearable stories in the past few days
and i remember in no recent history it's
been fun i've been enjoying it and that
this g watch was uh I that was teased at
the g3 event LG their final point yeah
they had it on in the showing
accessories right there like we have a
lot of accessories for this and it was
like gia watch my call are you gonna
talk about yes an apple like and one
more thing I know I would sort of didn't
expect it and then it is just glad they
teased it but I think there's no
question we are gonna see this thing at
i/o would you agree I not then then
another event around the same time but
when this thing was announced
in March I mean I wouldn't have been
surprised if it had its formal retail
announcement just a couple weeks later
from the as soon as we learned about
this thing it seemed nearly ready to go
it did yeah it seemed much more close to
release or much closer to release then
the Moto 360 but of course it has a
commensurate reduction in you know wow
factor just because it's yeah square
SmartWatch like so what however it is
one of the first Android wear devices so
we were excited to see I guess a video a
hands-on video did you watch it I did so
we've seen hands on pictures of the G
watch before but it was powered off at
the time and then this video popped up
yesterday it seemed Sherman and didn't
show us that much a lot of it was still
looking at the hardware the key to watch
itself but briefly we got to see some of
the interactions with Android wear how
did I power it on just the button press
on the side is there like a tap on the
face to wake it there's there's no
button on the side there's no no the
only hardware buttons on the back and
I'm guessing it's a reset button how do
you weigh things get I don't know I
didn't catch that from the video and it
seemed like they only had a very brief
amount of time to interact with this we
saw the same you know short run through
the menus looped twice so ok I'm is your
name that may be why this was make
private they weren't supposed to be
sharing it and con started I had the
inclination when I first saw this thing
just give problem yeah I should download
this is probably isn't gonna last and I
didn't but hmm um I did a week search to
see if anybody else had reuploaded it I
couldn't find it I seriously considered
it for a brief moment but then at the
same time what am I gonna do &amp;amp; Overy
uploads its pocket now and get sued no
yeah but we saw just scrolling through a
list of timers we saw they didn't have a
clock face this is a very very
thoroughly Android wear um but we could
see like you can pull down see the
battery remaining it was neat it had
some soy controls but this is a taste
aesthetically did it match the
screenshots we saw and the other linked
post in the rundown like these
notification no this is this is I think
far earlier than what we saw those
officially released one of the Google's
Android accounts are one of the people
working from cool
released I think seven or so screenshots
showing what developers can do with
notifications being sent to wear and so
things like multi screen notifications
you know swipe to get the rest of it the
notifications with media playback
controls like we see on Android itself
yeah this is a lot further along yeah I
got to say I was a little disappointed
because I click through it was like
sweet and then it's basically just just
a hey this like seven of them and it's
like nest there's a nest alert and
there's a clash of clans alert so the
alerts look like white cards that you
might see in Google now yeah very nowish
they have like a thumbnail on them to
tell you what app they're coming from
which is pretty cool and then they just
you know they very readable text and
stuff you'd expect but you know it was
it didn't blow my hat but these I think
we're mostly the the basic notifications
because we will elude it to developers
being able to do a lot more watch
specific stuff to give users
interactivity oh um a voice response to
things like everybody notification and
you can get speak you know what you want
to do next like oh you got a text
message ok show me the text message god
I there's always not I'm we're gonna
move on but always every frickin
SmartWatch post there's always some
goddamn killjoy to be like a one
wouldn't need a SmartWatch for get out
of my face every way god I can't stand
that anyway uh finally the last bit of
news on the G watch is that there is
this rumor and I don't know the credence
of this rhythmic reported on it I think
yesterday the day before that the G
watch may operate independently of its
companion smartphone meaning it would
have an embedded sim your solo style
yeah embed zoom is weird though I don't
like that it's very strange right more
information is expected at i/o in late
June which would be interesting that
yeah rhythmic Briggs an interesting
point why would you want to make this
device you know it i think there isn't
good i think there is a market for
standalone smartwatches i mean it may
not be now hello it's but i don't think
like you would position at this what
maybe there'll be two versions or
something like that that's what i would
help I don't think that everyone's going
to want the watch that has its consuming
battery power constantly as its trying
to maintain
cellular signal that has an extra data
plan you have to pay for i right you
definitely have the option for just a
tethered I'm still holding on to the
dream of like smartwatches as the new
dumb phones I think that would be so
cool just to have everyone I mean maybe
if you think that everyone everyone
everyone is going to be on a smartphone
of some form in the future I'm not
prepared to call you wrong but I do
think that there are gonna be some
people out there who still you know just
one voice and SMS and that's about it
like you know it's kyle of dining
segment but i've been looking through
some of my old electronic gaming monthly
from the mid 90s because that's what I
like to read in my spare time this was
the old magazines yeah it's awesome atms
they're the CES spread and 80 had this
um it was in the Y is a SmartWatch it's
a watch phone and it wasn't even
cellular you said to hook it up to it's
like a cordless phone for your home but
it had a little it flipped out like it
does so we kind of looked like a flip
phone that you hold it up to your to the
side of your head I want to see that
asked me to get Brody that do can you
please snap a shot of that and send it
to me cuz absolutely Taylor is preparing
a throwback piece that actually that
would be nice for perfect uh alright so
that's we're gonna learn more about the
G watch as time goes on I think we got
to just move on here finally to tie up
the Android category even though this is
sort of cross-platform atty thing we're
gonna see it a lot in android if it
becomes adopted oh boy wireless charging
guys oh this guy listen rock palm ship
listen this is so exciting to me and
it's exciting to me for exactly this
damn reason i'm at the assu SPAD phone
event of talking to AT&amp;amp;T am having a
great time they say hey the PadFone
smartphone component can also charge
wirelessly i'm like great is that chi
and they're like uh actually no no I
gotta go check on that and I checked on
it and now it's the stupid AT&amp;amp;T damn
poor because they're backing that
standard and so of course all the cheese
stuff that I have in my house doesn't
work with the damn padfone and that's
stupid and it's the worst damn thing
ever I mean I have yet to go to the
starbucks and find out if this works and
their stupid pads that nobody uses
because it's the wrong standard because
it's not being pushed if
I hit the whole thing so how could this
broadcom device solve those problems
Steven because the broadcom chip don't
care if your Chi if your power whatever
it's so there are basically three
competitors right now trying to
determine the standard here and you know
like you said if you're not if you don't
have the right phone and the right
charger that match up you can't do
anything so what broadcom is trying to
do is eliminate that incompatibility by
on the phone side of things making a
power chip that can handle any of these
three different charging standards you
can put it on a Qi charger you can put
it doesn't matter with its starbucks you
just drop it and you know it's gonna
work because it's like oh yeah if it's a
wireless charger it'll work this reminds
me of a lot of the system when system on
our chips were coming out that included
radios for like gsm and cdma or do you
know the big ones that were like gsm or
cdma and HSPA when 18t was doing a
switchover like i remember reading about
these SOC s that had both radios in a
moment oh wow great that's cool now it
can be one phone across carriers and
that's eventually what we did my only
concern was that you know I read this
and I'm immediately worrying well is
this gonna be a case where yes the chip
supports all these different standards
but like with smartphones with them with
their radios and band support where even
if the makeshift might support you know
20 different LTE bands the phone
actually doesn't because the antenna is
only engineered to be optimized for two
or three so we're gonna see things where
like they need different size coils or
something and haven't gotten a hard
answer but reading through the press
release I don't get the impression that
would be a problem I think that this
chip can handle these different
standards with enough grace that the the
hardware external to the ship isn't
going to queer the deal that's
interesting you that's a good point
because it's not just the chips to
antenna and that's you know we're
dealing with physics there like some
some coils are sized for specific pads
and stuff like that and it's like what
is its induction vs what's the other the
other resonance yeah yeah yeah so that's
gonna be interesting so what you're
saying is it is not garen
t that this is going to be a panacea for
our woes those of us who love wireless
charging possibly not but this is
definitely the best thing that wireless
charging has had come alone around port
in a long while and I mean even not just
the broad compatibility aside if this
was just key or just a TNT's thing it
still sounds like a very good chat but
has all these no high efficiency you
know the speed is boost mode it sounds
like it's solidly in and of itself
because that's been a giant complaint of
wireless charging is that it is slower
too long yeah i'm looking forward by the
way to the comments on this what do i
need wireless charging what do i need
smart watches you don't mind about
anything like fun hey if that's if all
that's true then this thing deserves a
far sexier name than BCM 59 30 50 or
whatever I rolls off the tongue when I
look forward to seeing that in some
smartphones let's see if we can power
through the iOS and windows segments
find out what's going on here I always
you get a wireless charging yeah so
that's a nice little bridge there what
is the story here Apple might be
selecting a partner for a wireless
charging specifically we're thinking for
the iWatch which makes a lot of sense
we've talked before about how you
probably want to wirelessly charge a
watch because it's a nice bedside table
piece of accoutrement also it alone is
need for ports yes this is true and I
think with Motorola we might be getting
a wireless charging thing with the Moto
360 oh gee my TV did they allude to that
now those battery they were talking
about because they G watch has those
pads on the back but yeah now we're
talking about the i watch it Apple that
really is getting someone to manufacture
these the coils this external stuff we
were just talking about the broadcom
chip for the iWatch then that very well
may use put on you know this bedside
pedestal like you mentioned oh I think
it's interesting that you talked about
that because we had another development
with smart phone charging I came up this
week nothing's in the rundown but this
new Samsung thing with them it's called
sim the sim band well yeah they're their
health platform yeah
and this is it's still early early phase
of this and the hardware doesn't sound
very exciting it's just like a reference
platform but the one thing that really
stuck in my mind was that Samsung want
you to wear this thing 24 hours a day so
you don't take it off to charge it get
out of my face what a nerd directed
wireless charging no um I made the
understanding is wrong I didn't watch
the whole presentation but talking about
the shuttle battery which sounds like a
battery that you charge like a normal
wall charger and plug it in and then you
take this thing and itself it's wireless
you I'm plucking my charger and then you
attach it to the watch and it sort of
clips on with magnets and so it's like a
shuttle it sort of relays the charge
from the wall charger to the watch by
means of a separate external battery
whoa interesting it's a little
complicated but yeah betia then you
leave that on overnight and aware of the
lock is you sleep no monitor your blood
pressure and all that stuff all night
long like a drill battery kinda yeah
yeah that's interesting at least you're
gonna plug into a boring alcove to
charge up with it wear it all the time
I'll give it time well I think you know
all of this points to exciting
developments at least in the wireless
charging space and it finally leveraging
the technology for the purposes for you
know reasonable logical purposes as much
as I love wireless charging on a
smartphone I agree that not everyone is
going to see the utility and it not
everyone needs it but for a watch where
you want to minimize ports it's a great
idea you know for a wearable that you
that ostensibly some people will wear 24
hours a day having some evolution of
wireless charging too for long distance
charging which we've seen bandied about
for ages by the way the s4 was like
rumored to have all right charges three
miles away like you know these these
Tesla technologies anyway I just I think
it's exciting to see so much buzz about
this and I think we're on the verge of
another of a sort of resurrection of
wireless charging yet again or who knows
what the sea state will be after this
next well really want to put a wireless
charger in my car I almost got as on
WPCentral was talking about a deal where
AT&amp;amp;T was offloading the old Nokia wire
chargers for like five bucks a pop oh my
god really yeah and they were only in
stores and very limited availability the
closest one to me was like 20 miles away
so I didn't end up getting one but and I
hear that they're awful you need to be
super precisely positioned to were not
I'm looking at one right now I'm holding
in my hand I was just I got very excited
and then I was like oh right but it's
the Nokia one that's the Nokia one it's
not the nexus for puck or the touchdown
from palm like it's just it's not ugly
it's just this plate but yeah you do
have to be very precise and there are no
magnets or anything that's the thing
that's what should be built into these
standards as a mounting paradigm that
that makes sense that makes it enjoyable
to use because that's the one thing all
this is missing like on the nexus 4
Puckett's like oh there's a layer of
rubber that's six of the phone the nokia
thing is just hard plastic the phone
slides everywhere like that sucks the
only people I've seen do it really well
or tilt with their angled thing angled
cradle that works nicely but I know I
can't remember what the nexus 5 charger
looks like on the top of my head because
I got its own special one didn't it I
don't know if it did I thought you think
it was the same orb I think it was a
more angular one that came out I don't
know maybe but the orb was a good idea
just needs magnets but magnets mms
everything else I think I google took
all the old Nexus cues and is cut them
in half yeah oh the queue poor thing
Apple goes official with the beats deal
we talked I know yet the other day yeah
it's so funny because I was just
listening to another podcast that is
discussing the possibilities here and we
seemed you know a lot of people are on
the fence like a is this actually gonna
happen or not and it's happening three
billion bucks for Apple to buy beats do
you think Stephen that they did this
because they're not certain about the
future of itunes because itunes is like
not even a contender in the streaming
space or do you think they did it for
you know some combination of that and
other stuff what do you think is the way
i should have phrased that question well
we're just feeding me the answers ya
know it's got to be a combination but I
I hadn't really considered so much the
decline of itunes but I think you do
have a point I mean just in general
smartphone users seem to be and I have
some heated opinions about this but
moving away
from ownership to subscription services
rent an your music yeah yeah and I mean
we see more and more of these
subscription things arriving and no
one's making a new store where you buy
music so and it beats and it's growing
fast doesn't have a ton of subscribers i
think i heard 250,000 mentioned in one
of the reports coming along side the
announcement here but it's it's a growth
market and beets has that brand
recognition that's you know paramount
importance that is another thing that i
just can't help but think about I mean
we all kind of poo-poo beats because it
it does really like ruin audio if you're
an audiophile originally I tend to like
its effects when I need a little more
volume everybody knows that I've said it
a billion times but really the important
thing is that outside tech circles i
think that beats is so damn recognizable
that that is going to be a it's going to
be a very visible addition to apples
music offering because i think you know
the ipod the sort of luster of the
company that built the ipod is starting
to fade a little bit you know it used to
be that you wanted those lily white ipod
headphones or the chic things to get and
now we have you know jimmy iovine I
don't know Jovian yeah I mean a slamming
up he was talking like he was right next
to when he's apple guy saying oh yeah
the apple headphones suck yeah how far
we've come I indeed I know and it always
reminds me of the one of the best pieces
of advertising I've seen which is a sign
that lives outside a local headphone
shop a stereo shop that says they're
free for a reason and it has a picture
of these earbuds I'm like that you know
that's a solid point but you know this
this brand is not is not hated in the
real world I think it's recognized and I
think people really think beats has done
a good job of convincing people that
it's hardware is superior and even if
it's not true it's a status symbol like
the ipod was like those white wires were
think that's the new beats like you get
beats if you want people to understand
that you have money to throw away on
headphones like that's important so
you're my beats if you want to have
headphones that are pretty rather than
sounding better true but you know i'm
fine with that like I mean I by
smartphone are very reason own I mean
like I get it tonight i underst
and I'd be shallow that's cool it's just
interesting that Apple found a
combination of factors such as perhaps
that perhaps buttressing it's streaming
music offerings perhaps enhancing its
audio hardware and perhaps brand
awareness and the the desire to be hip
again or be more hip and it found that
all that were three billion dollars and
you know dr. Dre sitting on your board
what that's worth it right there yeah I
actually don't know if that's part of
the deal or not but I assumed it was I
mean from one of the who was the press
announcement or Tim Cook's letter but it
did give the impression that the beets
leadership was coming on board to Apple
in some form or another Jesus I mean I
don't know man like I you know I have a
lot of respect for for for dr. Dre's
professional accomplishments but I can't
like I can never get over the fact that
dude like beat up a woman like severely
beat a woman and everyone knows this but
everyone has you know decided to forget
it because whatever he's Dre okay I
don't know anyway I'm more importantly
though this purchase gave us the
opportunity to see one of the the best
brand tweets I've ever seen whereas
Denny's sent out that we breaking
Denny's buys beats for three billion
makes you salad oh my god Bless You
Dennis ve whatever that all right what
so let's uh take us home here what's
happening with wdc just tell us when we
can expect it Stephen and where we can
watch that ish Apple will be so not all
of us can afford to attend WWDC in
beautiful San Francisco so starting very
very soon to be a busy DC veggie dip net
kicks off next week on Monday June
second and Apple is going to be
streaming a thing for all of us at home
to watch so if you've got a computer you
have a lot of good options here you know
max won't have any problem accessing
this and if you're on Windows you guys
install quicktime you able to watch it
only problem is we don't have quite the
same compatibility on the smartphone
side of things so sorry those of you you
know
junkies who have made the switch to your
smartphone doing all the work for you
because have to rely on us to tell you
what happened at WWDC than any
interesting announcements that come out
of it yeah I think we have an editorial
roundtable scheduled if the news that
comes out of it is compelling enough so
don't worry those of you in the comments
who called on us to have more live
hangouts I've certainly we would like to
it's just very difficult to get over to
everyone together busy yeah we busy
folks and speaking of which we got to go
so anyway we're going to be covering
that stay tuned for that let's jump into
Windows very quick will sound the bong
bong there it is Oh be mobile to launch
first Windows Phone this was one of the
kind of wave of new manufacturers that
might wake flood is more like it yeah
that they called out and said Nick hey
we're gonna have all these guys building
windows phones isn't that cool really
glad that it's pretty cool to have more
OEMs for especially for emerging markets
this one is particularly interesting
because it's obi mobile it is run by
john sculley who formerly was most
famous for firing steve jobs from Apple
few decades ago so I don't want i'm not
i'm not calling that absolutely we can
pile on the guy for you know using our
retrospect to be like oh you're mine
sites 2020 exactly now it's not that at
all it's just i find it if i find it
interesting that this company that he is
I don't know the founder of a know if
he's a founding member of her or
whatever he's not the same i can't
imagine he has much direct input to the
phone design or anything guess that he's
involved with this is going to get
people paying attention yeah agreed i
mean it's just always interesting to see
somebody from one company you know then
move into a situation where is now
working for a competitor or having
formed a competitor so it's an
interesting header image with the CEO
ajay sharma standing there with what
looks like a galaxy s5 but may be done
no that's bond is more for heart rate
you know yeah and then presumably this
new device nice i don't know what's
going on this header image is just
interesting but a windows phone is
coming from the guy who fired steve jobs
i thought it was worth a mention LOL but
also in a broader sense I
it's gonna be pretty cool to see whether
Microsoft is successful at fostering
this Android like ecosystem at the low
end yeah these are just gonna be you
know the throwaway not nokia devices or
if any of them are going to get a good
reputations for themselves if people are
going to actively seek these out I mean
not in all markets certainly but are
these going to be possibly more
appealing at some of the higher-end but
correspondingly more expensive options
it's a good point it's a good question
and I think they're going to outperform
all where most of the Android devices at
their price point so not that I know
anything about the price point but if
you're doing emerging markets you
definitely want to make some assumptions
yeah exactly so um you know windows
phone has always been really good at
performing on very shoestring hardware
so I think that's going to be
interesting to see and I'm actually
looking forward to more windows phone
news as we go on we were kind of now at
the tail end of the big ol blast the
pre-acquisition blast of products from
nokia and now we're in the low as as
microsoft mobile gets going when do we
know by the way when they're gonna brand
themselves didn't they announce that
didn't they say a couple months or so I
don't know I've stopped referring to the
company making the phones and general
what I'm talking about these guys let's
talk about the Lumias I don't know if
something nokia Microsoft mobile I'm
just keeping my mouth shut till we know
something for sure yeah well you know
that's a good idea and I think you and I
should both shut our mouths because I
think we should take this podcast home
and put it to bed what do you think wrap
this baby oh yeah let's do it I was
going to make a point oh yeah we're at
episode 098 folks if you didn't notice
and if you stuck with us this long I do
appreciate it in two weeks we will have
episode 100 and although he doesn't know
it yet anton denote she's going to be on
that one and so is exciting news brandon
minimun he's going to come back for a
second former editor-in-chief of pocket
now and founding member it's going to
come back and riff on mobile with us
it's going to be kind of a send off to
the existing pocket now weekly do not
worry we're not putting the podcast out
to pasture we're at pastor but it will
continue to posture we're going to just
make some changes we're going to make it
a little more exciting we're going to
introduce a live component we're just
going to shake things up a little bit
because you know it's been
how we chose it's right we like our
format but we're going to change it up
we gotta keep at the Times a little bit
so if you have something you want to see
in particular in our new format please
shoot us an email until then it has been
I don't know how to finish that sentence
just wait and see it's going to be fun
blah blah blah blah blah folks if you
are wondering about our transition music
it comes from Ali Spagnola who we
interviewed last week on what it's like
to make your music into ringtones it was
awesome she is wonderful it is great
stuff listen to it Ellie spagnola she is
at Le spagnola calm her YouTube pages at
Ali's bags youtube.com slash at least
bags she's hilarious she's a pleasure
more importantly her music is
outstanding maybe less importantly
depending on what you know I don't know
it doesn't matter boolean work yes
equally importantly go listen to her
stuff she's great that is gonna do it
for this episode 098 of the pocket now
weekly send us listener mail folks we
have some in the box but it's less than
usual send us some more will read it
next time thank you for all of it every
week be sure to find us on twitter
steven is that Steven shank our guest I
did yesterday you did it again well you
just did tweets about once every four
months so you enjoy that that's
literally true it is and Daniel Bader is
a journey Dan journey man except with a
d lol as always I met captain two phones
captain the number two phones you can
also follow pocket now officially
Twitter Instagram Facebook Google+ if
there's a social network we're on it
including Flipboard awesome in Pinterest
you show and Pinterest oh wait or wheel
that are doing no we're not but you said
all well I mean almost everyone you know
our only ninety six percent men so I
don't know but we're working itunes xbox
music stitcher wherever else podcasts
are heard usually you can leave a review
if you would do that for us folks that
would be great also we're on stitcher as
I just mentioned and you know what not a
lot of people listen to us on stitcher I
just found out what's up with that we
were trying to send it from a set up a
promotional thing and stitcher was like
yeah you like 500 people listen to every
week on citroen would it's like this is
like 150th of our listenership or
something
no math I don't know how that works
anyway listen to us on stitchers fun as
always thank you so much for listening
Stephen thank you for sticking around
for this stupid long outro everyone we
will see you for more mobile tech talk
next week the shame that it hasn't
become the platinum hit it deserves to
be a bit tardy for the party you know we
be cross streams once but yeah we don't
want to talk about that I say that is
just barely legal here my we're in
Massachusetts everything's legal issues
Massachusetts you know like tax excuse
its am i right whoa thanks Obama do you
uh do you okay yo you sound great man oh
well you're so kind how will will you
know gracefully escort you off the air
and then Stephen and I'll just hang
around in BS yeah I have other things to
do too nah bro only guests get their
time respective there's a lot to see on
that I think until we know more oh my
goodness coffee burp
