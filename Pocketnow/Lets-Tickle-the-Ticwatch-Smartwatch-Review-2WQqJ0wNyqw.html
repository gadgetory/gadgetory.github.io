between Apple watch and Android wear or
can another system emerge as a
competitor the pick watch looks to put a
fresh spin on a touchscreen wearable and
I've spent the last week sporting it as
my daily driver does it tickle my fancy
only one way to find out
first of all this is a really nice
looking wearable outwardly a finely
brushed metallic casing with leather
bands the underside is clad in a dark
plastic well not quite as nice as recent
steel watches helps provide wireless
fast charging in the unique tickle strip
more on both later in this review the
round display is a 400 by 400 pixel OLED
with respectable brightness though it
can still be difficult to read outdoors
the Onyx version which we're not
reviewing covers that display in
sapphire which is an easy recommend for
the $50 premium a bevy of tech is on
board including a pedometer heart rate
monitor GPS Wi-Fi Bluetooth mic and
speaker and the whole affair is ip65
splash resistant the software on tap
feels Android wear adjacent maybe like
the lovechild of wearing Tizen on setup
you'll see Android is starting and you
can secure the watch using a pattern
unlock on startup instead of the
vertical sliding UI of Android wear each
direction swipes delivers a different
function on tick watch swiping from the
top down reveals settings options music
controls in your step count swiping from
right to left opens the applet drawer
and here you'll find short interaction
services like the health apps stopwatch
calculator and a voice recorder swiping
from the bottom up houses your
notifications you can read deeper or
swipe the notification away and lastly a
swipe from left to right opens the voice
assistant it's handy for web searches
and looking up restaurants or point of
interest details but proved frustrating
for things like initiating phone calls
saying call marie juliet back now always
resulted in a web search for call me
back now a saying call marie would move
me to a text prompt asking me to choose
between my wife marie and my friend mary
EV while driving a car it would be nice
to have a voice prompt finish this
interaction is taking my eyes off the
road to hit small text on a hard to read
display isn't particularly great design
happily the voice recognition worked
like a champ for replying to text
messages coming from an android wear
device there was a little muscle memory
retraining but this layout isn't as
complicated as Tizen
various menus the watch can be used with
both Android and iOS but Apple's walled
garden stunts a fair amount of the
functionality for third-party wearables
using an Android powered accessory with
an Android powered phone just makes the
most sense for maximizing your bang for
buck one of the more unique features is
the tickle strip on the side under the
steel you can use the sensor to scroll
through and use in notifications it
takes a minute to get a feel for it and
I find it strange that the strip does
nothing from the main watch base but it
is an appreciated Hardware control which
reduces the amount of fingerprint
smudging on your watch face the sock
orientation though does look a bit odd
as tick watch natively puts the strip on
the right
so users wear the watch with the crown
on the left but that can be swapped in
the watch settings Wi-Fi is well
appreciated for keeping me connected as
I move throughout my condo but this
watch also falls prey to one of my
biggest wear pet peeves that you receive
no alert when the watch drops the
Bluetooth connection I really appreciate
a leash function on other wearables and
for having the heart rate sensor it's
nice when firing up a workout but
constant background monitoring is
appreciated on competing products also
it's just nice having health data
tracked throughout the day and having
more accurate sleep monitoring movements
is important but adding heartrate data
to your step count for a whole day
delivers much better insight on your
activities that last point might have
something to do with battery life
however tick watch claims up to two days
on a charge and I really couldn't get
close to that wearing this watch took me
back to my first days using early
Android wear Hardware watching the
battery meter plummet during the day
nervously checking to see if it would
last through the night it usually would
but I would often be running on fumes by
bedtime the watch fully charges in under
80 minutes so a short stint on the
charger can alleviate some of that
battery anxiousness but instead of
blending into my lifestyle tick watch
often felt like yet another gadget I had
to babysit or manage so let's wrap this
up where does that leave us with the
tick watch there's a lot to like here
tick watch delivers a fresh twist on
Android smartwatches and it's a well
featured wearable to look well
complimented my style both dressing up
and keeping it cash and it more than
satisfied the basics in delivering
notifications and offering applet
interactions Raso not overly concerned
about support as this watch has received
three small bug fix
date since it was delivered we would
like to see a bit more polish around
some phone interactions like initiating
a call through voice commands and voice
commands only but chief among our
concerns was battery life if you receive
a lot of notifications and are apt to
use the watch more heavily in situations
like commuting this will be a charge
every night kind of gadget even for that
issue though I liked this watch a lot
better than I thought I would it doesn't
completely satisfy my list of wearable
wants but it's a well executed companion
delivered with style
by a team with some obvious talent as
always thanks so much for watching be
