weekly hello and welcome to episode 030
of the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss the cooled crazy and the
contentious in the world of mobile
technology I'm your host Michael Fisher
and joining me this morning from what I
presumed to be the frozen Romanian
tundra managing editor Anton d Nadia
good morning to you hey guys how cold is
it over there actually it's been better
today six Celsius so that's good ok and
from a land where the Android skins are
beautiful our resident silky voiced
Google guy Joe Levi good morning to you
good morning it's a little bit warmer
than in Romania worked three aaron
height here but the fog is thick it's
you know i think it's i think it's
appropriate show that i introduced here
is the google guy and make an android
joke in the intro and then you
immediately turn into robot man when
it's all awesome is or a lot man again
how many degrees fahrenheit is it 23
degrees fahrenheit with a very thick fog
that's sticking to the trees and making
them look all crystally it's beautiful
dog means it's gonna be a sunny day is
that is that are saying and in Romania
Tony no that's actually what's history
teaches action is like no that's just
science that's reality the Utah must be
an anomaly in that regard as well but I
fuck you yuga except in Nebraska except
in Nebraska we've got we've got a lot in
the rundown today we've got its it we've
kind of run into the law that that I was
fearing or anticipating depending on
your point of view but we have a lot to
talk about all the same and we are going
to get to listener male listeners so
yeah you can hear the cheers across the
internet so thank you for your patience
we're not going to get to all of it as
always primarily because the letters are
so long yeah we don't have the the
button we don't have the soundboard in
here like we haven't hang out the
defects Nobel you got that under control
yeah yeah so thank you for your listener
mail everyone if we don't get yours
we're sorry but
please try and keep those brief like
three sentences because we just can't it
takes a long time to even read them well
but with such a I love that we have such
a day of like a listener base that's
willing to just delve into deep ideas
and their listener mail I mean they're
like essays I felt like I actually have
a little memo I'm like is there any way
we can turn these into like guest spots
and stuff like that but anyway let's
let's jump into it and I've temporarily
lost to run down but I understand the
way of some announcements or at least
one announcement Tony would you like to
take the floor for that sure not
necessarily an announcement button FYI
to everybody we have unfortunately
postponed our last week's episode of
pocket now live or hang out with you
guys the viewers the listeners and we
are working on getting it back on air
this friday as scheduled and we will
keep you posted on that however on
monday we will have some very very very
exciting stuff to show you guys to stay
glued to pocket now exciting stuff
coming up on monday and some exciting
stuff landing just today on the parking
out front pages on that is also that is
also part of them on the announcement oh
that's also part of the mundane us okay
alright so the okay good excellent good
good good so there's there's
announcements for today and we are
obviously still preparing for for our
mwc coverage which will happen when mwc
evans at the end of this month and i
think i've some concerns that hopefully
you guys can can help me lay to rest
because we keep getting more and more
announcements from companies major
brands saying how they are not going to
be present at mwc most notably the
rumors flying around that samsung is not
going to have an official unpacked event
samsung has not officially commented on
those yet but I'm sure they will and
just this morning we're hearing that
google is not even going to have an
Android booth at mwc so answer
disappointment it is a disappointment
and I you know the more companies
announced this kind of stuff the more
worried i get that Tony you and I are
going to get there and it's going to be
like CES all over again we're scouring
the edges of the show floor for like
these like knock off you know iphone
cases and trying to make news out of
them I'm sure it's not going to be that
way we'll have plenty
things to do but why i said it's
disappointing because you guys have not
been to mwc and i've been covering mwc
for a couple of years now one of the
biggest and most exciting booths is
Google's Android booth they usually take
up almost an entire hole they're huge
and they have these micro stands micro
boosts where om's and their partners
show of products and services and
oftentimes it's the place where we go
when we need to have some hands-on with
new devices for instance if LG has a new
device and it's jam-packed that LG's
booth we just run to the Android booth
and then we can have a chance of getting
the hands on there so that aside we'll
miss the smoothie bar I heard a smoothie
boy yes they did and all the flavors
were Android flavors like you could get
a gingerbread smoothie or a honeycomb
smoothie and the donut smoothie and
stuff like that were any of them any
good at all that sounds good no but the
branding was good in the market he was
good k magic all the way back to the
cupcake smoothie yeah that just sounds
wrong but doesn't it ha jellybean done
no thank you especially since i'm on a
not much of a health kick but a less
eating horribly kick and tony is just
becoming Iron Man 7 over there guys no
that's your turf yeah I know by the way
uh while I'm taking this this note can I
just kind of just complain very quickly
about OS 10 and its insistence on
integrating the Notes app with them with
your email accounts if you encounter
this how do you mean integrating with
the email again you can't use the stock
by the way I usually use Evernote so
everyone about to write and tell me use
Evernote I I know but the thing is like
the stock notes app on OS 10 integrates
with unity on on computer email account
if you use mail which I used to and now
I don't because we switch but it like it
just gives me an error every single time
there's no way to get around there's no
way to I have never used notes in such
way I always make notes which sync
across my devices the DI by the the
iphone and the mac but never integrated
with my mail so this is homework for me
uh yeah well don't do it it's yo yo hey
okay
life Windows has this really cool app
called notepad and I use that and it
works great I i was using about all the
time I'm not invest that was fish full
of txt files actually I used to use no
pet all the times you I used to save my
aim conversations in notepad oh you know
like I used to have like important aim
conversations with a girl I liked or
whatever and then I'd like copy paste a
minute weird yeah God now that important
all right we talked for like an hour
last week about blackberry so we're not
going to do that again today but just to
call your attention listeners to to the
fact that we are covering it like crazy
if you haven't seen we have yet another
pair of comparison videos up blackberry
vs nokia lumia 920 and blackberry vs
galaxy s3 is what it was and those took
forever to assemble as Tony knows I
finish these comparison videos and I
look up and it's been like eight hours
and I'm like okay well I'm not getting
to that other editorial today and
meanwhile Tony's already asleep in bed
so i sent a minute like once again this
took forever but hopefully the results
are good they're getting a good thumbs
up two thumbs down ratio and i think
they're they're a little more complete
than what we were able to do from that
hotel room in Toronto so I hope you're
enjoying those and we are still ref
aggregating information and impressions
for our z10 review Michael real quick
yeah I have a real quick question if you
wouldn't use Windows Phone 8 let's see
windows phone 8 is not out you're still
stuck on windows phone seven points
something or maybe even the seven point
eight okay blackberry or Windows Phone 7
point something which one would you use
you know it's funny if it's windows
phone 7.8 than that if it's 7.5 then
probably not but that's just because of
the the home screen versatility is just
so if it's seven point eight or eight
then it's windows if it's below 7.8 that
its BlackBerry OS yeah because there
were more apps like there were more
important apps 47.8 like at least I
could use Spotify on seven but you know
now I I like Windows Phone 8 but that's
a very good question you know blackberry
is if you buy a blackberry right now I
be like and I'll say this in the review
I feel like you're investing in in hope
like you're putting a little money in
the hope jar because you're just praying
that Blackberry can build its ecosystem
fast enough to remain or to become
relevant you know but right now it's not
there so you'd have to put up with a lot
of app gap in the meantime well that's
usually the case with every new platform
even windows phone 7 had this problem at
the beginning God it had a much worse
problem i mean blackberries doing much
better than windows phone was at the
very beginning already but there are
some bugs and you know i got a little
worried when I'm like reporting these
bugs and then of course the whoever
these insane commenters are to come into
the thread and just drop a whole
paragraph full of all caps shouting
about how I'm wrong and I'm like really
okay so I go to the crackberry forums
and I'm like is it is anyone else
reporting on these bugs oh yes everyone
is talking about the bus and you know
and I'm not talking blackberry mean
that's that's what happens with the new
platform you know we're all there for
the start of new platforms you know how
many bugs there are it's just gonna be
contingent on them to get them fixed as
soon as possible that was I was about to
say exactly so on apps do you think
we're gonna see blackberry try and
create their own app environment and and
put more stock behind I mean I know it's
already there but there's nothing there
or are they gonna try and scalp more
android stuff and have android apps that
run native on blackberry i know they're
doing work to try and get their emulator
up to support jelly bean it's been
already i think as of this morning it's
been already confirmed as being out oh
is it out I think I saw headline this
morning yeah no that's definitely a gap
filler it's just like what palm did when
they launched the pre and they had that
emulator forum for old palm OS apps it's
just a gap filler and I think I forgot
who at blackberry made this statement
but he said something akin to like where
we're using the Android apps and we were
glad that we ported those over but
definitely we're emphasizing we want
everyone to use the you know the connex
environment and make their apps
specifically for the blackberry platform
so yeah I'm not sure the encoder but i
think that's that's the case i would
prefer a application which is native to
the operating system than a port or an
Emmy
asian of the application on another
platform absolutely and I think most
people would and it's good to hear that
the company actually is you know it is
coming out and saying we know we want
you to code for our platform we don't
want to rely on this crutch of porting
android apps forever mmm so that's a
good thing but yeah so if any if you
guys want to know anything about the z10
you can go ahead and ask me and I mean
you Joe and Tony and also you listeners
you can drop a comment in there if you
have a question I try and get to them as
quickly as i can but shall we jump into
Android because we have a lot to talk
about here LG is teasing a new phone
series this is brand-new like just about
an hour ago news I think it which might
be released at mwc which might give us
something to cover at mwc LG is always
present at mwc and so far they brought
phones now nothing Shelley flagship
phones but they had phones two years ago
they had tablets last year they had the
extraordinary optimist view and the the
the l line up the 3 to 5 and the 7 i'm
not sure what they are preparing because
everybody's waiting for the g2 and
that's not going to happen at mwc or at
least that's what it appears right now
so i'm guessing there will be probably
some mid-range bones and why not some
tablet it's time for LG to bring out new
tablet it's been two years now I guess
it has and I mean maybe they've found a
way to make an android tablet
interesting that's not a Nexus device
and I mean the what was the name of that
Sabbath did the which was announced at
the same time as the optimus 3d it was a
3d camera tablets and have lobsters
regardless that's what's a good tablet
that was yeah it was a good tablet I
really liked it but it was running
Android which was I think honeycomb back
then yeah and that just sucked yeah we
and actually seeing the LG booth at
Aoife was my first indication that LG
was going to do something interesting
because we saw that what was that that
l7 or l9l then yeah and I'm like good
flipping through the UI and that the LG
got that booth seemed thoroughly
disinterested in talking to us he just
was not in the way
Aoife the l7 yah yah yah it was the l7
yeah l7 the yelignese rumored for this
year's MWC so who knows all right well
anyway so I'm poking around or whatever
that's been range LG devices and I'm
like this you I screams like this is
there's not there's no slow down there's
no nothing what is this running and it's
just regular old for dot 0 dot 4 and I'm
like wow that's cool and then of course
the optimus G landed and then we all had
a big you know appreciation our for that
oh speaking of appreciation hours with
Joe Levi sorry this is slightly off
topic my friend Chris and I were sitting
when Chris who listen to the podcast all
the time we're sitting just the other
day and he's complimented you before
Tony so you don't get complimented this
time around but did but Joe my my friend
Chris was like I love it when Joe's on
the podcast his voice is just so smooth
he just he knows exactly what he's
talking I just I like Joe it was like
well I will tell him I'm telling you
what well thank you Chris when I don't
sound like a robot I'll take that as a
compliment anyway we hope that LG is
something cool to share at at em do we
see that'd be nice but Joe I want you to
talk a little bit about Android and I
want you to talk specifically about this
ridiculous launcher that I watched I
watched this video last night Joe is
video called LMT launcher for android
hands on and i know i keep i always talk
about Star Trek and if you're if you
can't get used to attend dia I'm sorry
but this looks the most like a panel off
of the starship Voyager than anything
like it enjoyed accessory of everything
tell us about this launcher briefly if
you wouldn't want well first of all I
through the the Star Trek app on there
just for you Tony I have you in mind and
all the other Trek fans so I didn't want
Michael to see that at all so that was
for you right of course that's sarcasm
there guys anyway so we did the video
not long ago that was all about paranoid
android and man i got flamed for not
showing off pi which is their pie
launcher and there was a reason for that
and that reason is the LMT launcher
showing them both first would have made
the the last video extremely long and
secondly LMT will run on virtually any
rooted
android device it borrows the code from
what I understand from paranoid android
and it's not a launcher replacement per
se it's a it's a launcher with a
lowercase L meaning it launches stuff
without replacing your launch or whether
that's a stock launcher or nova launcher
or any of the other launcher apps that
are available this just supplements you
can pull it in from left the right the
bottom you can use gestures to finger
gestures from the sides the top the
bottom wherever and even some invisible
areas that I didn't go into in the video
simply because well first of all showing
off invade invisible stuff on a video is
kind of boring and second there's just
so much to do that video was already
pretty long so I left some stuff for
everyone at home to play with but very
cool very fast I had fluid as any slick
looking yeah animations on it were just
wow no doubt it's it's cool and it looks
good but my question to you Joe is does
it make you more productive hmm
absolutely yes really so you mean like
it streamlines your workflow it makes
you able to hop into the home or hop
into a shortcut faster than then
ordinarily you would be able to yes as
long as you go in and you being the end
user go in and customize it to the
things that you use most frequently
whether that's apps or toggles or
whatever the case may be as long as you
have customized it for what you truly
use all the time it's right there
literally underneath your thumb you
swipe in from the side it's there you
just move to it and it launches so
toggles are all in one place the most
frequent apps are all in one place you
don't have to go to the top of the bar
and pull it down to get into settings to
toggle your Wi-Fi on and off you don't
have to go to a different home panel to
find an app to touch or into an app
drawer right it's all right there and
it's fast it's just all under your thumb
when you want it I mean like it exactly
it looks like the end product is very
efficient it's very cool but I feel like
this app suffers from from two things or
not this F is launcher suffers from two
things that
make it frustrating to me one is that
you need rude to use it to its full
capability right or thesis at all to use
it at all yes ok and then number two is
that the setting screens are like so
many other homegrown setting screens or
so many other like budget apps settings
areas where it's just so convoluted like
there's like a list of 25 items that
it's like edit this edit this or the
distant of this and I'm like oh come on
like yeah initiative you don't offices
yeah navona off switches they have ones
and 0 1 2 they all mean something
different right and you don't really
know what they are until you play with
it yeah and they're not they're not
right next to for example if I want to
change the apps on the the second row of
the pie I can do that very easily but if
I want to show the icon I have to go to
an entirely different panel in the
settings and toggle it from 0 to 1 by
using the keyboard which by the way
doesn't default two numbers so i have to
switch from letters to numbers to make
some work out yeah yeah so yes and I
pointed that out in the video in the
article it's not the easiest thing to do
I listed some of the more common things
that most people would want to go in and
set I mean there's a whole bunch of
stuff just to make your your two finger
gestures work that's kind of silly but
that's all just under the hood and once
you've got a set it works and ultimately
I can I have to imagine that those
settings are going to become a lot more
streamlined a lot more user-friendly as
the app matures yeah I hope so and also
I mean of course I'm complaining about
the settings panel on what is it what is
actually really cool launcher so I don't
think that you know I don't want to
sound ungrateful but it's it's something
it's one of the first compelling things
I've seen in a while that would make me
consider rooting my stock Android device
for my Android device period so I think
that's a bold statement it is isn't it
well but keep in mind though I'm good a
UI nerd and to start Drake nerd and this
like takes both of those in
throws them together and it just should
put hits me right in the face with them
so but if we want to talk about talk
more about Android I want to talk about
speaking of stock Android for 22 which
is which is going to come out here in
what by the end of februari it looks
like and this looks like maybe the most
minimal upgrade ever because it might be
one of the last ones we seen before key
lime pie is that right at least
according to reports yes yeah lead
remember say it's it's been a month if i
recall well since the beginning or mid
january where we saw those Nexus 4
devices out in the wild running for
point-to-point too and then nothing and
then we receive some new Android codes i
think it was over this weekend or the
other one in AOSP and that was for
point-to-point one something and now
hopefully we will get four point two
points you mid-late februari as probably
the last minor point updates you
jellybean before key lime pie which is
expected in May at the google i/o that
idea that that confused me I mean why
have an AOSP refresh of four point two
point one revision 1.1 by the way to
revision 1.22 only release android 4.2
point2 I am so my brain hurts remind us
to your brain hurts I'm the guy sitting
over here being like yeah numbers
totally exactly but it won't with this
do you know what this does those it
makes me remember it puts me in mind of
a sad fact and that is that my erstwhile
best friend the Nexus 7 has been
misbehaving on me and it's not mine it's
just it's the software update like it
says is a direct result of the 4.2
update which I was really amped about
because of you know whatever the
horizontal home screens and all that
stuff but and I think I've mentioned
this before thing is laggy now to an
unacceptable extent Joe do you have a
nexus 7 I do have a nexus 7 I was
mentioned in that just before we for
Iran first are recording the podcast man
my cold medication is making me think
weird right now
sorry about that i was just saying for
those of you who weren't here when we
started recording the podcast i'm
running cyanogenmod 10.1 m1 on my Nexus
7 which is android 4.2 point 1 our 1.14
view numbers people out there well last
night was watching caprica for the first
time through on my no spoiler looks like
spoilers no spoilers don't leave them as
comments don't do it won't spoil it for
me guys so yeah i'm in like the second
half of the pilot and it freezes which
is odd and so i hit the back button and
the back button lights up and stays lit
up and stays lit up up and so at home
and nothing and i turned the power off
you're trying to toggle the screen off
and nothing so I hardly yeah i know i
hard reset the device you know Owen
reboot and I'm stuck at the cyanogenmod
boot logo for forever we're talking 20
minutes so ultimately had to reflash and
i'm back but i have no apps installed
yet so but and I mean if that's on
cyanogenmod right I mean yes and that's
very long story to to point out that's
cyanogenmod but it's running android 4.2
point 1 which is the same version of
android that you are experiencing the
lag in and before i went cyanogenmod I
to experience the lag and I think that's
why Google still has the 4.1 source up
available on their their images website
so you can go back to 4.1 if you want
and get that speed back probably because
now I know there's a massive like
changelog for the 4.2 update and I know
there's a bunch of stuff that I didn't
notice but basically what it did from my
perspective for the way I used my nexus
7 4.2 basically enabled a landscape home
screen for me and it changed my clock
into something that is very ugly and
that's the only practical advantages
quote-unquote i got from this update and
all the disadvantages have involved the
nexus 7 being almost an unbearably laggy
especially fridge that
device that's supposed to be running
with enhancements created by something
called project butter so I am annoyed
and because it has been so deficient I
have been relying primarily on my Nexus
excuse me gal at galaxy note 2 when I
need a set an Android tablet experience
because I'm just I'm not putting up with
it it's very frustrating Michael and FYI
yeah my nexus 7 home screen six months
later looks the same it's just gonna say
I I took all my widgets off because I'm
like maybe this will enhance performance
a little bit so it took all those often
I look at tomorrow it's like how Tony
runs his nexus Oh anyway god that's
let's that's depressing can we talk
about something that is first exciting
and then depressing again our old world
absolutely yes I like this I like it
when when we're on the cusp of
announcements from companies because
especially HTC because HTC if nothing
else knows how to like make an
announcement sound amazing I think HTC
can do like this thing where they're
like if she seemed preparing new phones
that prevent earthquakes and you know
it's like wow this is amazing and then
you get a rehash of you know that were
the 1x and it's like oh yeah and also it
vibrates a little less intensely as I go
well lame but there there's a lot of
buzz around this supposed reinvention of
the smartphone camera experience with
this this announcement and this is
really interesting that are they going
to call it are they going to change the
name of the megapixel Tony and I'm not
sure whether they gonna change them no
the megapixel stays the same dear okay
got it now HTC initiates sweeping reform
of merriam-webster dictionary ya know
the technology which is rumored to be
used in the next flagship Android phone
or maybe multiple plural other phones
made by HTC is relying on a ultra pixel
sensor which will basically be three
sensors separate sensors of 4.3 mega
pixels each summing up to a total of
thirteen point 1 megapixel
now why would this be good first of all
you'll probably have better color
saturation and probably better contrast
ratios why would this be bad because
your images will basically max out at
4.3 megapixels hmm but I mean now I
typically shoot it at eight megapixels
at five and eight megapixel camera or
you know sometimes I step it down to
five for whatever reason I mean do you
do we think that how often do you like
actually zoom in on a on a shot enough
that four point three megapixel woman
all the time because i'm using the 808
PureView well I'm sorry I didn't mean to
put that question to you Tony of course
okay so I hardly ever zoom in ya know I
just wonder and that's one of the Tony
you make the point in the article as
well it's like the the downside to this
would that would be that you know it
would be a comparatively low resolution
photo but I don't find myself pinching
to zoom in on my photos very often like
just to see more detail I don't take a
lot of distant shots usually the shots
are the photos that I take I like to
compose so that you know oh well this
can be viewed at normal zoom level
normal magnification and it looks fine
in that view I don't like have to pinch
to zoom in to see who's on the fon and
and not against this even with my 808
PureView I'm shooting in pure view mode
like 5 megapixel images and sometimes
even three megapixel images it's just
saying that it's it's interesting after
every thing we've seen this year and the
year before too had everybody going up
and up and up now HTC will probably come
and say okay screw megapixels 4.3 that's
what you get but exceptional quality and
this is the huge question will they be
able to deliver exceptional quality and
imaging hopefully yes hopefully yes and
I just got in my on my porch thanks to
our friends at HTC I just got another
droid DNA because we're about to do a
another feature on that in the days
leading up to this m7 launch which we
talked about in a second and it's just
it's crazy to me that the DNA is going
to have such a short shelf life because
Steven had an editorial recently where
he was basically like the m7 is about to
trounce the DNA
and I I think one commenter said if I
had bought a DNA I would be so annoyed
right now well if HTC is a little bit
smart they will not bring the m7 to the
US and then that way they can save the
droid DNA just like they brought the
droid DNA to the US and Europe got
nothing of course there was a japan
japanese version and broadway chinese
version is version yeah but if they are
a little bit smart you're not gonna kill
their own product they're not gonna
cannibalize it and they're gonna leave
the m7 hopefully with the same specs or
a little bit higher specs and leave the
joy DNA untouched or maybe bring the m7
to the other carriers in the state yeah
when when you do that when you release
something for 41 market and leave it out
of another one you're just ticking off
the other market yeah and that's that's
not cool now folks release release it
everywhere let people everywhere by it
because people are gonna want it and
you're not gonna win regardless of which
way you go so just let everybody have it
I think Tony is very familiar with that
feeling like I feel absolutely yeah
welcome to my shoes exactly yeah no I
mean you know mmm I think it'll be
interesting to see what features the
damn the m7 brings but I just before we
leave the story i do want to point out
that the HTC kicks off the tag line says
a new sound and camera experience in
2013 so we don't know anything about
what they're going to do with sound but
we have to assume that they're going to
do something to tweak beats so that it's
maybe not so insufferable to all that or
probably something in the vein of rich
recording from the 808 PureView from
nokia where you can basically be at a
concert a super huge loud concert and
still be able to record video without
distorting sound maybe they will
introduce stereo sound in their videos
and hopefully they're gonna up the ante
with the decibel war that would be nice
and it's for what it's worth of the
PureView excuse me the Lumia 928 has
that as well yeah that so I'm gonna go
out on a limb here and make a prediction
yeah beats is out and HTC is going to
partner with some other rapper to bring
some other kind of audio and and I'm
gonna say it's vanilla ice yes to the
extreme rock that mic like a vandal
first to arrive on scene with frost
tips acoustic noise reduction from
vanilla oh that would be horrible let's
talk about the m7 just a little bit this
is interesting that the m7 has been
spotted in the retail computer system is
a carphone warehouse the awesome
european phone retailer and by awesome i
mean big and company i hear about a lot
i have no idea whether they're awesome
or not they might be as lame as Best Buy
do you have any of those in Romania no
but I visited them in London when I was
for the galaxy s free event and it's a
chain it's a huge chain and and that's
all I visited them in London too but it
was back in two thousand six and it's my
first international trip so um it was
well before I was reporting for tech but
I was still really amped on cell phone
so I'm like oh sweet they're gonna have
the what was it the razor it was like
the original RAZR MAXX like not the
smartphone like the the flip razor
except the Razorbacks and we didn't have
that we never got that in the States
unless I'm forgetting something less
verizon got it anyway it doesn't matter
the m7 as in the retail systems
apparently the there's a silver option
blah blah blah but what's interesting is
that it is listed in these systems as
the m7 which I don't know if that's
standard for these guys if they if the
retail outlets get the the code name
like if it's a code name did you what
Tony nothing that was just cursing the
dog again the school is Terry cool one
okay there's a dog you've got I get a
new dog problem as hi mate so I don't
know if it's a standard I'm trying to
remember back to sprint I think back in
the days before the palm pre launch the
whatever the pre's code name was was was
listed in the sprint retail systems so I
think carriers do occasionally list the
code names and their in their systems
that the manufacturers give the
carrier's the code name and said the
go-to-market name if it's a secret I'm
just I guess what I'm saying is I'm just
hoping the thing doesn't launch is the
m7 well it will probably launch as the
m7 s Peter Chou showed it off on on TV
at the end of last week did he come to
m7 you know i don't i'm not sure i'm not
sure about that that's a good question i
don't know much about retail but
dunno as much so that I can see the
following things if the phone is all but
confirmed or there's no doubt that the
phone will exist retailers will often
put the phone and list the phone on
their websites and their listings for
pre-orders it's it's a purty to get some
cash early if there's a doubt that the
phone will be there they will some of
them most probably listed just like that
just to have it in their system as a
placeholder which they will update so
having a new phone point is having a new
phone listed somewhere doesn't
necessarily mean that this phone is
going to land soon now we have no doubts
about the m7 and hopefully that's gonna
happen in on the 19th but just as an FYI
this is how retailers think and operate
I keep forgetting about that yeah we
have that event at the 19th which which
i'll be going to with with brandon and
new york city and is that a simultaneous
event in other cities or is that just
near that's gonna happen in London too
okay so they're obviously yeah so
they're going to announce this thing and
they're not gonna leave the us out and
there's another rumor that Verizon might
end up launching the phones after am-7
after all the others which is
interesting no no surprise that right
like I mean we were just talking about
this like I mean if you're trying to
preserve the shelf life of a model you
launched not more than what two months
ago then you were three months ago then
you absolutely may be delay that
launched a little bit at the risk of
teeing off your perspective customers
and they're probably cut down the
brights for the droid the nhu oh they
gotta burn through inventory as well so
exactly right god it's so weird that DNA
if you know if that thing had come maybe
a little bit earlier and if it had come
to more carriers that that really could
have been a nice second half the year
thing for HC as it is it is that was I
mean it's a great device but I think
anybody noticed it I don't think there
was any effort made to push it really
and I'm not sure what HTC is doing it's
like they're they're acting like it's
their first year in technology and in
the business I mean their marketing
sucks
they're rolling out and logistics of
products sucks across the globe they're
not neither I'm not sure and if this I
say this is suicide intentional but no
oh no no it's quietly brilliant yeah but
it's so quiet nobody hears it anymore
yeah was that one of our headlines where
it was like HTC you don't need to be
quietly brilliant you need to be
aggressively outrageous or something
like that maybe if it wasn't ours a
little bit of good because it was great
it was yeah it was somebody somebody
wrote an editorial like then like yes
but um we more insanity out of HTC to
close this category out HTC as a result
of its changed fortunes is apparently
considering the low-end market in
emerging markets like China and it's
talking about releasing devices that are
going to sell new and off-contract for
as little as one hundred and sixty
dollars I think I said this is more
thing to do but but it's unless know so
for instance if you sell 1,000,000 droid
dna's in the US that's good but it's not
comparable but with selling 10 million
low end phones in China because China is
a huge market so if they focus on
low-end phones on mid-range phones in
emerging markets that's a smart move but
don't limit yourself to that but I don't
I'm is it a smart move because yeah yeah
you're pushing more volume but you're
making much less profit on a per unit
basis as but your own to sell more units
right but I mean if you sell 10 million
of one of a cheap unit and 1 million of
an expensive unit and you did the net
profit is the same like is that a good
yeah does its market share involved I
don't guess that's my I get you I
suppose I just we've seen this kind of
race to the bottom and android oems and
it's like yeah I i I've not seen this
strategy from a company that some that's
doing well obviously Samsung is
saturating the market with their galaxy
stuff I was HTC CEO I do the exact
opposite I would have HTC do super
high-end phones 64 128 internal storage
super nice screens exceptional camera
and nothing to Sara Lee act like Apple
but but always focus on delivering the
best out there yeah find all the stuff
that's weak that all the competition
isn't doing or isn't doing right and
then just knock them out of the park and
say HTC you don't like your phone get an
HTC we fixed everything that they had
screwed up and I guess I'm there's only
some of what we'll see from this
announcement on the 19th hopefully is
the new version of sense which is going
to be critical because I already think
personally that HTC does better hardware
and by Hardware I mean casing and
chassis and construction then Samsung
does and so I think that if sense is
holding them back which it is right now
because it even I just turned on this
DNA and I'm like wow this looks antic
ated and something like something i
don't want to do is you guys no matter
how responsive it is if the new sense is
a hit then I think that'll be a big big
big feather right thing up HTC along the
way somewhere shifted its course and
they went to the extreme with sense at
the beginning sense was just a skin and
as HTC of old sensible to become deeper
and deeper and deeper integrated with
the with the platform the year at one
point I thought they want to skin the
entire Android platform and that's
that's not good so keep it minimal keep
it simple and angle I'm glad to say this
Samsung has been doing a great job with
TouchWiz well and I do want to make the
point though that I think that sense was
so very necessary back in the day
because windows mobile was a very ugly
and and it didn't have enough in my turn
in my opinion in the way of plugins in
the way of useful touch interface and
what sense did when when HTC came along
was like was made at finger-friendly
absolutely then era of resistive screens
totally agree with you and that Edward
in it did the same for Android when so
when the evo launched that I think we
were still on what Froyo or something
like that it was summer of 2010 and I
thought Android was sinfully ugly and
because it was I mean the froyo and
donut and the order earlier versions
were of Android were just will but sense
came along and at least brought some
unity to it you know it was like oh wow
it tightened all the stuff that needed
tightening within Android but I think
once Android outgrew the need for that
that's when sense became a burden rep
asset they need to shift one gear lower
and you get I don't know slow down with
sense because jelly bean as it is it
works perfectly without a launcher yeah
without a custom UI so unless you are on
the Nexus 7 yeah yeah we're just not
going to talk about the next 70 let's
let's depressing but I'm just so happy
that there's news coming out of HTC so I
I'm really excited for what happened the
19th and I'm sure we'll have more to
talk about on this next week as we get
more rumors but let's go ahead and jump
into the windows phone if that's okay
unless you guys want to talk about the
galaxy young anybody want to talk about
order yet no I want to talk about the
galaxy fame the galaxy fame that's right
yes yes the fame and the young question
how many more galaxies I understand that
galaxy is an Android bren but how many I
i just lost counted them I i'm just so
i'm done i wrote that one editorial
months ago about how they're ruining the
galaxy Brandon out do you know how many
galaxies have been launched since then
and like 45 additional ones yeah uh well
I find it funny and ironic and a little
bit disappointing that Samsung has been
able to accomplish with the galaxy name
brand what Motorola wasn't able to do
with their super special licensed droid
name brand that was the same thing
motorola was trying to do and verizon by
extension and and they licensed that
term from from lucasarts yes so they
could use it and then yeah well galaxy
everybody's got a galaxy um well that's
true but I mean Joey it would be my
argument that that Motorola did
accomplish that and then excuse me in
America not not not getting area but
then Samsung came along and basically
did did that better so I think motorola
was there in America but Samsung was
doing her globally I remember back in
the day and the US market people there
was an identity crisis people
immediately thought that every engine
was a droid and they were referring to
an droids droids so they I think they
accomplish that yeah that's my point
exactly but now I that was there for
what six eight months and then it's no
longer a droid it's either an Andrew
or not gallons out of 10 it's a galaxy
galaxy well but you know I will say this
i did not start hearing the galley the
term galaxy on the street from the
mouths of normal people until the s3
launched or the ramp up to the s3 i know
this was different elsewhere but i don't
think the galaxy s2 had any kind of
traction here as far as name recognition
because it was being renamed by so many
carriers and it looked friendly on each
carrier he exactly right and it but it
was not until the three came up that
like I still always remember the first
time somebody came up to me and was like
I was that the new galaxy and like you
know what that is you know because it
was a it's that was a giant mindshare
coo for for samsung and well hopefully
motorola can can do something like like
droid again but it doesn't need to
happen again right because android
doesn't need to be introduced to the
public again like I think people are
finally getting the concept that yes
it's the galaxy or yes it's the samsung
but i think people are finally
understanding that android is an
operating system with many manufacturers
student or later the galaxy branding
will backfire I yeah I think you're
right and then it'll be interesting to
see Samsung is so transparent I mean
they're not trying to hide it they
shouldn't be trying to have they
shouldn't be ashamed of it's a good idea
but they're so clearly trying to
accomplish the success of the galaxy
brand with the achieve brand on the
windows side and it's not working
because for some reason they can't get
the ax t vas on on any US carrier which
is weird because it sounds like yogurt
we've established that yeah right okay
let's let's talk windows what I was
about to stay now that we talked windows
yeah no the windows thing is the most
important the first story and this is
the most exciting one to me that I love
this head i love this headline because
it seems to exude the hope that i feel
without being backed up by much in the
way of facts more sources attempt to
confirm nokia eos pureview windows phone
8 model and this is basically just a
news update talking about how more
people are coming out and talking about
this codenamed eos which can we just say
it's not going to be called it can't be
called that because who is it canon
we'll just do the pants off yeah so
that's obviously a code name but we here
from other sources that it looks like
it'll come to the u.s. sometime this
summer and they also claim that not only
is it more PureView it is the PureView
it'll have the HD 41-megapixel sensor on
this windows phone nokia device do you
think this is great do you think this is
I mean what do you think I mean do you
think it's unless they figured out a way
to minimize that Hardware I can't see
this happening and I don't have anything
against the hardware I like a change ft
phone in my hands but the problem is
that with the symbian / nokia OS nokia
was able to down sample the images from
a 41-megapixel sensor 28 or 25 that's
the core of the real purview I'm not
sure when those phone allows for that
yeah so I'm not even sure if there isn't
a I don't know a maximum limit for the
camera application for taking pictures
on Wonderstone and if there is a very or
if there isn't how will they manage to
do this down sampling so let me ask this
that's a good question and my question
is this with your knowledge of
architecture both of you and and you
know more code knowledge than I then I
possess would it be possible for nokia
this close partner with microsoft to
alter Windows Phone 8 in a way that they
haven't there including their own camera
app essentially they're replacing the
stock camera app with their own or is
that too deeply integrated into the OS
even for a partner like Nokia to have
access to you've got to have a driver
that talks from the app to the the
physical hardware whether or not that's
a component of the camera app itself or
what not that's been extracted away from
that's I love that word today
abstracting from the app so that you can
just draw something in I don't know that
that retained enough all right ecologic
will stand well yeah absolutely whether
or not that's how it's been implemented
I don't know it would make sense to me
as a coder to do that because then I can
have the same look and feel the same
interface across everything but I can
support all
of different hardware by having that
hardware there with its own its own
separate code base as long as they have
the same hooks and endpoints that app
can talk to any hardware what do you
think the likelihood of that is Tony I
mean you think that this is actually
going to be something that comes to
fruition or is this going to be a pipe
dream I i I'm not sure I'm keeping my
fingers crossed because a combination
between the two PureView technology is
the original peer review with the down
sampling and the optimal image
stabilization on the Lumia 920 so a
phone delivering both of these will be
my daily driver for probably one or two
years I'm not sure if they can achieve
that if Nokia wants to do something
Microsoft will probably help them
achieve it but what if what if we got
this all wrong what if this is not going
to be 41 megapixel sensor or what if it
will be a 41-megapixel sensor but it
will from the start delivered lower
images 0 NE your guess is as good as
mine I mean that that's about yeah I'm
just speculating okay let's take that
speculation another step what if instead
of 41 megapixels in one sensor what if
it's 3 13 and a half megapixel sensors
one for each of the major colors that is
also a possibility yeah but then again
you have to have some software
manipulation and rendering to overlay
those images and exports to a final
version which will be the JPEG which
needs to be done in the camera app and
we get back to full circle right so next
next speculation what if this was a
camera that let you do raw photographs
so you could literally have a dot raw
and men photographer's dream yeah but it
does windows phone support raw files not
yet yeah it would be cool to see I mean
then that's I think this all does come
back to that question of what can nokia
do with Windows Phone 8 and if anybody
can play with Windows Phone 8 to the
extent that would be necessary to make a
camera like this reality I feel like no
kids the one due to rely on and let's
not forget that nokia the nokia
executive in charge with the imaging i
can't remember his name so I'm sorry the
guy who
came after Damian dinning left he was
teasing something extraordinary imaging
wise for nokia so nokia has to have
something it's the natural evolution
nokia bell is dead the 808 PureView is
the last nakia bell phone the nokia the
last symbian phone for that matter so if
they want to move forward with their
camera technology and they want to do
that windows phone is their only option
yeah and read agreed speaking of
platform stuff i know this is AB set out
of the secrets of the run down here but
while we're talking about nokia and
platforms stephen elop has discussed the
possibility of a nokia tablet which
we've been bandying about for forever
but what's interesting about this is
that you know he does the usual thing
that CEOs have to do / he says we
haven't announced tablets at this point
but it's something we're looking at very
closely well and I thought I missed an
announcement I no no no he says we're
studying very closely the market right
now as Microsoft has introduced the
surface tablet so we're trying to learn
from that and understand what the right
way to participate would be and at what
point in time now this translates to the
following the surface RT the windows RT
and the windows 8 power tablets don't
perform that well in the market and we
don't have at the moment any reason to
jump in so we are still sitting back and
seeing whether this goes left or right
exactly now the inference that is drawn
from this though is that is that he
seems to have left the door open for the
possibility of a non-windows powered
tablet at least in word reputation or a
windows phone phablet right not with the
current resolutions of windows phone
which maxed out at 720p I was gonna say
this possible yeah hospital well I just
don't see I think it would be tactically
unwise for nokia to stray from the
windows only course and not because
windows have been treating them so well
or Microsoft's been treating them well
it kind of really hasn't but because I
don't think the answer to success for
anyone at this point is to jump into the
android tablet ecosystem I think that's
still a deathtrap
for a lot of companies particularly one
with Nokia like you know unless they
were able to announce that they had
secured some kind of awesome
relationship with Google where they were
going to be the next Nexus tablet
provider you know or something like that
no I don't think so and I don't think
this will ever happen because because of
the fact that Nokia is pretty much
relying on Microsoft and vice versa yeah
so I know that the markets are different
for tablets and for phones and they do
intersect at one point but they are
different and different and the
divisions within a company and OEM are
different but I don't see that not only
is not seeing this as a wise move I'm
finding it likely impossible to happen
yeah okay so a couple observations and
and a prediction on my side excellent
time it looks like to me and this is
just me as a kind of an industry insider
looking at it it looks like nokia and
microsoft have kind of a a bookie
relationship going on they've gambled
they've got money on the line and nokia
owes back to Microsoft and Microsoft has
guys that will come and break Nokia's
kneecaps if they don't keep staying the
course that's just my observation second
we've got microsoft who is trying to
figure out the tablet space is that
tablet space a windows 8 pro is a
Windows RT is it some kind of a expanded
up windows phone 8 in a phablet type
form factor right now the answer is they
don't know their plan all their hands to
see what wins once they have that down
then they'll start being able to go
further and out into the market I
predict or I feel rather that Nokia is
kind of waiting in the wings to see you
know let Microsoft expend all the money
to find out what works and what fails
and once they've got more of a precise
direction on what really is going to
make it then they'll get into into that
line in fact that may even be something
coming down from Microsoft to nokia
saying hey let us make them
stakes so that you're ready to go with
something as soon as we say yep here it
is this is the way we're going
everybody's going to look of this as
proven by the sales numbers and then no
key goes and flies and we have it a
tablet that looks something very much
like a mockup that we've got on that
article well you know I agree with what
you said and I think the same thing but
I think it's the wrong thing to do from
Nokia I mean this is just like if a
young boy is waiting for days and weeks
for the girl to answer whether she wants
to go up with him or not it's just the
same thing not yet sits back and waits
on Microsoft to decide what they want to
do when nokia has the power to innovate
in almost every category hardware and
software so they might need to pull this
off what if they killed symbian and they
come up with a Mego tablet that's my
point right now it's I don't know and I
don't think Nokia knows and I don't
think Microsoft nose and ask that girl's
sister out or is you gonna stay the
course and maybe send some flowers over
to the girl he asked first I don't know
but I hope I hope that note is letting
Microsoft make all the mistakes and take
all the knocks it's a normal thing to do
because they don't bathe in money so
right now you can bear the they can bear
the stress more they can bear the bad PR
more than I feel like Nokia can which
you know yeah nokia needs to be the one
that's treated with kid gloves at this
point yeah and microsoft hasn't had to
sell off their corporate headquarters to
say stall them to lease back yeah
exactly yep did I say this one last week
where there's a great quote about a
company where it's like the first step
in a massive company is to buy huge
global headquarters buildings and
inhabit them and the second step for
this large company is to sell off their
global headquarters and claim that
they're not in the real estate business
let's let's just close our windows phone
because we have got to get to listener
mail and are one piece of iOS news
windows phone 7.8 has bugs and moving I
it's expected I mean every every
platform which is new on the market has
bugs exactly windows phone 7 head bugs
then came no dough then came mango then
came portico
banking 7.8 it's a natural evolution of
a new platform android has bugs and n
druid is a top-selling platform we just
talked about the nexus 7 so as long as
they keep on fixing them as soon as
possible it's not a problem right and as
long as the carriers don't put up
roadblocks that keep you from getting
the patches which they will have bugs I
have a question for you guys I'm not
sure if you remember from the windows
mobile days when everybody was flashing
roms like five times a day it was
necessary and highly recommended that
she do a hard reset after every rom
flash do you guys or any of our readers
and listeners still do that these still
hard reset when you install an update
whether if it's official or a point
update or a likely or a custom rom this
applies to Windows Phone Android and iOS
never full stop well there you go so
that's a lot of questions all in one
whenever I get an official OTA update I
usually don't do any kind of a wipe or a
factory reset unless there's weird stuff
happening and then I do is a
troubleshooting step being that I
haven't gotten one of those in a long
time because I'm doing custom roms all
the time if I'm going from for example a
cyanogenmod nightly to another
cyanogenmod nightly and it's relatively
close meaning it you know i'm not going
from 13 months ago to one right now no I
you know I just flash it and that's it
I'm good again unless something weird
happens then do a wipe and start over
when you're switching from one person's
rom to another person's bummer or in the
windows mobile vernacular one cook to
another cook yeah absolutely when I
switch from cyanogenmod over to aokp or
too paranoid android you gotta do a
factory reset on it and just wipe
everything so you have a clean slate
because you know you're testing these
roms to see if you like it whether
you're doing that for a video we're
doing that for everyday use do you like
it well is the bug that you're
experiencing something that's in the rom
and you don't like the ROM or is it
something that's some weird hybrid
combination of settings from your last
rom
your new rom and it's not a really good
test so yes when you're going from one
cook to another cook absolutely you've
got to do your your factory set and set
your device up again but Pete should I
mean I don't think regular people should
be expected to do this with official
updates I don't know if you're doing an
over-the-air update you should not have
to do it but if you are getting weird
stuff and i would say that even goes
outside of the you know the context of
roms any time your device starts acting
wonky and it's just doing weird stuff
that you don't like and just a regular
power off power on power cycle doesn't
fix it yeah go through and wipe just
just do a factory data reset yeah and
and set everything back up again and
there you go you know my favorite
examples my favorite example of that was
i was reviewing a device for pocket now
and I had like most of the review
written and it was just lambaste in this
buggy mess and then I suddenly there's
someone pointed out to me on the team or
I just realized on my own that I had um
I had received it we've gotten a second
like we hadn't been the first string on
this one so the person who had had it
before me had never reset the device and
so I'm working with this device that
like yeah it was empty but um it it was
clearly it had been modified and I'm
like reviewing this modified device in
my god are you serious so I do like wipe
it clean and start the review all over
again and it turned out that it wasn't a
buggy device at all it was just the fact
that somebody hadn't factory reset it
yeah so that's what happened to meet you
I had a tablet i was reviewing and it
looked stock it looked all fun and fine
and it had been set up from whoever sent
it to us officially set up so it had
some apps and whatnot on there that they
wanted us to use to test review with and
would yadda yadda yadda and I did out of
respect to the company that sent it to
us I picked it up and I reviewed it as
is and my benchmark scores you know I'll
usually I'll bench and then I'll verify
I'll go out and I'll make sure that the
scores that I got are somewhat in line
with what others in the industry are
getting when they review the device yeah
bitch and I was way off I mean it was
hundreds and hundreds of points lower
what on earth is going on and it cost us
a day or two in the review time for me
to figure out what was going on wipe the
device set it up again and then all of a
sudden hate it's fast it's performing
faster than the other people who
probably got it from the same people so
more of the story factory resets are a
good thing from time to time at the
right I highly recommend it every three
months at at the most depending on your
use so before i go to reset my my
devices all of them why don't we talk a
little bit about just very briefly
actually we don't even need to talk
about it maybe I may I feel like has
released hi my Rivera our own Jaime
Rivera has released a video that reminds
me of the old Android what is it which
which one does it remind me of Android
power user does remind me of the android
guy weekly power use your
android-powered use its power user yeah
because he's released a video februari
fifth which is yesterday on top five
reasons to Jailbreak iOS 6 which i think
is pretty cool aside from releasing a
video on how to jailbreak iOS 6 on the
iphone 5 and the iPad Mini yes oh yes
yes I own and how to yeah exactly so if
you are in need iOS users listening to
the podcast all seven of you if you are
in need of jailbreaking solutions I'm
not making fun of me but I'm just saying
we don't typically have a lot of iphone
and and I was about this do you think
all seven of our readers have I've
iPhones and no android phones yeah no I
don't unless they're jailbroken in which
case this video will be very helpful so
that's there there's not a lot of iOS
news that is really more the of
discussion we're just kind of batting
around new murs and be but jailbreaking
for iOS 6 i'm sorry this has to come
from the android guy but that's huge
there been people who have been wanting
to jailbreak their iOS 6 device and
haven't been able to they've gone what's
it been a couple months without being
able to do it and now finally finally
they can jaimé shows you how and i'm a
tells you why you want to do it and then
well today posts a support document
telling you why you should not jailbreak
I said what are the disadvantages which
is detectable move yeah yeah well well
and an apple products don't need
antivirus software because no one writes
viruses for apple products right yeah
well jailbreak your device guys go out
and do it experience freedom yeah thank
you for bringing some needed excitement
to that because I just get you know not
carrying an iOS devices as a mobile
phone and only using my iPad
sporadically because it's such a beast
yeah I'm almost criminally out of touch
with the iOS user base I should
jailbreak just to see just to see what
it's like just for the heck of it yeah
just for fun let's talk litter mail
there are ample videos you could watch
to see how to be before I do before we
do that guys just I will have to leave
you I'm attending some other cool bucket
now projects most of them are related to
our Monday announcements so I'll know to
leave you with the reader mail and I'm
sorry guys if I'm not here to answer
your emails I promise you I will next
time oh right Tony we will miss you in
the listener mail segment but a few if
we get any news about 7 inch tablet
phones which we did have someone write
in about it and 7 inch tablet phone
specifically for you but anyway we'll
let you know thanks for having you guys
thanks for being here Tony that man okay
Tony's gone we can let our hair down
yeah everybody was sweet Oh excellent
hey hey welcome to the American podcast
this is the podcast where we can do
American accents just as good as tony
from roomie nicam talking about spitting
cha and all that kind of stuff and that
meanwhile Tony's Tony's back in the chat
he's like tony is actually supporting
our call right now so he's just muted
he's not actually absent um anyway let's
let's jump in listener mail because we
Joe you and I have to go to I have to we
got a bunch of stuff to do but we're
very excited about finally bringing back
listener mail it for like four weeks and
we had a big backlog and once again if
you didn't hear it last time if you just
jumped to this time code please when
you're sending us listener mail keep it
below four or five sentences I said
three before but it's not enough because
we just can't read them all and and by
the way that that's not like two
sentences
that are a page and a half long yes a
succinct stuff cuz we yes we read them
but then we've got to kind of try and
summarize them and distill them down and
we may lose out on it yeah you're really
trying to ask so so help us help you the
pelvis uh this is from Christian from
Germany he's got a question who the poor
guy lost his motorola razr this weekend
and the person who found it apparently
stole it and took his him out and that
really sucks but after the initial anger
Christian says I thought about all the
stuff i have on my phone which is now in
the hands of a complete stranger like
photos documents and all the access to
services like Facebook mail and dropbox
and Twitter so I had to change all these
passwords right away to prevent this
mistake for the next time I would like
to know if you secure your devices
against such things and how or do you
leave your data mostly unsecured like me
and can you recommend some good apps for
the scenario i will just come out right
you're giving my answer right away no I
if I lose my device i'm generally
screwed i have to change all my
individual passwords up to make sure i
don't forget any of them and half the
time because they annoy me so much I
don't even have a pattern unlock or a
pin on lock on my lock screen because I
it's a pain I don't like it it's it's
irritating so the answer from me is no
and it's stupid and don't be like me so
and and also apparently you know if
you're a mugger out there come find me
on the street because I'm an easy mark
yeah find find him he looks just like
iron man but he's not thank you except
you know high-end drug iron man Joe
apparently so Christian here's what I do
first and foremost I'm less concerned
about losing my device because I can buy
a new and it's only stuff yes it hurts
to go out and buy a new one but that
aside second like you said you can
always go in and change all of your
passwords so you're not going to be
losing your identity and whatnot and
causing that just do it quickly like
like you mentioned that you did so that
not a big deal all of the pictures that
are on there the videos that are on
there I don't know about you I've got
kids and I've got a ton of pictures of
my kids on there that I don't want to
lose that data to me is priceless so
for that reason I've got a set up so
when I take a picture it'll
automatically go up to my dropbox I have
not lost my pictures so keep your data
safe and secure whether that's kids
pictures like mine or whether that's
business documents or whatever your data
is more valuable to you and the cost of
recreating it that or maybe not even
being able to recreate it then then the
device or the passwords itself so it's
good advice that aside now what about a
limit to securing yeah what about like
eliminating that if I the information
that's already on the device like not
only do I want to save my pictures but I
also want to remove my photos and videos
and things from the hands of someone
else like there are remote why tap apps
available right yes and that kind of
goes hand in hand with where I'm going
next secure your device however you
think you need to secure it if you've
got sensitive information on their
secure it I secure it just because I've
got kids who like getting on and doing
all kinds of stuff to my device and i
don't like them doing that let alone a
mugger or whoever else right so i use
and it works for me i use androids face
unlock with a 4 by 4 pin pattern behind
it and on the nexus 4 and the other
Nexus devices that works wonderfully
well for me the nexus 4 will see my face
and unlock so fast sometimes I don't
even know that it's unlocking the times
when it doesn't recognize me because I'm
wearing a hat or just got up or the
Lighting's too low yes i still have to
do that pattern but with cyanogenmod
I've got a 4 by 4 pattern instead of the
stock 3 by 3 my son has a six by six
it's ridiculous but it's a little bit of
inconvenience offset by they have the
camera being able to unlock it for you
and it's just that extra added security
that it's yeah you really got to do
something to try and get past that I'm
glad to guess looks can wipe it and get
you know me it works for it works well
for you because I yeah I can't do based
on knock anymore because just takes so
much time on my devices and also it's
shooting you from the most unflattering
angle ever
where it's like every time you unlock
the thing it's like oh hi that's what
people look like when they're looking up
at me from six storeys below okay yes
exactly and if you have or have not
tried face unlock yet go ahead and try
it but then go and do a improve face
recognition whatever it's the approved
thing in there and take at least four or
five more pictures and we go through
that process it will improve that
recognition so much and speed it up and
it's yeah don't stop with just one do at
least two or three or four I got like
six or seven that I've recorded some
with hats some with facial hair some
without just however choking so do not
interrupt you but we do have an app for
like doodoo of a third party app for
remote rights management on a device
that use I have two things so the first
thing is lookout mobile security and I
have the free version I don't pay for it
but if I ever needed to I could that
will help me find my device wherever it
is it's got a new feature called signal
flare so when your device is about to
run out of batteries it will send up a
virtual signal flare it'll turn on your
gps and send out a here i am i'm about
to die just so you can come and look for
my kirkus this is where i was when i
turned off ah so yeah why they didn't do
that in the first place I don't know but
it's beautiful and so helpful and then
of course you still have the ability to
find your device later by asking for it
through the web interface of lookouts
website whatever that is so I've got
that that also lets you do some backup
stuff as well which I've turned off
because I have dropbox that I use for it
and then it also I believe it's a
premium feature it also gives you the
ability to remote wipe your device so
you can just take care of all of that so
that's the first thing that's called
look out that's look out ok yes I highly
recommend it if you've already lost your
device they have an app that you can
remote install called plan be that does
some of the same things and will help
you try to locate your device if you
forgot to install look out before it got
stolen or misplaced it's called and last
but not plan B by the same people
and last but not least is if you're
hooked up to your companies or schools
exchange server chances are you have
already added that company as a remote
administrator to your device and you
have remote wipe capabilities through
that so I can remote wipe through
exchange from my my day job as well if I
if I ever needed to that is awesome
thank you I knew you'd be the one to
answer that question because I stupidly
don't use any of that unless i'm using a
review device in which case i do use the
lock screen thing and I do take some
other steps to do it but thank you thank
you for the attention feedback as well
now so prevention good question
Christian it is a good question and the
the next one we have Christian thank you
the night for me half as elves is from
Germany as well as from Martin florin
who asks and I'm not sure I feel like
we've I feel like we've like asked this
question before we've had this question
before maybe it's just one of the buffer
for as long as once to know is there a
gadget like a 10 inch or even bigger
eating display that shows calendar
content from several Google accounts in
month agenda week and Dave you it would
be very useful to have one in the
kitchen living room on the wall which is
a really really good point I haven't
found a single thing like it now I
Bennett I balance about three or four
google calendars in my life and I some
of them are not mine some of that you
know we entered interact and it would be
really great to have them all in an
aggregate view on something that for
dedicated purpose I have not been able
to find anything in my quick googling it
seems right for someone to to just you
know an opportunity for someone to come
along and say hey I've got some
engineering prowess I've got some cool
idea and I've got the desire to start a
Kickstarter project like it sounds like
some small nice little project that
could be is right in the fringe of
mobile like we probably actually
wouldn't cover it but it's a cool enough
idea that I wanted to bring it up what
do you think so i haven't seen anything
that's a ink that i could recommend for
that but i'm thinking you could probably
repurpose some older tablets you know go
and grab a nuke rooted throw a custom
rom on there
you know I need to be touchpad on our 10
stone sure absolutely even even if
you've got an old tablet laying around
just put it in a nice looking frame hook
it up to some power you know put it in
front of a power outlet in the wall and
and go from there regarding the second
half of the question so that's the
device part the second half is can you
do what he's actually asking and I'm
using the the calendar app that you can
download from the Play Store not the one
that comes pretty built in with with
your stock Android devices but this is
going to vary based on whoever your
manufacturer is different calendars may
support different things I for example
have I don't know how many i think i've
got six calendars that I subscribe to
right now I've got my pocket now
calendar my day job calendar my personal
calendar my life's calendar I've got
some us holidays calendar yada yada yada
all of them show up color-coded on this
calendar view so really it looks like
all you need is something that will
display that that stock calendar in a
nice frame that's gonna get power to it
has an internet connection and you
should be good to go I'd really
recommend trying to repurpose an old
tablet even if that means throwing a
custom rom on it that's really good a
good advice and I actually didn't
realize that until you mentioned it i
used the HP touchpad on a touchstone
sitting in my kitchen not for a calendar
but for like a photo slideshow just to
fill a corner that's not filled and if
you you know if you wanted to throw a
custom rom on there there still is it
far as i know they're still cooking up
roms for that device and that would be
really really awesome if you could find
a way to do that unfortunately it
doesn't have the advantages of ink it
doesn't have the kind of minimalistic
cool factor and it also requires a lot
more power than an e-ink device would
but also martin if you are not satisfied
with anything on the market if there's
something you've missed but if there's
something we've missed rather in the
comments in the podcast geez I can't
talk please commenters leave Martin some
suggestions in the comment thread but
Martin if you can't find it you should
see if you could build it because that
would be awesome yeah just whatever you
do document it take
pictures Yeah right what you wondered
what worked what didn't throw that up on
a blog somewhere and and let the
community help you with it that's one of
the huge advantages of Android is we've
got community to behind us to help us to
do that stuff that we love doing that
exactly I have two more pieces of mail
here and then we'll get it close it up
this is from gel Loman I'm sure I got
that wrong with from the Netherlands who
listen to our podcast every single week
and loves listening to it so keep up the
good work thank you we'll do it question
is smartphones have evolved from single
core dual core pretty slowly but then
they went from dual core two quad core
relatively fast so now that we have the
samsung exynos octa processor announced
the question is do we think that
eventually we're going to be walking
around with phones that have a 48 core
cpu and a 72 core GPU or do we think
that processor development will stagnate
and they'll start focusing on screen and
camera more I've personally not knowing
anything once again I'll just jump in
here I think that we are going to
plateau at some point because the
usefulness of all these cores is not
going to last forever Joe what do you
think look at desktop and server
computers as a model yes you can have
more than four cores people usually
don't when you start talking about GPUs
your graphics processor those have cores
out the wazoo I don't even know if they
count them anymore they just say it's
got like a bazillion core and that's
because graphics does things a little
bit okay a lot differently than CPUs do
when you switch that back over to mobile
yes we had we had single course for a
long time we had dual cores that came
out we had them for a little while and
then almost immediately we jumped right
up to quad core we've got some devices
that have quad +1 and now we've got the
octa-core which really isn't an
octa-core it's a dual quad-core and just
kind of kind of funky the way that is
we're probably just like with desktop
computers going to see things start to
level off at least with the CPUs the
return on investment just doesn't get
there on you you start putting more and
more in in
you get a little very little return back
for that the only sub note that I have
to that is arm's big.little concept
where you have big processors that do
big heavy work and then you have little
processors that are very very
conservative on power that do background
processing or do the processing while
your screen is off and you don't care
how fast it goes those might break the
paradigm and we might see a like we have
the octa-core which is a 4 by 4 that
does something more like that but i
think we're probably going to start to
level out we're not going to see you
know true octa-core zeni time soon but I
think we'll start seeing a lot more of
the the big little dual quad core
systems out there as we progress coming
over to GPUs we're going to see the same
kind of thing happening in video showed
us they I don't even know how many they
have in their new Tegra 4 if you don't
know I'm not going to tell you yeah it's
I think that's the 72 number I mean it's
a lot of course it's ridiculous but
again graphics they're rendered
differently then just regular processing
stuff is so that the sky's the limit we
may see that continue to go up
exponentially I don't even know the one
thing that that was missed out of that
question yes I hope they'll look at a
better screen better camera moreover i
want to see better battery we've we've
got to do something with battery
technology especially considering yeah i
mean the more I used to throw in there
whether it's more cores or I mean I feel
like the there was a really interesting
discussion that kind of temporarily
cropped up when the quad core thing was
announced about how adding there was
this big fight between two camps that
were like adding more cores will kill
battery life and then these other guys
like adding more cords will make it more
efficient and we kind of ended up with
the situation where battery life didn't
really go anywhere and maybe that's a
result of one of those things being true
and other factors playing into it i
don't know but all i can say Joe is that
I agree with you that's not true that's
not true there are two things I can say
one is that we're really short on time
too I i agree with you i think i usually
agree with joe Levi is the smart thing
to do because he's very smart guy
it well Tony's the guy who disagrees
with everything I say but to your last
point yes it's it's the old adage if
you're running short on gas you need to
drive home as fast as you can so you can
get home before you run out of gas the
logic just doesn't hold up with with
gasoline but with processors it kind of
does if it takes 10 seconds to complete
a task with one core then that's 10
seconds of battery that you just ate up
if you have another another system that
only has the well it has quad core it
takes one second yes it might be taking
up twice as much power to do that but
you're completing it 10 times faster so
that's a net savings of I've energy
units at whatever so so there's
advantages and disadvantages there and
eventually we get to the breakdown of
well yeah but it's going to take you
more gas to get home at 100 miles an
hour then it would at 30 so that's
interesting I never actually thought
about in those terms this is the first
time not because you're dry Joe but
because I don't I don't generally care
about this is the first time I've been
interested in this in this segment of
the conversation that's interesting
let's talk about that more in a future
cast yeah yeah because I love learning
new things about things that I formerly
didn't care about and finally a piece of
mail from Ryan our old friend Ryan I
have a question about project butter in
android for that one does project butter
help reduce lag and things like the
keyboard or will improvements only be
found in home screen animations Ryan has
a device he's is about to be upgraded to
jellybean if the keyboard like is not
improved its she says it's time for a
new phone thanks for the mail ryan i
bring this up only to stress that if you
jumped right to listener mail you should
go back and listen to our android
section where I complain about this for
like 10 minutes it does project the
short answer Ryan is that project butter
and jelly bean has been shown not to be
infallible and all you need to do is
pick up a nexus 7 with the stock rom to
find to see that but i don't know
specifically if it's improvements apply
to the keyboard or just a animations Joe
so in a nutshell project butter is the
google attempt to make things buttery
smooth as
actually what they're doing and guys I
know I'm oversimplifying this for in the
interest of time so don't flame me in
the comment it essentially takes the
screen the touch screen the processor
GPU all of that stuff and it runs them
together in a synchronized clock and it
increases all of them to i want to say
60 frames per second so everything is
running lockstep at the same time it's
all in cadence with one another nothing
is waiting on anything else it's all
there just using that common clock to to
help coordinate everything so it's
running simultaneously you know your
inputs and your screen responses look
the same it really really helps we saw a
huge improvement in android 4.1 ice
cream sandwich it was tremendous ice
cream it was smooth project butter was
just smooth 4.1 jelly bean right I'm
sorry yes okay jelly bean jelly bean 4.2
on the other hand introduced some
weirdness that has been experienced as
lag despite us having a you know project
butter in there your experience is going
to vary so you're going to have more
advantages going up to jelly bean then
you'd have sticking with ice cream
sandwich or whatnot any versions before
that unless it's got skin on so yeah
well there's still a lot of stuff under
the hood that you're going to get
advantages of yeah it skins are going to
take away some of the the visual stuff
that you would have seen in some of the
integrations with social networking I
own that otherwise would have been there
yeah no I'm sorry feature wise that's
true but I only say that because in
terms of sheer performance the object
the LGU I running on top of 404 is
smoother than anything I've ever seen
running jelly bean yes and is the
Samsung the TouchWiz skin actually gets
very very smooth even on those earlier
versions as well so just from it from a
UI performance standpoint that's all I
meant so to the specific point of the
question is keyboard lag improved the
new keyboard itself that comes with
jellybean is significantly improved over
previous keyboards
it's my favorite one out there I'm not
running a third-party keyboard anymore
because it is so good and it works for
me keyboards however very very personal
you are either going to love it or you
are going to hate it there's really no
middle ground true I think that they
will not leave that Google will not
leave this 4.2 bug issue you know that
this lag that you're this bug that we're
experiencing is lag unaddressed so four
point two point two is supposed to
address that we don't know what's in it
we don't know when it's going to come
out but rumors have it that's the main
reason for four point to point to as
close as they're going to do it too key
lime pie I mean why why I would think
that he that loves right well but we had
we'd love to talk a little bit more
about this but I think we do have to jet
Ryan so if sorry we can't give you some
concrete advice there but hopefully this
gives you a little bit more insight and
hopefully you can make an informed
decision about that and if that involves
maybe loading a custom rom you know
where to go to find that issue we know a
guy you know again anybody who who wants
to and is rooted franco.kernel just a
little teaser give that a try oh who are
we gonna see something on that I'm not
gonna say whether we are or not you'll
just have to stay tuned to talk it now
just keep it locked to this channel you
same bat-time same bat-channel that's
good that's good enough Tony here to do
as he will laugh um guys thing is that
I'm supposed to be evil I don't know
what it's supposed to be it's just
hilarious it's just a hospital I'll of
it when he doesn't um that's that's it
for listener mail thank you for writing
in everyone and we do have to run
because I have to edit this podcast for
six hours because there were so many
errors because say yeah it's good if
anyone from skype is listening I would
say this call is going to get one star
but all six of these calls that it's
taken to get to this point podcast are
going to get one star god it's just the
worst and we are still determining an
alternative solution but we working out
are packing up live problems first we're
dealing with technical issues this month
it's fun shoujo closing thoughts before
we forget
here I'm just gonna go with my stock
even with all the technological problems
that we've had and the difficulties in
the frustrations look at where we are
guys we've come a long way the future
looks bright enjoy what we have it's
only going to get better amen I can't
wait for ELQ cars and with that let's
close it out that's going to do it this
is episode 030 of the pocket now weekly
and you must find us on Twitter we have
a lot of fun there Anton is at an Tandy
Naja a and T 0 and DNA gy Joe is at Joe
Levi Jo ele VI and i am at captain two
phones follow pocket house official
accounts pocket now tweets is on twitter
pocket now at facebook and google+ i do
I say it all the time but you should
leave us a review on iTunes an Xbox
music because it helps us get discovered
and it helps more ears get onto the
podcast and if you like the podcast it
would be great if you would help if you
have a topic question or suggestion for
the podcast or you just want to say hi
we do answered listener mail from time
to time at podcast at pocketnow.com
thank you genuinely for listening it's
been fun and we'll see you next week
thank you and good day no Everett like
Joe is Joe was screwing up even when he
was wired a couple weeks ago you were
screwing up and like Brandon convert now
I think we all have problems i think
it's if we all have a shoot something we
all know I'm shit man I am wired to the
interwebs yes so sorry you were saying
Joe about the carrier's getting in the
way right no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
