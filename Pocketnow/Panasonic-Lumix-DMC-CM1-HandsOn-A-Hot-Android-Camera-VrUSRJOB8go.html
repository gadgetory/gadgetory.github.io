is mobile centric coverage spectrum well
how about a smartphone counter side I
might add to Houston with pocket now
here at CES 2015 checking out the
Panasonic Lumix cm one now let's be
clear the CM one is first and foremost a
camera so much so in fact that Panasonic
doesn't even call it a smartphone but
instead a communication camera of course
every camera needs good glass and
Panasonic is packing a 20-point one
megapixel like a lens to do the job that
lenses fixed at 28 millimeters F 2.8 and
powered by Panasonic's own venous
imaging engine which is the same
dedicated LSI that you'll find on the
rest of their Linux lineup that means
that the shots you take will be quick to
focus and quick to capture taking a look
around the smartphone side we've got a
stock build of Android 4.4 KitKat with
no word on lollipop availability the
only software changes you'll notice our
custom camera and gallery apps both of
which are built to support the RAW
format the viewfinder is laced with a
myriad of manual controls from exposure
and metering settings to live filters 4k
shooting burst mode HDR and plenty more
it's a bit jarring at first but if
you've ever used other Panasonic cameras
in the past you should feel right at
home of course no camera is completely
ready to step shutter button and
Panasonic thankfully delivered here with
a price tag of $9.99 and no official
word on US release you're probably gonna
have to wait a while to see the CM one
for yourself though Panasonic is in
talks with American carriers as we speak
and yes we'll review it if and when it
comes stateside for much more from the
