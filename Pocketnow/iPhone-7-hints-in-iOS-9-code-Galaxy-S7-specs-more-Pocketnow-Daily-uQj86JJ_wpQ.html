to what to expect with the iphone 7
Microsoft Research envisions a new and
creepy way to do video calls we get more
details on the specs of the galaxy s7
I'm hi I'm Adam iveta and my son says
that he should handle the jokes going
forward but his first joke was just
terrible this is pocket our daily the
official news today begin with Panasonic
a company we rarely talk about except
for the fact that they're cm-1 the
smartphone camera from CES 2015 was
really hot up until we learn about the
specification and it's one thousand
dollar price tag still it is a very
compelling option for a camera that's
also a phone and the company has just
launched the revamp it's now called the
CM 10 and if you thought you'd get new
specifications actually no you're
getting the exact same ones with the
difference that this one doesn't make
phone calls and it costs 150 dollars
less so if you're in the market link to
the description full details then we
move the spotlight over to Samsung we
learn more about the galaxy s7 we've got
some benchmarks that claim
specifications we've got a 5.1 inch quad
HD display android sixth auto dot one
marshmallow we've got four gigs of ram
apparently it starts at 64 gigs of
storage or that could just be that
particular listing and we also get the
16 megapixel in 5 megapixel combo for
the camera pretty much a very similar
phone to what we already have except for
the RAM boost let's see what we get and
for those of you who find video calls
awkward because you have to hold the
phone in your hand and just lift it up
it seems that Microsoft is working on an
alternative this is from Microsoft
Research it's called room to room at
what it uses is a projector and a Kinect
scanner for it to be able to project a
person standing in front of you as if
you were actually having a conversation
with somebody this is rather creepy but
I feel that this is a very cool idea and
it could probably be the principal to
holographics in the future stay tuned
for that and I'll talking about the
iphone 7 we have some very interesting
coach strings on iOS 9.3 that make the
headphone jack optional meaning that it
allows up developers and it allows
pretty much apple / say so
actually build the OS and accommodate
the fact that the phone could have or
not have a headphone jack which means
that yet seems that Apple is going to
move away from this and I feel that
that's something data let's just hope
they add another jack let's say by
charging through USB 3.1 and a lightning
port for the headphones would be an
amazing change let's just see if it
happen and finally the hot news that
they have to do with Gartner analytics
as the company is just published figures
4 2016 and they aren't extremely
interesting particularly because 1 it
predicts that smartphone spending is
going to drop and two because it's still
predicts that the amount of phones that
are being sold will be on a rise so the
analytic here pretty much says that
phones are either going to get cheaper
or people are going to start spending
less on phones because we've now have
the premium mid-range which gives you
the option to have a really good phone
and not necessarily have all the specs
of a flagship smartphone or the price
tag but it does lead me to the question
of the day if you have the chance right
now let's say if you have the chance to
buy the galaxy s6 or a galaxy a series
smartphone which is a premium mid-range
which one would you pick would you go
for the black ship or will you go for
the premium mid-range and save yourself
a couple of bucks in my case I always
prefer to go for the black ships but
then some premium mid-range phones are
actually really good particularly from
Oppo because they perform just as well
leave us a comment down below the
dilemma is very interesting we'd love to
know your opinion and friends as always
you know the way it goes if you want to
