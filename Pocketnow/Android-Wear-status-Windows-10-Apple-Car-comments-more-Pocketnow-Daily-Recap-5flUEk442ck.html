wrong with my natural highlights to
seeing you without a tommy hilfiger polo
is weird that shirt makes you look fat
and yeah right back at you man we have a
more premium look now and I'll make sure
not to put myself on discount after that
one that's right it's that time of the
week I am hi Mary that this is pocket
now and this is the bargain house daily
recap for last week brought to you by
Squarespace so on Monday ask you what do
you think about VR headsets as LG has
just launched the 3d our headset in
certain markets for the LG g3 a good way
to start we have 447 comments out of
which sense says it's been what more
than a year since these VR headsets
started showing up and I still have no
idea what the hell they are good for um
they're good for gaming and there are
other uses out there but still I do get
your point they haven't taken off and I
think there's a reason for that we saw
the cardboard design we've signed the
Samsung gear stuff and probably this
free one will do but the fact that it's
free tells us a lot about how bad a
technology is right now good point and
flame says why would I need a VR for my
mobile phone sorry if I'm gonna be going
around in public with my g3 strapped to
my face if I want to be our gaming I'll
pick up an oculus not an attachment for
a phone good point it's better to have
something that stand alone than have
your phone on your face and your battery
going dead at some point then Harrison
says I think the VR will be more
mainstream when a it gets cheaper and be
when it stops looking like something
that's eating my face and you're
watching too many alien movies but yeah
true about the cheaper part though we'll
see how this LG one performs being free
then on Tuesday asked you if you would
prefer for Apple to improve its car play
services that haven't taken off or if
you want an apple car as the rumors are
that Apple has hired as many as 50 Tesla
employees and apparently that's a
thousand employee project from Apple
there are a lot more rumors about this
we have 448 comments out of which CD
gaming says I think I would rather have
an update to carplay car play is just
the pretty ugly and the benefit of being
able to install car plate in any car if
you want it's pretty great I do agree
with that
would rather have a service that I could
install on any car then have a car that
I would have to buy which is definitely
not affordable then 10 says I think the
I car is going to be a self-driving car
just like the google one anyone agree
the difference is the Google car still
not being sold that up assess oh boy I
can already see it the Apple car last
five hours of driving cost the same as a
Lambo and if I hit a pole or something
the car will be totally destroyed and
people will wait on the totally new
Apple stores that now sells cars and the
specific feel for the I car for months
um yeah you're talking about experience
here that on Wednesday asked you what do
you think android wear needs to do to
become popular as well there is the
study that shows that it's only a tiny
fraction of the amount of wearables that
are being sold in the market we have
1078 comments thanks a lot guys out of
which coyote says android wear needs to
become a standalone device to become
successful i would be able to forget my
phone at home when i go out and jog and
i still retain all the phone's
functionality then it wouldn't be
Android wear it would be an android
phone and a watch but there are products
that can do this and that haven't taken
off light for example the Sony
SmartWatch 3 for example can lock your
run without the need of your phone but
then again yeah the lack of
compatibility of applications is really
what's making this sluggish so I do get
your point and Erin says well Android
wear was only in its first generation
last year prices will go down and the OS
improvements Willie made as time goes on
then we can expect to see Android wear
take off and have seventy percent of the
SmartWatch market by 2020 we'll see for
me it's a battery life issue really the
lewis says just like android on a
smartphone it was mediocre in the
beginning but as the years went by nick
got better now it's the biggest platform
in the world as you said that same will
happen for Android wear as well could be
we'll see if they figure it out again i
think it's a battery life issue but on
Thursday ask you something new to share
your theft cases or memories as well the
news are that Apple's investment in the
whole activation lock feature has made
a lot better for iPhones it has dropped
the theft rates by forty percent fifty
percent in some countries we have 370
comments out of which Prince Armstrong
says ain't nobody stealing my smartphone
I will fight you to death if I have to
it's mine I wish everybody could
actually say that that's true after it
got stolen then harsh says was walking
down the street with my new iphone 5 was
very happy that I finally bought an
iphone then suddenly a man pushed me and
starts running I thought that he was
just in a hurry but when I reached my
destination I realized that my phone had
been stolen that as far as that I had
not activated find my iphone please do
so android the vice manager or find my
iphone do so now if you have it then Abu
says I had my sony ericsson k750 stolen
for me years ago since then I think I
must have found there were 15 phones
that someone had lost them every single
time I made sure that to find that who
would belong to and returned it really
cool dude paid forward and I think
everybody should do that but the point
being is Apple has doing something
really cool with activation lock cool
with Android device manager these are
new laws that are forcing people to not
be able to activate a phone after stolen
or found which is really cool and it's
going to make that a mainstream going
forward and then finally on Friday I
asked you if Windows still in its
preview would be enough to make you
switch to Windows 10 as up the preview
for phones is now out and we tested it
then we like some things we didn't like
others we have three and 61 comments out
of which one of them says after Windows
10 update the platform should have more
companies making windows phones like
Motorola LG at other brands in that case
I might pick it up and hopefully but the
thing is Windows 10 doesn't really look
that different to Windows Phone
currently so that's going to be
interesting Michael he menaces it's hard
to switch from android OS or iOS the
windows zone because of the many apps
that are not windows compatible if
windows managed to get more apps and
update them faster people won't have an
excuse to try windows you know the app
gap is getting closed the problem is not
really the app gap anymore it's really
how the apps perform try Spotify for
example you have to refresh
modify every single time you launch it
on windows phone so what's the point
about having Spotify have it play so
badly really that's what Microsoft needs
to focus on when Jasmine says no update
for the 1520 Wow and I felt the same
about my lumia 930 only the 830 got the
update and that's really bad I hate that
fragmentation problem with Microsoft
really a lot of people that adopt that
Windows Phone years ago became sour over
what happened between windows 7 and
windows 8 windows 6.5 in windows 7 and
it seems to happen with Windows 10 again
so I don't know I get your point I agree
with it and sadly oh my god we'll see
what Microsoft does going forward this
