and kind of surprises everyone we get
some interesting leaks of the HTC One m8
Prime and those of you interested in the
galaxy note 4 we got some more leaks as
well I'm hi Mary man I and if I look
kind of yellow sorry guys I'm testing a
new office as we're kind of moving right
now but this is parking out daily let's
begin today with what's official as
you'd assume that the departure of
victim d'autre from google would mean
that Google+ would be dead and there
were tons of leaks about that that
apparently the social network was going
to die but given the fact that there are
so many things that are integrated it
was logical for the company to do
something about it and we do see a new
redesign that's reaching Android
smartphones today hopefully hopefully
you'll get it and it won't make google+
any more compelling or it won't get you
any more people to follow you but it
will look nice now let's talk about a
compelling product that a lot of people
are waiting for the Moto 360 which is
probably the cutest SmartWatch that's
coming soon with Android wear and rumors
have it that if you're interested in
getting the SmartWatch it will be
available in July hopefully and
apparently it will cost you 260 eros
which would probably some up to two
hundred and sixty dollars as well the
United States we still don't have
specifics on that but trust me a lot of
us are waiting like this like a hawk
I'll talk about the Galaxy Note 4 from
Samsung yes that is the favorite phablet
of a lot of people including me and we
already have the rumors of what to
expect for the future apparently this
product will make it to Aoife as well as
all previous three models have
apparently we will retain the 5.7 inch
form factor because of how big could
that thing get and we're not sure if
Samsung's gonna play it safe and keep
the same design we're actually hoping
that it does because it is quite cool
right now probably better materials but
it seems that we are getting a quad HD
display on this phablet and there are no
rumors of a new form factor that we
still can't figure out so stay tuned for
that let's let's talk about another
product that's anticipated the HTC One
m8 prime that is apparently going to be
launched soon what can we expect from
this phone apparently it's a new version
it'll have new materials etc but we get
the first leaked renders courtesy of
efflux and
it's kind of protruding camera which
probably means that HTC will consider
breaking as optical image stabilization
and hopefully have more megapixels of
HTC hopefully that's the case we're
still not sure but the design does look
quite cool and we wonder exactly what
composite materials are being considered
here and finally for the very hot news
of the day Microsoft has just announced
the surface pro 3 and no surface mini we
don't know exactly why but there is the
surface pro 3 and you know it's not a
surface pro 2 or surface pro this is
actually a more compelling tablet a lot
of price ranges from eight hundred
dollars to two thousand dollars a lot of
specification but the coolest thing is
that it got bigger so now you can use it
for more things and that's not what she
said but obviously a bigger tablet does
lend to more productivity and it did get
thinner so it's easier to handle and
honestly guys it's really cool lot of
great specifications here it's hard to
know if people will want to buy this
thing as yeah it's not the price of your
average $200 tablet but still that
leaves use the question of the day what
are your thoughts on the surface pro 3
when you buy the tablet because in my
particular case you know because of how
tight i am on the ipad and the mac
lineup i don't think that i'd switch but
i would highly recommend this tablet so
far and i really can't wait for a review
unit to arrive so leave us a comment
down below what do you think and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
filming she follow us on talking out
comment subscribe trying to channel as
well you'd also follow me on twitter i
underscore a better please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi meri behna thank you very
much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
