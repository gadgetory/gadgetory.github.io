now the key to taking great photos with
the Samsung Galaxy s3 is to be a
professional photographer that's the key
to taking great photos no matter who you
are but I'm not a professional
photographer I envy them
but I'm not one so this video is not
about technique and it's also not about
apps the Google Play Store has many apps
that will enhance the functionality of
an android phones camera but the galaxy
s3 offers a lot of functionality in the
camera app right out of the box and
often the way to take a great shot with
the galaxy s3 is just to drill down into
that camera app and see all the options
there are I'm going to take you on a
guided tour and we'll find out how to
take great photos with the Samsung
Galaxy s3 so basically I want to run
down the features of the galaxy s3 is 8
megapixel primary camera here and see
what they're all about
and show some sample photos from each
shooting mode and we'll take a look at
all the options or most of the options
the camera offers Samsung is thrown in
more options with this camera phone than
I've had on some standalone cameras
there's almost too many options you'll
see what I mean ok so the first thing
you or any mobile photographer needs to
do obviously is to open the camera app
there's no hardware key on the galaxy s3
which is a shame but thankfully the
TouchWiz skin that Samsung is built
allows for this to happen pretty easily
you can place a camera shortcut right
down here in the lockscreen dock if you
want to and you can just swipe up to
open the camera that way or if you want
to you can enable the advanced motion
gestures that we've talked about in
another video and from the lock screen
you just press and hold a thumb on the
lock screen and rotate the phone to
landscape and it launches the camera
that way Adam lean just mentioned in his
AT&amp;amp;T galaxy a3 review he finds that
pretty cumbersome I like it but
different strokes you have you have
options is the point so once we're
inside the camera app here on the right
we've got the shortcut to the gallery
here shutter button here and the toggle
to video mode up here we're going to
leave that alone for now because we're
only doing stills in this one on the
left where all the action is up top is
that
hoggle for activating the front-facing
camera a lot of people use this camera
for self-portraits but remember it's a
much smaller sensor up here on this lens
it's only 2 megapixels are really only
1.9 compared to this 8 megapixel monster
on the back so there's also no flash so
it's performance won't be nearly as good
really it's best used for video calling
only so you're probably want to leave
that one alone the next one down here is
the flash toggle this lets you set the
galaxy s3s flash manually off manually
on or you can set it to automatic I do
not trust it like most phone cameras the
auto flash is a little aggressive the
phone will use the flash at the first
sign of dimness so I tend to find that
the flash on phone cameras tends to wash
out the photos so I tend to avoid the
flash whenever possible and I leave it
off the middle option here is where
things get interesting this menu allows
you to select the cameras shooting mode
which is where I've had the most fun
playing single shot here is pretty
self-explanatory you just set it there
you get focus and then you take a single
photo that is the default shooting mode
burst shot is something I first played
with on the HTC One X if I can select it
there and it's very very awesome the
deal with burst shot is this when it's
enabled holding down the shutter button
will snap up to six frames every second
for a total of 20 individual frames this
is nice if somebody's sliding into home
in baseball or those annoying shots when
you can't get a fluttering flag to
behave in the wind and within burst shot
is this best shot feature up here in the
corner which you can barely see probably
there a little bit of focus issues there
we are
and when that is enabled you can
it'll take 8 shots in one blast you see
the counter down here changes to 8 and
then the software will sort of decide
which one it likes best these are always
going to be hit or miss situations the
phone isn't nearly smart enough to get
this right all the time but it is a fun
novelty item the third one down in the
shooting mode menu is my favorite HDR
stands for high dynamic range and it was
first popularized in consumer camera
phones by the iPhone for what a camera
shooting HDR does is takes multiple
pictures at different exposure settings
then it stitches those shots together
into one photo this means greater detail
very often it's very useful in shots
with both dark and light areas without
HDR the darker regions appears is just
kind of a dark shadow with HDR you can
see the color it's not always a magic
ticket you have to hold the phone more
still than you ordinarily would to
reduce blur in fact Samsung gives you a
warning about that very thing right
there which is very very nice and
sometimes it results in more artificial
appearance in the shots but I use HDR
mode more often than not and I'm happier
with my photos more often than not smile
shot is the next one down and it is just
ridiculous with smile shot what it does
it waits for you if your the the
pictures subject to smile before it
takes the photo so you've got you know
somebody's face in the shot and you you
line it up like this and you need an
assistant you hit the the camera button
tries to focus and it waits for the
subject to start smiling before it will
take the photo it's not going to do it
with with with Rick Astley here because
I can't maintain focus because I'm
shooting this video all by myself but I
tried it a couple times I tried to fake
it out it's pretty good at telling when
you're smiling it works pretty well
it's gimmicky it's funny it's weird
I want to next here I want to skip right
to panorama mode because it's kind of
it's the last what I'll call legitimate
shooting mode panorama shots with the
galaxy s3 are okay I mean you're
basically asking a handheld computer to
do a lot of computing to stitch multiple
photos together so it's nice to have
this feature at all and we can thank
Google and Ice Cream Sandwich for that
you just need to be really really sure
to keep the camera steady and on an even
plane while you're taking the panoramic
shot otherwise it's going to come out
crooked and if there's any moving
objects in the shot you're definitely
going to get blur
and ghosting so you want to watch out
for that beauty shot and cartoon shot
are more toy like well they're fun
you're not going to get great shots out
of them beauty mode according to Samsung
is there to hide facial imperfections
but people in these Beauty shots come
out looking like they've just got a
whole bunch of pancake makeup on this
mode basically just eliminates texture
on the face making you look like an
Android and cartoon mode is kind of fun
but nothing you couldn't achieve in a
cheap or free photo editing application
in fact you can apply almost the exact
same effect using Samsung's free photo
editing suite for the Galaxy s3
so that's all the shooting modes let's
hop into the less often used categories
focus mode and settings now I don't use
focus mode terribly often because auto
focus works well most of the time on
this device but while we're here let's
talk about that the galaxy s3 like most
modern smartphones allows you to choose
where you want the camera to focus just
by tapping on the area you want so if
you want to take a long shot while
focusing on something in the foreground
you can do that just by tapping on the
part of the photo you want the camera to
focus on if you want to focus instead on
the distant part of the shot you can do
that if it's too close or if the camera
just for whatever reason can't focus you
get a red reticule and it it you don't
get the satisfying focus beep you can
still take an out-of-focus shot if you
want but it'll be out of focus if you
know you're going to be taking up close
photos you can set the autofocus to
macro mode auto focus will do this for
you though in normal circumstances so I
don't use this too often face detection
is pretty clever the galaxy s3 can
detect faces in photos anyway but in
this mode if it detects a face you can
double tap on the face to zoom in that
said zooming on a device like this that
doesn't have optical zoom isn't really
the best of ideas you can do it in a
couple ways you can pinch to zoom to
zoom in and a photo or you can use the
volume keys on the bottom here to decide
how far you want to zoom in zoom may not
be available depending on what
resolution you're shooting in but it's
digital zoom it's digital zoom so what
that means is it's not moving a lens
mechanically there's no optics here
moving in and out and I actually
magnifying the image it's cropping well
I did that it's cropping the shot which
you could do later and an editing
program and even right on the phone here
you can do it an editing program get the
same results so there's really no reason
to ever zoom in when you're taking
photos on a smartphone with no optical
zoom you can always crop the shot later
let's hop into the settings menu here
one of the great things about the guy
cs3 something I didn't know until I
started researching for this video is
you can set what shortcuts you want to
appear alongside here so if you want say
for example you want your white balance
settings to appear instead of the flesh
you can just drag it over here and
replace that that's really really really
nice
your experience is customized so some of
this in here in the settings menu is
going to be duplicate functionality
let's take a look at scene mode now
there's no description for this in the
user manual but what it looks like this
is doing is giving you some options to
change the white balance subtly and
maybe the shutter speed a little bit in
night mode for example the shutter speed
is noticeably slower and the color in
the shot is noticeably warmer and the
opposite is true in something like
sports mode truthfully there are so many
options in scene mode and they're buried
so far down in the menu system I don't
have the patience to select it ahead of
time most of the time phone cameras are
so much better these days but they're
still primarily used for quick shots so
if you have the time to set up and wait
for like a bird to come line at your
bird feeder or if you know you'll be at
a party with harsh incandescent or
fluorescent lights or if you're going to
be shooting some fireworks these modes
might be useful to you if you think of
them and they're great to have
especially backlight which is handy for
those awful situations where you have no
choice but to shoot it into the Sun but
not using scene mode isn't going to ruin
your photos keeping scene mode set to
automatic is or none rather is usually
what I do and it's not going to hurt you
at all let's check out the manual
settings like exposure value using this
manual slider here is is handy for
situations where you haven't selected a
scene auto focus or auto exposure isn't
working well and you you just need to
tone the brightness down a little bit or
you know tone it up a little bit the
same is true for the ISO setting here
most of the time because it's very good
camera software auto will do your
just fine but sometimes it's helpful to
manually select these levels but it's
the sheer number of options that are
going to weigh you down here I mean look
at all this stuff seriously you know how
you spend time setting up your home
screen when you get a new Android or a
Windows Phone you should sit down and
spend at least that amount of time
getting to know the camera on the galaxy
s3 in order to take great shots in
addition to all the other stuff we've
got GPS
tagging white balance settings metering
Auto contrast toggle anti shaken and so
on there's just so much now this can be
quite an intimidating array of features
so my best advice is this start using
the phone camera with the out-of-the-box
default settings and then tweak them as
you move forward and gradually
experience different usage scenarios and
different requirements here's how I set
mine up out of the box after a little
bit of learning in settings I've made
sure that my flash is set to OFF I don't
trust auto so I turn it on when it needs
to be on I keep the scene mode set to
none I leave exposure alone focus alone
no effects I ratchet up the resolution
to maximum 8 megapixels because I have a
lot of storage space in this phone and I
want the highest resolution possible my
white balance I leave set to auto except
in extreme circumstances like crazy
fluorescent light I leave ISO on
automatic as well except in tricky
lighting situations typically dark ones
where I need to amp it up a little and I
don't want to use HDR for some reason I
leave metering Center weighted
anti-shake Auto contrast and guidelines
are all usually set to off and I set my
image quality to superfine that's fine
out of the box I don't notice much
difference but if your resolution junkie
you know what to do they're super fine I
don't tag my photos with GPS that's
personal preference you do what you want
there and I prefer to keep my storage on
the memory card so I'm not using up my
phone memory that is not set that way by
default so just a word of warning there
because I like quick access to what's
important I like my shortcuts along the
side here to be as follows
I like the camera toggle for front and
back camera but I don't use the front
camera of like ever so I ditched that in
favor of exposure value
I leave the flash toggle where it is and
I definitely leave shooting mode where
it is because remember that's our
gateway to the really interesting useful
HDR and burst shot features and so on
and because auto focus usually does the
job well for me I got rid of that in
favor of the guidelines I can turn those
on and those help my composition
sometimes but most of the time they
don't of course
those settings are there for you to play
with these are just my personal settings
for getting the most out of my Galaxy s3
now in most situations the automatic
functions will see you through I mean
the phone does a very good job of
choosing for itself what it needs to do
to deliver good pictures but if you're
in a specialized scenario like shooting
fireworks or shooting a soccer game the
few seconds it takes to drill down into
the menus and find these options will
probably yield a setting or a mode that
fits your needs exactly and that is a
little look at how to shoot great photos
with the Samsung Galaxy s3
