of the cool things about android is the
ability to customize the look and feel
really everything that is your android
just by changing out the launcher app
and that's as simple as going to the
market downloading and installing one
well in the past we've shown you ADW
launcher which is an open-source just
really cool really fast launcher based
on the the Nexus One launcher and it's
really nice we recently saw technology
demo that was just insane with page
transitions and just all kinds of cool
stuff well today that technology demo is
in an actual launcher and that launcher
is a TW launcher ii x let's go take a
look so i've shown you an awful lot of
launchers in the past and this is yet
another one now this is similar to one
that i've shown you in the past and it's
one that is similar to what comes stock
with cyanogenmod so if you guys are
running cyanogenmod out there you're
probably familiar with ADW launcher
which is an open-source launcher and
that's one of the reasons why it's
included with cyanogenmod my other
favorite is called launcherpro and they
both have benefits they both have
advantages and disadvantages well one of
the biggest disadvantages with ADW
launcher has been its settings and
really that's because there are just so
many of them well you'll notice here a
little simplified version of of that no
longer do we have a launcher settings
and a phone settings now it's all
incorporated into one universal settings
to get to phone settings you tap on that
and then come into phone settings so one
step a way to get to your phone settings
but for everything else here are all of
your nice and iconically representative
menus you can go into and change for the
launcher itself now this launcher is
called ADW launcher ii x and a while
back we showed you a really really cool
technology demo that showed some cool
page transitions well a lot of those are
now included in this presets presets
lets you come in here and change it to
something default the way that it comes
stuff
ah commander web and iPhone ish Nexus
ish and fast if you've got a slower
phone you want to choose fast because
well this is a fast launcher well if
you've got a fast phone like I do this
is the t-mobile g2 you don't need that
and you can take advantage of some of
the more whiz-bang stuff so let's go
back and talk about a couple things
really quickly are you ready for this
first and foremost you have this nice
thumbnail preview just by touching the
home button from any one of the screens
that will show you all of the screens in
this case it comes stock with 5 and I've
been able to up it to seven I've got a
couple of blank screens in here and I
have those they're primarily just for
padding it doesn't take up any more
memory or slow your phone down to have
them there as long as they're empty and
it's nice to have a place to drop a
widget or some stuff when I'm doing
videos for you guys so you may want to
stick with five or three or one or
whatever suits you it's customizable
they can be rearranged which is
something new to this version and that's
a really big feature being able to move
say this screen down here that screen
over there change which one is your
default screen by painting it there very
very nice I mean that right there is
worth the upgrade but you can go right
to the screen by tapping now the second
thing that you're going to notice is
this looks an awful lot like the Nexus S
which is running Gingerbread what with
all of the little green hinted icons
then in fact we can come over and look
at other stuff and I'm kind of showing
off the the next feature that I'll get
to which is the page transitions but
before we go too far this theme with
these icons which goes a little bit
further you know it goes into your
dialog boxes it goes into your app
drawer and all kinds of stuff but it's a
theme this does not come stock with a
launcher in fact this theme costs 99
cents it's available in the market and I
forget the name of it it's an 80 w nexus
s theme i believe and all it does is it
lets you select a theme that then
applies these various rules and it makes
this which is still froyo look like in
this case gingerbread which is kind of
nice I don't have to install a
half-baked version of gingerbread on my
phone and make it look like it I can get
the best
both worlds by doing it this way now the
reason that I bring that up is one it's
really cool not only can you customize
your launcher but you can also phim it
and that's been around a while but the
reason I bring it up now is this is an
entirely new version of the launcher I
mean it's not quite from the ground up
because it's based on the ADW launcher
open source core but it is a radical new
version it is not free in fact it costs
about three and a half dollars in the
android marketplace and it's well worth
it in my opinion but it works with all
of the old themes that are out there for
the old version of the launcher so if
you've got a collection of themes that
you've purchased or downloaded before
don't worry they should work just fine
so really cool next I want to show you
just because you guys are going to ask
this is beautiful widgets by levelup
studio and you'll notice over here I've
got a nexus s theme on that as well so I
get the nice hint of green in there so I
know you guys are going to ask so there
you go this is a calendar widget and
I've just chosen a green header on that
to make it look green but let's get to
the really good stuff okay switching
between screens I'm going to just tap
and drag and if you notice can you see
this this stream that the default screen
is kind of getting smaller and it's
fading out that way where the new one is
getting bigger and it's kind of rotating
in from the other way they see how cool
that transition looks that's my favorite
but let's look and see what some of the
others are now this of course takes some
3d processing and you know it's it can
get pretty hefty so if you find that
your phone isn't as isn't as fast as
you'd like to be choose choose a
different way to do it that's a little
bit nicer on your phone of course you'll
want to choose whatever works best for
you so this is in general behavior we go
into settings and then general behavior
and then animation and effects now these
don't have any any names really so let's
go into screen transition effect and I'm
on effect
for now what is that you don't know I'm
hoping a next version will will come out
with some names for these things and
maybe the developer will hold some kind
of a contest to name them who knows of
course submit your recommendations to
the developer and and perhaps you'll get
some some kudos in the credit or a free
copy of the software who knows anyway so
normal Scrolls normal scroll it's the
the TV vol behavior it's probably one of
the fastest ways if you have a slower
phone the fact one is kind of cool so
let's do that we'll tap there we'll go
home and now to switch between them okay
to swap between them you just tap and
slide and you can see this has kind of a
rotating effect will just go through a
couple of those pages so you can see it
and it's really quick I've got widgets
I've got I cons I've got all kinds of
stuff on there and it just kind of folds
in like you're looking at sides of a
cube from the inside but let's not delay
let's go ahead and check out another one
so back to general behavior and again
doing this on a flat table sometimes the
taps don't work but that's that's
because of the orientation that I have
it not because of the phone or the theme
or the launch yourself so back to
transition in fact let's go to effect
two and we'll just kind of buzz through
these really quick so you can see them
this one kind of explodes and fades out
and the other one zooms and fades in a
little bit slower on this transition but
that's more for effect than anything
else so let's go back in to our general
behavior animation and effects
transition effect 3 and there are a
whole bunch of them and I'm not going to
go through all of them but just to give
you an idea this is kind of one of the
more intense ones you grab on and it
rotates that out of the way and it
rotates the new one in you can kind of
see the side of it over there so really
cool now i'm going to set this back to
four just so you can see where i was
before which again is general behavior
animation and effects and transitions
and
to number four for the others you're
going to have to go out and grab a copy
of this from the marketplace that you
can see how this is really quick and
kind of has a nice bouncy effect when I
land on it so just really cool now of
course if you want to try this the
android market now has a more limited
trial feature it's down to just 15
minutes so if you're going to try it
download try it and and if you don't
like it go ahead and ask for a refund
and you do that by uninstalling it it's
really not that bad but we're down to 15
minutes instead of a full day to be able
to do it once you try this on your
device I don't think you're going to
want to return it it's really nice it's
really fast and this has now become my
stock launcher in fact for three and a
half dollars I think us trends and
currency translation rates was three
dollars 33 cents of course that may vary
depending on what the the currency
exchange rates are and what not the
theme is 99 cents and it's really worth
it for four less than five bucks you've
got a customized phone that you can do
all kinds of stuff that your friends
phones can't do or can't do until they
get the app really cool i like it a lot
i would recommend you go out and get it
but i'm interested in your thoughts what
do you think have you tried adw.launcher
if you try to atw launch or e x which is
what this one is do you like it better
or worse than launcher pro is there
another launcher that you like better
than these or are you the kind of person
that just likes the stock launcher and
doesn't want to make any changes and if
so why what advantages does that give
you we want to know leave that in the
comments down below if you haven't
subscribed to our video channel yet make
sure you do that in fact we've got a
whole bunch of videos that focus just on
the t-mobile g2 or use them as our
spokesmodel as the case may be so make
sure you subscribe and catch up on all
the stuff that you may have missed so
showing off ADW launcher ii x4 pocket
