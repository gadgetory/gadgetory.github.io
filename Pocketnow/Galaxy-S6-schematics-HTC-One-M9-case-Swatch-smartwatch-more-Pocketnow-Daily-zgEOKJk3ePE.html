very thin phone Microsoft makes yet
another acquisition to boost their iOS
and Android presence and believe it or
not even swatch wants to get into the
SmartWatch game I'm hina Rivera and if
you really want the beer jokes to come
back then barn just ask for them this is
far get out daily brought to you by
lynda.com the official news today
continue to be interesting as a
Microsoft continues to invest in
companies to boost their presence in iOS
and Android and I say this mainly
because of the company's acquisition of
a complete they acquired the company and
then they built all that into their
outlook application and now the company
has invested apparently a hundred
million in sunrise calendar which is a
decent application it's got a really
cool calendar design and everything it's
not the greatest thing on earth I've
seen cooler like for example pocket
informant but yeah they just invested
that amount of money in sunrise calendar
and let's see what they build it into
and hopefully that does include a
Windows Phone alternative I've got a ton
of lease coming up next starting with
HTC we are still skeptical over the
final design of the HTC One and I'm then
we will learn more at mwc 2015 but we've
got another leak and this time it shows
us a the dot view case for the 109 but
the problem is that does the case looks
almost identical to the previous one in
the front obviously seems there are no
enhancements but the back obviously
adapts to the new design and that new
design looks a lot like the dummies that
we saw so we don't know that's just
another dummy and if you've wanted to
get your hands on Android 5.0 lollipop
on your current Galaxy s5 well there are
some very interesting rumors going
around at reddit that you could just go
to any best buy look for a samsung
experienced consultant and they will
gladly install lollipop on your
smartphone in the United States doesn't
matter what carrier and they'll do so
manually the only condition is that you
don't have to have a rooted phone and in
the case of galaxy phones is just so
difficult to root them and to install
other wrongs with the whole Knox thing
that I'm sure a lot of you are currently
in the status so visit your best buy
what have you got to lose and speaking
of interesting
we saw the leaks of the chassis of the
galaxy s6 yesterday looks a lot like the
iphone 6 having a baby with the Sony
Xperia z3 and today we've got some lead
schematics and these schematics are the
ones that are based for some cases that
are already in the market you know the
way this goes and yeah the design is
pretty much what we saw in the leaks and
actually it's not a bad design at all
there is a protruding camera but it
doesn't look bad at all and yet this
seemed like the galaxy s6 will be more
minimalistic than ever before a really
really hot actually we'll see what we
get it mwc and finally for the very
interesting news and rumors of the day
there are some credible sources claiming
that swatch is going to launch a
SmartWatch and even though many of us
would believe that we shouldn't really
care about this I think we actually
should first of all apparently this
SmartWatch will be able to connect with
Android and Windows no iOS compatibility
was mentioned but what's the coolest
part here is that apparently swatches
figured out how you will not have to
charge that watch and if that is true it
doesn't really matter what kind of
display we get on that thing or what
type of notifications we get as long as
the prices right I'm sure that people
will go crazy for a product like this
because it'll be a SmartWatch not really
a smartphone fitted into a smaller
chassis which is really what we wanted
it leads me to the question of the day
if you have to choose Apple watch which
you have to charge every day or Android
wear or swatch would probably will not
have the greatest display or anything
but you won't have to charge ever which
one would you pick because in my case to
be fully honest with you I would rather
get the swatch which would at least give
me notifications and some functionality
but would behave as a watch there was a
comment down below what do you think and
folks if you ever want to learn the web
design or how to become a pro and adobe
tools or even build a video like this

courses at our sponsor Linda calm /
