that smartphones aren't just getting
better they're also getting
significantly more expensive with
players like Apple proving that they can
cross the $1,000 barrier unscathed the
result hasn't really been good for
consumers as major competitors have
decided to follow so for those of you
wondering why all the popularity over
the launch of the oneplus 60 on t-mobile
in the United States that's because in
2018 this phone is still $100 less
expensive than most flack ships out
there for those of you asking well
what's the catch it's time to detail the
pros and cons I'm high mentally that I
will pocket now and this is our review
of the oneplus 61 plus has gained lots
of popularity for its motto of being the
flagship killer but if you remember any
of my previous reviews in the last
couple of years I've never really agreed
with that even with it's never settle
slogan I always felt that there was some
level of compromise up until this years
one plus six that was easily one of my
favorite phones of early 2018 so you'd
assume that the oneplus 60 would build
on that and the fact of the matter is
that it does for the most part not on
everything in the looks department it's
hard to not admire the breadth of
originality that oneplus has adopted
since the 5t with different coats of
aluminum or glass and even unique colors
this Thunder purple variant is hot the
gradient goes from purple to black and
even extend still the aluminum finish
and the color shifts depending on the
angle that you look at the phone the
matte glass finishes not flawless and
it's fight for fingerprints or smudges
but it does do a better job than most
and even if I'm not a fan of cases
oneplus does know how to make a good
sandstone case to blend it's really the
little things like the mute slider that
most of us praise and that makes this
phone stand apart the change you will
notice is that this phone is thicker and
heavy
than its predecessor but in that case
it's because it serves a purpose with
its larger 3700 milliamp hour battery
almost everything else inside definitely
makes this a flagship we've got a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 options for more
RAM that most at 6 or 8 gigabytes it
also starts with more storage than most
with an option that begins at 128 gigs
not expandable and extensive 256 we have
dual-sim capabilities if you choose the
international variant and we also have
one of the fastest charging solutions in
the industry now the corners cut to keep
the price down begin when you ask for an
IP rating the phone is splash resistant
according to the company but we can't
really tell you to what degree and then
my least favorite changes the death of
the headphone jack pretty much
contradicting all the fun oneplus is
made of competitors for settling on this
trend there are some neat tricks that
don't necessarily compensate but that
are welcomed this is the first phone to
bring it on display fingerprint scanner
to the United States and it's not just
fast it learns you'll notice that it
keeps getting more and more accurate as
you use it also fastest face to unlock
which surely is not secured but crazy
convenient when wearing gloves in
horrible weather conditions in between
both solutions we have one of my
favorite displays on a flagship there's
a nearly unintrusive notch at the top
minimal Chin's at the bottom and a
well-tuned 6.41 inch optical AMOLED
display a 1080p Plus resolution all
protected by Gorilla Glass 6 this means
great color reproduction deep blacks and
no issues when viewed from an angle but
the only thing missing for this
experience to be great stereo speakers
in order to enhance content consumption
trust me
don't muffle the speaker
which means that I naturally drifted to
the first pixel things I do miss or the
smart approach and hiding the knotch
that we saw with the oneplus 6 when
watching videos in full screen but that
being said a cool alternative is now
that you can fully hide it as oneplus
has now decided to still portray
notifications in the hidden portion and
still give you the extra screen real
estate for content hardware on this
phone may not be flagship challenging
yes I do agree there are some things
that I wish were still here but it
doesn't change the fact that hardware on
this phone is great for the most part
now where this phone is king is in
software and notice it's no pixel those
of you looking for an uncompromised
experience in android this is your phone
sure it may be called oxygen OS 9 point
0.5 but it's nearly as stock as Android
9pi should be with some minor additions
to improve on the experience the
launcher offers lots of flexibility like
being able to control the grid size of
icons and the design of these if you're
not a fan of widgets on your home screen
there's a drawer on the left where you
can stack them up or do both approaches
as well the app tray looks like the
standard from Android but if you slide
from the border there's a hidden app
tray for apps you want to keep to
yourself then there are the gestures you
can pick the typical Android navigation
buttons you can also pick to go with the
pixel pill that is not necessarily my
favorites the one I really like most are
full screen gestures where you can set
both sides to go back and then you could
set the Google assistant that's a long
press on the power button and then there
are other extras like gaming mode to not
be bothered by notifications while
you're playing and then my other
favorite which is reading mode for those
of you wanting a black and white screen
while reading a book on the go so then
you ask why is this closest stock
Android if there are so many extras well
I've been using this phone for nearly
three weeks and there is just no lag
oneplus has this neat feature called
project boost where the phone uses
leftover RAM to load elements you use
most on applications in order to have
these load and performs faster the
company has also spent the last two
years proving that it can give you the
latest version of Android within a close
range of when it gets launched on the
pixel as well
even with the reduced earpiece phone
call sound great and the same goes for
the speaker as long as you don't cover
it and then data speeds are epic our
test on the t-mobile network for this
phone have proven it to be a champ
topping even phones like the iPhone 10s
which is far more expensive best of all
the battery life oneplus makes its
competition look really bad on this
department
this device barely sips on power while
not in use and when you do I've ended
days with enough juice to go for another
and yes I do wish that it had wireless
charging but the fast charging is so
good that really you don't care you can
top this phone in less than an hour
really easily now usually the story goes
that companies that are aggressive about
the price will cut corners when it comes
to the camera but not here ever since
the oneplus 6 I've really praised the
improvements provided we've got the same
camera combo an arrangement of the six
with some added software enhancements
this means a 16 megapixel camera at F
1.7 aperture 1.2 2 microns and a wide 25
millimeter equivalent there's a
secondary camera at 20 megapixels F 1.7
aperture and standard microns but it
serves more to assist the primary in
certain scenarios photography is great
obviously during the day it's hard to
find a phone with these specifications
that doesn't deliver one of my favorite
enhancements that oneplus has figured
out as HDR dynamic range on this phone
is killer and now like the 1 plus 60 is
good almost to the level of other
flagships the smaller microns on the
camera don't really help but if you're
able to hold still nightscape bring some
long exposure love to the mix to truly
match even the best smartphones
I also praised this portrait mode I mean
you can't really edit the blur after the
fact but you might not want to do so the
results are very natural but I wish I'd
feel the same about selfie portraits the
company's HDR doesn't work with it
surely the idea is to blur the
background but not blow it out seriously
regular selfies and HDR just make photos
so epic that it might be necessary for
oneplus to show some HDR love the
portrait selfies as well
video recording is pretty much like the
one plus six meeting it's really good
and super stable I filmed the full
camera experience of the one plus six in
London where you can notice its
civilization for both the primary camera
and even the selfie shooter but you're
both fantastic in my opinion to conclude
I'm not sure if you noticed but one
thing prevailed across this review a lot
of this phone is just like the one plus
six the changes between the three in the
3t were internal and then external
between the 5 and the 5 T but in the
case of the 60 these are external but
not all are welcomed as much as we saw
in last year's predecessors point is if
you're holding on to a one plus six said
it might be a good idea for you to stay
where you are
you get to keep your headphone jack
you've got a thinner phone and the
things that matter like battery life and
camera remain nearly the same now if
you're in the United States it might be
a better idea for you to go for the 1
plus 60 my 1 plus 6 worked fine as I
used it but unless one plus has done
some added band tuning and software
updates my speedtest on t-mobile had the
60 downloading twice the data speeds and
you also have horizon support on the 16
and then there are the significant
subsidies on t-mobile and this is really
at launch which means they're only gonna
get better
I'm not gonna say that the one plus 60
is the perfect phone it's not there's
really no such thing but at its launch
price this phone does make any other US
flagship look really bad this is not the
typical story of you get what you paid
for nope the one plus 60 is not just
great for the money
it's even better than phones that cost
twice as much and we've got comparisons
to prove that what about you
