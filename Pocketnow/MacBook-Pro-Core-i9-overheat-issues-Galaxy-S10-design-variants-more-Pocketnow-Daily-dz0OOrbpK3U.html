hot to handle I mean that literally
looks like the 2019 I'm the BC will be
about Samsung products according to
trusted sources and if you're not buying
a new iPhone and still want the fast
chargers it seems that there's a catch
I'm hey metal Iveta and once again thank
you so much for your support to the
Spanish Channel and your comments even
for those that don't speak Spanish thank
you guys for those of you that want to
watch this video in Spanish there's a
link up here this is pocket out daily
the official news today continue with
the huawei mate 10 Pro and B&amp;amp;H the
company continues bringing more deals
when it comes to huawei phones and LG
phones this time $300 off for the mate
10 pro it is still one of our favorite
phones even today even after the p20 pro
you can learn more about all the deals
in the description now let's talk about
samsung as well we hear from a very
trusted source that the gear lineup is
going to die when it comes to
smartwatches and we've been hearing
rumors that there's going to be this
galaxy watch but the twist back then was
that the galaxy watch was going to be
the Android variant and the gear was
gonna be the Tizen one now we hear that
we're only gonna get the galaxy watch
and that's going to run Tizen whatever
fourth version of Tizen it's gonna be I
hope it runs Android apps or whatever
the case may be
we'll see what works I mean we hear that
we are gonna have to wait for unpacked
others say Aoife now let's talk about
Samsung we had some old rumors that are
now being confirmed by Ming XI quo and
that's the reason why we didn't cover
them before the three variants of the
galaxy s 10 that we should expect from
the BBC apparently will mimic the iPhone
in sizes we hear five point eight inches
6.1 inches 6.4 inches diagonal we even
wonder if we're losing bezels up to the
point where phones are actually going to
be of similar size we also hear
confirmation that the smaller variant
will be flat and have a fingerprint
scanner on the edge because it's gonna
be flat it's gonna fit but I find those
fingerprint sensors on the side to be so
cumbersome but anyways the mid one is
going to have dual cameras and then the
larger one is going to have three
cameras at the back which is actually
the opposite to what Apple is doing to a
certain degree let's see what we get MWC
is going to be interesting
can't wait to see the Galaxy S 10 indeed
now let's move the spotlight over to
Apple as we've heard rumors that the
company is going to provide the iPhone
10 2018 models every single phone that
launches this year with a fast 18 watt
charger that's all fine and dandy the
question is what happens if you already
own an iPhone Center an iPhone 8 which
are also fast charging compatible
currently you pay 75 bucks for the 25
watt adapter in addition to the USBC
it's a lightning cable now we hear that
you're gonna have to continue doing that
same thing for the iPhone 10 2018 if you
want to keep your old iPhone it seems
that they're gonna be out of stock of
the chargers when the phone launches
you're gonna have to wait a while
because they don't have enough supplies
let's hope that's not the case because
yeah that's terrible
and finally the hottest news today
literally have to do with the new
MacBook Pros the core I 9 models
particularly our pal Dave 2d just
published the video where he shows that
there is really no benefit in buying
these new computers because of the
thermal envelope on these new MacBook
Pros doesn't have enough space for all
the heat being provided by the core I
nines up to the point where even proves
that processor performance gets
throttled even below the quoc speed
unless you put the computer in a freezer
which is something you're definitely not
gonna do but definitely it's proved that
Apple is just terrible at doing first
generation products and this is the
first time they're doing a core i9 you
know six cores on a laptop I get it but
in today's question let us know what do
you think definitely watched a 2ds video
it's so interesting and let us know are
you still gonna buy these computers or
not in my case answering all the
questions I received on Instagram and
YouTube no I'm not I'm gonna wait it out
because I do want these computers I
don't want to deal with first generation
issues but anyways leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us I'm
