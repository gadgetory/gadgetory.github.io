the Galaxy Nexus Ice Cream Sandwich
smartphone that all finally pulls back
the razor in our thoughts on what Ice
Cream Sandwich means to Android all this
and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hey memory that I'm
with parking out without common welcome
to android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
this week everything's hot so let's
begin after quite a long wait Sam say
and Voula finally teamed up to bring us
their unpacked event where we finally
got the Galaxy Nexus Ice Cream Sandwich
smartphone let's begin talking about the
Galaxy Nexus because it truly is a
game-changer first of all it brings the
best of the best Android experience out
there that huge spect 4.65 HD 720p
display first time sensors we've ever
heard before like for example a
barometer for pressure altitude
beautiful design in the cake topping
obviously is android 4.9 the first
smartphone make sure you hit our website
for full specs because there's a lot to
talk about and while so far the Galaxy
Nexus is planned to be released on
November at the beginning though
carriers were not mentioned just yet the
initial price apparently will be six
hundred eighty bucks unlocked and well
we'll see what carriers bring eventually
but so many dramatic improvements
carriers will definitely flock for the
smartphone so if you're waiting to buy a
smartphone this fall hey wait and see
because this is probably the hottest
smartphone of the year and what about
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich I'll tell
you this much Google made their best
move in hiring matias duarte from webOS
because he's brought the elegance and
good taste that Android needed years ago
Ice Cream Sandwich looks clean it looks
elegant and looks smart it looks
intuitive it's a whole paradigm shift to
what you were used to seeing an Android
in the past and a lot of these really
good changes needed to happen the amount
of enhancements bring a huge new UI
better services like for example Android
beaming the facial detection for
unlocking and the phone really brings
some smart text to speech for typing
it's incredible video capturing etc etc
etc the list is really long so I'd
rather you read Joe Levi's recent
article on everything that ice cream
sandwich brings to the table because
it's an OS that compiles the best things
from Windows Phone 7 and the elegance of
iOS so it's pretty much the combination
that everybody was out there to get does
a true game changer and hey you can bet
my money will be waiting for this galaxy
nexus whenever it gets released you guys
never see me that excited over
smartphones that is just to give you an
idea of how
much our expectations have been lifted
with Ice Cream Sandwich mineral also
came out to help us remember the good
old phone days with their release of the
new motorola droid razr just like back
in the day with the v3 this is the new
motorola flagship it's almost a finished
smartphone in the world except when you
hold it from the thickest point and
while it's got really gorgeous specs
first of all it's got a super amoled
display steel internals for durability
it's got this Kevlar back the device is
no slouch when it comes to processing or
storage and we're really sadly overwhelm
with the fact that well it's not a world
phone so far but it will have some gsm
variants soon sadly it's costing three
hundred bucks after a two-year contract
so make sure you think about it and the
Galaxy Nexus see what's best on your
lineup Brandon went to the event and he
got some really good video on what to
expect for the smartphone so far we've
got some really good smartphones coming
with this droid razr it's even getting
ice cream sandwich as of next year so
stay tuned out of our coverage this week
make sure you hit Brandon's recent
article and video on how to get ice
cream sandwiches emulator running on
your computer Joe later goes deep and
bring us all details on what Ice Cream
Sandwich is and also he brings an
article on what to expect of the
barometer hopefully from applications
the later gives us his own opinion on
what's missing on Android 4.0 on the
announcement and well so far things are
cool but not everything is obviously
perfect Anton later shows us how to get
ice cream sandwiches wallpaper on our
current android devices and later Steve
also goes back to show us how to get the
Roboto font on our current android
smartphones aside from that while you've
already met sassy Bob and her already
really great coverage on the HTC rhyme
so make sure you hit her recent video
when she goes out on the road to ask
people of the ACCC rhyme is really a
girl phone or not watch it to find out
and while deke Adams is also currently
reviewing the HTC Flyer from t-mobile so
all really good videos and content on
our website so make sure you hit it up
going through other smartphone releases
AT&amp;amp;T has just made their Motorola Atrix
2 available for sale it brings really
great specs at an unbelievable price of
100 bucks after 2-year contract so make
sure you hit it up because it's really
got great specs
from that sprint has also introduced
their HTC evo design 4g world phone
which we leaked recently again really
great specs and a hundred dollar price
tag really interesting and well t-mobile
and LG have also announced their double
play duel touchscreen smartphone which
brings these really mid-range specs not
really compelling and well it's got this
weird design with the open keyboard and
an extra screen not sure it's appealing
for everybody but hey there are people
that like these kinds of things though
it's not available for all keeks just
yet anyways that's a pradesh oh thank
you very much for watching i'm high
Meadow iveta remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
