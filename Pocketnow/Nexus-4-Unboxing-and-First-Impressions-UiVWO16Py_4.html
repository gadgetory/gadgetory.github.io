pocket now calm despite having a
terrible pre-order experience the Nexus
4 is likely to be one of the best
Android smartphones for a while to come
so in this video we're gonna unbox it
and give you some first impressions
let's get to it
now the reason people are so excited
about the Nexus 4 is really for three
reasons number one the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro has proven to be the
fastest chip available in a mobile
device it smashes everything in the
benchmarks in day to day usage it is
fantastic and it sips power so it's
great for battery life number 2 the
display we saw it on the optimus G and
now it's coming to the Nexus 4 LG's
amazing display it's got 1280 by 768
resolution so higher than 1280 by 720
720p it's got fantastic color saturation
great contrast and overall it just is a
fantastic display and number three
Android 4.2 brings some awesome new
features like widgets on your lock
screen and photosphere and unfortunately
the Nexus 4 doesn't have LTE but iFixit
found that there is actually an LTL to
each chip on the board
with seven bands of LTE support we're
going to talk about what that actually
means in this video so let's get to the
unboxing all right so we're gonna unbox
this here so I'm going to come back on
and give you some first impressions and
I mentioned that this has LTE support
well not really it's got the Qualcomm
chip that enables LTE but doesn't have
the antenna or the amplifier to make
that happen so while you might sort of
be able to get out to eat even if you
did something with the software you
still couldn't actually get LTE because
you don't have the other parts to do it
so here we have the Nexus 4 a really
cool box 4.7 inch screen a little bit
smaller than we're seeing on some other
devices makes it a little bit more
friendly in the hand and at the core
this is just an optimist G and actually
that's a great thing because as
mentioned we get the s4 pro we get a
really good camera and an amazing screen
and this is running unadulterated
Android just stock Android with jelly
bean 4.2 so it's going to be real
all right so let's take this out of the
box all right go this very nice
very angular very light that is
impressively light see if there's any
goodies in the box no I don't think that
there are going to be in good job anyway
so let's take a look at the Nexus work
let's do the screen protector peel off
Michael Fisher style let's listen to it
oh yeah I did a little too fast there oh
well sorry Michael so let's let's look
around the device I think we've got some
plastic around here oh yeah you hear
that good stuff there so this is the
Nexus 4
it is a lot lighter than you think it
would be it's got a battery integrated
so you can't take that out and we've got
glass on the front glass on the back and
that's kind of a liability because like
with the iPhone 4 and 4s when you drop
it you have a two times more likely
chance of cracking something but Google
is selling a bumper interestingly for
the Nexus 4 so let's uh let's do a first
boot here let's actually take a look
around the device so we've got camera
can focus got the power button really
which om will do a dedicated camera key
got to go to windows 28 for that
secondary mic 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack this is the Micro SIM slot standard
charging here and this does have
wireless charging it will work with the
cui hope I'm pronouncing that right Qi
wireless charging standard so let's turn
it on I'm not very excited to get HSPA+
data but I think the speed of the device
will make it sort of be a fair trade-off
we've got a really interesting tapered
edge here it kind of goes around which
apparently won't make it much easier to
do gestures with very nondescript front
here we've got on-screen buttons and
again the resolution is 1280 down by 768
across so you're getting about 48 more
pixels then you get on the Galaxy Nexus
and the galaxy s3 and all those other
phones that are 720p so that's nice so
anyway we're going to set this up and
come back in a minute with some four
depressions alright een I've spent a
fair amount of time here with the Nexus
4 just want to give you some first
impressions the first person impression
is that this screen is tremendously
smooth in fact it feels like there's a
coating of butter on it not sure if
that's a good thing actually it's just
so slick and maybe it will get less
slick as it gets used and there's more
oil and grease on it and other dirt
particles but right out of the box this
is the silica screen I've ever seen and
felt and I don't know if that's a good
thing but it's a really nice taper that
they have going on here and just the
entire front is a piece of glass
something else to notice is that when
you turn on the device you get a ledge
here that you don't get on the Galaxy
Nexus as much and you can actually hold
the device from that ledge without doing
a mist press of the button so that's
kind of cool if you're watching video
we're doing something in landscape mode
you can have another point to hold on to
it in addition to around the earpiece
like you normally do another observation
is that there is an LED notification
light down here in the center it's
really small this time it's a lot
smaller than the Galaxy Nexus a few
other observations in terms of hardware
here's that around the entire device
this is a soft touch plastic so while
this front is very slick and so is the
back at least you get that rubbery feel
when you hold it in your hand that you
cleanse - a pretty good in hand feel
well it's not the thinnest device ever
it's it's thin just not the thinnest on
the back here we've got this really cool
pattern no I'm not talking about all
these fingerprints I'm talking about
these little circles that catch the
light in a really interesting ways if
you get it just right the back kind of
glistens and glows unlike any other
phone out there and again you're getting
a lot of fingerprints there that's
what's gonna happen if you have a shiny
surface but these little circles are
super cool anyway so let's turn on the
Nexus 4 here I've got it set to 75%
screen brightness I turned off auto
brightness because it didn't seem to be
strong enough it didn't seem to put the
back light levels up high enough and
perhaps that's just a matter of getting
used to it but I really want to see this
screen shine because it's a nice nice
screen of 320 PPI screen you cannot see
pixels on this guy in color saturation
you can probably tell in a video is
just fantastic everything looks really
sharp and clear now in terms of
performance bouncing around we've got a
combination of jellybeans in addition to
the brawny Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro
quad core and it's just navigating
around it is fast and there's a lot of
cool Android 4.2 stuff that we'll cover
later like photo sphere and widgets on
your lockscreen one of them in
particular is that if you do a
two-finger swipe you should get these
quick toggles the reason why it doesn't
come up with two fingers is because I
think there's a notification in progress
right now so it doesn't allow you to go
into the quick toggles well the quick
toggles are actually kind of ugly
they're useful but they're had a little
bit ugly it would be nice that they were
a little bit more attractive and
especially if you can move them around
maybe you want to have your brightness
in the upper right corner so you can
toggle it quickly so if you tap in an
old thinking that they move around it
just doesn't happen that way let's jump
into the web browser who will of course
went with their Chrome web browser which
we're not too fond of we found we find
the Chrome web browser to have worse
performance than the built in stock
Android browser and of course Google
wants to push their Chrome browser
because it's theirs they built it from
the ground up it's their thing and so
let's go to a web page so we're gonna go
to pocketnow.com or over Wi-Fi you might
be wondering how data speeds are on AT&amp;amp;T
over HSPA+ we're gonna test them out in
a minute this is probably gonna be the
longest first impression video ever
anyway so here's pocketnow.com the
Snapdragon s4 pro just just rules let's
see how long text takes to clear up
almost instantly we're gonna do a lot of
comparisons just to see exactly how fast
this browser is but you know first
impressions are that it's it's quite
good and we can go into landscape here
and as mentioned you can hold it by the
bezel now on the right because you've
got this nice chin over here where you
don't have to worry about doing a Miss
press of the of the on screen buttons
okay so let's turn off Wi-Fi and run
speedtest.net
on AT&amp;amp;T HSB Plus Network here so now
with quick toggles we can go into Wi-Fi
and that's not actually a quick toggle
it's a shortcut to the settings
okay so Wi-Fi is off we're waiting for
the eight
to appear and it's likely we're gonna
get h which means HSDPA not h plus which
is HSPA+ depending on where you are at
that moment in time it will vary so
strangely we were not having any luck
testing the bandwidth speed with speed
test on that nor with the FCC test so we
found this Qi P speed test which
actually does work very strange that the
other tests are not working so let's
quick start test it says wherever HSPA
not HSPA+ kind of know the results we're
going to get we should be a little bit
slower here than let's see what the
results say so of course on 18 t 3g
you'll get anywhere from 1 down to as
high as 10 11 down depending on where
you are and how many people are on the
network at the time these are pretty
poor results we're gonna have to test
this more extensively later when we have
better a better signal over HSPA+ you're
not going to get out to east speeds but
you might get bursts of LTE like speeds
so first impressions of the nexus 4 are
quite favorable is it better than the
galaxy s 3 should you consider the Droid
DNA instead time will tell we're going
to take this out into the field out into
the real world and actually spend some
time with it one things pressure for 299
bucks or 349 bucks this is undoubtedly
the best value in Android right now and
with such a fast processor and with a
fantastic screen this might be the best
Android phone ever to come out we're
gonna find out if that's the case for
you in our upcoming review we're gonna a
lot more videos so be sure you subscribe
to the PocketNow channel here on youtube
to find out when the next video hits if
you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and of course thanks for
watching that's it for now
