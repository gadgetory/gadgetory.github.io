no introduction so let's not waste any
time I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our unboxing and
hardware tour of the new HTC one this
device isn't just important to HTC it's
crucial to its survival as the vanguard
of a new design language with new
construction materials and an entirely
new Android skin the one sets the tone
for all HTC devices launching this year
and judging from the packaging it's
obvious that HTC knows exactly how
important this device is the rounded
corners catch the eye nicely and the
plastic film helps convey the impression
that what's inside is valuable and
that's backed up by the spec sheet
printed right on the outside for us to
gawk at highlights include a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 processor at 1.7
gigahertz and that's quad-core 32 gigs
of storage with 2 gigs of ddr2 RAM a 4.7
inch full HD 1080p display at 468 PPI
special HTC value adds like boom sound
built-in amplifiers in the speakers
Beats Audio and an ultra pixel camera
with Zowie functionality as well as some
clever pixel manipulation tricks and the
usual Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 GPS etc
and finally this box is 98% recyclable
proving that you don't need to throw a
phone in a cafeteria lunch garden to be
green that's nice now that that's out of
the way let's open this sucker up
we're left with a box made of premium
feeling cardboard just begging to be
opened and here we go there she is new
HTC one front and center
convenient pull tab down here to get the
device out of its cradle
HTC calling out three features right on
the protector blinkfeed boom sound and
Zoe sounds like a crazy independent film
let's put the device aside for one
second pop open the protective cover HTC
has included service and repair labels
so that they don't have to gum up the
outside of the device with cheesy
looking barcodes that's very nice here's
our sim removal tool with some visual
instructions on exactly how to use it
instructions on how to insert your micro
SIM card
warranty statement safety and regulatory
guides typical microUSB cable some
prepackaged headphones on our global
unit very very nice and the by now
standard HTC wall plug with European
adapter before I even take the HTC One
out of its protective swaddling here the
cool aluminum is just radiating mmm
coolness and through the plastic film it
definitely you can tell right away that
this is a metal phone and as far as its
weight goes it's 143 grams feel
excellent in the hand it actually feels
a bit heavier than that it's hard to
believe this isn't this isn't even 10
grams heavier than the Samsung Galaxy s3
which as we've said many times feels a
little too light to us let's go ahead
and take this protective covering off of
here
protective covering also covered in
instructions for sim removal just in
case you missed it on the first
go-around and here is the brand new
device fresh out of the packaging that
aluminum just shines under our studio
lights here coming back around to the
front of the display and boy you get
that plastic over there and you can
really really feel that aluminum itself
it is impressive I actually didn't
expect it to feel quite this good even
though I knew that I should expect it to
feel this good it's tough to communicate
how much more premium this device feels
in the hand than a lot of others even
after only about 10 seconds of exposure
this is something else but let's get
down to business we've got a job to do
up front here is a 4.7 inch display at a
Super LCD 3 and it is 468 PPI which is
incredible we're gonna power that on in
a minute is obviously capacitive
multi-touch with the usual array of
light sensors proximity sensors and so
forth and there's that beveled edge
surrounding it or the chamfered edge if
you prefer take it over to the right
hand side we've got our volume rocker
very very similar to the one on the
Droid DNA but we're gonna take a closer
look at the similarities and differences
later today between those two devices
around bottom just to be unconventional
we'll go there first that is a microUSB
port along with the microphone and on
the back of the device we've got that
backside illuminated four megapixel
sensor with what HTC is calling their
ultra pixel technology and a bevy of
features that we're not going to get
into right at the moment but as you can
see of quite a large lens there along
with a LED flash the HTC branding in the
center Beats Audio called out down below
and the additional noise cancelling
microphone for what HTC is calling sense
voice power standby button up top next
to the headphone jack three-and-a-half
millimeter of course pretty easy to
reach the power standby button if you
hold the phone up here if you are
holding it down here that's gonna be a
little bit of a stretch for you but
we'll talk about that background at the
front of the device you've got the HTC
branding there along with the home
button and the back key right where it
should be on the left along with one of
the two front firing speakers that
provide that HTC boomsound audio which
we will talk about in which we are
really looking forward to getting our
ear
on because front firing speakers make a
whole lot of sense to us
the camera up top is a 2.1 megapixel
unit with a wide-angle lens with room
enough for you and three of your friends
to get in the shot or at least two of
them and to conclude this quick unboxing
we're going to go ahead and power the
unit on one two three hmm getting a
taste of that boom sound already that
was a very very loud greeting from the
device definitely lets you know when it
is awake and there it is the new version
of the lockscreen shipping on the new
version of HTC Sense Sense 5 just go
ahead and unlock it here so you can see
the homescreen and here's our welcome
screen encouraging us to set this up
with our own preferred language which we
will do right now and as HTC prompts us
to setup our brand new device we will do
so but we're going to do it off-camera
don't worry though
we'll be back very soon folks that's
going to do it for us but stay tuned for
a lot more on the HTC One including
comparison videos and of course our full
review so follow us on all the usual
places subscribe and all the usual
manners thank you for watching we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
