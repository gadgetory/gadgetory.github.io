such for the iphone success sandton
seems to plan more than just one gear a
model and we get more details on the
huawei and LG nexus hardware I'm hi I'm
nothing that I'm wondering exactly why I
want to force touch the phone that I'd
also be babying with a case this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Qualcomm is the company
has just come clear on its future
processor lineup Snapdragon 820 620 and
618 your details on hdmi 2.0 port new
GPUs and even support for up to three
cameras but those of you that are
wanting to know when you'll get these
processors on a phone first half of 2016
is the case and even though recently the
hot news are about windows 10 mobile
smart phones those of you that are in
the market for windows phones right now
better look away from the Lumia 830 as
we've got some trusted sources with
retail leaks that claim that the device
is reaching end of life soon we kind of
don't understand why the rest of the
Lumia lineup which is more than a year
old has not reached end of life yet but
it seems to be coming very close very
soon sad news let's move the spotlight
over to Google's feature Nexus lineup we
get trusted sources planning a ton of
things like for example from facing
speakers on both devices from Huawei and
LG both devices supporting USB type-c
and both devices bringing fingerprint
scanners support at the back now what's
still up for grabs as the materials we
hear that the huawei device will bring a
metallic chassis we heard that before
actually but we're still not sure about
the LG model and we're still unsure what
we're getting these phones stay tuned
for that and for those of you that are
keeping an eye on Samson's future
circular Tyson based smartwatches I
either the Orbis or gear a whatever name
you want to give them it seems that we
are waiting for three products not just
one the Orbis s1 orb is s2 and Orbis
classic now we don't know any
differences here but yeah it makes sense
particularly with the Apple watch having
three models it seems it Samsung is back
to its old antics so yeah could be that
one of these will be the most expensive
one the other is the sport and the other
is the base
let's see when we get these and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
and rumors as well it seems that
analysts are predicting that the iphone
6s for such technology will not be
enough to make this phone sell more than
its predecessors which is interesting
because apparently that will be the only
thing that will change now hear me out
here it seems that Apple is planning
something different with force touch
we've got separate leaks to claim that
it will be for shortcuts and not just
necessarily for context menus like in
the case of the Apple watch or for other
navigation cues like in the case of
macbooks it seems that Apple wants to
simplify iOS and save you a couple of
steps now it's definitely not a deal
breaker but definitely not something
that's extremely hot as well we've got
to agree with analysts here but it does
lead me to the question of the day do
you feel that for such technology alone
would make you want to buy the next
generation iphone success in my case no
they have to come up with something
cooler because if not then I would
rather stick to the iphone 6 but leave
us a comment down below what do you
think friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was filmed we
should focus on packing out comment
subscribe to youtube channel as well it
followed me on twitter hind underscore a
better on instagram at high memory mehta
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hey Mary better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
