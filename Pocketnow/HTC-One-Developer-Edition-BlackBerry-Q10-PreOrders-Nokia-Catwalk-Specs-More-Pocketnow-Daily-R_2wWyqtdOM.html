developer edition and on sprint the
blackberry q10 also hits free orders and
we've got some leaked our series photos
and the Nokia catwalk may not be as hot
as you think I'm hi meri behna and if
you do not have drunk yet that's because
you clearly don't know it's friday
already this is out daily let's
start the day off with some tech irony's
as hapless father new panda will allow
them to bring a street view service to
their iOS Maps application which is sort
of like google street view but with the
advantage then you can use the gyroscope
to move around instead of that we have
the pan around on google maps but it
does much to wonder why Apple is trying
to add new services to iOS Maps when the
old ones don't work now let's talk about
nokia's we've now got some leaked specs
on that Nokia catwalk that will probably
be released next month and don't let me
board with specifics it is the same
devices than nokia lumia 920 exactly the
same in specification the only
difference is you're getting an aluminum
chassis or metallic we don't know what
it's gonna be and then you're also
getting a lighter chassis as well so I'm
not complaining this is bad only just
think about the fact that 1080p is the
resolution for this year and that's not
coming on that catwalk now let's talk
about pre-orders as that's the rest of
the news that's happened the rest of the
day t-mobile finally gets the iphone 5s
today you can pre-order the device in
the prices are actually cheaper than if
you've got an unsubsidized unlock iphone
on an Apple store just kind of
interesting because t-mobile has their
non subsidy plans but then on the other
side of the world and on the other side
of competition we've got samsung quietly
releasing their Galaxy Note 8 at their
Samson experience store in London in the
UK and you can look at the device test
it out in the store and also buy it as
well so just keep that in mind of you're
in London and we've got some more
pre-orders coming hold on now let's talk
about blackberry as their mysterious
blackberry q10 finally reaches
pre-orders in the UK as well only at The
Carphone Warehouse for some reason but
device is finally available you can get
it by the end of the month but
interesting enough if you're interested
in the front-facing curity the q10 is
pretty much a device for you because
we've got some leaked photos of the are
sri smartphone that came in the road
that was leaked a couple of days ago and
we thought this phone was bigger and
better and the curve display on that
leaked photo is not really of a curved
display but that this device is the
successor to the blackberry curve
meaning this is an entry-level ugly
cheekbone so stay with the q10 and then
finally for the hot news of the day the
most anticipated smartphone of the year
the HTC One has reached free orders
yesterday on AT&amp;amp;T and then today on
sprint but it doesn't end there you also
get the pre-orders for their developer
edition which they promised would be
launched at the same time as all the
carrier editions but get this you get an
unlocked bootloader and you get a 64
gigabyte of storage device for 650 bucks
and you'll think about 650 bucks is a
lot and it's actually not six hundred
fifty dollars is what you pay for an
iphone 5 unlocked 16 gig or samsung
galaxy s three or four at some point so
honestly 650 bucks for an unlocked phone
with LTE because that's a developer
edition and 64 gigs that's a definite
bargain but that leads me to the
question of the day are you getting the
HTC One and if you are are you getting
the developer edition or are you getting
a cattery or subsidized device in my
particular case I'm going for the
developer edition but leave us a comment
down below of course for an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone it's a parole machine
