today i've got kind of a walkthrough and
a show-off
of what is new and what is fun what you
can do in CyanogenMod 7 the final
release let's go take a look ok so I am
running CyanogenMod 7 final on my
t-mobile g2 CyanogenMod 7 is based on a
gingerbread so it is version 2.3.3
that's the latest version as of the
shooting of this video I've actually
gone a little bit ahead of that and
flashed and even more up to date kernels
so I'm up to 2.6 point 32 point 36 which
is they per shoots
kernel that doesn't actually come with
the point 36 it comes with one just
slightly down from that but close enough
come down here you can see that my mod
version is CyanogenMod version 7.0 point
zero vision now vision is the codename
of this device the t-mobile g2 now that
means a couple things first of all there
are other mods out there so if you're
running a Nexus One for example you can
run CyanogenMod 7 on your Nexus 1 in
fact you can run it on a whole bunch of
devices head out to at CyanogenMod calm
and go to devices to see if yours is on
the list pretty much the only devices
you can't run it on now or what
originally got CyanogenMod and that's
the the t-mobile g1 and the HTC magic
which is the the mytouch original so
it's a little bit disappointing that
they couldn't quite shoehorn Android 2.3
on to those devices but for devices that
came originally with 1.5 or mine came
with 1.6 out of the box it still was
pretty impressive
but let's get back to this what do we
have so let's go back to our home screen
over here and it's a home screen just
like you'd expect let's jump back into
settings really fast so we can see some
things we've got CyanogenMod settings
over here now this is something that
you're not going to happen unless you're
running CyanogenMod so let's go in and
take a peek and this
is really where a lot of the stuff comes
into play it's things that you can set
up or change or customize that you
couldn't normally do
for example applications we can allow
app moving and I've got that checked by
default we can change the install
location to internal external or
automatic I've got my two external
that's the SD card and something fun it
is phone goggles now you remember all
that fun we had on April Fool's Day
well somebody I think their name rhymes
with Google you don't have to go check
somebody had a phone goggles
April Fool's we're basically you know it
made you do some math or jump through
some hoops to use your phone during
times where you might be inebriated well
that was just an April Fool's but
signage amat actually has that built in
as a feature so all you have to do is go
into your settings like we have tap that
checkbox to enable foam goggles and then
here's our default settings now of
course you can set custom settings for
either the dialer for calling people or
messaging does not apply to Google Voice
just the built-in messaging app so keep
that in mind but basically what you can
do is you can filter some numbers you
can set when to start goggles mode when
to end goggles mode and what kind of
confirmation
none prompt you hey are you sure you
really want to call this person or math
problems if you do math problems there
are three settings there's easy medium
and hard so you know if you end up
calling people when you don't want to in
the middle of the night or whatnot set
it to math hard and if you can't figure
it out at least you can use your phone
again in in the morning but that's
really what it's for so kind of neat
that it's something that Google made fun
of as an April Fool's joke but it's
actually really here in CyanogenMod 7 so
really fun next let's go to display now
in display we've got basically the same
things we have a screen on and off
animation I've got mine turned off it
helps speed my my phone up and what that
is is when you turn your phone off it
has the old CRT monitor pinch where the
cathode is turning off and you
and that line then has a bright flash at
the end well you can turn that on and
off another feature that I use all the
time is rotate 180 degrees so I can flip
my phone completely upside down and use
it just like that it works just fine in
any of the three rotations that it
normally does but it also adds that
fourth rotation as well so really kind
of cool they're automatic backlighting
now this takes your automatic backlight
that you generally have and it adds to
it so you can use an averaging filter to
go through and reduce flicker that's the
scale up scale down okay so you have my
hands right there using this can go
through and smooth that out so you
really don't notice it quite as much and
then I also like setting the allow light
decrease which allows the lights to
decrease and uses hysteresis I think
that's how you pronounce that to reduce
the flicker so and you can all kinds of
customizations that you can do in there
so really kind of cool it doesn't become
turned on by default so if you want that
you need to go turn it on let's go ahead
and look at input in input you now have
something you can do with the long press
of the home button so down here just
like when you long press on search it
brings up Google Voice Search long press
on home you can now use a custom
application and map it to that as well
so really kind of neat there you can
also just on home press you can change
the number of buttons or the number of
apps it'll show up in that list if
that's what you want your long press at
home to be and of course that's what I
want mine to be rather than using a
custom app so I'm going to leave it just
like that search key behavior now you
can remap that haptic feedback haptic
feedback is awesome you can go in now
and customize your patterns
I haven't played an awful lot with that
but it's cool that you can if you've got
a a use for that if you've got some
customizations let us know leave some
feedback down in the comments below I've
got this set to wake my trackball which
is really a trackpad
but if my phone is off I can push my
trackpad and it will wake the device up
volume button music control this will
let me seek music
when long pressing the volume buttons
when the screen is off so if I don't
like what I'm listen to I just press and
hold on the volume up and it will go to
the next track and vice versa if I press
volume down so kind of duplicating or
rather adding another feature another
function two buttons that RT exist on
the phone without having to add more
buttons to the phone I can also set my
camera button this is kind of cool so
I've got a dedicated camera button on my
phone right there not to be confused
with the battery door release right
there but what that lets me do is I can
toggle playback when I long press the
camera button when the screen is off now
again this is just when the screen is
off so when the screen is on the buttons
are going to act just like normal so you
don't have to worry about that now this
is a g2 which has these three little
soft keys down on the keyboard that I've
never really mapped I've never done
anything with but I can do that I have
to keep rotating the phone back into
portrait mode for you but I can do that
I can set the quick keys right there
kind of cool so let's go now to the
interface power prompt so when I try and
turn off my phone it brings up this
prompt lets me do a whole bunch of stuff
I can set silent mode choose a different
profile which is in CyanogenMod seven
you guys who use HTC Sense are very
familiar with this so I can have an
indoor profile and outdoor profile at
work profile on that play profile
whatnot I can reboot the phone really
easily I can even just power it off of
course I don't want to do that so I'm
gonna hit back here's something really
cool it's the notification power widget
alright so what's that well if you pull
your shade up you can see I've got my
carrier I've got my day date and time
all my normal buttons and I can now have
all of these as well again HTC Sense the
newer versions have this as well so you
can go in and use quick settings to turn
these on and off so here's Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS and sound so kind of cool
then I've got all that right there but
wait a minute that notification bar is
down at the bottom of the screen and I
pulled it up from the bottom rather than
pulling it down from the top
what on earth is that all about looks
coming like a mini tablet with that down
there at the bottom doesn't it and if
you watched my last video I kind of
teased to this I'm trying this for a
couple days just to see how I like it
and so far I'm really really digging it
what it is is right down where did it go
in statusbar tweaks right there show
clock I can show battery percentage
that's not it it's actually hidden
someplace else so let me find that and
I'll show you how you can move your
status bar down to the bottom okay so
before we do that let's go ahead and
finish up this screen render effect is
something that we showed you a long time
ago
you can basically tell your phone to
only display a certain pixel so each
pixel on the screen is made up of
several sub pixel elements actually
about four of them a red to green and a
blue RGB okay Y to green because the
green pixels aren't as bright as the red
and the blue but they each use a
different amount of power in fact the
red ones seem to use the least amount of
power so if you want to only run in red
mode you can do that or only in green or
only in blue or whatever so you can save
some power that way also if you are
colorblind as quite a few males are this
may help your screen look better to you
so you can always play with that and I
know you want to get down to the status
bar so it'll go really fast render
effect we just talked about reflow after
pinch in I don't really play with that
over scroll effect if you notice down
here I get to the bottom see how it's
kind of bouncing I can set that that was
not the right one over scroll effect I
can have it bounce and glow and this
theme you can't see the glow very well
but it's got a little bit of a glowy
line at the bottom some other themes
kind of glow up really big and it looks
neat but it's kind of bouncing and then
how much it bounces is right in here
from extra light which is hardly at all
- extra heavy which is quite a bit so
you can see how that's bouncing at the
bottom there so really kind of cool
let's move on now we're gonna skip a
whole bunch of stuff we can do stuff
with the lockscreen with the performance
we'll come back to a little bit of those
tablet tweaks you can even run this on
your tablet even the the part
Noble Nook color so they've got this new
feature called tablet tweaks now this
isn't a tablet but I can still have
access to some of these tweaks such as
this I can add a bottom status bar and
just as easy as that
my status bar is now at the top oh look
now it's down at the bottom now tablets
have buttons and stuff that they put
down at the bottom so if you want to
have everything all together on the
bottom this is how you do that so kind
of cool dead zone I can add a dead zone
to half the screen I don't know why
you'd want to do that if you know go
ahead and let us know and then if you
don't want a a lock screen you can turn
that off now that's because the lock
screen doesn't look all that good on
tablets because it's a significantly
bigger screen it's kind of kind of funky
looking if you went and saw my Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble Nook Color video you could see
that but tablets weeks they're really
kind of cool let's go to the lock screen
now since that's what we were talking
about we can change the style to a
sliding tab which is what most of you
used to I use rotary which gives you
that kind of rotary phone to either
change the volume or unlock the device
rotary revamped kind of has a bevel to
it and then lens is like HTC Sense where
you pulled down to unlock so you can set
any one of those that you want you can
even set a custom app so on your rotary
unlock how you have your phone or unlock
on one side and your phone volume on the
other you can add a custom button in the
middle that when you pull down will
watch an app so if you're always going
into your phone app or your messaging
app you can add that so you you unlock
and launch that app right away if you
don't like it in the middle you can set
unlock in the middle to function kind of
like the shade and the custom Apple burr
on the side and you can do all of that
in here
rotary arrows are the little hints to
show you a you know if you don't know
how to use this phone scroll that way to
unlock or scroll that it's on the lock
screen you've seen them they're just
kind of subtle in there but you can do
all that kind of stuff so really kind of
neat they're widget options you can put
widgets on there and these aren't
widgets in the true sense this is just
informational stuff like I want mine to
always display my battery status when my
phone is locked I want to display my
music controls on the lockscreen
including the song name and album
art and I want to display the music
controls only when I have a wired or a
Bluetooth a2dp headset connected not
otherwise because I don't want to
accidentally start playing the music
unless I have my headphones on so that
makes sense right and then all this
display music if I want to override that
you know if music is or isn't playing I
can put that in there I just have it off
it's personal preference up to you so
lockscreen gestures let's do unlock
options before we do that this is some
of the other stuff how do you unlock it
you can disable the slider you can do
quick unlock if you have a pin code so
that you don't have to hit okay when
entering the pin if you enter the
correct pin it will let you in I don't
like that because it's you know somebody
messing around with your phone if you've
got it pin protected doesn't have to
know oh it's a four digit code go ahead
and let him in you know if they get the
four digits right they have two four
digit and then okay so not my preference
but again if you like it that'll save a
little bit of extra time when you're
unlocking your device menu unlock if you
have a physical menu button which this
phone does not you can use that to
unlock the phone as well and then of
course we already talked about the
trackball unlock so let's come back here
we did unlock action options gestures
you can actually use gestures which are
basically like little scribbles on your
lockscreen tubelaunch stuff I played
around with this a little bit it's kind
of cool for the first little while but
then yeah so if you want to to be able
to launch email you can have an e or if
you want to launch Google Voice you
could write a V on the screen on the
lockscreen and have it automatically
unlock and launch that app for you so
kind of cool you can turn that on set it
to show the trails so that you can see
what you're writing on the screen or not
custom colors in hexadecimal sensitivity
and of course the ability to create your
own gestures so kind of cool right there
now this is getting a little bit long so
I want to jump out of settings even
though there
a bit more that you can do in here
including performance sounds you know
all kinds of cool stuff like that but
let's just take a quick walkthrough of
the device so first of all what I've
done is using a custom launcher it comes
with ADW launcher not IX but just the
base one I've actually replaced that
with launcher Pro and I've set it to
have five rows of icons which you could
do even without CyanogenMod so we've
come through here nice kind of animation
there I can resize my widgets again
because of launch or pro and do all
kinds of cool neat stuff
now this is pretty much what you could
do with the custom launcher on just
about any device but what you can do
with CyanogenMod is this neat little
thing right here called theme chooser
now this comes with CyanogenMod seven so
you open that up and you can now
download themes from the market some are
free some cost money and using this
which is actually we've talked about
this before but thanks to t-mobile you
can go through and choose a theme and
apply that to the look and feel of your
device so this is the default one I've
installed red remax purple punch orange
octane and what I've been showing you is
honey cream which is this nice kind of
oil creamed honey color it's kind of tan
but not brown it's just really pretty it
looks professional it looks kind of neat
let me go ahead and show you Android ian
which is a really cool one well apply
that it takes just a minute to do that
and there you go now it's applied but
it's only mostly applied like Billy
Crystal said and the Princess Bride it
mostly it funny reference go go watch
the movie if you haven't seen it but if
you look down here you now see that
instead of that kind of cream color I
now have this cool green color and if I
grab that window shade and pull it up I
now have as if you can see right down in
here so you know I have a nice
looks almost 3d gradient in there over
the t-mobile well when I said it's only
mostly applied there are some things
that I have to reboot the phone to get
to apply because it is tying deeply into
various components inside the system
let's go ahead and try a another one now
I'm back over here to theme juicer and I
am going to choose to do orange octane
I'll apply that you can see really
quickly that turned everything orange
down there even this is orange with a
nice orange glow around it if we come
over to some other widgets you can see
that that's got kind of an orange glow
and orange glow it's change the theme a
bit to more orange II if we come in here
you'll even notice and this is where you
have to reboot but the gmail icon
specifically is kind of orange II so
with these custom themes you can have a
custom set of icons that go along with
that but again you do have to reboot to
see those take effect so kind of cool
you can do though that does however mean
that those themes are somewhat large in
size and by large you know they can be
about 10 megabytes or so they can also
be very very small if they're just
changing colors some of them are built
for devices with other screen sizes for
example this one that I was running
before I'm gonna apply it anyway
that looks great honey cream does and
that's kind of my favorite for for this
week so it's still kind of cool anyway
so kind of a detailed walkthrough of
CyanogenMod 7 and what you can do with
it on your phone kind of digging into
more of the nuts and bolts I'm really
impressed with it I really like it I've
been running it all the way since it
came out with the first night they
builds all the way through the release
candidates that's a side note they had 4
release candidates this time which is
about double what they normally have so
this is running really strong really
stable I've got it running on my
t-mobile g2 and love it my wife has it
running on her her t-mobile Nexus One
and loves it as well so I think you will
too if you want to know how to flash
signage
seven on your device head on over to
pocketnow.com and we'll give you a link
that will show you basically a resource
of how to do it on on your phone because
your phone isn't gonna be the same as my
phone there's lots of different ways to
get it on there so we'll give you a good
resource on how you can do this to your
own device and get going on the
open-source Android project really it's
all kinds of neat so if you like C and
this kind of stuff of course give the
video a thumbs up if you haven't been
over to pocketnow.com recently make sure
you head over there and get some of our
written articles not just our videos we
even have our podcasts over there so you
can listen to them as well
so for pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
