products like the G flex 2 from LG my
biggest surprise came from my visit to
ZTE and now we get to take it out for a
spin I'm high memory but I'm with pocket
now here are the run boxing of the ZTE s
pro 2 digital projector if you're asking
yourself why you should buy the gentle
protector powered by Android I'm about
to spend a week showing you the benefits
of one in our full review coming very
soon for now let's talk about the box
which coming from AT&amp;amp;T is sadly not
saying much 18th e is already infamous
for making any unboxing experience doll
or stripping away accessories to a
maximum but the unboxing of the ZTE s
pro 2 is not that bad first of all we
have the ZTE s pro 2 friend center and
the significant amount of accessories
accompanying it this device is powered
by Universal 12 volt adapter that's
included in the box which might be a
good idea when powering a 200 lumen slam
for a good deal of time you also get an
HDMI cable since you can use this as a
regular projector if you want to believe
it or not we even get a very neat taste
in the box something odd for AT&amp;amp;T but
what's a digital projector without one
in addition you also get literature and
the sim ejector tool now I promise you
I'll try to get a regular digital
protector in order to give you a full
size comparison of the S pro 2 because
it is surprisingly small I mean it's
just 5.3 inches in height 5.2 inches in
width and even though it's definitely
not light at 20 ounces nor thin at 1.2
inches no digital protector is the top
is dominated by a 5 inch 720p
touchscreen a power button and the rest
is the usual bells and whistles of a
digital protector only smaller and even
includes volume buttons
I'm sadly not a fan of this dark blue
model nor the honeycomb texture on the
sides when compared to the silver model
that we saw at CES but hopefully you'll
grow on me powering it up provides a
very similar set up experience to what
you get with most Android phones only
with a ZT proprietary skin and a
horizontal experience now interesting
even though we do get a 63
milliamp hour battery in the package or
should I say in the projector sadly it
seems that we have to connect it to the
wall II who want maximum brightness with
the lamp so we'll report back on that
with our full review packing everything
in the included case makes you feel like
if you're carrying a small netbook in a
sleeve so yes this is a small and light
enough to be part of your computer bag
when needed something that was
definitely not the case a few years ago
and that's definitely a good way to
start with my experience with the s pro
2 for the next few days it's small it's
light it's practical
let's just see how it performs I've got
a full list of games that I want to
start playing with this product with a
Bluetooth controller including the
karaoke night with some friends but for
now make sure you follow us on social
media subscribe to youtube channel as
well you can follow me on Twitter hide
me underscore teretha please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I am hi meri behna thank you very
much for watching we'll see you very
soon with a review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
