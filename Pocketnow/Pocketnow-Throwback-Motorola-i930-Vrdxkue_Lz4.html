30 millimeter thick body if those kind
of specs don't get your motor running
you don't remember 2005 very well I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our throwback review of the
Motorola I 930 the AI 930 remains one of
the most unique smartphones of all time
seeing Windows Mobile in a clamshell
form factor was always somewhat rare but
this sucker took one-of-a-kind to new
heights first of all though it had a GSM
radio for international roaming onboard
the eye 930 was only built for one u.s.
network technology ID n the push-to-talk
centric digital network used by Nextel
and practically no one else by the time
this phone was launched at the tail end
of next tells glory days in 2005 it had
been delayed so many times that diehard
fans had been waiting almost two years
for its release even though it was
already somewhat dated even by the
standards of the day the pent up demand
from that long wait plus the prestige of
a rare 900 class model number meant next
tells then new owner sprint sold a lot
of these devices in the hand the 930
exemplifies everything Motorola's Falcon
line of ident stood for at 167 grams
it's substantial at 30 millimeters thick
even without our expanded battery cover
here it's massive and it's metal and
impact resistant plastic construction
means it can take a beating as well as
any other next cellphone on the front is
a 4096 color stn LCD screen with a
resolution of 96 by 65 above which sits
the phone's one and only camera it's VGA
resolution was outdated already at
launch as devices with 1.3 megapixel
cameras like the eye 870 were already
starting to land on next Oh on the
left-hand side between the 2.5
millimeter headphone jack and the volume
rocker is the familiar PTT button for
Direct Connect calls that button hasn't
changed much at all in 15 years
see pocket now is Kyocera torque review
to confirm that around back is the
Nextel branding and the powerful rear
mounted speaker and up top we've got
more push-to-talk controls the
speakerphone toggle and smart key the
latter allowed a user to access the
call list and some apps via the external
display making it possible to place
phone and Direct Connect calls without
opening the device next to the smart key
is the i9 30s extendable antenna the
wideband identic Knology onboard would
theoretically have enabled data speeds
of up to 100 kilobits per second but the
eye 930 shipped with this feature
disabled and Sprint never enabled it the
930 thus chugged along at a painful 20
kilobits per second on a good day on the
right hand side is a full-size SD card
slot with a maximum capacity of 2 gigs
and above it sits the IR port windows
branding and an awesome feature that
some Nokia 6126 fans may find familiar
integrated into the eye 930 status light
is a quick release button for the
phone's flip in 2005 folks this was hot
business opening the device reveals the
phone's 176 by 220 display along with
the numeric keypad customized for
Windows Mobile flanking the d-pad or 2
soft keys in the upper corners a home
and back button off to the sides and a
talkin end key down left and right the
power button set below the number keys
which were sunk a little further down
than on the I 930 s contemporaries
probably to prevent them from scratching
the screen when closed a chronic problem
with many motorola ident found the
software is vintage Windows Mobile
Smartphone 2003 being powered along by a
180 megahertz processor backed up by 32
Meg's of RAM there's a horizontal ribbon
of recently used apps a status area with
time date and network status recent
calls upcoming appointments and a
voicemail and message count down below
interestingly as the Nextel network
didn't support mobile originated SMS for
the majority of its existence
MMS was used for all messages even those
without media attached it all looks
fairly archaic now but in 2005 for ID
end users accustomed to phones whose
features routinely lag behind those on
more popular networks the added
functionality of Windows Mobile made the
AI 930 the most powerful non blackberry
on nextel many people routinely
criticized its poor battery life its
lack of Bluetooth disabled wide n mode
low res camera high price tag and a
thick build that required a holster to
carry it effectively
but many more people overlooked these
shortcomings to buy one and for their
money they got an excellent voice and
push-to-talk machine with smartphone
features that though they weren't fast
or at least solid at one time in America
being a Nextel customer meant the same
thing being an Apple customer used to
mean you were part of something
different something special the I 9:30
was unique besides its camera less I 920
variant no other Flip smartphones
existed on Nextel that plus its
artificially inflated demand from two
years of delays made the 930 the king of
the special phones and it remains
perhaps the most legendary mobile phone
from the golden years of push-to-talk
