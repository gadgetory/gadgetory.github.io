LG phones one of the premier features we
look forward to testing is the headphone
quad DAC and amp system our hands-on
with the V 30 we're currently using
pre-release hardware and software so
we'll have to wait just a bit for a full
real audio review but we're already
seeing or hearing actually phenomenal
performance we recently tested the V 20
against a premium standalone music
player and it was really the only phone
which could give this Pheo a run for its
money in our early testing the V 30 is
shaping up to be a worthy successor this
multistage signal processing helps
reduce noise and produce a high fidelity
audio output this year more
manufacturers are delivering Tru 32-bit
playback thanks to improvements from
Qualcomm on Snapdragon chipsets no
longer such a rarity LG faces more
competition pumping out a clean signal
but where this phone still stands alone
is with an incredible amp which is aware
of the quality of headphones you use
it's important to properly drive nicer
headphones with a powerful signal but
you also don't want to overdrive
consumer grade headphones the V 30
detects the hardware and will
intelligently scale amp output to match
the connected audio device sure 3.5
millimeter jacks might seem
old-fashioned to some manufacturers but
we're still able to teach these jacks a
few new tricks we're holding off on
posting our charts and graphs until
we're closer to a consumer release but
early impressions are very positive
this phone produces quality nearing the
limits of my home recording equipments
ability to further detect differences
and more testing is required but LG
seems to be engaging in less audio
manipulation when the phone is set to a
flat EQ plus we have a few more options
to manipulate playback for folks who
like tweaking bass and treble settings
we don't get the same techy cool
features found on HTC or Samsung phones
that customize via ear scanning tricks
but the core experience of powering
headphones with a punchy amp is a
significant step above the rest of the
flagship phone pack
this year we'll be answering all your
questions soon full charts and graphs on
headphone performance a few speaker
samples so you can see how it stacks up
against the competition and we're all
dying to know if LG is going to have a
partnership setup with a company like
BMO to make sure we've got some nice
headphones in the box
we'll have more to report soon and if
listening to music podcasts videos or
game audio on the go is an important
feature to you we think you're gonna
like what we'll have to show you as
always thanks so much for watching be

coverage and help us out with a share on
your favorite social networks for pocket

guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
