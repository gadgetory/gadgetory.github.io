privately showcased at CES reports
claimed that it looks a little better
Apple reportedly also cut down on its
production of the iPhone for the first
quarto of 2019 it looks like the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 Lite is gonna get a better
name that what we heard I'm high metal
II that I'm reporting from CES 2019
we've got more live coverage of
everything that's here there's a lot of
cool actually this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with
product launches we already have a
hands-on video being cooked for the new
biometric Mars we've got Jabra we've got
DJI also there are a ton of launches
also something from Hisense that we're
really looking forward to sharing with
you guys CES is getting really cool and
obviously we're to find new stuff is in
the playlist in the channel now let's
talk about the Google pixel 3 and pixel
3 excel for those of you that we're
complaining including all of us
reviewers of the poor quality and audio
when it comes to filming video there's a
software update that apparently fixes
that and that's not the only fix there
were other people that were having
issues in recording video as well
thinking it was a codec issue or
whatever the case may be make sure you
get the software update I haven't
updated in mind I'll keep you posted
when I do now for those of you that
joined me in thinking that the Galaxy S
10 should not be called the light
because of all the specs that we covered
yesterday the first time that it's going
to be called a galaxy s 10 II what are
they thinking with the e I have no clue
hopefully they'll explain it at the
event but we have reports that we might
be getting some information on invites
very soon and yes Apple is not having a
good time when it comes to sales of
iPhones up to the point where the
company is reportedly dropping
production by 10% so those 47 million
they were planning to produce for the
first quarter is barely gonna be more
like 40 million and it could be even
worse going forward as you know products
decline over time so we'll see about
that
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the Galaxy EF and
reports from the Korea Times that it was
showcased privately to people here I'm
not on the list and I'm not kidding this
time I have not seen it yet the reports
claim that it's actually thinner than
what was showcased earlier in the
developer
friends that you can break it have you
bend it to a certain degree and so many
other things which just makes me think
that it's not even close to being a
finished product
there's no in the comments down below I
mean what do you think do you think
there's actually a reason for this
foldable craziness to happen or not
because in my case I still feel that
it's a solution in search of a problem
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
