for Alcatel in 2018 bringing what they
say is the best of their Idol phones at
multiple affordable price points I'm
high metal Yvette are with Jules Wang
reporting for Pocket now at CES 2018
let's take a closer look we should say
before going on that Alcatel will detail
specifics on devices at MWC but they're
introducing their blueprints right now
the models on display are just that
actually models on display that's set
this is our first look at the Alcatel
one three in five series you'll notice
that they all have fingerprint sensors
at the backend extra-wide displays
probably the best looker of the bunch is
the Alcatel five series but what's still
hard to believe is that this device is
apparently going to retail for under
$300 the Alcatel three is no slouch when
it comes to the deluxe department thanks
to its reflective back dual cameras and
even this one will go for under $200 the
Alcatel one series is probably the only
lovely one in the bunch but for $100 you
can't really ask for much like seriously
oh and that I mentioned that all devices
include the new standard two by one
aspect ratio across the board if you're
asking yourself how is that even
possible with these budget offerings
well that's because TCL will be
providing the panels of these devices
since yes Alcatel belongs to TCL and we
know the company is having a lot of
success in its TV business obviously it
will be interesting to see just how well
the synergy works when we review these
devices some markets l1 phones will run
with the lighter version of Android or
EO under the Android go program
meanwhile select three and five series
phones will get dual cameras either on
the rear or the selfie side specs are
still not provided but we're happy to
see headphone jacks are being included
on all devices
all the while TCL wants to imbue the
aesthetic of its previous idol phones
match with some aggressive price tags
this is not to say that the idol line
will end but it's just to be clear that
the focus right now is diversification
of choice all on a budget we'll look
forward to seeing these devices in our
review labs very soon but
the meantime make sure you shine in the
comments and let us know what your
opinion is on this new approach and
