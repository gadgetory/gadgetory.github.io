might know i've got a nexus one right
now and i really like it but the samsung
galaxy just came out and it's really
cool it's got the same type of processor
1 gigahertz different brand but about
the same speed but the cool thing is
it's got this really really powerful
graphics process or GPU now with that
graphics processor they've got their own
UI overlay kind of like the sense UI
from HTC they also have some cool live
wallpapers that really take advantage of
that high-power GPU let me go show you
what they look like ok so here's my
nexus one running cyanogen mind five
point zero point eight and you can see
I've got the beautiful live weather live
wallpaper running right now on it really
like that I've already done an article
on it so let's jump right into what the
Samsung live wallpapers look like to get
there I'm going to long press and go to
wallpapers and I'm going to choose live
wallpapers the first one is Aurora
similar to the aurora borealis I'll set
that and you can see here I can interact
with it and touch and make some little
fireworks here on the screen that just
kind of fade out to know where you've
got these little lines that come through
and just dance through the screen kind
of like the aurora borealis just kind of
nice elegant looking it's pretty doesn't
do anything but it's pretty let's see
what else we've got the next one is blue
sea now this reminds me of Windows 95
windows 98 with the bubbles screensaver
can tap on these bubbles and interact
with them make them glow on the inside
just kind of pretty and they just sit
there and float and look nice next up
we've got dandelion now this is one of
the fun
I'm gonna go ahead and set that as the
wallpaper first of all you've got these
lines coming through I don't really know
what that has to do with dandy lines but
it looks kind of cool it adds some more
motion to the screen you've got a nice
color fade from blue down to yellow at
the bottom with a green in the middle
and then you've got these stylistic
dandelions that if you come in here and
poke Adam the little dandelion seeds
will go away they just kind of float in
the breeze so just kind of neat here's
the one that I really want to show you
you all remember the water wallpaper
that first came out and everybody loved
it I mean it looked cool it was like
maple leafs falling on on a nice rainy
puddle well this is called ocean waves
we'll go ahead and load that up this is
where the Samsung GPU really shines on
the nexus one which again it's a 1
gigahertz processor it's a little bit
laggy on the Samsung it's nice it's
crisp it's clean it's smooth but you can
still come in here and interact I'll be
it a little bit slowly but then you've
got just this nice view looking down
through the water at the bottom of the
sea or wherever it is there are no fish
for that you'll want to get one of the
koi pond or other live wallpapers it's
available in the marketplace but for
something from Samson that comes from
the phone or comes right on the phone
itself these wallpapers are pretty neat
and for one of the developers over at
XDA developers to go through and port
them over to the nexus one that's even
cooler I know you're aching to figure
out how to do that so hop on over to my
article and I'll show you how if you
thought these wallpapers were cool go
ahead and give a thumbs up to this video

now channel you're missing out we update
