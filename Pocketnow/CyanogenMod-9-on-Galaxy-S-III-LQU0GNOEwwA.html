pocketnow.com you know Google did a
really good job with Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich it's beautiful it's
functional and it's fast which makes it
a shame that the manufacturers come in
and put the proprietary interfaces on
top of Ice Cream Sandwich whether that
sense or nature UX or the many many
other interface replacements that are
out there so we were really excited to
learn that CyanogenMod 9 beta is
available for the Samsung Galaxy s3
because we've got great hardware here
and finally we can get the most
performance out of the device as
possible without the clutter and all
those extra features we just want
unadulterated Android 4.0 and we're
gonna show it to you in this video
CyanogenMod 9 on the samsung galaxy s3
let's get to it alright let's take a
look and as is the case with all cm9
Knightley's this is not a final release
it has a couple of bugs but so far I
have found the bugs to be not that
significant in fact I'm probably gonna
use this as some idea of a driver now so
we turn on the walk screen and what we
see is the Ice Cream Sandwich lockscreen
woohoo no water droplets or crazy sounds
and what we have here is trebuchet which
is the CyanogenMod 9 home screen
launcher which allows you to change a
lot about it
so if we go into settings here then we
go into launcher we can change a couple
of different settings here trebuchet is
the name of it of course you can install
any third-party launcher that you want
but right out of the box
unlike the galaxy s3 out of the box with
Samsung software you can make folders
quit clean easily just as Google
intended which is very nice to see so
yeah everything works and everything
feels stock of course as we mentioned
there are some added settings here like
the ability to theme in the system make
some changes to system settings we get
the performance tab down here which
allows you to do some things with memory
management and with the CPU and these
are all CyanogenMod 9 features of course
so just kind of some some additions
another thing we can do which is always
great is we can go into
notification drawer settings so we can
really customize what's up here we can
turn on a battery percentage lots of
other cool stuff that you can do let's
jump into the browser real quick and
we've actually already got pocket now
loaded so very good performance here
although the galaxy s3 had pretty good
performance in the stock web browser but
it's even better now because you have
more RAM available less ram being used
with the TouchWiz UX nature UI that that
Samsung likes to push and one of the
best parts of CyanogenMod of course is
that we get the stuck Ice Cream Sandwich
just as nature intended email app so the
email app in the galaxy s3 was pretty
bad it had a confirm delete box that you
cannot tell to go away so in other words
every time you deleted a message it
would say are you sure you want to
delete the message another problem the
email app was that all of the action
buttons were at the top so you had to
reach a thumb all the way to the top and
an Ice Cream Sandwich the action buttons
are on the bottom just like where they
should be so if you're rooted and you
have a custom bootloader like
clockworkmod recovery installed
installing this rom is as easy as
transferring the file to your phone to
your SD card and installing it from the
recovery so that's it that's CyanogenMod
9 and it works very well and it gives
you that unadulterated Android 4.0
experience which is very nice purely
this video please give us a thumbs up
and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
