big splash in the United States you see
all our coverage of their devices this
year and last year now we have the z5s
mini here at mwc Tony behind the camera
hi mate with pocket now let's go through
the spout now ZT is a very interesting
company you would think that they are
doing mid tiered phones specifically
because everything that they launch is
not with the highest and specifications
yet their phones actually performed
quite well we saw the grand memo to we
saw the new ba5 that I reviewed and the
z5s LTE that we saw at CES and then
we've got their mini variant and what
makes this phone different first of all
we've got a 4.7 inch 720p display this
time and we also have a qualcomm 1.7
gigahertz quad-core processor which I do
assume that is a 400 we've this phone
only weighs 120 grams and you can feel
that it's light even with this huge
tether that it's got here so we've got a
2,000 milliamp hour battery this is
running Android 4.2 point2 sadly and
it's running on top of this basic and
pretty much it's a card you why that
we've already seen with the previous
Nubia devices that we've launched you
can it doesn't have two layers only one
there is no app tray here and you can
add as many of these home screens as you
want you can build them with widgets and
apps and folders in the same spot it's
actually kind of interesting now one of
the coolest thing about this phone is
that even though you don't have optical
image stabilization you do have a 13
megapixel camera the back to the flash
and you do have a 5 megapixel camera at
the front it seems that everybody's
doing that this year now other than that
we have the typical basics the typical
sensors that's obvious it's available in
white green pink yellow and blue again
this is a mid-tier drone and this is
even more mature than the basic it's
just smaller and more pocketable easier
to handle aside from that again it's
hard to tell you if this phone will ever
make a big splash in the United States
again this is ct's big push foot so far
I'll tell you this much doesn't look
that bad and its really light truly
portable and the build quality doesn't
feel as cheap as we felt with the newbie
of 500
this time every other phone pocket now
Tony behind the camera we've got more
coverage from WC believe it or not and
will upload it very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
