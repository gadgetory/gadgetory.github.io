pocketnow.com looking at the HTC One
we're at the launch event just want to
show you some more things here we've got
sense 5 here a new version of sense so
let's take a look at SMS again beautiful
picture display here we get this really
interesting flat UI it's not
conversation bubbles like we're kind of
used to kind of this very flat and in
the cameras having trouble focusing kind
of this flat UI that's the story with
HTC sense 5 it's a flat UI everywhere
you look and you know that's a really
good thing let's go to the dialer see
what that's about so like in Android 4.1
from there on we have a swipe to the
right to the left gesture to access your
things and this is just a gorgeous you I
here for the new version of sense we go
all the way all the way to the right
almost we have people we've got all
these these quick action thingies a lot
to see here in the new version of sucks
HTC has spent a considerable amount of
time I mess around with sense let's go
through the settings and take a look at
what we have here let's scroll to the
top we have new buttons here kind of a
different style with a little kind of
slash line there and that will allow you
to turn on the various toggles we've got
media output to go to your deal on DLNA
capable device here in more we've got
mobile network sharing NFC toggle and
notice something here NFC is turned on
but we don't have an annoying NFC
notification here in the top bar that is
a relief going down to personalise see
what we have your weave wallpaper
lockscreen style and this is interesting
we've seen this in previous versions of
sense we
the no lock screen which is kind of cool
we've got music we've got photo album
productivity which just shows you your
calendar and wallpaper which is what is
there currently customized home screen
which will bring you into the widget
adding view and some sound settings here
let's keep going down accounts and sync
you know if that looks like just there
really nicely skin to you I I'd say it's
nicer than stock Android and HTC has
always done that location services some
of this stuff is kind of boring you'll
see if you can find some interesting
stuff got a Beats Audio toggle on and
off we talked about to display gestures
and buttons in a previous video we can
change the double-click speed for the
multitask you I with cheese sensor
calibration then we've got that three
finger output gesture to turn on the
DLNA to go to your TV screen sir we have
an appt see how things look because
things look different for example if you
go into power just get this beautiful
HTC you I thats a little bit familiar
language and keyboard settings so we can
turn on trace give you that swype like
situation where you can swipe along the
keys developer options yes don't ask me
again I know so you can turn on
developer options like you can I but you
cannot turn on the bell our options here
and you can turn off screen area nations
and all its up and finally down in the
bottom exciting software information HTC
Sense 5.0 says it and Android 4.1 4.2
though I imagine this is going to be
upgradeable to key lime pie HTC says
that this is capable of running future
versions of Android so we assume that is
what that means so just a quick look at
settings and some other stuff here and
sense 5 on the HTC One and I want to get
a closer look here at blinkfeed this new
concept that HTC wants to bring in lots
of different news feeds glanceable
information from facebook twitter your
calendar news services all on your home
screen one question I had is
is this endlessly scrolling and while
you tell me yes it keeps going and going
and going another question I had about
this and obvi as you can see these are
little tiles with beautiful images that
links to stories and if you tap on one
of these like for example Rihanna's dad
wants grandchildren that's fascinating
it takes you into the same exact app
every time it's a reader it's just a
reader the font size is adjustable which
is nice a very minimal reader if you get
the back button up here it will go back
to that screen I was also curious if you
can configure the size of these tiles by
tapping and holding and the answer is no
the link feed will automatically change
the size of the tiles presumably to a
preset mosaic it kind of looks good so
we've got sort of a one that goes
two-thirds of the way and then a third
we've got full full width one another
for with one and got a skinny one so
really interesting how they do this and
now if you want to change the settings
of this guy you go up to here to these
three dots by the way there's search bar
wonder what that does I see it searches
through all of your information here
that you have on your blinkfeed that
could be handy we go to topics and
services to shoot you all the stuff you
can add and I really like this section
services in apps because you can add
facebook twitter that's something i
would definitely do if you can see it I
would also add calendar Zoe share that's
an interesting way to kind of put
together pictures that you've taken in a
really nice artistic way kid mode I have
no idea what that is we'll have to check
that out later and these are the
featured headlines these are from the
different news services there's not that
much here right now presumably more will
be added in the future and you can drill
down into categories let's go to
technology in science shall we gadgets
that sounds good so now if we go back to
the home screen we should be getting
some more gadgets stuff now of course
you might be wondering where
a real home screen like the traditional
android home screen it's to the right
and you can actually specify where that
occurred so if we add a panel and I'm
just guessing here but you should be
able to tap and hold yep and put this
somewhere else you should be able to do
that so that maybe your blinkfeed is in
the center and then your other standard
android home streets are on the side as
mentioned in order to add widgets you
pinch that's HTC leap right there but
kind of time reconfigured I guess to be
a little bit more inclusive of other
stuff got all of our widgets here really
fast performance let's sing a complex
widget Oh weather clock hey now that's
good because we thought weather clock
was dead can't be an HTC phone if you
don't have weather clock anyway so
looked at blinkfeed and the home screen
system here on the HTC One something
else to know is that from here in the
apt ray you can't tap in moon anymore to
bring back to the home screen you gotta
go like that that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
