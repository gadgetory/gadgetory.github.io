market share while others begin to grow
swatch unveils its SmartWatch offering
and makes it really hard not to
disappoint and oneplus begins teasing
its future handset I'm high memory betta
and after a very crazy day let's get
over with the news this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
1 plus we have been covering the rumors
of the oneplus Mini or oneplus X for a
while now and the company has just
decided to send out a teaser apparently
there is an event to happen on October
29 and well it's got an ex one and
number two they're teasing something
beautiful and powerful so yeah let's see
what we get and for those of you that
have been waiting for the swatch
SmartWatch that will last for I don't
know how long
well you can kind of forget about it as
of now it's called the swatch bellami
and yes it cost just $90 but there's a
reason for that it's not really a
SmartWatch you don't get an operating
system you don't get any sort of fitness
tracking any sort of heart rate sensors
or whatever all you get is an option for
mobile payments and we are really trying
to understand what went wrong with
swatch here I mean what other company
does mobile payments on a watch only
Apple and people rarely use it for that
but well it is what it is and even
though we are still a week away from the
HTC be brilliant event we've been
covering the leaks of the HTC One a9 and
today orange the carrier ended up just
pretty much showing us the press renders
of the device if you see an iPhone with
the movement in the camera yeah it looks
a lot like the iPhone but then again
this is a very sleek Android design and
specifications aren't really that bad
links in the description for what we got
and let's just wait for the event and
even though I can't remember the last
time we had so many blackberry news the
company has just the announced that's
pre-registration for the blackberry
proved their Android powered device and
within the pre-registration which you
can apply for you also get more
information on specification like for
example a 34 10 million power battery in
addition to a 5.4 inch display
even though no other details were
provided we could be getting this phone
sooner than later
looks very hot in those renders by the
way and finally the very interesting
news of the day have to do with
smartphone market share as we get
details worldwide and even though
Samsung and Apple continued to be the
top players being Samsung the leader
this is very interesting both companies
have lost 2% within the quarter compared
to other companies like Lenovo and
Huawei which have respectively grown 1
percent and obviously 2 percent of the
top markets here is not the same as 1
percent of the load markets here so yeah
we do know that it's a lot more phones
and that 2 percent than in that 1
percent growth but it does lead me to
the question of the day what do you
think Lenovo and Huawei have been doing
good lately for them to grow in
comparison to every other company in my
case Lenovo thank you for acquiring
Motorola thank you for doing something
good with it and in the case of Huawei
well it seems that they're doing
something right with their latest
high-end smartphones but leave us a
