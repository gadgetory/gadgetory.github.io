the media after the review period is
done there are a few that stand out
gadgets that people still ask about
months later some that we even decide to
hold on to his daily drivers and then we
get to see aged over time the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 plus is one of them
we're just a few days away from the next
unpacked and if your mind is set on
grabbing a good deal on our favorite
all-rounder of 2018 you've come to the
right place I'm hey Matt we got our with
pocket now and this is our galaxy s 9
plus after the buzz for the past four
generations we've considered samsung's
latest galaxy s s the best all-rounder
not the jack of all trades and master of
none this is actually a phone that can
do a ton of things and get most of these
rights though when it comes to aging it
did get a few things right and others
not so much
this was my primary smartphone for about
two months after its release and I
drifted back a few times for comparison
purposes during that time it suffered
too hard falls onto concrete one from
waist height which left a flat dent on
the top right corner and then the other
from a tall table which I thought would
completely obliterate the glass as it
turns out it did end up with two
horrible dents on opposite corners but
that was it the glass on both sizes
nearly scratched free and if it wasn't
for the fading oleophobic coating which
has left me with smudge central this
phone has proven to be a champ at taking
a beating trust me I learned my lesson
and started using this awesome leather
case by mojo I highly recommend their
minimalistic approach to Galaxy cases
and the fact that even after a third
major drop of the case the leather
barely shows any signs of wear size wise
this phone was a breath of fresh air
after my time with the Galaxy Note 8 the
curvier body makes it less of a pain to
carry in jeans and more comfortable to
hold in your hand
little things like the movement of the
fingerprint scanner to a more ergonomic
area went really far for me because this
iyer scanning face to unlock is simply
hit or miss most of the time it was also
a refreshing solution to the knotch
frenzy of 2018 the 6.2 inch super amoled
infinity display is still our favorite
and second only to the larger galaxy
note 9 from its amazing color
reproduction and contrast to its great
viewing angles and that infinity pool
effect seen from the side to its overall
symmetry this screen is an industry
standard in my opinion it's stereo
speakers even a year later sound a lot
better than most of its competitors it's
one of the proud feel that's kept the
headphone jack and this phone even has
my favorite always-on display as well
with more useful information than most
its internals have also H well the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 spent the year
powering all of our favorite phones and
it was well matched with six eco bytes
of RAM 64 gigs of expandable storage and
a decent size 3500 milliamp hour battery
this phone is also one of the field that
supports faster wireless charging fast
charging through USB C and the ip68
water and this resistance meant peace of
mind in all conditions that I used it
sadly as I mentioned at the beginning
not everything about this phone aged
perfectly fun fact I've spent weeks
delaying this video because I was
waiting to showcase my thoughts on one
UI over android ty but ya know this
hasn't happened and this is seriously
one of the most frustrating things about
Samsung phones they are notorious for
late updates or for flat-out illogical
approaches to fragmenting updates as
well and probably one of the major
reasons why I was looking forward to
this update is because I have noticed
slowdowns here and there and how the
device performs which is quite odd
considering that the Galaxy Note 9 has
the exact same specs and UI and doesn't
bog down at all it's not to say that
performance is terrible you'll rarely
notice these stutters it's just not
expected from a phone of this caliber
and as stuff which one you I was
supposed to fix if only I got the update
and then there's the case of battery
life where even if you don't touch this
phone for hours the battery will take a
hit regardless
stuff which again doesn't happen to the
Galaxy Note 9 now don't get me wrong I'm
not gonna bash Samsung for everything
there are things that I do praise from
its software like the edge menus I do
rely on them constantly for shortcuts
and app pairs which I find to be
convenient now the one thing that did H
really well on this phone is the camera
I praise the camera during my review
given its interesting approach through
variable aperture and I feel strange
software updates have made it even
better one major change that I've
noticed that started with a galaxy note
9 was this new subtle approach to
photography where photos are no longer
oversaturated colors are on point with
dynamic range being just epic even in
low-light this camera now does a far
better job than it did when it launched
I highly recommend that you watch my
comparison to the 1 plus 6 see where
you'll notice the differences though
again it's not perfect I sadly feel that
Samsung still needs to work on its
shutter speed as moving subjects and
low-light or still hit or miss and then
something else that I will praise as
portrait photography not because Samsung
gets it best but because if you don't
like the results you can always just go
back to the standard photo and then
video recording on this phone has also
seen an interesting boost now with
colors not being as muted as before and
with some really good stabilization and
improved dynamic range
selfie video still suffers from a bad
crop it's the bill ization is great and
this is one of only a few phones that
supports 2k video recording from the
selfie camera to conclude let's just say
that after a full year there are still
reasons to consider buying the samsung
galaxy s 9 plus and also a good deal of
warning signs if you go for it I
honestly did not expect this hardware to
age so well that ii dropped this phone
which stood should have broken it and it
still looks nearly brand new at least
from a distance sadly I wish I could say
the same about software seriously if a
year later this phone has trouble
getting major Android updates I honestly
doubt it'll get any better in the next
year or so now the biggest question what
I still buy this phone if this were my
money I would if I found a good deal on
places like swap I feel that it's not
worth it to buy it new right now and I
doubt that carrier deals would beat what
you'll find for a slightly used phone on
swap ah and if you're still holding on
to a Galaxy S 9 plus and are considering
upgrading this is the best time to list
it on swap on resale values proven to be
highest before the next announcement and
we're just a few days away
overall the galaxy s 9 plus is
definitely a great phone it wasn't the
perfect device but Samson can fix this
it just needs to work on having its
software age as well as its hardware

experiences with the galaxy s 9 plus in
