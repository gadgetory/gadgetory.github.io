get more megapixels in its camera but at
a cost microsoft hyperlapse gets
launched from android in windows and no
it's not the same app in a galaxy s6
active shows its space and boy it's ugly
I'm hi Mary Villa and guys the pocket
out daily will return on May
twenty-fifth I will be in China covering
an event so stay tuned for that this is
parking out daily official news today
might disappoint some of you as a HTC
has just announced the new j butterfly
for the japanese market and this is a
polycarbonate HTC one m9 on steroids
you're getting the same Snapdragon 810
but then you get a quad HD display you
get three gigs of ram a 20 megapixel duo
shooter at the back with a 13 megapixel
shooter at the front and expandable
storage which just makes you wonder what
is the point of the One m9 and well
we'll see if it ever launches in the US
and if you thought instagrams hyperlapse
application will remain exclusive to iOS
it kind of will see Microsoft has just
launched its own Microsoft hyperlapse
application and that works in Android
Windows Phone and there's even a pro
version that works on Windows and it's
pretty much the same concept you can
record time lapse videos and these are
recorded in a very smooth way through
algorithms and so many other things that
this application does it is extremely
cool and worth it for you guys to give
it a try but we wonder whatever happened
to the Instagram hyperlapse application
that is really awesome an iOS though now
as much as we like the ax Suzanne watch
last year the company CEO after the
launch talk to us about the zen watch to
and told us that he was going to give us
a full week of battery life on Android
where we really wanted to see that and I
guess we won't it seems that the watch
will be announced at computex on jun 2nd
and no you're not getting a week of
battery life but apparently you're
getting three to four days and that is
really not bad at all let's see and for
those of you that like the design of the
galaxy s6 stay there because it seems it
won't be worth it to consider its active
variants like the galaxy s4 active
remember the s5 act that was horrible
and seen
the s6 active will be just as ugly up to
the point where we really didn't cover
these rumors of the links a few weeks
ago mainly because it looks so much like
the galaxy s5 acted the video was hard
for us to say yeah this is different
phone but it just came up on Samsung's
database so it just seemed to be a real
thing and does seem to be a very ugly
thing as well and finally for the very
concerning news of the day we've got
some trusted sources claiming that even
though those 12 megapixels on the
probable camera the iphone success will
be true it seems that they will come at
a cost as apparently the sensor is not
necessarily going to grow or the pixels
are going to get smaller either way
smaller pixels leads to not the same low
light performance in addition to other
things that we've seen have become much
better with the iphone ever since the
iphone 5s with larger pixels obviously
that was the excuse to remain in that 8
megapixels so we wonder exactly what
Apple is planning here obviously knowing
Cupertino they figured something out but
it does lead me to the question of the
day whenever you're buying a smartphone
does the megapixel count of the camera
matter because in my case no it doesn't
really matter if you give me gorgeous
photos i don't care if you've got an a
bigger pickle shooter but then again
we've got the HTC One m8 and I retract
my comment that would be the only
exception but leave us a comment down
below what is your case and friends
remember I will be in China until May
twenty-fifth that is when the pocket out
daily will return so we want to get the
news earlier before this video is still
machine falls on Parnell comment
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
it follow me on Twitter Jaime underscore
iveta please give this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi
Natalie thank you very much for watching
we'll see you on May twenty-fifth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
