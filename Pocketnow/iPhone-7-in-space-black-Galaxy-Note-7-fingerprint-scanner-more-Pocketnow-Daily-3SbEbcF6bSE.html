type of space gray in the works HTC
finally decides to make its VR plans
official as a separate company and a
certain amount of deals could land you a
couple of good products even for Monday
I'm hi Mary vera and if you've ever
recorded yourself with someone else
watching you it's crazy awkward this is
pocket out daily as we try to do every
single day the official news today begin
with deals if you are in the market for
any galaxy s7 or even a galaxy s6 or
even a gear VR I would highly suggest
you follow the link of the description
there are a couple of deals that have
either of these products for more than
twenty percent off some of these deals
are rather compelling mainly if you buy
the combo so again learn more in the
legs speaking of deals one of our
favorite products of last year is the LG
g4 up to the point where that camera is
still making it to current products this
year and if you want to get a really
good deal on last year's flagship it's
currently available at B&amp;amp;H for two
hundred eighty dollars and we're
actually talking about the black leather
variant that was extremely difficult to
find I consider that a very good deal
even for it being last year stone and
one company that continues making
headlines is HTC from changes like Peter
Chou leaving the company to other things
like saying that they won't spin off
into a PR company and the as of today we
have confirmation that they will chair
Wang has just mentioned that the company
took a little capital there apparently
starting a new company there is a lot of
positive feedback and future according
to Wang into what to expect for VR in
the future in education in business and
definitely in consumer products so we
can expect the vibe to make a big splash
soon hopefully that's the final name for
the company as well now very interesting
twists just emerged for samsung we're
expecting the galaxy note 7 to either
habitat Aoife or probably august second
according to some recent leaks and we
saw some new pens today that have to do
with the fingerprint scanner design
apparently it's gonna become circular
instead of bold and apparently there's
also the option to have to fingerprint
scanner at the top in ways which we
cannot really begin to imagine how
Samsung is going to figure that out but
it would make a lot of sense in the
world for you to be able to hold your
phone from either
direction of Samsung would be able to
pull that off you can learn more from
the pans in the links and finally the
very interesting news today have to do
with the iphone 7 again this phone is
expected to happen in September we're
not expecting major design changes but
we've seen the deep blue color option
the probability that space gray is going
to say quits but today we see some new
leaks that call it a space black option
coming for this device now space black
is not necessarily something we like as
an idea mainly because of the experience
we had with the iphone 5 where it would
just get dented and look horrible after
usage but it could just be that Apple
figured out a way to make this space
black color look good and it leads me to
the question of today obviously the
iphone 7 will probably have to
differentiate itself in color this time
so if you have to choose which would be
your favorite color option for the
iphone 7 if you had to pick because in
my case i would stick the space grey but
i'm not getting the option so i might as
well go for pink leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
