and I would like to bring you a quick
look at the NiO interface on the new
tmobile shadow so let's take a look at
this real quick to unlock the phone as
you could you might be able to see it
says unlocks we push the soft key and
then the HOME key so quickly on the left
side here these icons represent pains as
you navigate through these screens you
get a nice little animation and it will
bring up some different pains and you
can pretty much get all your day-to-day
your usual activities done from the home
screen without having to navigate
through any menu so this is the home
pain and if you have my fav set up
you'll see your circle of your five
faves right there the next pain is the
no notifications stepping back a moment
on the my pain on the home pain you have
the contacts button for the soft key
there and the start start will take you
to the program's a more in-depth
traditional look at the windows mobile
system and then the contacts bring up
your contacts notifications you can left
and right through them right now it says
there's no notification so there's
that's great great out you can take a
look at recent calls text messages
picture messages voice notes windows
live if you have that set up you just
enter your windows live ID and it will
hook up there and setting up any emails
if you have an email setup that would
also show up in this pain for
appointments with no appointments but
right from the home screen I can set up
a new appointment or I can take a quick
look at the debut and we'll see that we
have no appointments so we're just
looking at the NiO interface so we're
going to go back there the t-zone the
t-mobile icon there goes right to browse
web that opens up an ER net explore if
you hit browse tzones it will open up
the proprietary t mobile wap browser
which is really good for their site
because there
mobile sites pretty much designed for
that as you can see there's a timer on
the lock so you don't accidentally call
people it will automatically lock so
going back to the tmobile icon you can
browse the web or you could go to your
tmobile account or you can browse
wallpaper or hifi ringers of course
those cost money it's something else
that you might not see is this d-pad
will actually scroll through these by
just spinning it or you could push your
left and your right selecting them would
just be the button in the center it's
going down the cool thing if you have
your library selected from the home page
you can go through windows mobile or
Windows Media Player or you can just go
to the full screen if you don't want to
do that you can actually from that
screen the home screen we can play your
music pretty cool so interesting stuff
there from the pictures they have a
picture pain and right from the home
screen you can go through the pictures
that are on your phone within the NiO
interface which I really like that so
it's really quick you don't have to
navigate submenus for looking through
your pictures to show them as a picture
of a bicycle i bought this picture of
jupiter on my last pass through the
solar system here we go settings these
are quickly you can manage your
connections if you manage your memory
closing unused programs if you think
that it's running a little bit slow and
you've been using it all day long tell
you what your battery status is you can
change the ringtone or your wallpaper or
even your profile now this is the one I
suggest if you want to go silent change
your profile from here instead of using
the volume buttons on the side the
volume buttons control most of the
sounds but I've noticed a couple times
that alerts with sound even though this
was all the way down so it's going here
and change it to silent
or you can click all settings and go
through more in-depth settings for
different things on the phone so we'll
take a look at that later but right now
this is pretty much it for the the NiO
interface as you can see you get most
things done right from the home screen
you notice there's a compose button
right here right there from the text
message screen I can hit compose and
it'll just bring up I can start typing
out messages get stuck like it thank you
come back again soon and we'll go over
some tips and tricks on how to use your
tmobile shadow to be more productive
thanks again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
