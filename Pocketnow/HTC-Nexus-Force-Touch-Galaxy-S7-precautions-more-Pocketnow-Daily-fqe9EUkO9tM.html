could feature some unique display
capabilities we learn more about some of
the water resistant precautions of the
galaxy s7 we get more details on the
changes that come to Android M I'm hi
Mary Vanna and when you get breakfast
served in the morning with beer you can
only imagine how Fridays go this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Amazon for those of you
that consider that 189 bucks for that
Amazon echo was too much money the
company has just launched two new
speakers that will be available soon for
pre-order the echo dot which is an echo
just smaller it'll cost you $89 but
sadly it seems you need Alexa to be able
to order it there are some walk arounds
in the link of the description but in
addition to that there is also the tap
which is supposed to be a portable
speaker that's some sort of waterproof
in addition to that we will keep you
posted on more details as soon as it's
available by end of March other official
news come from Samsung and six flags for
those of you that don't think that
Samsung is doing something positive for
VR in order to make it the mainstream
guess what if you go to Six Flags now
there is this roller coaster that
includes a gear VR and even though it's
enough of an attraction to go crazy on
it you'll be wearing a gear VR and
you'll be playing some sort of a fire
fighter pilot that kills aliens sort of
the thing that you'll be expecting for
Independence Day the new movie that's
coming out in June a shameless plug by
the way speaking of Samsung let's talk
about the galaxy s7 the company is
gearing up for the phone to be launched
in over the next few days and for those
of you that wonder how exactly will the
company protect you from whenever it is
wet and you're charging your phone
actually the software will prevent it up
to the point where you can connect the
charger to your micro USB connector and
it will actually not charge until it is
dry it's a good safety precaution we
expect more of this to come as soon as
we learn more from the phone when our
review arrives and now that we know that
Google i/o is just a few months away we
learn more about what to expect about
Android and we saw a few leaks a few
weeks ago today we see the leaks of the
settings menu yes the hamburger menus
are
that wasn't too popular but there is
something cool like for example the fact
that if you want to know how much memory
you have left you'll be able to see it
at a glance you will not need to go into
the menu and wait for it to load
obviously there are some other changes
that are coming to android end and we
are hoping that they are aesthetic as we
don't see anything in the settings menu
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with that HTC nexus
smartphone or lineup we're so much sure
we're getting one or two phones but for
those of you that are wondering what's
going to change it seems that
pressure-sensitive displays are going to
be the thing now these won't be the
first Android devices with a
pressure-sensitive display but
apparently Android n or whichever
version of Android that will be featured
on this phones will be able to be
enhanced or be used or taken advantage
up with this new user interface we're
not exactly sure what we're getting
again leaks are going to tell us more
very soon but it leads me to the
question of the day tell me something
how important is pressure sensitivity on
a display to you I've been using the
iphone success for the last few weeks
and I literally forget that for such
technology is there leave us a comment
