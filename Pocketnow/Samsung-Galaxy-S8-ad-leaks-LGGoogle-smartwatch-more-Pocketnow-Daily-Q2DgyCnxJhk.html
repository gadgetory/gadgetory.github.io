the samsung galaxy if 8 aren't wrong at
all LG might be the manufacturer of the
possible Google smartwatches and since
of the future Nokia's black ships might
mimic some sharp entry-level phones I'm
hi meri behna and now i am recording
from the middle of somewhere let's get
through the news this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you are in the market for the
microsoft surface pro 4 probably one of
my favorite tablets that are computers
in the market hey right now the
entry-level model including the keyboard
is just seven hundred dollars that is an
insane deal for probably one of my
favorite computers ever you can learn
more in the look at the description and
isn't it amazing how quick time flies
just a few years ago AT&amp;amp;T told everybody
that in 2017 they would shut down their
2g networks which would be GSM an edge
these are officially shut down as of
today successfully meaning there is no
fallback to edge at some point if you've
lost your 3G or 4G connection that's
pretty much it hopefully things will get
better as we make the move to 5g as
things keep going but obviously we
wonder how that's going to be for those
of you that are keeping legacy phones
now one legacy company that out to try
to change everything is nokia the
company apparently is going to use the
backbone of a sharp aquos entry level
design for its future flagship that's
actually not something we like but the
specification czar actually crazy
Snapdragon 835 six gigs of ram we hear a
possible 128 256 gigs of storage 5.3
inch LCD apparently it's not going to be
an AMOLED panel the only problem is we
don't know when we're getting this
product but we hear that mwc could be
the time for the announcement and for
those of you that are waiting for those
mystery Android wear smartwatches built
by Google apparently the pixel
smartwatches will be built by LG we hear
of an LG watch sport and LG watch file
to be the future smartwatches that will
carry the google logo we don't know
exactly if this is going to be more a
nexus approach or a pixel approach but
whatever the case may be you know google
we really don't care how to
just at this point we just want android
wear to otto unless those watches are
crazy cool you can learn more about the
specs in the description as well and
finally the very hot moose that they
have to do with the samsung galaxy s 8
again and that will be the trend going
forward as we continue to find leaks the
company definitely needs to keep this
phone on its limelight as it tries to
pretty much fix everything with the node
7 killed we've got this very interesting
ad from the company's imola division
where we see the differences between LCD
and AMOLED but at the end of the ad you
will notice that the bezels are pretty
much inexistent for the smartphone that
it's using it to showcase this and for
those of you that haven't seen the case
leaks and renders this pretty much is on
par it seems that this galaxy s 8 will
have very little bezels no home button
etc it leads me to the question of the
day do you think that it's possible that
this design will be the galaxy s 8 or do
you think that it's just being used as a
showcase in my case I feel in the design
is ahead of its time but then again that
is what Samsung does leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way goes if
