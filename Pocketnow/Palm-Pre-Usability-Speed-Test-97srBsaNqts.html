we're going to do a usability speed test
on the palm pre now we started these
usability to be test with the treo 800w
and they're designed to kind of show you
how easy it is to do some average tasks
that you might do with a smartphone
first one is to see how quickly you can
switch between the email contacts and
calendar applications from a suspend
mode power down so ready go contacts
here comes there we are calendar email
and there we go pretty good the next
test is to open a third party
application that's buried within the
interface now it's not right here on the
home screen where you can just press
button real easily you gotta like dig
for it so usually we do google maps
where do you go it is
and there we go it's opening now that's
a really nice interface just search for
the program name hit enter when selected
and that opens it just like Windows
vistas start menu which I think should
have been implemented on windows mobile
as soon as vista was released but anyway
the next test is to open a favorite web
page from the home screen so there's a
number of different ways we can do that
I can just type and then you know search
through google but i'm going to go to
the actual web browser so ready go
and they're right here so that was very
easy as well the bookmarks are right on
the home screen when you launch the web
browser next test is to start playing
music from a specific artist so let's go
back to the home screen ready go
I forget what artists are here
I was try that again
that's a while let's try that again
where you go
just type powerful
alright well there we go that's not too
easy but it's doable next test is adding
a new contact beginning from the home
screen with a specific details of John
Doe so let's go back to the home screen
ready go
come on
work phone
phone number clan
email
there we go that's done
our last test is to start an email to
that contact beginning from the home
screen so now I have to find that
contact and write an email to them where
do you go
opinion
and done
so that's it for our usability speed
tests will have some time just posted
and you can see how it compares to other
devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
