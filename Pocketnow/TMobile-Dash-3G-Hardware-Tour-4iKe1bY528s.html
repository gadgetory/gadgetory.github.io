calm and we've got the new t-mobile dash
3g right here where this is going to be
a hardware tour now if you saw the
review of the snap you'll see lot of
similarities we have a trackball rounded
buttons here however there is no inner
circle button this is a customizable
shortcut key instead and you'll also
notice the keyboard layout is a little
bit different normally on these core
teeth um boards you see keyboards are
all straight aligned buttons like that
and usually you got the cue and am uh
all the way on the left but as Brandon
pointed out with a snap there's a tab
key here which made you know you're used
to having the queue in the a right there
unlined but that made it kind of weird
with the dash 3g the a is all the way to
the left and you also notice that the
keys are offset you know they're not
aligned straight which is very similar
to a normal keyboard so you have qaz
it's kind of at a diagonal whereas this
one it goes Q and then the a goes to the
left and lezzies way over here I was
kind of put off by the shift key being
here but if you look at a real keyboard
it's where it's supposed to be because
you know these other palm devices always
have the function key there so it's you
know different but whether it's good or
bad you got to get used to it the calm
over here that's good period direct
access to those keys you have a 2.4 inch
screen up here it's 320 x 240 qvga your
speaker grill
an LED light in a ambient light sensor
up there a microphone down here you got
your left softkey home key back key
right soft key sometimes I could confuse
as to which one is over you know the
soft key when trying to use it
one-handed without looking just got to
remember where it were there and on the
side we have while up and down where
it's really well much better than the
old dash with the finger slide your
plane over do on the side over here we
have a flap that covers up the extended
USB port and it really sucks having it
over here because when you're in the car
I want to plug it into the car into the
stereo got this big adapter sticking out
on the side that's pain I also hate the
flat book t-mobile seems to look adding
the slap on the bottom we got nothing
you got a leonardo backs a 2 megapixel
camera and another external speaker and
here's another hard thing this whole
back is all very flush it doesn't slide
so it's very difficult to open you have
to get in there and kind of pry it but
this piece is very thin too so it's very
difficult to open but I found if you put
a penny in and twist it that'll do it
so there you go here's your battery
better comes out like that and under
here is the sim card you have a little
latch that locks it in and then right
there is the microSD slot so you do have
to take off this cover every time you
want to switch your SIM card or micro SD
card and it's a real pain and look we
have a penny and you know the trick so
there we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
