possible launch this month an HTC dual
mode android and windows phone handset
gets rumored as well and the surface RT
just cost mr. Steve Ballmer a chunk of
his bonus I'm hai mera neta and please
make sure you switch the incognito mode
before you start watching this video
this is pocket out daily source day off
with some official and sad news and as a
matter of fact all the news today is
kind of sad as it turns out mr. Steve
Ballmer is getting a pay cut from his
bonus because of the sad performance of
the surface RT turns out that the
company obviously had to lose nine
hundred million dollars in extra
inventory for this tablet and he's going
to get only seventy-nine percent of his
bonus so yeah the poor guy is only going
to get four hundred thirty-four thousand
dollars from the five hundred fifty
thousand dollars he usually gets from a
bonus I am so sad for and for all seven
of you that are still carrying a
blackberry well have you thought that
Fairfax financials had bought the
company as it turns out it was only a
proposal the company is still in dire
straits and some analysts are already
predicting exactly how long it would
take for blackberry to go bankrupt with
their existing cash ins they're not
selling anything and as it turns out the
company only has 18 months to live so
you better sell that phone right now and
I mean now now another company that's
bleeding cash like there's no tomorrow
and I actually mean that literally is
HTC as the company has just reported a
hundred million dollars in losses for
the quarter which is more than double
what they lost last quarter and it's
really hard to know what the company is
going to do to pick themselves up
because a different color HTC one is
definitely not going to cut that as it
turns out we've got some more rumors
that the company is actually working on
a dual-mode version of a smartphone that
will run Android and Windows Phone and
it seems that Microsoft is actually
planning to help them out because you
remember HTC used to do a lot for
Microsoft back in the old pocket pc days
so it turns out it seems that microsoft
plans to wave their Windows Phone
licensing fee in order to allow the
smartphone to exist so stay tuned let's
see what we get and if you're among that
huge list of 12 people that's getting
the galaxy gear which I am not on the
list well there's a carrier in the
United
states that just came to their senses
t-mobile is going to be selling the
SmartWatch for two hundred and ten bucks
instead of 300 which is awesome
considering the fact that the nike
SmartWatch for running costs 150 bucks
even though i do find more functionality
in the nike watch but well as it turns
out it's not that easy though there is a
procedure that you have to follow a
coupon code and this is a limited-time
offer so if you're interested in getting
this SmartWatch links down below for the
full procedure before they run out of
supplies which could take the whole year
and finally for the interesting and hot
news of the day google has just launched
Android 4.3 point one to the masses for
no particular reason that we know about
still it's focused on the Nexus 7 and
the LTE variant mostly so just make sure
you upgrade there must be a bug out
there but even more interesting it seems
that google is planning to bring us a
SmartWatch and it's going to be called
the Google gym and yeah google gym and
as it turns out they're planning to
announce this SmartWatch on October
thirty-first along with the new Nexus 5
and Android 4.4 KitKat so make sure you
keep your radars open for whatever news
we get out of this but that leads to the
question of the day do you think that
Google will be smart enough to actually
follow the Nexus pattern and the
chromecast pattern and actually sell the
SmartWatch at an affordable price you
know I believe that Google is the
company to do that and if they do that
even if that SmartWatch sucks it is
going to sell like hotcakes so leave us
a comment down below I would buy a
SmartWatch from google if they priced it
accordingly not by google glass friends
of course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet girl but she
