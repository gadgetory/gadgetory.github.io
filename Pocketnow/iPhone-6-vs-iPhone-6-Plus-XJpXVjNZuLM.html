which means now it's time for
comparisons you'll see apple's latest
put up against the LG g3 and HTC One m8
in Jaime Rivera's face offs coming later
in the week but first it's time to put
the new iPhone up against the other new
iPhone I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
and this is iPhone 6 vs iPhone 6 plus
look at the hardware of the iPhone 6 now
look at the iPhone 6 plus you've heard
it said before and you're about to hear
it again it's the exact same thing at
different sizes if you stuck a straw
into the iPhone 6 and blew as hard as
you could and we all lived in a kooky
cartoon world you'd end up with the six
plus for our full impressions on this
larger iPhone check out Taylor Martin's
video review for my part I'll say that
the iPhone 6 feels like a natural
extension of the iPhone family while the
six plus feels a little like it's trying
too hard to fit in with the super-sized
androids that prompted its existence
from one-handed usability to pocket
ability the iPhone 6 works better for me
but those for whom two-handed smartphone
use isn't a problem have other factors
to consider factors like how iOS 8 works
on the 5.5 inch display relative to the
4.7 inch panel on the smaller phone
scaling problems and apps are more
apparent on the iPhone 6 plus with text
often pixelized or just off like many of
its large screen competitors iOS also
fails to properly leverage the 6 pluses
added screen size there's no persistent
number row on the pluses keyboard and
there's also no dual window multitasking
as on Samsung and LG phones no snap as
on Microsoft tablets but then again most
of those features are just as absent on
Apple's tablets which people continue to
buy and droves
so if your goal in picking up an iPhone
6 plus is to replace a tablet there are
features here that the iPhone 6 doesn't
have like a landscape oriented
springboard and tablet style panels that
use screen space a little more
efficiently the keyboard has also been
widened in landscape to include
additional functionality
still no numeric kero at the top but
maybe that's a blessing considering how
little actual screen space you have when
the keyboard is deployed in landscape
hopefully Apple will be able to
implement bug fixes a little more
smoothly going forward than it did last
week because performance updates are
definitely needed for a smoother plus
experience versus the six some
third-party apps take longer to load or
to restore from dormant mode on the plus
others are just plain broken so why do
you get an iPhone 6 plus instead of the
six two reasons screen size and battery
life the bigger screen might not be used
to the fullest in the interface but just
like with other underused large screens
like on the Lumia 1520 for media
consumption it's definitely the better
choice it's a higher resolution panel
despite being almost a full inch larger
on the diagonal the bigger battery on
the iPhone 6 plus also makes a massive
difference nearly doubling the iPhone 6
is already respectable 10 to 16 hour
endurance in moderate to heavy use that
we found in our test period what about
the cameras well the specs on the
shooter's are much the same each is an 8
megapixel sensor with an F 2.2 aperture
and a 5 element lens even the sapphire
crystal protective covers are the same
the only technical difference is that
the plus features optical image
stabilization Hardware that allows the
camera lens to float within its frame
somewhat the 6 doesn't does it pay off
well if it does I don't see it it's
important to remember that the iPhone 6
already has some of the best digital
stabilization we've seen so hand tremble
is already taken care of you may be able
to see the OIS in action on more violent
rides like a speedboat or on a train but
we weren't able to test that in
side-by-side fashion the other area
where oh is is theoretically helpful is
in low-light situations where a more
stable shooting platform can leave the
shutter open for longer to capture more
light without motion blur but we didn't
see much difference here either that's
not to say there is no benefit again see
our full
view of each phone and our camera test
said pocket now four more samples but
from where I'm sitting it's doubtful the
average person could tell much of a
difference here if you're a fan of
consistency you've got to admire the job
Apple's done in unifying the iPhone
experience across these form factors the
plus is for now the model with more
growing pains on the software side the
model that's clumsier to use with one
hand the model that's $100 more
expensive at every price point but it's
also the one with the slightly better
camera and vastly superior battery life
it's the one to buy if you're in need of
a larger format screen or you're looking
to avoid getting a separate tablet to
complement your phone for those who
instead are looking for the modern-day
iPhone experience in the truest sense in
my view the conventional iPhone is the
better buy don't forget to check out our
full review of the iPhone 6 available
now at pocket now and linked in the
description below and see all our iPhone
6 and 6 plus coverage here on our
youtube channel page to which you should
subscribe if you haven't already till
next time this has been michael fisher
captain two phones on twitter reminding
you that a plus in one place doesn't
always mean a minus in the other we'll
see you next time
