samsung announces a passbook like wallet
service and microsoft says that windows
phone 8 won't be as bad as 7 when it
comes to upgrades I'm hi Mary vana and
I'm in desperate need of a cappuccino
right now this is poking out daily you
know it's extremely odd for either
android or windows phone manufacturer
site or provide you with specific dates
or specific pricing points for their
future devices but it seems that Nokia
is raising the bar if you remember the
Lumia 520 and 720 devices that were just
announced at mwc 2013 well we've already
got the price of 139 arrows for the
Lumia 520 and 249 eros for the Lumia 720
and both devices won't be available as
soon as April first so if you're
interested in these devices obviously
stay tuned our view should be live very
soon and speaking of Microsoft all the
terrible stories that Windows Phone 7
customers have lived in the past
apparently will come to an end with
windows phone 8 devices or so says Greg
Sullivan which is their VP of Marketing
are pretty much their marketing manager
the point being is that when those phone
7 customers would obviously not be able
to upgrade to Windows Phone 8 but
apparently that was due to hardware
issues according to Sullivan windows
phone 8 devices are obviously designed
to be able to be upgradable in the
future so hopefully Windows Phone 9 or
whatever it's going to be called which
is code name blue should be available
for windows phone 8 devices but after
the story with windows mobile 6.5 or
Windows Phone 6.5 and Windows Phone 7 I
don't know what to believe let's just
cross the fingers now let's talk about
some mwc oddities last year Anton and I
both noticed in Barcelona that there was
this NEC prototype device that allowed a
dual screen you I meaning you have a
hinge that allows both screens to match
together to make just one screen pretty
much turning the device into a tablet
sort of like what the kyocera echo tried
to do even though it eventually became
one of the worst gadgets ever at least
on our list and well this NEC medias W
device is now available and Tony and
Michael were both able to film this
device at mwc 2013 so make sure you hit
the links in the description follow the
video it's a kind of an interesting
device not sure I would recommend though
but obviously there are more mwc 2013
video so make sure you hit the links
full playlist downstairs now if any of
you thought that Samsung was already
tired of getting sued by apple well it
seems that they're not tired just yet
they've just announced the new wallet
service which ironically is not being
called s wallet it's just samsung wallet
and the point being is that it looks
exactly like the apple passbook
application that you get on iOS and the
point is that it will allow us with a
joint venture with visa to make
purchases through the service now
obviously the Samsung service is better
than apples because you do get NFC on
galaxy devices so you will be able to
use the device and the service to
actually pay for something but the point
being is that obviously the service
looks exactly like apples but anyways
the service should be available soon so
stay tuned we'll keep you posted and
finally for the well I don't know if I
should call this interesting news of the
day apparently the galaxy s4 will retain
the same processor strategy as the
galaxy s3 you'll get one processor in
the United States and one processor in
Europe meaning you'll get the Snapdragon
600 in the United States which we
already noticed that in the HTC One
bricks a lot of records when it comes to
speed and then you'll get the Exynos 5
octa-core processor in Europe yes you'll
get 8 cores in Europe and quad core
processor in the United States so it's
really hard to know if one device will
be better than the other but we did
notice that there were some minor
differences in the galaxy s3 with a
different processor type so that leads
me to the question of the day does it
bother you that the phones in Europe
have different internals and the phones
in the United States or vice versa in my
particular case I don't care which
processor I get as long as I get LTE but
obviously your case could be different
so leave us a comment down below of
course if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone then tell the world make sure
you follow us on parking now calm or
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm hi Natalie
that up thanks for watching see you
tomorrow even though we never thought
that Apple would release a 7-inch tablet
the ipad mini is finally among this and
even though it's a good tablet we do
know that it lacks key elements like a
Retina display so is it still worth
you're buying dollar join us on thursday
februari 28 for the ipad mini after the
buzz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
