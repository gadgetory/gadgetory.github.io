pocketnow.com and this is a continuation
of the walk through their windows phone
7 series on the emulator we got that
leaked image earlier that allows us to
see a lot more of Windows Phone 7 series
than we could before we've already shown
you the calendar and the email and
messaging application also internet
explorer so if you missed those be sure
to check out our channel at PocketNow
video that's youtube.com slash pocket
nail video so let's walk through a few
of these things and we're also going to
take a look at the much extended
application list over here which has a
lot of new stuff that we want to talk
about so first let's go into the xbox
live hub and again hubs are places where
lots of information can come to collect
really under one roof so here we can
swipe to the right to see Xbox Live
information there's nothing you can do
with this right now we can swipe back to
the right and we're takin back to our
collection from here presumably there
will be a list of games and also a link
down here to get more games in the
marketplace the marketplace doesn't
really work right now but we can show it
and we're going to show it in a moment
let's go back to the start screen
scrolling down we can see the pictures
hub and let's go into their the pictures
hub is where all of the pictures sort of
hang out on your phone so we can swipe
to the right to see some photos some
sample photos to the right we get what's
new so this will pull from facebook and
other forms of social social networking
and then we're back into the gallery
where we can drill down further into our
favorite pictures we into different
albums and into back into favorites so
we can go to the sample media gallery we
can click on any of these pictures and
we can swipe to the right if your phone
has multitouch you can pinch to zoom or
you can double tap to zoom in if you're
using the emulator you can also click on
a picture to get certain actions so we
can add it to a favorites so it shows up
in that favorite screen we can delete it
we can share it through email or through
mms we can also use it as wallpaper or
go back to the album so pretty cool
stuff we're looking forward to seeing
more advancements in the pictures hub
seems like a really good idea
okay let's go back to the start screen
and let's go into zune and literally the
zune hub on Windows Phone 7 series is
almost entirely like the zune HD it's
like having a zune HD on your Windows
Phone which is awesome because the zune
HD rules so what you can do here is you
can swipe to the right and it looks like
it just goes back to the same screen we
can click on music and from here we can
filter by the music that we've
downloaded albums playlist genres and so
on but you can actually go and download
things right from this application if we
cut click on marketplace we're taken
into the zune marketplace and we can
swipe to the right to see some featured
albums swept to the right to see new
releases we can tap on any of these
albums get more information we can see
the songs on the album see the price
obviously you can't buy anything right
now this is not an active store and so
on and so forth and let's go back to the
previous screen swiping to the right we
can see top albums things that are hot
sellers right now and we can also filter
by genres so if we want to see sort of
hip-hop we can dial in by hip-hop and we
should get some nice pictures there we
go very visual on Windows Phone 7 series
everything is very you know visually
friendly so we get these nice big
pictures for Timberland so we can click
on that and we will get all of his
albums in zune marketplace right here
with a cool background that shows
Timberland so a very immersive music
experience and this will be cool when
you get this on to a phone so the zune
application is really awesome it's one
of the more evolved hubs on the Windows
Phone 7 series let's continue down the
line see what else we have here we
already showed you the mail setup that
you can tap into multiple email accounts
and sync up with them okay so let's go
into this application try i'm not sure
what to actually call this maybe it's
the start menu although this is the
start screen what you can do you can
sweat to the right to get the list of
applications and microsoft has gone on
record by saying that this screen is
probably not complete right now it's
really ugly it's a list of these small
tiny icons that really have no order to
them it would be nice if you could group
these by say entertain
productivity so hopefully there's more
coming let's take a look at a few of
these applications we can go to alarm
where we get some very basic alarm
functionality we can press the plus
button we can change the time of the
alarm and of course we get that sweet
looking wait to change the time very
intuitive can change the sound sometimes
you actually hear yep you can hear this
down there and then I don't think it's
going to stop if because I tested this
earlier so we can change the name to say
new alarm press the Save button down
here and here we go and we can turn on
and off this varies various alarms and
we can go back in and we can edit them
and change certain settings about them
even change whether they're on Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday things
that you'll find on a basic cell phone
alarm nothing really revolutionary
they're just a nice clean interface very
congruent with the Metro look so now we
can go into bluetooth which is very
simple it allows you to turn bluetooth
on and off if i turn bluetooth on it
will freeze the emulator i'm not going
to do that let me go back to the start
screen and back into the the programs
list it's getting a little bit
cumbersome having to go back to the the
start screen every time to get to the
programs list I hope they figure out
something because it's just annoying if
you want to go in and out of
applications very fast let's go into the
calculator very simple calculator
application will jump back here and go
back in we've got the camera doesn't
make sense to show that to you we've got
a simple conversion application a way to
turn on and off cellular data going down
here we have a Maps application let's
drill into that and hopefully that will
behave doesn't look like the maps
application is going to work right now
we can go into marketplace which is
actually a combination of marketplaces
so we can go into the xbox marketplace
the music marketplace or the zune
marketplace or the standard old app
marketplace and this isn't complete the
backgrounds not there we can sweat to
the right and see the new games and the
new things we should get a
here it is a listing of the different
categories we can drill in by lifestyle
we can tap on an application and see
more information see the ratings here
the reviews with stars and that's really
it we can't do too much else with that
if we click buy it doesn't like that
okay so let's go back to the start
screen and see the other applications
that we have not covered yet the People
Hub it's really pointless to show you
that because I don't have any contacts
on here you can set up an account and
linked to various places or you can see
sort of all of the status updates on
Twitter and Facebook whatever accounts
you have currently set up so people have
not much I can show you right now
because there's no syncing going on
we're going to talk about settings in
detail we're also going to talk about
OneNote and PowerPoint in upcoming
videos let's go down a little bit see
what else we have speed type which is
just a simple application to help you
get accustomed to the on-screen keyboard
on the Windows Phone 7 series platform
Wi-Fi is just a simple on and off switch
so nothing really to show you there and
if we go back we're pretty much at the
bottom now I'm going to show you a
system info in an upcoming video where
we also go through the settings on the
device but that was just a quick look at
some of these built-in applications on
windows phone 7 series one more thing to
note if you tap on the search button I
don't think it's going to work right now
because I think the maps application is
crashed but it will launch the maps
application or sometimes Bing I'm not
exactly sure how that works hopefully we
can show that in a future video when
that starts to work so to find out when
we post our next walkthrough of Windows
Phone 7 series but sure to subscribe to
our YouTube channel just hit the
subscribe button right next to the video
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
