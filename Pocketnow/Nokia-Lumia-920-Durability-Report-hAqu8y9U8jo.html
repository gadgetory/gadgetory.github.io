since Nokia released its flagship
windows phone 8 device for the United
States so let's see how it's holding up
I'm Michael Fisher this is pocket now
and this is our durability report for
the Nokia Lumia 920 now like Brandon
minuman I don't believe in cases I think
they obscure the beauty of a phone's
design and I think they bulk it up more
often than not so I generally don't use
them of course there's a price to pay
for that and the way of scratches dings
and just ask Joe Levi and his poor nexus
for total destruction so after three
months of usage is my daily driver
without a case how is my nokia lumia 920
holding up let's see so let's take a
look at both sides of the phone to most
thoroughly answer this question from a
distance and on the camera view you're
seeing here my 920 looks to be in pretty
excellent shape but once you get close
you can see some telltale scratches here
on the display now this is guerrilla
glass 2 which is supposed to be twenty
percent stronger than Gorilla Glass one
so what's the deal should I be angry
here well one possible explanation is
that the glass itself isn't scratched
but rather it's the oleophobic and he
oiled coating on top of the glass that's
showing where that sounds logical but
the end result is the same the display
looks beat up now the more interesting
thing about the display scratches is
that they're so small remember this is
my phone I was there when these
scratches developed and we're not
talking about regular wear and tear here
in each case the phone slammed down face
first on a hardwood floor from about
waist height BAM that would probably
have shattered the screen on another
device but even with all 185 grams of
the Lumia 920 crashing to the floor the
display held up with only just a few
little scratches that's impressive now
let's take a look at the back now
originally I wanted a matte finish 920 I
was wary of getting a glossy finish
Lumia because I didn't want scratches to
show as easily but I didn't have a
choice on launch day it turns out I
didn't need to worry well the Lumia
920's casing does show scratches if you
look closely enough unless you're
getting just the right angle on the
light the white casing here doesn't
excellent job of hiding its scuffs and
scratches despite its glossy finish
obviously your results are going to vary
depending on what color and type of
Lumia you buy also the soft metal of the
Lumia 900 s camera bezel has been
replaced by a harder material on the 920
that means it's not as comically
scratched up as the 900s was after just
a few days see episode 1 of pocket
knives after the buzz series to see what
I mean but it does still show some
scratching considering the device rests
right on its center line when it's on a
tabletop I guess that's unavoidable
fortunately these scratches are masked
by the bezels gloss as well now if these
blemishes came about despite my babying
I'd be very angry with Nokia but in
reality I've beaten this phone up pretty
senseless do too careless drops and it's
held up much better than other devices
I've owned despite its fancy optically
stabilized camera module which you might
think was prone to damage from drops
it's not like we've said before the
Lumia 920 might be thick and heavy but
there's a reason for it it's a tank in
the best sense of the word stay tuned
for our full after the buzz treatment on
the Nokia Lumia 920 as well as
durability reports from other devices
coming soon and follow us in the links
in the description so you don't miss it
I'm Michael Fisher this is pocket now
thank you for watching we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
