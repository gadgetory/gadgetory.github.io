Tokyo
peaked audio that is amazing this is
only one of the reasons mm-hmm
why didn't nobody tell me that it was so
easy to get good scotch mm-hmm at a
7-eleven in a can it's too easy cousin
soda can yes it's too easy I had too
much if there's one company that has
been consistently making splashes over
the last year or so it might be Oh PO
you only need to think back to the Opel
find X one of the first phones to bring
a motorized camera in order to achieve
the full screen experience
the oboe Reno came there after wowing us
first in Switzerland with its shark fin
or mountainous pop-up camera and then
the final realization of the 10 times
zoom concept that was announced almost
two years ago Jaime de vida and ISA
Rodriguez joined me on this episode as
we talked about this phone that
continues to impress us and what better
place for Oppo to continue our journey
with the Reno ten times zoom then Tokyo
Japan the Tokyo is the New York of of
the Orient yeah it's just this it's the
most complex city I've been to what you
think works everything works but
everything is complicated like finding
an exit in a metro station it's
complicating how to order ramen in the
ramen Street is complicated and finding
around finding ramen Street is
complicated this is definitely one of
those cities where you have to know like
if you know then you know and it's
regardless of how of an how advanced of
a city it is cash it's a cash City it's
a cash City I was not expecting that
yeah but have you ever know have you
noticed that all during your time here
yet what kinds of tech people use like
what the digital culture is like
everybody has an iPhone there are a lot
I don't see very many people with air
pods for example like you see in the
States but there are a lot of truly
wireless there are but not air pause yes
they skew towards quirky technology yes
it's it's quirky if it's not quirky it's
convenient I think there's two ways of
looking at it those are the two cultures
of tech they're both words here have
speakers yeah everything talks the eye
shed and announcements in MWC Shanghai
for an inn display front facing camera
it says that there is no loss in quality
when compared to another mainstream
selfie phone of like the fine mainstream
so of course if you compare it to other
brands who don't focus on the selfie
camera they'd probably still be better
so maybe so but yeah my eyes look bigger
and I love it no but I mean speaking of
someone who does use the beauty mode and
there are a lot of people even if you
say or you feel that they don't use the
beauty mode they probably do especially
with women oh my friends my god I can't
recognize them at the gym but they look
amazing every girl every girl knows this
their angles and this is just an added
layer the beauty mode and it just makes
it so much easier if it's built in all I
know is that when I turn all that stuff
on my freckles go away and I'm offended
because I probably inherited my freckles
they are a defining feature even people
on YouTube comments oh I got in damn I
didn't know yet freckles dude listen I
remember how I looked 10 years ago and I
didn't look that good as when I see
myself with filters oh man so yeah
regardless in display front facing
camera all you some ones is that beauty
mode built-in that's all you know I'm
curious to see how they riot support for

pocketknife so in the past you know
we've got - charging which is pretty
much what we had with oboes vu Luke yes
but now vivo just launched their 121
charger ok so ok a 50 percent battery in
8 minutes we're ok my first question
this is my first gut reaction when I
when I see that kind of stuff we already
went through battery debacles in the
past obviously it was Samsung which was
high-profile who's not going to be
worried that 121 so here's the thing
first of all we have to remember all the
benefits of power deliver mm-hmm fast
charging seems like the perfect
practical feature of a phone that works
really well for your kind of content
user like like how do you feel about
fast charging oh I used the Oppo find X
Lambo edition such a long time because
that phone that was the fastest charging
phone when it came out it was zero to a
hundred and thirty minutes mm-hmm
I would literally not charge plug it in
as I do my makeup and it'd be done yeah
but if that thing can deliver 120 watch
to my laptop that that was I was banned
so the only problem was proprietary
technology and this is the point that
I'm trying to make is literally the fact
that its proprietary yeah that you know
it only works with their products and so
one of the approaches that I really
liked was that Huawei a supercharger for
the maybug X Pro mm-hmm because that
thing could scaled-down whether you're
connecting an iPhone to it or you're
connecting the laptop it'll adapt to
whatever it's connected to oh that's how
it works so now we can talk about this
you know it's what were these guys
doing in Reno Nevada by the way out of
all names the only bummer and this is
again this is something that I will
always harp on and a lot of people like
think I'm such a nice user but I am I
mean it's just the way it is I'm
disappointed
generally when the video capabilities
can't use all the lenses this is one of
those phones that does that but that is
probably the only significant bummer
because we just got a good update like
while we were here oh yeah on the phone
and I you guys covered that you could do
night mode for all right angle night
mode yeah which is a step forward oh my
god absolutely okay so all right this is
again my first experience with the Reno
mhm
number one I did not expect it to be
this bulky yes that that's my thing it's
heavy it's a heavy phone and so I I had
no experience of the phone whatsoever
and so I walk out and I just start
snapping photos and I'm like okay either
the the display on this phone is really
good or the cameras actually not bad or
both yeah exactly
it turns out it's both dude I took some
photos of 10x hybrid from Mount Fuji
which is another thing I mean you gotta
be really bold to want to establish it
toward to a mount it's really hard to
see in the season yeah yes
yeah and use and and make it clear that
your phone is the only one that can get
shots like this yeah I just really want
the pink one so yeah there's a pink one
in China but it's only available in
China blue if you haven't seen it yet
yeah looks really nice yeah they're all
really good and like he said there's
it's flat on the back it's just a tiny
nub there that's really easy to pick out
when you're whole dude wide-angle night
mode man that's what we liked about the
p30 Pro and that's a new feature so we
still have more you know we got it we've
gotta use tested out of it yeah but yeah
I mean you'll notice that you know we're
sitting here in Tokyo we're talking
about Oppo and oppa Reno ten times zoom
not once did we mention the Sony Xperia
1y I'm going into the outro after the
fact so this guy could get some rest
