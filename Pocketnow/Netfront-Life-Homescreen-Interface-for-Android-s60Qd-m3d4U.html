pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to talk about an interface
replacement for android call net-front
life it's from the same company that has
brought us the net front and life
browser but this is actually a really
cool home screen interface let's get to
it are you are now while this may look
fancy it's actually very functional this
home screen interface is comprised of
three different parts one is the widget
to is the program tray which we'll talk
about in a second and three is this
carousel along the bottom now the
carousel is very functional for example
if i type on if i tap on the f for
facebook i will get my facebook updates
feeding right to my home screen here
really cool if i go to the t if i have
it set up it will load the twitter
updates we can go over here calendar
will show you upcoming calendar events
we can go to browser to see browser
history messaging to see if there are
any new text messages that have come
through we can even stream RSS right to
the home screen here I've got the pocket
now RSS filtering right to my home
screen really cool stuff now it does a
lot more than that the widget is
actually customizable so we can go into
the menu here and click set widget let's
do a google search for all and there we
have a google search now what about
programs how do you access your programs
you actually swipe the widget off the
screen and then you get this little cube
interface a little bit over the top
fancy but it's quite satisfying actually
to be able to flip through your apps
like this from here you can customize
the carousel on the bottom so as you can
see there's a blank spot over there if
we want to add gallery we tap and hold
and drop it over here and now it's added
by the same token you can remove certain
items from the carousel you can't remove
everything so if we go to calendar and
try to drop it back it will actually
work and let's put calculator there and
when you're all dying to press the home
button and you are taken home and now
you can see calculators here although in
this case it's just an application and
some of them aren't actually functional
widgets that can take place and show you
information on the home screen settings
also is one such place where you can see
the info
mation right on your home screen without
having to dive into another application
and of course to get back to the main
view you press the home button and boom
you're taken right back so a really cool
free home screen replacement if you like
to experiment with new interfaces it's
called netfront life and it's available
in the android market if you like this
