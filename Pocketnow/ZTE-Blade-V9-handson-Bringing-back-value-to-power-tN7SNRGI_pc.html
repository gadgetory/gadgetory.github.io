plenty of budget devices some of them
have even been sold quite nicely with
carriers like Cricut and t-mobile now at
MWC 2018 we're going to look at the
blade v9 and how this one is a looker
with Jools wang on camera he metope that
out with pocket now covering ZTE
sponsored by invisible shield well this
thing leaked like crazy but with how it
looks a blade beam behind certainly
deserves our attention the company is
dubbing their new approach to design
aurora glass which refracts light in a
certain way that reminds us of the honor
eight one of our all-time favorite
designs that may be the part of why this
phone want the if' design award now one
trophy that we'd like to give to ZTE is
an impressive 84% screen to body ratio
one of that is credited to the toddler
2x1 display which is really I have never
seen this on this price point before on
the other side another thing that's
really hard to find that the price that
the company is planning for this phone
is a 16 megapixel camera with a wide F
1.8 aperture like seriously this is wide
enough to compete with most flagships
combined with a second 5 megapixel
camera we're told that the imaging
system is really intended to perform in
low-light a claim that we're obviously
gonna test answer that the near star
experience with Android 8.1 and there's
a compelling argument to spend money on
ZTE and even with the 3 or 4 gigs of RAM
option probably the most impressive part
again is the fact that the company is
planning to price this phone below $300
if that much sounds a little too rich
for you which we doubt the manufacturers
also come up with the blade v 9 Vita
it's about half the price and buyers
will lose out on the aurora glass and
get a slightly weaker Snapdragon chip
but it still has dual cameras the extra
wide display and almost stock Android
but that obviously depends on the region
the unit that we're seeing here is the
Chinese variant which is definitely not
bringing the star experience the blade v
9 and v 9 Vita will first go to Spain
Germany Russia Mexico and China it is
