pocket now calm and this is a quick
video showing Microsoft recite this is a
free program that will run on any
windows mobile device it's very easy to
use it's very simple but it's really
smart actually i'll post a link on
pocketnow.com on how to get it basically
this is a technology preview which means
that microsoft probably plans on using
this technology in an upcoming product
but for now we have the technology in
this application and i'm going to
demonstrate it now now basically the
purpose of this program is to help you
remember things so earlier I recorded a
note to myself to remember to record the
video on recite for pocketnow.com so
right now I'm going to hit the search
button i'm going to say pocketnow.com
and the program is going to look for any
of my voice notes that have that sound
in it pacquiao calm so listen pocketnow
calm and there it is it says for pocket
now calm don't forget the recite video
so it found the first match that it
found happened to be the right one so
when would you want to use this well
let's say you're at work and somebody
gives you your phone number you could
say toms phone number is 555 1212 and
then you get back home and you're like
what was Tom's numbers so you press
search and you say tom's number and it
comes up or let's say you just made a
new email account and you want to
remember your password so you'll say my
gmail account password is 1234 5678
although hopefully it's something
different than that because that's not
very secure or perhaps you want to
remember where you parked so you would
record my parking spot is so and so and
then when you get back outside you press
search and you type and yet and you say
parking spot and it will bring up the
voice note that matches what you've just
said so a really cool program there's no
reason really not to get this there's
probably a time when you will use it and
it's free i'll post a link on
pocketnow.com on how to get it that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
