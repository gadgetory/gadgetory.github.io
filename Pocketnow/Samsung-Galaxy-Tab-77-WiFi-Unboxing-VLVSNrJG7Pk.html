pocketnow.com the Samsung Galaxy Tab was
the tablet that started it off in the
world of Android tablets for many of the
seven inch screen size was a perfect
alternative to the 10 inch screen found
on the iPad it allows you to actually
type in portrait it allows you to easily
browse the web in a smaller form factor
read books more naturally without a
large 10 inch screen in front of you and
it was extremely portable you could put
it in your jacket pocket if you wanted
to you could put it in your pants pocket
it was a really good screen size even
though Steve Jobs said 7-inch tablets
are dead on arrival that turned out not
to be true a lot of people really liked
the 7-inch screen size but there were a
few problems with the Galaxy Tab it's
relatively thick in today's standards it
also ran Android for phones and not
Android for tablets with honeycomb or
Ice Cream Sandwich well that's all
changing today there's finally a real
successor to the Galaxy Tab 7 and it is
on sale now it's the Galaxy Tab 7.7 it's
been announced for several months but it
hasn't actually been available for sale
until now the cool thing about the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 is that it's super thin
super light it builds all in that
smaller form factor best of all it's got
a Super AMOLED plus screen which means
that it has the RGB sub pixel
configuration found on the galaxy s2 and
some other Samsung mobile products which
means that this screen should be
amazingly crisp and clear have you ever
seen a tablet with such a large AMOLED
screen probably not because there aren't
any out there this is the tablet that
has the largest AMOLED screen and it's
of the Super AMOLED plus variety so it's
even better this tablet is also a lot
better than the Galaxy Tab 8.9 and 10.1
because of the processor instead of the
Tegra 2 chip it's got the Samsung Exynos
processor running at 1.4 gigahertz
similar chipsets that you see on the
samsung galaxy note so we've got speed
we've got an amazing screen a light form
factor and a mate an amazing package
that translates into probably one of the
best tablets that you can buy right now
the Galaxy Tab 7.7 another been an
introduction
some box the thing now the Galaxy Tab
7.7 is available in several
configurations this is the Wi-Fi 16
gigabyte version which can be had for
about 560 bucks over at Negri
electronics comm they're just starting
to ship now you can also get a 3g
version for about 50 $60 more and you'll
see other capacities come to market so
this is the cheapest version but
certainly for most people it would be
good it won't be good enough and the
lower price point really makes it very
attractive indeed so let's unbox here
the Galaxy Tab 7.7 can't wait to see the
huge Super AMOLED plus screen which by
the way has 1280 by 800 resolution so
here it is
get some notes here there's the Super
AMOLED plus if you look at a device like
the Galaxy Note it's Super AMOLED
without the plus meaning it's pentile
the subpixel configuration is pentile
some pixels are shared not that is not
the case with the Galaxy Tab 7.7 some
pixels are assigned to each individual
pixel creating a crisper clearer picture
so I've got a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
CPU of the Exynos Exynos variety and
let's see if we get any goodies inside
the box just want to feel this for a sec
amazingly thin and light and it's got
like a metal feel to it unlike the other
Galaxy Tabs which kind of feel plasticky
so that's another reason why this is an
very compelling tablet compared to the
8.9 and to the 10.1 it's got some
headphones here you've got of course
Samsung continues to use their
proprietary charger there although this
looks a little bit different than the
8.9 and 10.1 we'll have to look at that
later and this device is not intended
for the US so you get a different kind
of plug there so let's get this stuff
out of the way
and let's look more closely at the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 let's take off this
screen protector here obviously a
buttonless design this is running
Android 3.2 honeycomb which is rather
unfortunate
because honeycomb compared to Ice Cream
Sandwich is kind of it's quite slow so
this will be upgradable to android 4.0
watch the development community there
will probably be an unofficial where I'm
available with Ice Cream Sandwich a lot
sooner than Samsung will drop the
official ROM for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 so a
strip all of this off take a tour around
the device and we definitely want to
turn it on let's get it booting so thin
it's almost difficult to pick up it's
got sort of rounded edges which makes it
more easy to pick up when it's on its
back like this but just a really awesome
form factor just a great size let's turn
it on and see what we get okay so let's
see what we have in terms of ports here
we've got microSD expansion so you can
add a memory card over there obviously
you're not gonna find a SIM card slot
because this is the Wi-Fi only version
and let's just zoom in on the screen and
try to get a feel for what this Super
AMOLED screen can do and I can already
tell you it's absolutely gorgeous we're
getting some reflection here so it's
this is actually Hong Kong device and
we're gonna try to get this into English
very good touch response Wi-Fi setup
will do all of that later and let's
actually just go right home we'll skip
this will do that Hong Kong time let's
switch that to Eastern Time and of
course we have TouchWiz the same
TouchWiz that you've come to expect on
all of Samsung's Galaxy Tab devices but
this time we're looking at it with Super
AMOLED on a Super AMOLED display and the
contrast is just unreal here as a little
bit of a comparison and we're going to
do a a more full test here we're going
to turn on the original Galaxy Tab here
just so you can get a sense for the
difference in terms of the screen
clarity so let's open up the calculator
on both and maybe that's a screen that
looks somewhat similar very different so
that really doesn't serve as a good
basis of comparison let's go back into
applications super crisp scripts screen
over here by the way on
original Galaxy Tab we had 1024 by 600
resolution and of course on the Galaxy
Tab 7.7 1280 down by 800 across so let's
see if there's anything common between
these if it go into alarm-clock these
are totally different versions of
android but you can just tell right off
the bat even if you look at a dark space
that the blacks are far more black and
rich here and just the colors really pop
on the Galaxy Tab 7.7 what a gorgeous
gorgeous display super smooth even
though we're running on Android 3.2 here
which is notorious for being not the
fastest operating system out there but
again Ice Cream Sandwich update is
coming in the near future let's just see
how fast the screen rotates this is such
a nice size for a tablet it really is so
we've got lots more coming up on the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 you can hear it in my
voice I'm really excited about this
tablet it really represents a great
blend of large screen tablet with
mobility and for more first impressions
check the link in the description going
to link to the post on pocket now we're
going to talk more about what it's like
using this for the first few moments if
you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
