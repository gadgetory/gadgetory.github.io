pocketnow.com and let it never be said
that we don't cover Lumias particularly
in the 800th series we've already
reviewed the Nokia Lumia 810 for
t-mobile USA we just finished our quick
review of the Nokia Lumia 822 for
Verizon Wireless and now we have the
original version almost it's the AT&amp;amp;T
version of the Nokia Lumia 820 we're
going to give this device the quick
review treatment as well but first we're
going to unbox it give you a little
hardware tour and give it its first boot
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
let's get to it so starting with the
packaging we're not looking at anything
different here from AT&amp;amp;T this is a
mid-range device and it is in the same
box as their low-end devices as their
high-end devices as everything 80 very
economical as far as packaging goes open
up the flap there we have a quick start
guide as well as a welcome to AT&amp;amp;T
greeting we're greeted front and center
by the device device still a little
chilly from being in the FedEx truck we
can put that aside this is a special NFC
tag from Nokia telling us to touch the
upper back of our phone to it to
discover more Windows Phone apps this is
a familiar card from our Lumia 920
unboxing telling us more about our
phones features product and safety
information
the usual wall charger and USB cable and
separately packaged removable battery in
a very thin form factor very interesting
this battery rating 1650 milliamp hours
the 820 features a very interesting
release mechanism for taking the back
cover off you just pull this tab as it
instructs you to and you can see the
device well device is supposed to part
yeah jeez I'm probably doing this very
wrong but pull toward you to release
cover than this boat yeah won't pulled
it what woody what you're supposed to
cement the phone down on your desk when
you pull it toward you there's nothing
else to hold on to pull toward you I see
there we go okay
well that was a little more dramatic
than it needed to be but here's the back
cover off of the device first things
first though we want to make sure our
SIM card is in place we're going to head
and pop that in right there we'll go
ahead and skip the microSD for now sim
card clicks in with a reassuring
mechanical spring back pop the battery
in and let's see if we can get this case
back on with a minimum of drama after we
discard the word of warning here as we
just found out the battery when it is
inserted does not lock in without the
cover in place just pops right back out
of the phone there when you turn upside
down so you do want to be careful about
that let's go ahead and remove this
quick pull sticker here and put the
cover back on hopefully with a minimum
of drama good cover snaps back on hugs
the sides of the device tightly very
nice and why don't we go ahead and get
that screen protector off and if you've
just trimmed your nails this can be
difficult but let's go ahead and pull
that screen protector right off of there
very nice going on a little hardware
tour of our all-black Nokia Lumia 820 up
front here is a 4.3 inch AMOLED display
with Nokia's clear black technology that
has packin a resolution of 800 by 480
pixels down below the capacitive windows
buttons for home back and search up
above a little difficult to see the
branding for AT&amp;amp;T and Nokia and the
front-facing camera there on the right
the typical Windows Phone buttons volume
down volume up power and the two-stage
camera key pretty good feedback right
off the bat will tell you that's a
little mushy err of a 2-stage key than
we've had on some of the 820 s variants
coming around to the back absolutely
unadorned on this cover that is
something you don't see very often
usually there's some carrier branding
back here are some additional Nokia
branding nothing just the Carl Zeiss
call out on that 8 megapixel camera
there along the side not much going on
just the headphone jack up top and along
the bottom the microUSB port and a slot
for the speakerphone
unlike some other carrier variants of
the 820 this one is relatively sleek
it's nine point nine millimeters thin
and it weighs 160 grams so rather than
being a thick lightweight device this is
a relatively thin somewhat heavyweight
device which is an interesting change
and it's a little surprising to feel
after the 822 and 810 both of which felt
very different in the hand we're going
to wait for the quick review video and
the comparison videos for some more
in-depth thoughts on the build quality
but for now let's go ahead and wrap this
up by giving the device its first power
on 1/2 there's our little confirmation
vibration there the 18t splash screen is
here and while this boots up we'll just
call out the processor that will be
familiar to anyone who follows the Nokia
Lumia brand in the 800 series this is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 clocked at 1.5
gigahertz and backed up by a gig of ram
there's 8 gigs of on-board storage
expandable via microSD maximum size
there are 64 gigs and we are being
welcomed to our new Windows Phone we're
going to go through the bevy of custom
settings on our own here and turn this
phone into our daily driver for a couple
days get some more impressions for now
this is the Nokia Lumia 820 for AT&amp;amp;T as
I mentioned at the top this is only the
first of several videos covering the
Nokia Lumia 820 so stay tuned to pocket
