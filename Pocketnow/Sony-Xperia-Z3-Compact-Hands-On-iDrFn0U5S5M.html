pocket now at the Sony event checking
out Sony's new small fry the Xperia z3
compact
let's go hands-on remember how last
year's z1 compact was a flagship device
squeezed into a more manageable
footprint well to no one's surprise so
is the latest version but the things
that make it a flagship are predictably
more impressive in this iterative step
what that means specifically is a
Snapdragon 801 processor 16 gigs of
storage and the same improved 20.7
megapixel camera we showed you in our
Xperia z3 hands on which is identical
right down to the crazy high ISO
settings it can hit there's microSD and
water and dust proofing in the eight
point four millimeters casing as well
which feels a little chunky in the hand
just like its predecessor it's also
another glass sandwich build so be ready
to break out the smudge rags if you
carry it without a case the battery and
screen are where the compact takes a
little bit of a hit the smaller phone
packs a downsized battery at 2600
milliamp hours and the display is bigger
than last year's at 4.6 inches but some
might take issue with its resolution
downgrade to 720p those hypothetical
someone's though aren't us at least not
yet not till we get to spend some more
time with it for now it looks good and
we're just happy to see another very
high-end smartphone in a form factor
that doesn't stretch our pockets there's
lots more from Sony here at Aoife 2014
stay tuned to our continuing coverage
from Berlin and follow us on social
media so you don't miss a thing until
next time this has been Michael Fisher
with PocketNow we'll see you real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
