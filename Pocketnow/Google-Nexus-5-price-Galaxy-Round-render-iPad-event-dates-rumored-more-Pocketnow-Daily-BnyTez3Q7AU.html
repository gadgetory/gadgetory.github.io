different battery and pricing schemes we
get some leaked renders of a galaxy
round then yeah it's round and it seems
that Apple is planning for their ipad
event to happen at a very strategic time
I'm hi Mary vetta with all these new
round phones do we actually need to grow
an extra pair of cheeks for them this is
pocket now daily listeners day off with
some official bad and good news for
Microsoft on the bad side those of you
waiting for the YouTube application to
get fixed on Windows Phone sorry guys
Microsoft has just thrown the towel they
are not working on it anymore at least
for now and they are now sending
everything to the browser which was
actually already good but then on the
good side it seems that gdr3 will allow
you to have smaller tiles on 1080p
displays and also those devices they're
running wxga displays as well which
means most of the high-end Nokia Lumia
products so make sure you download gdr3
when it comes out and tell us all about
it we're just waiting for a date of
course and for those will be waiting for
the HTC One max phablet the company has
begun distributing press invitations for
Taiwanese outlets for October 18th which
is interesting since the wall street
journal is betting everything the events
going to happen on the 15 still
everything points out to the one max
being announced at this event which is
really cool though obviously we're still
not sure where it's going to be based
since obviously this is in Taiwan now
another positive news we've got some
screenshots of HTC Sense 5.5 with some
major changes so links down below for
full details on that and for all the 730
commenters that actually gave us their
opinion on the pricing scheme for the
Nexus 5 yesterday guess what we've got
some leaks on how google is planning to
sell this device is really interesting i
mean first of all if you want to go for
the lower end 16 gig model you're
getting a 2300 milliamp hour battery and
it will cost you 2 99 which is awesome
it's just awesome for those specs but
wait a second I mean if you want the 32
gig bottle you're not only getting 32
gigs you're getting a bigger battery
apparently you're getting a 3000
milliamp hour battery with this phone
and it's going to be priced a hundred
dollars more which is awesome just think
about it if you want a higher capacity
iPhone or a higher capacity any phone
yes
pay a hundred dollars and it's the same
battery so this is really cool if the
leaks are true let's see how it goes now
let's talk about Apple as all things
these reporting that the company is
planning to have their ipad event on
october twenty seconds which is two
weeks away that's awesome right well
just think about this the microsoft
surface 2 is going to be launched on
that date and apparently no kiss also
planning to launch their lumia tablet on
that same date so judge by the fact that
apple is just doing things at a very
strategic time let's see what we get at
this event because well we don't have
any press invitations just yet but all
things d is never wrong and finally for
the hot news of the day that image that
you see behind me is of the samsung
galaxy round no I'm not kidding this is
not April Fool's this is not a joke
these are some leaked renders of what
the galaxy round will look like it is a
curved display from side to side and men
I'm just trying to understand this I
mean we've got some other reports that
LG is actually planning to bring turf
batteries to their phones for them to be
round as well but we just never thought
that the phone would be round from the
sides you know it's usually from top to
bottom and previous devices that we've
seen so you know that leads me to the
question of the day when you buy this
phone would you really buy this galaxy
round you know round from side to side I
mean honestly I I think this is the next
gimmick I find no point in this I never
paste the phone to my full face because
I don't like my face oils to reach a
display and having to be cleaning it off
so I see no point in this device this
for me is the next 3d on smartphones
displays you know it's just gonna flop
but leave us a comment would you buy
this and friends as always if you want
