weekly hello and welcome to episode 002
of pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discussed news and opinion from the
world of mobile technology smart phones
tablets phablets and everything in
between I'm your host Michael Fisher
contributing editor at pocket now and
I'm joined by our managing editor anton
d Naja and now you can hear got it right
it's getting close good morning good
afternoon good evening everybody and our
editor-in-chief Brandon minimum
gentlemen Brandon how's it going hi I
know yeah very very very well it I'm hot
I am it ridiculously ridiculously hot
because the weather in boston is i think
it's like it's like 98 degrees right now
fahrenheit which is about as hot as it
gets for us and the humidity is just
ridiculous i realize that we on our last
podcast we did not really talk about
where we're each broadcasting from and I
know my temperature extremes has nothing
on Tony's but I once again I'm
broadcasting from Boston and I'm not
sure everybody knows that we broadcast
from all corners of the globe so Tony
you're also pretty pretty hot today
where are you coming from all I'm coming
from Romania oradea which is basically
eight kilometers or five miles from the
Hungarian border and i'm happy to
announce that this week the weather is
acceptable last week we had like 40 41
celsius 108 110 fahrenheit which was
awful but now it's in the normal 2325
even some people are complaining that
they're cold so it's it's good for me
i'm glad you have some relief there
you've been complaining about the heat
for wigs been about time felt horrible
for you what about what about down there
for you Brandon I'm uh I'm out near
Philadelphia in a suburb of Philadelphia
and I've never had a cheese steak from
Pat's or Geno's I've been there before
I'm
hang out this new vegetarian thing for
the last like six weeks my wife my wife
just everyone says that they think it's
a craziest thing well I'm not saying
it's a bad thing I'm just surprised Wow
my wife fought you know she she decided
that she wanted to be vegetarian for
both health reasons and for animal you
know cruelty reasons although i'm not
gonna start preaching and I thought I'd
give it a try and I I'm pleased with the
results I lost a few pounds i am i'm
surprised by sort of what the choices
are when you go to a restaurant there's
actually a lot to eat on the menu and
vegetarian dishes are prepared usually
obviously with vegetables and very fresh
ingredients and so it's been um it's
been good i feel i feel better after i
eat a meal it's a strange feeling but I
feel like kinda less Blair after like I
don't want to I don't want to roll over
and take a nap after i eat yeah it's not
because you're not eating as much
because you find it less palatable right
it's not because you're not just
stuffing your face with red meat and you
either because that that's that's the
amazing thing for me when I have a
burger it's like it's so amazing that I
can't stop eating it and then am I in
the right podcast I mean I was sure
really come on well what I mean surely
you have an opinion on this Tony
absolutely i'm not even laying my eyes
on anything which doesn't have meat so
this is my opinion so we're okay so
we're covering all three corners of the
of the triangle here diversity yeah are
you make a good point i ub should talk
about technology at some point today
shouldn't we at least last two minutes
okay well branded uh it'sit's that's i
will look forward to hearing more about
that we're gonna check in with you
weekly and see how that's coming along
oh nice yeah um be prepared for that
please if if i pass out just get some
get some filet mignon put it in a
blender and feed it to me through a
straw and i don't believe i've i've
written that down already that sounds
good that's all right we are the first
thing i want to talk about is this big
thing that is a first for me and it's
not a first for the site but it's the
personal in a while for the site i feel
like we are giving away we're in the
midst of a giveaway contest for the for
an AT&amp;amp;T branded Sam
galaxy s3 this is huge and awesome and I
really like it we are once the podcast
goes up here we should have a link to
all the articles that we discuss that's
something we didn't have last time so
we're kind of optimizing going forward
so we'll have a link to the giveaway
contest it's cool it's kind of elaborate
do you do you guys want to talk about
how you came up with the idea for this
giveaway like rather than just something
really kind of annoying like well we're
giving away a phone and send us an email
with nothing in it like I feel like
those are kind of boring contests not to
you know dog our competitor and live
better just I just like I like creative
contest I feel like this is kind of a
cool one we had some creative ideas me
and Brandon but we decided that they're
not feasible enough to to put into
practice but to be completely honest
with you as you said Michael we had some
giveaways in the best and I personally
gave away an LG optimus seven at the
time it was launched so we had a pretty
rough idea of how we want to involve our
readers our audience in within the site
the reading of the the content and
getting them interested not only in the
contest but in the entire website itself
it's it's not been difficult but it's
not been easy either I'm curious to see
what Brendan thinks about this Tony do
you remember our original idea that's
exactly what I said what I said in the
beginning yeah yeah it's not safe for
work or even for after work so Oh
awesome yeah I mean maybe yeah maybe
another site another day but another
podcast podcast do we have to schedule
like a pocket now after dark podcast to
offend if I'd show going I think we have
to get rid of the clean tag on iTunes I
went to a lot of trouble to get that
clean tag on their toner you don't I
diluting it with us okay guys right fun
fun for all ages is with the podcast is
yes well I'm excited to be doing I mean
like I say it is my first giveaway I'm
really pleased that I got to be the one
doing the video on it and it'll be
really fun to see next Monday who who
the winner is so you know we'll we'll
see how that goes in the interim though
we've got to we've got some this is not
going to be an all-american trick
podcast
at all but there are two very important
American carrier stories that we just
should blaze through here the biggest
and the smallest American carriers are
each getting their own phablet which is
kind of crazy in in in two different
respects verizon wireless is getting the
LG optimus view which i did not handle
did you get that did you handle that in
Barcelona Tony yes I did hands-on with
that and I also did the hands out with
the yellow sea note last year at I have
face so I had one on one on one with
both devices at the time of their launch
you had a year of giant phone exposure
yes that Optimus for you I remember
writing that was one of the first pieces
I wrote after I came on board was about
phablets or something like that and the
optimist view was brand new at the time
and I was like I do I can't get past how
how square that thing is I mean it looks
like a like a graham cracker or
something or I don't know what is that
square what I just go on Brennan yeah
yeah it's not it's not it's not pretty
and in synagogue it's got sharp edges
it's got a thick bezel and it's uh it's
it's almost like what Samsung might have
dreamed up for a phablet like 10 years
ago and then they and then you know 10
years went by and they're like oh we can
make this thin and elegant and kind of
beautiful but then LG was like well
we're just gonna make this kind of ugly
thing that was a prototype that we stole
from Samsung's laughs 10 years ago your
thing is that a LG had to come up with
it with a tab I almost a tablet with a
phablet even though I hate the word
phablet because Samsung has the galaxy
note and obviously they didn't want to
go with a 16 by 9 aspect ratio and they
went with a 4 by 3 which is at one point
normal if you come to think of it
because the ipad is a four by three
aspect ratio and everybody says it's
good for content consumption even though
if you're watching videos you'll see
those huge black bars at the top and
bottom but it feels larger than it is i
think i even mentioned that in my hands
on video I handled the galaxy note and
they won
and then I handle the LG optimus view
and they want you and it feels larger
than the note even though they are
comparable in size yeah it looks larger
than the note I mean it looks like the
note looks like a phone the note looks
like a phone but that's got an injection
of steroid the Optimus looks like looks
like a tablet that even in its tablet
form factor wasn't the right idea and
then it got shrunk down to phone
proportion that said considering how
interested I've been in trying out new
larger phone's ever since the galaxy s3
exposure that I've had I wouldn't mind
trying out that Optimus for you I don't
you know just because something's
different doesn't mean it has to be
awful I would like to try it out for a
week or so it will be an interesting
encounter believe me because LG as far
as I'm concerned they're making good
hardware even though ninety-nine percent
of the listeners will not agree i think
i think that they make a good job with
with their hardware but yeah you have to
meet it personally to handle it for a
week and then you can talk about whether
you like the 4 by 3 aspect ratio or not
because there really is no middle road
right I'm a middle way I was uh I was
speaking of LG I was playing with it
this is a tangent one of a hundred I was
in a verizon store today and they had a
little kiosk and there was an LG phone
it was i think is some LG phone with a
slide-out keyboard and it was a cool
kiosk because when you picked up the
phone the system or the kiosk knew that
you did that and start playing a video
specific to that phone yeah and the
video was just ridiculous I mean maybe
maybe for someone who doesn't you know
look at phones all day but let me tell
you about some of the things it was
saying it said updated you I with the
latest Android 2.3 and then and then it
says upgraded process Oh echo mmm little
like oh that's all right no going and
then it said upgraded processor and I
looked down at the information card and
it says 800 megahertz and I started to
cry and I and I said excuse me sir this
is out of date and uh not factual and I
would like to talk to your owner person
did six guys come out in suits and throw
you through a window no now they there
was a there was only one guy and and
there was a big line so I just you know
went on my way yeah Oh God isn't that
funny the retail store is a strange
strike zone where facts get get twisted
around until there's something else
entirely and when things are just out of
date and and you know it used to be that
in the retail environment that was okay
because things didn't change so fast but
you know two point three point five is
you know two generations old now so yeah
I want to spend like a whole I want to
do a whole field trip to retail stores
again for some reason I feel like
there's like carriers are going to
figure out a better way to do the retail
store at some point because like
everyone sort of does it the same now
with variations on a theme of these
phones on these big clunky tethers and I
feel like there's such a better way to
do it didn't Helio do something crazy
with retail stores didn't they have like
cow chips or something or am I just
making that up you will they only had
like three phones which was great for
them yeah and then they had yet they
made a funky environment because there
is there really targeting the teenagers
and so the couches and probably soft
drinks or whatever kids these days drink
you know for me it's just whiskey all
day but um oh what a coincidence well it
before we get too far off on that while
we're talking about carriers the end
phablets the galaxy note is coming to
t-mobile USA really I just want to laugh
a little bit I mean it'sit's I I do like
seeing t-mobile USA try and I really
like a lot of stuff they do I feel like
their customer service is really
excellent but they're about to get the
Galaxy Note like like on the eve of the
launch of the galaxy note 2 and it's
like why bother at this point I wonder
let me let me defend t-mobile please
please so if t-mobile had a press
release today and said we're we're gonna
have a iphone 4s this week no one would
be like oh geez you know the iphone 5s
coming out you guys are horrible because
everyone wants the iphone or not
everyone a lot of people want dot the
iphone and you know the fact that
they're bringing out the note which is
uh still very popular and only
you know a small fraction of the
smartphone using population has it
there's still a lot of opportunity to
get it and and don't forget that you
know the note 2 is going to be announced
next month but that it's probably not
coming out into september-october and
then it's not coming out in the u.s.
until probably if it's going to be as
breakthrough as it needs to be that's
probably not going to be available in
the u.s. until early next year so
there's six months probably the t-mobile
we'll still have still be relevant with
it with a note what if what if what if
Samsung will pull the same trick as they
did with the samsung galaxy s3 and it
will be available in the states in
September and that means that our good
folks our friends on t-mobile will get
the yellows you know to next year
because they just got the Galaxy Note
one how do you think t-mobile
intentionally like delay it well do they
have any reason not to get the galaxy
note on time I mean a TNT had it with
the same Snapdragon processor what was
the reason for tmobile not to get it
mobile uses different bands though yeah
but still the processor supports those
bands and it's not a problem a processor
that the Galaxy Note uses supports AWS
yeah it's a Snapdragon processor it's
working on a tnt and it should work on
tmobile too so I think even if it didn't
support those those AWS network
frequencies I think if t-mobile would
have pushed Samsung a little bit they
could have had the phone or the phablet
and summer and even then it would have
been late yeah well i mean i don't know
i don't think t-mobile has necessarily
has a lot of clout you know i mean
they're the smallest US carrier they
just the people were interested because
they were going to get a gobbled up by
AT&amp;amp;T and then I don't know I like
t-mobile I like aspects of t mobile but
it's quick question one of my usual
quick questions the samsung galaxy s3 is
a four point eight incher the samsung
galaxy note is a 5.3 share the
difference is really small would you
grab the latest galaxy s3 on t-mobile or
would you go would you grab a
one-year-old galaxy note I I mean I'd go
for the galaxy s3 myself just because
it's I prefer so much more about it what
about you Brandon if I had larger hands
and we talked about this in the last
podcast how I can't use a fabless
messages month um i would probably
go with the galaxy note um the Euro note
really you know it's got its got a fast
processor the screen is higher
resolution than the than the screen on
the galaxy s3 and there are things you
can do with the note that you come out
yeah i think the resolution is the same
no it's uh it's slightly it's a s3 is
1280 by 720 and then the note is 1280 x
800 so 80 more pixels i but but but most
importantly you can do things with the
note you can't do with the galaxy s3 you
can change the pixel density this is a
little you know enthusiasts trick so
that everything appears smaller but you
can literally because the screen is so
big you can fill the home screen up if
you're running at the right DPI force
DPI you can fill up with a ton of
widgets and and and it's and they don't
become microscopic they're actually
pretty big so you can have your email
which in your calendar and your favorite
shortcuts all in one screen I don't know
who would want to do this but in case
you did and and not only that but the
you know galaxy the galaxy note is a
better you know mini theatre to watch
videos even though the galaxy s3 is very
good so are there are some advantages
hmm you know I've just been giving more
and more thought to the note in the note
family and ever since i wrote the
editorial about you know tablets and we
talked about this last week and you know
i would i would get one I mean I would
get a note too I would try out a note to
is my daily driver for for a month you
know I don't know what the note 2 is
going to be but I would never have
considered that before handling the
galaxy s3 and to a limited extent the
Galaxy Nexus just because it's display
sizes are so ridiculous now i'll make
sure to photograph the look on your face
one samsung announces the notes you in
Berlin mm-hmm please do I look forward
to seeing my reaction anyway so moving
on way to a slightly bigger screen this
is not terribly huge news but Brandon
your your Nexus 7 is a hot ticket item
there retailers are burning through
stocks of them of
I I haven't got my friend Chris just got
his pre order here in Boston delivered
today so he's enjoying the unboxing did
you guys ever take a macro economics
class I'm no no I finished law school
for acting Brendan all right so no
economics there and tell you at the law
school so you probably you've probably
seen the line craft that says when a
price goes down demand goes up so of
Cannes if I we go well kk we had it
smells name well this doesn't matter but
let's pretend that Apple priced how let
me let me start here how could Apple
sell I don't know how many ipads they've
sold all right it's a lot how could they
sell a hundred million iPads they could
just bring up that just bring up the new
iPad that's it yeah yeah that's funny
just bring out the new know they put the
if they price if they keep going down in
price eventually they just sell almost
an infinite amount and that's what's
happening with the nexus 7 it's just
it's so affordable at 199 comparatively
that you know it's dodds a hot ticket
item and it's okay it's it's affordable
but also it's coming from a major brand
like Google which is not like if it were
like in a sous backed thing where it's
like hey this runs Android and by the
way we're a sous like that wouldn't work
yeah because it's a Google Nexus brand
here's an economy-related question to
you Brandon from what I've understood
google is selling the nexus 7 at a
minimal close to zero profit margin how
long do you think they can keep up with
that how long until the price of the
nexus 7 will go up because at one point
google or issues will say okay enough of
this I need to make at least one dollar
out of the entire deal ah never because
Google is obviously trying to benefit
from the all the money they make from
google play which is a lot you know they
sell all kinds of content and they make
money from apps so Google Google will
just be collecting checks and asus is
probably being paid close to at cost if
not slightly below and in exchange
they their brand is plastered on
probably the second hottest tablet of
2012 and maybe one of the hottest a
blitz of 2013 so this isn't this what we
call a thumping policy or what caused it
a dumping and I'm sure if it translates
correctly into English it translates
under something hilarious and English oh
yeah well I'll rephrase that for the
next podcast but make sure to include
this one because it's an interesting
topic ok I'll take a note on everything
you have to just discuss a dumping
policy I am I need never mind I Tony I
this is one of the things that I've
wanted to make sure that we mentioned at
the top of the podcast because it's so
important to me that everyone
understands how much joy I get on a
daily basis being able to talk to like
you in Romania hi May in well gotta tell
me I'm getting wonderous right yes oh
good you know it's just not like every
day I get to have like a different
cultural experience like that like you
one of these podcasts I'm gonna have you
tell us about the the parking situation
out in front of your building that one
more okay i'll snap some pictures please
do alright well we'll leave that as a
teaser for next time the the final
android topic that i have unless unless
you guys have another one after this is
a is something that i've noted in in the
log for the podcast today as simply as
this is ridiculous android 4.1 jelly
bean has been ported to the HTC hd2
that's that's nuts this phone was what
will never die this phone will run every
platform that's ever going to be
released i mean do you guys own one of
these like are you doing this just for
fun or what yeah i have one and is
probably collecting dust somewhere but
it's in its original box and i'm
actually that's gonna be a collector's
item yeah i'm actually glad you brought
this up because now with the giveaway i
might think of giving it away who knows
maybe I'll do that I think giving away
the hd2 yeah which is as new and it will
come from me who knows I'll think about
it you could sign it
but I piles courage this green with my
signature that'll be perfect Brandon
what about you did yeah I have an hd2 um
you know one oh well okay me up mine
sort of brick da send it to maybe if you
don't forget um the hd2 is interesting
and because as you said it runs I mean
I'm looking at the XDA sub-forums and
it's got windows mobile 6.5 windows
phone 7 up and all you know all versions
but you know seven point eight and eight
it's got androids got you bunt to it's
got me go and then the questions like
why the hd2 why not um why can't the
desire HD do this or why can't I can't
the nexus s run you bunt to and miko and
windows phone 7 well the answer for the
at least what I'm trying to come up with
is that because so many people bought
the hd2 and it became almost a
development platform in and of itself
because it for the first time brought
capacitive displays to windows mobile
and I think it came out before Android
started shipping and so it was either
trying to think back well i know i think
android was out but it was definitely
the first 4.3 inch display i ever saw in
public i think was the biggest display
for a minute and biggest display for a
minute and you know the it's it's built
with the respectable snapdragon 1
gigahertz MSM i don't remember the rest
of the numbers and so it's just it's
very it's just such a good it's such a
good platform so i think that if you
know any other device was as as
prevalent as the hd2 i think it could
enjoy the strange operating systems III
really want to see me go on this thing
but there's this looks like it's stalled
a development for the head I want to see
somebody run webos on the thing I mean I
feel like like we're all talking about
running webos on the Galaxy Nexus once
open webOS was announced but i would
feel like the hd2 could handle it it
looks like t-mobile's release date for
that phone was March 24th of 2010 so
that was a while back
interesting yeah but it's an amazing
device it early HTC did the undoable
which was bring capacitive touch to
windows mobile and they did it before
windows mobile 6.5 point 3 came along
before officially supported so they had
to like from the ground up create create
that experience so that was that was
very respectable yeah even though if you
want to go back to the keyboard on the
HTC hd2 now and type a short text
message or a short email message you'd
be sweating really is the keyboard all
the responsiveness can be tweaked but
the out-of-the-box experience was awful
I mean you you tapped on the Q key and
it registered sometimes a tea or a you
so it had some glitches it was good it
was good but out of the box the
experience wasn't as good which is
normal because HTC was a pioneer with
this and of course the developing
community helped a lot by going with all
sorts of tweaks and hacks for
calibration of the keyboard and the
entire touch screen itself but I think
as a first it was a good effort yeah not
only that but it was made of glass and
metal and soft touch plastic it had a
thin bezel it uh you know as we point
out how to have a large screen and it
was thin like real thing I mean it was
like it was a spectacle really yeah I
still remember the first time I laid my
eyes on one it was on the train and I
just couldn't believe the size of that
display you started dumping I did it
started to dumping operation oh thats
related to totally something different
here in Europe but or at least in my
head oh man well speaking of a windows
phone though the only news this week
unless I missed something really
critical guys save me if I did is that
the the Lumia 900 price is down to two
4999 which indicates that we're getting
close to the not really the end of its
popularity but certainly the buzz has
passed after the buzz episode one was
based on the the Nokia Lumia 900 we do
some speculation in the article there
what do you guys think that says about
the state of like I mean this combined
with the
story we did about a week ago about
nokia reducing its component orders
would seem to indicate that the 900 is
kind of reaching the end of its well
actually there's been a news post today
and according to that the shrinking of
the production for the Lumia 900 was due
because of the fact that Nokia switched
part of its production to a new factory
in Argentina if Eric oh well and the
first Lumia 900 dziak came out from that
production line recently today yesterday
or something like that so it doesn't
have anything to do with with the Lumia
900 dying I still think it's one of the
best films if not the best windows phone
at the moment in the States but I think
personally I think that this is how to
make it sound normal just by talking of
course it's a last push nokia and
microsoft are trying to push Windows
Phone and the current products for the
summer because everybody knows that
Windows Phone 7.8 and Windows Phone 8
will come out summer in q3 q4 and they
might as well sell as much as they can
right now to whomever buys them but
aren't the Dantas stakes super high now
I mean we've been talking about nokia
being in this really big vat of hot
water and you know that they were
already not making almost any money if i
recall right on the on the Lumia 900 at
$99 we're just like I mean they're
slashing the price in half it's like it
is this is this like a part of betting
on the future so hard you know on future
adoption of windows phone 8 devices that
they're going to manufacture or what nah
yes policy was always and if I recoil
attended a couple of Stephen Elop ski
notes was to get smartphones in the
hands of as many people as possible
whether we're talking about emerging
markets or we are talking about
established markets like the US or
Europe I think they're continuing on
that same trend to get nakia products
and Windows Phone Microsoft products in
as many hands as they can so they can
grow their user base and to have
something established by the time
windows phone 8 hits regardless if there
will be an official upgrade or not sure
but Nokia doesn't make any money like
you know with with the more people
having when
phone handsets right i mean they don't
get any they don't get any profit from
the the custom apps they're building or
anything like that like their money
comes still comes from hardware doesn't
it yes but opposed to Google who's
making money out of something else nokia
has first to re-establish itself as a
brand at least on the US market where it
disappeared a long time ago so they have
to regain that brand recognition which
they had they have to have nakia people
talking about nokia as a brand on the
street wherever you go so they have to
get it back into the users attention and
is that happening this is a question to
both Brandon and you Tony I think
grabbing where you or Brandon is more
entitled to answer that because he knows
a lot about the u.s. the market about
the u.s. yes I was going to ask you
about about Romania Tony but I want to
do it want to hear by the US first yeah
I've never I've never owned a nokia
phone but i'm starting to feel the
result of the nokia push in the u.s.
because you see it you see the 900 in
movies that nokia brand is starting to
be kind of cool and and you know the the
fact that they're dropping the price i
think means that the blue 900 is going
to step aside soon it's going to go even
further down in price and then the the
new Lumia is going to come out in this
in this holiday season it's going to be
priced at 199 again and then and then
people are going to be like oh do I
really need this high res screen is dual
core cpu here's a 900 it's 30 bucks it
looks just like it and you know I'm
gonna get that and then they're nokia
customers for life so is that I mean do
you see them on the streets though like
me do you see nokia nokia devices out
there I think I have one friend who has
a Lumia 900 in Boston here mr. yeah it's
really rare and it's yeah I mean that's
the thing this is what worries me
because we've had this massive push and
it's been very visible in eighteen t is
like here's a whole corner of the store
and here's here's window units and
here's everything we're putting all of
our commercials in whatever and i still
like most of my friends have it is you
know this is anecdotal I'm you know it's
not really worth anything most my
friends have iphones most of my friends
of android phones you know it's like
yeah but don't know what the big picture
I'm sorry Brandon going
I was just going to say that the quote
have I seen it on the street and quote
test isn't very for some reason it
doesn't really hold water because think
about this how many Galaxy Nexus next
side you see on your daily life if I go
out I see about see about one a day what
a day okay uh and that's one of the most
popular phones um ever uh what a nexus
yeah it won't you say that i don't know
i think that i think the sales data on
the nexus is unclear but for the sake of
argument go ahead i don't to interrupt
you you think yeah for some reason i
guess maybe because there are just so
many devices trying to gauge the
popularity of a phone and I've tried
this x by c by trying to determine if
you if you see it in your everyday life
his is problematic at best yeah yeah and
the up the only phone that you see
everywhere is of course the iphone and
every team is that almost every human on
the planet has an iphone it's very
strange like in the subway iphone iphone
iphone where's the galaxy nexus where's
the Lumia 900 well certainly you know
millions of people have purchased these
but you don't see them it's mm-hmm
what's the story over there in Navia
it's different if you recall the nut and
the Nokia Lumia 800 and 7 10 launch
announcement it was or it should have
been available initially in five
countries in Europe I think Germany
Italy France UK switch went something
like that maybe I'm getting some some of
these wrong yeah we got actually here in
Romania we got the Lumia 800 but at the
same time around you guys got it in the
in the States through the microsoft
store so we got a pretty late you scan
still buy a Lumia 800 or Lumia 710 we
have a couple of e Taylor's here who are
having those phones on their offer but
they're not on stock so you have to wait
one or two weeks for for them to deliver
them to you so it's it's kind of strange
Romania is a country which up until
recently had a nokia factory one of the
largest in europe which was of course
closed a couple of months ago you to
economic
situations but that's not the topic the
topic is that one would expect to have
nokia lumia phones throughout the entire
european community around the same time
and that's not the case hmm it seems
like they've still got their work cut
out for them and I agree with you
Brandon that anecdotal evidence is
treated with sort of disdain for a very
good reason it's just it's just
interesting to to see because you expect
something like a massive push like this
like for like what we've seen for the
Lumia 900 to have had some kind of
visible concrete results and it's it's
funny when that is not the case but then
again I am surrounded by people who do
not care about technology which is why I
am happy to be on the podcast with you
guys who do care about it oh yeah yeah
you know and with our listeners thank
you for listening the windows phone is
now I want there to be more news about
it but there is none so I want to talk
about iOS for a second I do not have the
iOS 6 beta 3 but it is coming out it is
trickling out to developers I think I
may have said that some of the
improvements have been interesting I
don't think there's much interesting in
there i think it's just you know some
some app fixes and things like that i
still have to get my ipad to like me
again by the way I don't know if I
mentioned this last week but I should
mention it now anyone who is running a
beta or a regular version of iOS on
their iPad or iPhone do not do not
change your debit card information or
your credit card information in itunes
and then try and do a software update
because it will mess up your entire life
my ipad for about a week because i
haven't had the time to fix it has been
stuck in a continuous loop of trying to
update its apps and not being able to so
don't change your iTunes billing
information and in related news don't
lose your credit card when you are out
on the town because that's inconvenient
all the way around that goes for you two
gentlemen
nice thanks no problem I'm happy to
provide life advice for you but even
more exciting new details on the next
iPhone has production started already
we've got a bunch of leaks of these
these frames it seems pretty clear at
this point that this new design is a
lock this kind of stretched iphone 4
design I have to be honest with you I'm
bored out of my mind by it who's excited
about it please talk about it well okay
so you took here into your lungs so now
speak okay uh well so well I I'm sort of
envisioning the new iphone and you know
I think they're gonna have some very
interesting hardware breakthroughs maybe
with that I left because of that the
thinner screen or could be a higher yet
resolution screen or could be a
quad-core processor I'm thinking about
this I you know of course I'm gonna get
the new iphone it's kind of my job and I
you know I even if it wasn't not get the
new iphone cuz i love this stuff but i'm
thinking about iOS 6 and just right now
I had to go to apple.com / iOS 6 to
remember what the headline features of
iOS 6 were and and except for maps new
maps and except for shared photo streams
using the new iphone it's going to be a
lot like using the iphone 4s with
slightly different hardware hopefully
it's dramatically different hardware but
you know I'm more so fantasizing about
getting cyanogenmod 10 or just straight
jelly bean on my galaxy s3 and using
that for a while then I am excited about
getting the new iphone with iOS 6 it's
it you know yeah just that kind of a sad
realization there and you know Tony go
yeah this is maybe just me wishful
thinking but I have to contradict here
for a second Brandon because imagine
this Apple will have a keynote with the
iphone 5 or whatever its name will be do
you imagine Tim Cook on stage talking
only five minutes about the iphone
no I think that there are many more or
at least I believe or I I'd like to
believe that there are many more
features to ios6 than what we've seen
and they are holding some of them back
for the iphone launch because it's just
normal to show off new hardware with
some new groundbreaking amazing
something you've never seen before and
blah blah blah Apple marketing talk
features as I said it happened before
the it's it should be just normal for
them to do that because presenting a new
product takes five to ten minutes I mean
this is the phone this is how thick it
is this is what it does blah blah blah
it's got NFC it's gotta else use got
quad core full stop you have to show
something off right no there's also
apple right there like you know yeah
we've put a new gasket under the volume
keys that makes it feel like you're
squeezing a sponge in your sack not
making this madness that's something
like the never did before yeah but
that's an interesting notion it's been
done in in history where company
releases a new product and with it new
software features that we didn't tell
you about take that take that but I
don't think Apple has ever done that I'm
thinking back to the four SQ note back
to the for keynote was there ever a
surprise software announcement the 4s
game with Siri and if you look at all
yes the macbooks and the iPad everything
came with something software related and
if the WWDC told us everything about iOS
6 I think that then we'll have the
iphone and the ipad whether it will be
the ipad for the ipad mini it's as far
as I'm concerned impossible to have only
the iphone on the entire keynote yeah i
agree i think they're gonna they've
definitely saved some stuff from out
from our sex i remember the the feature
cloud at the end of the iOS 6
presentation and like there were
articles out there just picking apart
even what was listed in that like
feature cloud of all the stuff they
didn't get around to talking about so
there's other stuff that there's plenty
of stuff that they can focus on my beef
with it is that it's the same damn you I
I you know even if I weren't we think it
is I mean it that's what that's what it
is in the betas you know the betas yeah
but what about if they are holding
something back I don't know something
like widget
I'm just saying stuff right you know
what I wish I wish they were I I wish
that I could believe that that kind of
that kind of big shift was was in store
for us I mean if it is I will I don't
know what I'll do I will eat my hat you
know i mean it's it's just it seems so
they seem so timid about changing this
grid of icons based you I mentality even
though it's been five years you know I
look at an ipad today or an iphone today
the UI looks exactly the same as it did
in 2007 with the exception of a custom
wallpaper and some more icons and
folders you know that's not limbal what
there's that the same I don't understand
there's that saying you guys say in the
in the States and in the UK if something
ain't broke don't fix it and so far with
selling millions I know I know you know
I think there should be a saying that's
like that says well it's broken everyone
doesn't know it you know like mean I
don't know I think that yeah this is
still a problem for we tech nerds and a
subset of tech nerds to that's not it's
not all of us I mean it's just the UI
people and the people who use this stuff
all the time I guess but yeah I don't
know regular users ever complain about
the grid of icons I think they're fond
of it I mean they like it I like it and
if you come to think of it android is
the same okay bring on the hate mail but
it's a matter if it's a kawai the
launcher it's the same just fire up your
application drawer and you'll see the
same list of icons right but the
application drawer isn't the core of the
experience yeah but where you go to get
your applications you can do whatever
you want with your home screen yeah you
have widgets in android which is
something different if iOS brings iOS 6
will bring widgets it will be on par
with android and again bring on a hate
mail I found am I found I'm always
looking for useful widgets because
although I love to doubt the benefits of
Android is being able to put glanceable
widgets on your home screen they never
quite seemed to work for me by the time
I flipped to the screen on the left the
widget hasn't updated I'm like well this
is pointless delete and then the news
app on the right home screen
uh you know also isn't updated or it's
it's it's white for like a second as it
refreshes well this is useless so I
flick it off and I came across a new
widget add that I'm not going to tell
you the name of yet because I'm gonna
write about it make a video about on
pocket now and and it's uh it's actually
reported on another site so maybe if
you'll know what it is but what it lets
you do I love this it lets you crop a
part of a website so think about your
usage habits for example I visit certain
websites on a regular basis like the
verge and pocket now and android central
and what I do is I look at the top two
stories and I see if there's a new one
because I'm kind of obsessed with new
stuff and and and my my typical workflow
is that I've got a folder on my android
phone with all my favorites so I hit the
favorite I look at the website I go back
to the home screen I hit the next
favorite nike I do that this this widget
app lets you crop out the top part of
the website or the whole web web web
site it'll put a thumbnail which is
resizable either as a 1 by 1 or 1 by 4
or 4 by 4 on your home screen and it
will update it it'll go out and pull the
website and refresh the thumbnail at
intervals that use you you specify so
imagine this there's four there are four
websites that you visit on a regular
basis you put four little thumbnails on
one home screen to the right of your
main home screen and you know that it's
been updated recently it's glance and go
I think it's I think it's going to make
the world a peaceful place on quilts it
sounds a lot like the Flipboard widget
except with a lot more granular control
over what you have displayed I mean that
sounds very very useful quick question
again how many home screens do you guys
have yeah I have right now I was just
about to talk about the what I'm running
here like I'm I've got three home
screens right now that's all I ever
really want what about what you run it
well what's on your home screens uh well
that I was going to do since we were
talking about widgets i'm using the
motorola atrix HD right now and i've got
three widgets that I use all the time I
always swipe to the left to get my full
screen calendar I have an entire home
screen just devoted to the calendar
widget
which is important to me because I do a
lot of stuff and I always forget what I
have to do and on my primary home screen
actually to the right is power control
and in Evernote widget but in the in the
center here motor oil has really done
something kind of interesting with their
bubbles widget because I've got three
bubbles that I can kind of swype
vertically and flip over and you know
one of them displays the time but if I
flip it over it's like oh this is last
text message and that's interesting and
then if I flip over the weather bubble
I've got weather for different cities if
I flip over the battery one I got a
settings shortcut and a and data meter
so you know I've I love that kind of
expandability that's what I'm running
right now and if Motorola's really got
that right there I want to use that I'm
different phones because i'm addicted to
it after a day so I mean so you're using
some widgets that are kind of system
based so they're there they're already
updated by the time you flip over right
exactly yeah they run very well because
they're not those third-party widgets
that often have those problems you
described yes yeah yeah interesting I am
I go back and forth and I still have yet
to come across the perfect home screen
configuration and I'm messing with a
bunch of different plugins that I've
found but usually I have one home screen
with you know four or five folders along
the bottom and what I what I really like
doing quick tip is an Android you know
in Android you can have a direct dial
shortcuts oh it's one touch it has a
little picture of the person it's really
pretty and so what I do is in the bottom
left corner of my screen I make a folder
with all of its and there's a direct
direct dials to my wife my friend and
who whatever else and then the phone
icon so like it's so quick and easy for
me to call someone that you know I want
to reach um so my home screen tends to
be very simple very minimal I like I
like really nice wallpaper so I kind of
maximize the amount of space i get to
see what the wallpaper yeah i think i
stole my wallpaper idea from you that
the beautiful vortex are beautiful
nebula or whatever it's called yeah i
saw i saw your running out on the yeah
yeah galaxy s3 thank you for that thank
you for the inspiration yeah i would use
those call widgets to because i was
setting up the atrix here
last night and I was like oh yeah it
would be great to have those faces that
I could tap on to call but I never call
anyone so like I just always text and so
those widgets that would otherwise be
very very useful or like oh well that's
as useless to me as like the Google Play
widget that lets you tab through apps
for some reason the ultimate you I that
I found is that that shot that frog UX
thing from sharp or what was it called
frog or yeah frog Rick it's called feel
you x is this right am I yeah is this
right I'm up let's see looking up feel
you x on google and i'm getting a really
interesting series of results Jesus hmm
backspace yeah this isn't this isn't
right I'm Adam yeah there's a Vimeo or a
video on it the sharp UX on a on android
phone it's got three columns right oh
yeah it's beautiful yeah and and and
what's all you know what I would love to
be able to have one of my home screens
be windows phone 7 like a vertically
scrollable because that's a very very
natural thing to do is to scroll up and
down and then um the home screens on the
right and the left are just static but
can i can i call you out for a second
okay I'm oh yeah i'm going to i'm
fascinated in this and i'm not doing it
to be cruel i'm actually fascinated
because we talked about the Android
multi tasking interface and so many of
the comments on the piece that i wrote
about the Android multi tasking
interface being a ripoff of webos is
that the vertical scrolling is not as
useful as just a box of six recently
used apps but i agree with you i think
that vertical scrolling is a very
intuitive thing when it's presented
usefully and i think windows phone does
that yeah it's about minimal finger
travel windows phone does it very well
oh my gosh guess what I found out but
you're not gonna believe this alright
everyone sit down um mind is blown
already the iphone 5 no yes i have the
iphone 5 and no um so i was using a I
don't I've I already told the story
should really kill me um I I was using a
a friend's galaxy note and he had a
logitech keyboard right up bluetooth
keyboard and interestingly if you press
alt tab you get a task switcher and you
know kind of like windows or OS 10 right
you guys ever use alt tab yeah as I used
this as a jumping-off point for that
article I was talking about yes totally
oh yes yes um so the interesting thing
is that the alt tab task switcher is the
legacy gingerbread multitask UI and that
could only mean one thing which is that
the gingerbread legacy multitask UI is
in Ice Cream Sandwich and as I found out
later in jellybean after doing some
searching I found that through a very
complicated process you can actually
bring back the gingerbread tassels
switcher and forget this ice cream
sandwich vertically scrolling thing that
fades in and out too much you can
actually bring it back and like I spent
an hour trying to figure out how to do
it there's a thread on XDA and you know
I need to do a lot more research because
you have to like extract this thing
called the framework from your phone
you've gotta edit it and sign it and put
it back on your phone without destroying
everything but it's it's possible to
bring back the legacy gingerbread you
all along it was in there okay I'm gonna
I'm gonna completely kill the geek
excitement and I'm going to bring up the
lame stuff I what I did recently is in
the lane category I actually connected
my bluetooth mouse to my HTC One X and i
used i use the HTC One X laying back in
my in my chair here at the office using
it with the mouse and after five minutes
I said okay this is completely useless
why would anyone introduced the ability
to use an android phone and any phone
really with a pointing device yeah
following the footsteps of rim you know
with that that scrollable mouse pointer
in the browser which at one point in
2006 was pretty cool
yeah that's cool but going through
widgets and home screens with your mouse
yeah come on I he have tips to you for
doing it though I mean that's that's I
think you may win the geek of the day
award I mean Brandon had it until you
brought that up because I that I got to
be honest to the Brennan when you told
me on the phone a couple days ago about
that very same thing I was like man I
that sounds to me like like there's been
this car this like abandoned car in
front of your house for for like two
years and you just like man that thing
really bruise really ugly and finally
gets towed away and then you spend like
a week and a half like trying to find it
so you can bring it back and put it in
front of your house I gah i hate the
gingerbread test critter I know that it
makes more sense i know it's more
efficient but even though i think the
ribbon is a ripoff i still prefer it to
that box of icons check this out okay
the cook the cool thing about the
gingerbread UI is that it's fast it's
simple and you can see 8 apps on the
screen at one time I don't have my phone
nearby but I think an Ice Cream Sandwich
gingerbread not gingerbread Ice Cream
Sandwich jelly bean it's only like four
right so so sometimes you get into this
pattern of scrolling and trying to find
your app the ultimate and i know this is
possible because android can do anything
would be to first of all if if you're
using like a galaxy s3 where you have to
tap and hold the home button to get the
multitask you I chain so annoying change
that to a double tap and then bring up
the ginger bread test switcher but bring
it all the way to the bottom of the
screen dare I say like the iphone so
that it's really close to your thumb and
your like DoubleTap boom next step
double tap boom next step and you are a
monster multitasker that is probably the
best case scenario and I know it's
possible as long as it's responsive you
know it has to be responsive and it has
to be instant and you know ever we have
to we have to move on I have a bit of a
hard stop today so I we have is this the
new iphone possibly we have iphone
hardware speculation left and right
we'll we'll kind of have to see how that
goes I do want to cover before we leave
iOS though this ipad mini it guys is it
inevitable Tony you can go first and see
you haven't talked in a minute like is
is that at seven going to happen is it
inevitable I touched upon this in our
last at
so I think that the chances are very
slim and that's even because Apple is in
the business with premium hardware I'm
not saying that it's impossible probably
they will come up with with a 7-inch
tablet in order to capture a part of the
market which is now dominated by Google
by Samsung and by amazon but as i said
in my previous episode in our previous
episode will i buy one yes will I need
one no reddit um yeah yeah I think
what's changed what I said last time was
that the the the the current iPad is far
too thick and far too heavy to be
comfortable isn't you know in the in bed
and whatnot that what's changed is that
the new rumor is that the ipad mini will
be as thin as an ipod touch and wow that
would just be incredible that would be
just finger looking good um i just i
simply realized that I hate thin
hardware but but we'll get to that later
on yeah you hate Santa hardware yeah i
just realized that when i got the puter
view wait away but we'll talk about it
later I've got an atrix HD here for you
how thick at its thinnest it's eight
point six millimeters but it oh no bring
out of 40 millimeters man well that is
watch out to a thicker measurement up
top though it's yeah oh you could
definitely this is definitely a theft
deterrent you could definitely take down
a criminal by throwing this at his face
I want to yeah i think the ipad 7 is
coming if it's as thin as an ipad ipod
touch i would i would buy it instantly
that's kind of my one points about the
nexus 7 i really don't like is the
thickness I'm you know what it you know
what Apple could really pull off bicep I
do let me scratch everything I'm too
excited now you know you know what would
be huge and awesome for Apple to do with
the ipad 7 to do something which has not
been done yet or maybe some of them do
it but but not everybody bring on the
smaller ipad but full foam functionality
on it not by a bluetooth not bias peak
by a speakerphone just just kill
the need for having two devices you wait
you you want a 7-inch phone yes no
listen Michael right don't yet I I don't
want to carry my iPhone and my iPhone I
understand I understand I wrote I wrote
a piece on it I I agree completely but
but a 7-inch phone like you want to hold
a semanas phone up to your head why not
why not come on it's if okay okay no no
Menlo no please please continue this is
fascinating you guys don't get it I hate
carrying two phones I've always carry
two phones because one is my preferred
platform the other one is my preferred
camera I always carry a phone and a
tablet if I go outside because i'm
tethering from one to the other or
because i need stuff but with a smaller
tablet i will no longer need to bring my
phone with me if the tablet will allow
me to receive phone calls and i'm not
talking about phone calls by my
bluetooth headset I'm not talking about
phone calls by a speakerphone so that
the entire tram bus and everybody the
taxi driver listens into what I talking
sure sure water but what about something
like the PadFone wood with like a
bluetooth stylus or something like that
like I mean something that integrates
nicely sure yeah just just bring on some
full phone functionality and I think
that would be great I guess it's just a
question of like you would have to never
go someplace that would require you to
put the thing down because you can't fit
a 7-inch and your pocket terribly well I
mean not everyone is you know you're
you're broke you know you're a tall guy
right so you could probably fit a 7-inch
tablet in your pockets i mean i don't
think i could under all circumstances
what happens when you go to the the
water park or something like that i
don't know what are the kids do these
days he Romania nothing they don't carry
that stuff like that kids these days all
they do is text and sext and Facebook
and water rides and on the wilder
facebook and on the myspace yeah anyway
well that's fascinating tongue if i come
across a 7-inch phone i will i will get
it to you somehow it looked strangely at
the samsung galaxy note even i had a
picture with the galaxy note at my ear
but yeah why not I didn't mean I don't
care what people say if they laugh at me
when I'm using the iPad as a camera
which I never do I don't care if I'm
putting a 7-inch phone to my ear and
talk to somebody I don't care what I'm
what I care about is that I need to work
I need to be good at my work and I need
to be able to multitask and I need to be
able to deliver what I have on my desk
list for that day and if that needs a
phone functionality on Sabbath give it
to me let me be happy I understand you
know I understand i think i just i would
need something more portable like i was
able to go through life for four months
with the veer as my daily driver you
know that is a 2.8 inch screen you know
and it's not just because i'm a webos
guy it's because i really liked it i
found that i liked carrying around this
phone that sort of disappeared into my
pockets and it wasn't taking up this big
slab of space somewhere on my body you
know i mean there's something to be said
for extreme portability as well so i
don't know i feel like as long as you
can swap your sim in different
circumstances i could maybe carry maybe
maybe carry a 7-inch phone yeah but
don't forget the you can use the iphone
with the headphones which are supplied
you could use the ipad at the same way
if it had phone functionality sure well
that's true yeah but you made a big
point or saying like you didn't want a
headset right but anyway but i want
phone functionality on a tablet so that
i don't me yeah i don't need another
phone with me right hey the Galaxy Tab
7.7 actually has an ear piece at the top
near the prox sensor and it's capable
with the right software making phone
calls and I I was looking at it the
other day and like can I should I try to
do this should I try to use this it's
the Wi-Fi version so i need to get a 3g
version but should I try to do too
that's too much a 2 now it's too it's
too much about the answer is yes now we
need to have a whole video of Brendan
minimum walking around in Philadelphia
talking on the phone talking on the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 it fits in my pocket I
mean it looks really weird like there's
something wrong with me but the you know
usually people think something's wrong
with me i guess so i guess i want to be
different if
okay well that'll have to be a weekend
video or something I would love I would
I would pay you to see that i would love
to see that anyway before we go I we
have we're into the miscellaneous
section will not take very long I
touched on this heavily and our today's
article about whether a new smartphone
platform can ever survive in today's
market Mego is amazingly coming back the
the guys who were behind me go I have
many of them have sort of split off from
Nokia and have partnered and under the
brand name I don't know how to pronounce
this does anybody know how to pronounce
this Julius yo jolla you if it's finish
then it's yola of a Yolo right yeah if
it's because it's finished right then in
Ceola yeah then it's got to be Yolo and
like I mean they're serious about this
they've got a whole team they've got a
they don't have a website yet because
it's a brand spanking new but they have
a LinkedIn account they've got a Twitter
account and they've announced a
distribution deal with Chinese
distributor somebody save me on this one
I don't know what the Chinese
distributors namath but it to you know
that this distributor is like 2200
retail outlets and leather goods huge
its massive and they're going to build
to at least to me go based phones this
year one of which will be for the common
person one of which will be for the
enthusiast you know that's amazing and
they're talking about maybe building
incompatibility with html5 based Tizen
apps this is just huge I love seeing it
when first of all when a new platform
comes and kind of tries to shake things
up a little bit I love the underdog and
i really love when a bunch of people who
are part of a company that's going one
direction say no we like the way we were
going before we build something amazing
in me go actually the quote is nokia
created something wonderful the world's
best smartphone product it deserves to
be continued and we will do that
together with all the bright and gifted
people contributing to the meego success
story that's cool man I mean these guys
have passion they're going to go do it I
think it's great what do you guys think
when I reviewed the nokia n9 but sorry
Brandon were you seeing something i I
just I was just gonna say it's kind of
cool but I you know I don't know much
about me go I really don't have an
opinion on the matter yeah I use that
phone the nokia n9 and of course it's
far from being the planets best
smartphone OS it's a new OS and it's it
brings a fresh look I mean the concept
of those panels you had basically three
panels if i recall well it was back in
the day one for swiping mm sorry one for
swiping left to bring up a task manager
one is your main home screen and the
third one is the list of your
applications and you can access them
whenever you are wherever you are in
whichever application just swipe from
the left or from the right and you can
access those or even from the top to
lock the screen so it's a great concept
the problem as always with new platforms
is lack of developer support and lack of
applications for the end user so it all
depends and it's like a chicken and egg
story you cannot have users if you don't
have applications and you can't have
applications if you don't have a user
base so it's it's a catch 22 23 24 if
they can figure out how to how to get
android apps running on on me go do you
know if they can make a sizable enough
story i'm not sure i'm not sure google
will agree to that but if it will at all
if it could happen i mean look it's
happening on the playbook to a limited
extent you know i would go as far as
saying that back in the day if nakia
wouldn't have ditched me go or if
somebody would have picked up me go
where nakia left it off it would be
around the same as windows phone right
now because they both started basically
from scratch yes yeah I I'm looking
forward to seeing what what exactly
happens with this this is obviously
brand brand new news this is there's not
a lot to talk about yet but I'm going to
keep my eye on on this and I might snap
up one of those one of those phones that
they that that they release going
forward we'll have to see I want to talk
tell me about your crazy camera shoot
out very briefly what was it like to
shoot with them Tony posted an article
comparing the
cameras on what the HTC One X the iphone
4s the PureView 808 and the yellow CS
freaking galaxy s3 and it's awesome it's
if you haven't read it listeners you
should go out and check it out on our
site it's really really an in-depth
comparison I've loved it because I love
shooting sort of amateurish photos with
my cell phone camera what was it like to
shoot with four phones out in public I
mean it was interesting and I and I
realized that there is a way of shooting
with several phones at one time
everybody in the business is using
phones either I don't know on a board or
holding one phone in their hand and the
other one in the other hand but the the
real thing is that all the phones which
you are using for your test recording
have to see I have to have the same
perspective so that the same lighting
conditions apply the same sound
conditions apply and I realized how to
do that and it was tricky to do with
three it was close to impossible to do
it before but I somehow managed to pull
it off you must have been a sight to see
yes yes indeed and people look strangely
towards me especially when I was talking
to myself well basically I was recording
but they would like look at that guy
with four white phones it's all phones
were white all white yeah and and I was
talking but it came out pretty good
despite in the comments it would have
been so cool if he managed to take a
picture of yourself like with a
thoughtful look on your face as you're
holding these phones together from like
across the field kind of you know that
would be so cool you know what Brandon I
started off with a three-way comparison
i did a four-way comparison the next
time i'm doing a five-way comparison i'm
gonna have somebody shoot a picture of
me with the five phones in my hand you
better if you do in Berlin I'll take the
picture okie dokie you're gonna be like
Gillette with razor blades you're just
going to keep adding more the the last
point I want to make before our sort of
wrap up here is that as a result of
Tony's crazy camera shoot out we we had
some commenters who were kind of
questioning the validity of the of the
photos and saying you know essentially
that you guys cropped
you know one of these to make to make
another phone look better and you know
it was one of those kind of fan boyish
arguments and it was you know there were
a couple comments thrown back and forth
the thing is Tony did you ever post the
your side by side comparison the road
the raw images like I said no I I did
not post the images because mainly I
have the reputation and bucket now has
the reputation on the market to not
defend itself against any accusations
thrown whatsoever but i will post and i
have posted the raw images from the
Nokia 808 PureView and I just wanna I
just want to run for up for a minute if
we have time that whenever a company
comes out with a product which is the
best the lightest the smartest the
fastest it's proven to be that and it's
proven to be dead by different media
outlets and you say that Anton says that
bucket now confirms that and there comes
a new breed of users on the internet
it's called The Moron and the moron
throws his keyboard or her keyboard at
you and he says oh my god this how
can you pull this one off you know what
I don't care about your comments because
you as a person do not exist unless you
prove to me that you can do it better
faster or you can do it without my
mistakes until then you just grow some
balls and maybe we have to take away the
clean tag for this one grow some balls
and accept it that your phone is a six
month old phone and that somebody can do
it better I'm always in favor of
intelligent discussion with arguments
but as long as somebody says I don't
care about that technology I have never
used it I have never seen it but no I
can't accept that and its end of my rent
right well you know all this falls in
the category of you know we all get
really really passionate about about
platforms we're using with the mobile
world is a lot like sports teams I mean
it's very very everybody gets all hot
faced and sweaty and whatever yes
Michael but we are talking facts and
facts can be proven can be our palpable
zero you can see the difference I mean
you don't have to but that not everybody
can see can see the difference that's
that's the thing come on man you can see
there was a huge difference
when the HTC One X and the 808 you're
kind of like that that specific example
I'm with you I'm not I'm not kind of i'm
not really defending anyone as much as
I'm making an observation that when
everyone gets that excited about
everything we all get very emotional and
it's very annoying because then the
facts kind of disappear and then all of
a sudden where there's there's a
shouting match i'm not talking about
your your interaction i'm talking about
the people in general in this in the
field right so it's like I I know I know
exactly what you mean I we've talked
about it last week you know about people
getting really up in arms about that
you're not actually saying it's funny
it's it's an interesting little sidebar
I completely completely agree and I
think that um I think that my point is
just this you engaged with the you know
with with with the commenter which i
think is cool is not a lot of people
will do that yeah absolutely i take
responsibility i right i mean what i say
and do but whenever somebody comes and
throws in accusations which are harsh
accusations I mean they're not only
questioning my integrity as a reviewer
they are questioning the entire websites
credibility which is not acceptable in
my book as far as common sense is
concerned right and you know and you
responded you know and i think that
happens kind of all the time across the
entire site will get commenters who will
say great things will say horrible
things will say middle road things and
if we have the time more often than not
we take we take the time to try and
respond that's been pushed from the top
from both of you guys ever since I came
on boards like try to engage with the
commenters and you know try to be a
member of the community I think that's
really cool sometimes it ends up in
little in tiffs sometimes it ends up
with jerks and sometimes it ends up with
like really useful interactions I think
the point I'm trying to make is that we
are listening to the listeners out there
we are we are listening to your feedback
you know in the case of the contest we
put out the contact the giveaway contest
for the galaxy s3 and we were like well
we have some restrictions here where we
want to make it us only because that'll
be simpler we're not really sure if the
phone can be unlocked by the way
everyone stopped telling me that all
phones can be unlocked we have we've had
problems in the past with units coming
from specific vendors that
not be unlocked easily so that's what we
were trying to avoid any way we put the
the contest announcement up we were like
us only and everyone kind of exploded
and then we kind of talked about it we
spent an hour we're like well can we do
this can we make it international let's
investigate we decided that it was
possible we unlock the phone and now
it's open to everyone so I guess my
point is we're listening to your
feedback thank you for continuing to
provide it and we'll keep engaging as
long as you're not you know as long as
people aren't jerks and I think that
goes for the Internet as well as a real
world I mean I don't interact with jerks
very often in the real world either
brenna do without on that uh you know I
think it's it's nice if if people can
act as if you know we're all you know
we're on let's let's act as if we're in
the same room we're having a reasonable
intelligent discussion about the issues
that that we care about at the end of
the day we're just reviewing and talking
about cool technology and we want to
help you point we want to point you
towards the coolest stuff we find and
we're not paid by Samsung we're not
where we don't have an agenda except to
write really good content for you and so
it's it's kind of confusing me sometimes
when when the the morons come with it
with their tour shallot and and it's
like whoa oh we're you know you know if
you think there's something wrong here
let's let's talk about it we'd love to
engage you but don't come at us with a
fist in the air so you know it's just
that it's just you know it's just how
the internet is and you know it's fine
well we'll put Tony out how you how you
doing over there you good hey absolutely
I was just thinking that it's it's
interesting how how the anonymity of the
Internet I mean hiding behind a username
can make somebody believe that they can
get away with stuff I mean we are all
public figures as far as our faces names
workplaces email addresses Facebook's
and Twitter's are concerned you know all
the stuff that needs to be known about
us what can you tell me about a troll on
YouTube not it's just a username which
today exist tomorrow is not there
just keep on coming back once you
probably banned them because they're
using f words all day long so what I'm
saying is that the Internet is a great
thing but it's also a hostile
environment that it is and yeah there's
that there's a lot of its that is so
true that there are a lot of books out
on that very topic and it's fascinating
psychological thing and I just I just
want to thank the person who once told
me that I had the best sideburns in tech
like that's I really yeah I like that's
nice it's really nice you a person he
was it was on YouTube I you know I
really appreciate that thank you thank
you very much that is a good place to
jump into the to the final topic of the
day here which we really do have to
spend two minutes each on guys we have
some rumors coming down the pipe of
several phones that are going to rock
1080p displays that is not 720p that is
1080p that is full HD on a phone display
of whatever it is in the four to five
inch neighborhood this is overkill or
this is not overkill two minutes for
each of you Brandon you may begin let's
discuss wait Tony's to go for seven
first last time oh alright yeah I'm
cheating because I know where your each
coming from so I thought I'd structure
it that way but okay Tony okay the giant
in Romania has the floor I think it is
an overkill because we are having phones
which are at the moment between 4.3 and
4.8 inches we have phablets of 5.3
inches and if the next phablet will go
up to even six inches I don't think
there will go any further because that's
tablet territory at six inches full HD
resolution yields for 380 ppi which is
huge I mean the difference between HD
720p and full HD 1080p doesn't give you
that much of screen real estate as the
difference between I don't know wvga or
qhd towards 720p so you don't need that
high of resolution because content which
you are seeing even if it's full HD
content from YouTube you can tell the
difference if you're watching it on a
720p screen or a 1080p screen yeah sure
bring on 1080p screens for
or the four tablets that should be a
standard but as far as small as small
diagonal phones are concerned I think
720p should be the maximum resolution
for anything below six inches and I rest
my case wow wow less than a minute this
guy is good Brandon all right I want to
throw a curveball to both you I'm
actually I'm I've been thinking about
this a lot and I actually agree with
thorny here's here's Pierce watch that
you don't agree just gonna say what it's
like it like it two hours ago you were
sitting on the other side of the fence
go ahead hi all right tell me a mighty
mice um i saw i was thinking back to how
screen resolutions have improved from
qvga vijay wvga 720p and i thought to
myself that the jump from 720p to 1080p
would enable something new to happen and
maybe some sort of new UI and then i
thought back to this evolution of screen
resolutions what has changed nothing
what has been what what's different now
is that you can see more detail in a
720p video what's changed is that icons
are so clear that you cannot see pixels
and there's a point at which we're more
pixels are overkill so I I agree that 10
1080p is going to be overkill except in
two situations one it's going to whoever
gets to market first is going to have a
fun marketing message to provide and
number two if the screen is large enough
and you're watching a 1080p movie and
you have good enough vision you're going
to see insane clarity that might be
marginally better than what you saw on a
720p screen but only if you have I think
better than 20 20 I slightly 2015 2013
which is actually very possible so it
that's what I think nice very good very
very balanced shot they're also well
under two minutes you guys are really
good at that at only saying what you
mean you know from from my part I'm not
going to take two minutes I'll just say
I think it's overkill but I I can live
at 800 x 480 I'm the worst person ask
this question to I would never ask me
about resolution stuff because I unless
i can see pixels with my naked eye
I'm just plenty plenty happy so that
just one short second i'm using the
Nokia 808 PureView as my daily driver
because I have to review the phone and
it has n HD resolution which is nakia
has 360 x 640 or something I don't think
I think it's that from the top of my
head yeah it's the standard for symbian
and you know what it looks good it's a
four inch screen it looks good I can see
pixels of course but I don't care about
pixels because I'm not holding the phone
up to my nose I'm holding it at 15 20
centimeters and at that distance is good
that's understand I understand exactly
what you're what you mean I know Brandon
does not agree i've got we're all
different it's lovely I don't agree I am
I must have had a lot beta carotene when
I was younger but my eyesight is
fortunately not going to what very very
good and so I can uh from a normal
viewing distance on a wvga screen i can
i can see pixels and you know I keeps
you up at night and it it really does um
it's you know it blah I don't know this
is now now you understand the late Steve
Jobs when he called up the google
executives saying that the yellow and
the google icon was not yellow enough
for Apple to use did that happen yeah i
think it's an anecdote which which
really happened wow you have to look
that up for it wasn't the biography
which I read it wait it wasn't it was in
them oh alright well we'll talk about it
next time we've got a we've gotta jet um
