pocketnow.com the HP beer is the
smallest smartphone on the planet it's
selling right now on AT&amp;amp;T for $50 in
your choice of black or white in this
video we're gonna talk about the
hardware on this tiny little cute phone
known as the veer 4G
let's get to it okay so before jumping
into hardware let's talk about
specifications we've got an 800
megahertz processor with 512 megabytes
of RAM that's certainly an upgrade from
the lower specs that you found on the
pixie and the pixie Plus which really
seemed like underpowered devices they
were slow when it came to multitasking
and web browsing they would ask off
often freeze which was quite annoying so
hopefully we get better results from the
veer 4G which is considered to be the
true true successor to the pixie and the
pixie plus we've got Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
HSPA+ for faster download speeds
category 10 which means in theory you
should be able to get fourteen point
four megabits per second down but of
course those are theoretical speeds you
probably can't get anywhere near that in
the real world we're going to talk about
speeds in an upcoming video we've got a
five megapixel camera on the back
unfortunately no flash back there which
is kind of annoying the screen is super
tiny 2.6 inches the resolutions 400 down
by 320 across and although this isn't
fair we're going to take out the samsung
galaxy s2 here which of course has a
screen much much larger 4.3 inches and
let's just flip these on real quick and
you're gonna get a sense for exactly how
these compare so I've actually got
pocket now loaded on both and click onto
that and obviously you're not going to
carry a phone with a large screen like
this next to a veer which has a tiny
screen you're just gonna have a veer
right so you're not gonna notice how
small the screen is unless you're
comparing side to side like this but you
can really get the sense for the
difference in screen size and also the
quality of the screen the the veer 4G
has an LCD panel whereas the galaxy s2 a
Super AMOLED plus so you don't get that
super great contrast but that really
wasn't a selling point of the veer 4G
they didn't claim to have
tremendously amazing screen the screen
is crisp and clear or talk more about it
in an upcoming video colors look good
contrast as good of course it's hard to
beat this the Galaxy S two's Super
AMOLED plus display so let's move that
away and move around the device and talk
about what we have and we also learned a
very important lesson about the vir 4G
you're going to talk about in a sec on
the side of the device here we've got
the volume up and down rocker kind of
nicely adorned in Chrome on the top
we've got a little lanyard loop and here
is the SIM card slot now you might be
thinking well isn't the SIM card slot
behind the battery cover well obviously
it's not it's on the top here and what
you have to do is Jam your finger in
there and you get to the SIM card slot
now a word of warning do not and I
repeat do not try to remove the back
battery cover on the veer 4G previous
palm devices or HP devices this case
palm-like the pixi had a removable
backing right so you can access the
battery get to everything back there and
even the pre 2 on AT&amp;amp;T you could pop off
the battery cover so that you can change
batteries if you want right you can
change the SIM card not the case with
the veer 4G if you try to remove the
back battery cover you're going to break
something like I did if we look over
here ouch
this piece very thin piece of plastic if
bent or mango the wrong way is going to
permanently Bend like that fortunately
this this blemish hasn't altered the
functionality of the device it still
works great but just a word of warning
for those of you thinking about getting
this device do not try to remove the
back battery cover I know a lot of
people don't read the user manual like
like me sometimes but just take that
warning seriously over here we've got a
silent switch which is nice it's been on
palm devices since the earliest pomme
smartphones very nice to have got the
nice power standby here in the upper
right corner and then this thing which
we just were looking at a second ago
there is no mini USB or micro USB port
on this device and there's also no 3.5
millimeter headphone jack what you have
to do is get this little adapter for a
3.5 millimeter and prick
Euler it sucks on there real easily kind
of annoying that you have to have this
extremity on the device and this doesn't
impact the slider by the way it just
slides nicely with it we'll talk about
the keyboard in a second it's just
annoying to have to remember an
accessory and it's pretty secure
although if you give it a little bit of
a twist it will eventually fall off
naturally and then the other part of
this is the power cables so you can't
charge with usual microUSB which is kind
of annoying last weekend I was away from
the office I didn't have this thing so
the the V or 4G went dead because I
couldn't charge it with my usual micro
USB cable so that snaps right on charges
the device the battery is about 900
milliamp hours and although that's small
it's enough to power the vir 4G for for
quite a while thanks to the small screen
and 800 megahertz processor so let's
take that off and keep moving around the
device again we've got the 5 megapixel
camera here with a speaker and no flash
HP branding no palm branding to be found
AT&amp;amp;T logo on the bottom and let's talk
about this keyboard the pixi had a
super-duper clicky keyboard which was
great
people really liked that and even though
the keys were super tiny I put a pen
next to it so you can see the keyboard
was very very usable and the same is the
case with the veer 4G and if we take out
the pre 2 I'm gonna pop that back
battery cover back on we can see that
the keyboards are basically identical in
terms of layout so all the buttons are
in the same place what's different is
that the keys on the beer 4G probably 20
to 30 percent smaller but again Palm
webOS devices are have very very usable
keyboards so if we go over it here it
just feels really good whether you big
hands are small hands just something
about the keyboard is really really good
and it makes a lot of sense to pack a
smaller keyboard in a smaller device
here so let's close that of course the
webOS device so we've got this
capacitive button here that'll take you
back to the home screen or you can use
it as a back button lots of other
functions like that too
we're gonna talk all about software in
an upcoming video build quality is very
good except for the fact that something
can break if you attempt to take off the
back battery cover
but to be fair if you read the user
manual you'll find out that that's not
how you get to the SIM card slot and
you're it's not meant to have a user
replaceable battery like all of the
other palm devices which is kind of
frustrating so overall very good build
quality feels good in hand has a good
weight and balance like all of the other
webOS devices that have the slide down
keyboard and unlike early webOS devices
which had problems with a slider the
veer forging was very very tight it
doesn't look like it's going to fatigue
after a long period of time
it's spring-assisted most of the way
what there goes and not that strong in
terms of spring of the spring systems
but pretty darn good so those look at
the hardware on the fear 4G it is tiny
it is small compared to other phones it
looks kind of ridiculous but if you're
looking for a small microphone with high
level of build quality this is a great
phone to get and we're going to talk all
about software and whether the higher
specs the faster processor the more RAM
really makes a difference in day-to-day
use so if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and if there's
something particular you want to see
about the HPV or 4G drop us a comment
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
