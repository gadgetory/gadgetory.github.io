fridge 2015 Google i/o event we hear
more details on when other flagship
smartphones you're getting lollipop and
that mystery Apple then changed to
include Tesla engineers and Nieman
scooby-doo I'm hi Mary vera and
celebrate with me we are three days away
from Friday this is Park it out daily
brought to you by lynda.com the official
news today I have to do mainly with
Google starting with google i/o the
company has already sent out press
invitations and we know that it will
happen on May 28 and 29 which is just a
couple of days away from WWDC now we
know that this is a the company's
developer conference as well we expect
to see the latest and greatest version
of Android here or at least some major
upgrade and you know also in conjunction
with other projects like hopefully the
feature of google glass stay tuned for
that and speaking of Google the company
really wants to double town on its
security up to the point where it's
willing to give me away something not
monetarily but the company is apparently
going to give you two gigabytes of free
google drive storage if you just go in
and update your security settings that's
all you have to do the promotion and all
the details are in the links of the
script you just follow them and hey two
gigabytes why not and raise your hands
how many of you are enjoying Android 5.0
lollipop on an AT&amp;amp;T modded device
because I just tweeted yesterday how
much I was enjoying it on my 1 of 8 from
t-mobile because my AT&amp;amp;T unit hasn't
gotten it yet nor my Moto X but the
company is apparently going to do
something different with the LG g3 a
users are already confirming that they
are receiving the firmware upgrade to
lollipop but the beware apparently those
that have are having issues with a
Google services apparently they're not
working stay tuned for that will keep
you posted but yeah I'll go downstairs
and get my g3 and hopefully get the
update and speaking of interesting
upgrades we have more details on the HTC
One m9 we still don't know if we're
dealing with decoys here but apparently
the company is investing in two
different things that are going to be
important for this phone first of all
the wireless chipset on this phone
apparently bring you better wireless
intensity which is a really good
considering the fact that the one inmate
what
really bad but I do personally notice
that it has far less reception than
other smartphones that are made of
aluminum and in addition to that
apparently the camera at the back sat
from being a larger 20 megapixel sensor
according to some rumors will apparently
be built by Toshiba and will give us
better image quality which is
interesting since a sony BSI sensors
have ruled the world here we don't know
why we're getting a change but stay
tuned why not let's see what this chivas
got to offer and finally for the very
interesting rumors of the day last week
we reported that there was this
interesting apple van it was an apple
least van with a lot of cameras at the
top and we thought it was that Apple
wanted to get its own street view but
reports claimed that Apple has been able
to interest as many as 50 former Tesla
engineers to come work at Apple and when
you get people from Tesla we're talking
about building a vehicle here apparently
these were focused on mechanics and
robotics so I don't think it has to do
anything with software it could it be
that Apple is working on its own smart
car whatever it wants to call it the I
car or whatever because hey Google is
working on its own self driving car as
well or it could just be that because
carp play has not really taken off it
could also be that apple also wants to
get some you know high-end folks to work
on that part as well because Tesla had a
really good one but it leads me to the
question of the day what would you
prefer an icar or better car play
because in my case I don't know I would
prefer both a car play on a replaceable
you know car dashboard you know car
stereo or a car why not but leave us a
comment down below what's your case and
folks have you ever wanted to learn how
to build your own application become a
pro photographer or hey even build a
cool video like this one there are

sponsor lynda.com slash pocket now
