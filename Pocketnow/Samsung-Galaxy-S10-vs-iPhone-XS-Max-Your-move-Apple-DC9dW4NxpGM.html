from Apple and Samsung go head-to-head
this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus up against
the iPhone 10's Macs before we get
started a quick shout-out to our sponsor
D brand they now have skins available
for the samsung galaxy s 10 plus and the
entire S 10 line but there's also a new
pattern called swarm which you can get
for any of the tech that you want to
give a completely different look you can
check out the links in the description
below to see the skins for yourself
clearly the designs of these two phones
will be familiar to anyone that used the
previous generations the biggest
difference in the galaxy s 10 plus from
the last iteration is a new ultrasonic
fingerprint reader within the display
and a couple new lenses on the front and
back the iPhone 10's max takes after the
previous iPhone 10 and is as the name
implies a bigger version of the iPhone
10 s I have the gold edition which while
you you tell me if it actually looks
gold to you for both of these devices
one-handed usage will be a little tough
but that is to be expected because these
are both big phones you do get a lot of
screen and bigger phones like these and
both displays are pretty great while the
resolution of the galaxy s 10 plus
screen is technically much higher than
that of its competitor that isn't to say
that the iPhone display is bad quality
or any less useful the Infinity o
display is an answer to all of the
notches that we saw in 2018 including
that of the iPhone 10s max as is the
case with all displays that sport either
of these choices the cutouts don't
necessarily get in the way of any
content unless you expand things like
YouTube videos at that point you either
have a hole in the corner or most of the
side is interrupted by the front camera
and the phone speaker
it used to be trendy to get mad at all
of these cutouts but after some time
with either phone people just kind of
get used to them I really applaud the SN
community for getting creative with the
hole in display I mean come on all of
these wallpapers that we're seeing these
days are just super fun to try out one
knock I do have to give the iPhone in
terms of its notch is the fact that you
have to swipe down from specific sides
in order to do the notification drop
down or the control center for a phone
that is already hard to use in one hand
having to reach for a specific corner
just makes it that much worse now if you
want to get as many features as possible
the galaxy s 10 plus fits that bill it
sports a headphone jack wireless and
reverse wireless charging expandable
storage and of course you have that
ultrasonic fingerprint reader
under the screen speaking of which a lot
of people were unhappy with the loss of
touch ID and the iPhones over the last
year though I have gotten used to it and
honestly face ID and face unlocking both
of these phones are something that I've
gotten used to using over the last year
or so now there is extra input on both
of these phones in the form of a Bigsby
button for the s10 and then the silenced
toggle on the iPhone but if I'm honest I
use the silenced toggle on here way more
than I ever use Bigsby on here but more
to the point I don't think I've ever
really found Syria all that useful
either on the topic of battery life
let's just put it this way the Galaxy S
10 plus has almost a thousand more
milliamp hours in its battery over the
iPhone Tenace max meanwhile I've
actually had to help someone with an
iPhone reverse wireless charge their
phone because they were down to single
digits on the spec sheets it obviously
seems that the Galaxy S 10 plus is that
many steps ahead of the iPhone but there
are different ecosystems at play here
the iPhone sports the latest Bionic a12
chip and four gigabytes of RAM that last
one might sound a little miniscule
compared to the eight or even twelve
gigabytes of RAM that you can get in the
S 10 plus but there's no questioning
that there's good performance in either
phone iOS is simply optimized for what
the iPhone 10s max provides and on the
flipside the galaxy s 10 plus is
uniquely equipped for every little
feature that Samsung bakes into its
version of Android Samsung one UI
one UI is a very welcome next step in
Samsung's version of Android and it
manages to provide a lot of useful
features that maybe you will never use
but at the very least it doesn't bog
down the core experience of Android but
there aren't extras you might want to
try out like Samsung's own version of
full screen gestures that work basically
like the three button nav bar I prefer
that over the full screen gestures that
started with the iPhone 10 and then
found their way to some versions of
Android since then this is all in
contrast to iOS where basically what you
see is what you get Android fans will
lament the lack of widgets no app drawer
and the lack of customization options
but I know a lot of people out there who
prefer it that way
to have an experience that just works
Samsung doesn't fail in this regard it
just adds so many layers on top of the
already solid core experience finally
the cameras the Galaxy S 10 plus is the
most stacked camera not only in this
comparison but even in its own lineup
three on the rear with a wide-angle
camera that I'm personally super happy
to have and then two on the front which
adds in a depth sensor
next to the selfie camera that depth
sensor helps with front-facing portrait
shots much in the same way that the face
ID technology helps the iPhone achieve
portrait lighting effects and also helps
with an emojis self portraits strictly
are pretty comparable here with both
phones using HDR to good effect details
are pretty good and the portrait cutouts
are generally well done even if there
are still issues with certain lines like
my glasses where the galaxy sn+ really
ups the ante is in 4k video recording
which makes it a viable tool for selfie
videos and vlogging shooting with the
rear cameras is a different affair as it
is easy to argue that the galaxy s 10
plus provides way more options that
wide-angle lens is a fun addition one
that maybe Apple will add in one day but
I don't find pictures from one or the
other being really leaps and bounds
better so it just matters which one
provides the different features you want
I will say though that the smart HDR on
the iPhone 10's max is seriously
impressive especially an evening out
pretty much any scene but if you want to
have a little more contrast and also a
little bit more saturation the s10 might
be the way to go
now here's a development that just
happened pretty recently in a nod to the
social media junkies out there samsung
has finally rolled out the Instagram
mode that ties right into the platform
if you're an IG person this is a big
deal because you originally had to use
the main camera to use the phone's
features and then import it into the
Instagram app now you can use the wide
angle or the telephoto press for picture
or hold for video and when you're done
it goes right into the editor in
Instagram it might not seem like much
but for avid social media people every
little bit counts this is a step further
than the square moat which itself was an
apple move toward the Instagram audience
again what you see is what you get in
the iPhone 10's max the galaxy has 10
plus does the same but gives you a ton
more that you can enjoy if you choose to
one thing I do want to touch on real
quick is the price the iPhone 10s max
still is one of the most expensive
smartphones out there right now which
made it all the more surprising that
Samsung priced every one of the phones
in the S 10 line pretty competitively
you can actually save a couple hundred
dollars if you go for the samsung galaxy
s 10 plus and you get a lot more in it
when compared to the iPhone 10s max just
on paper but of course your experience
is going to dictate which one of these
speaks more to you as far as what comes
next Sam song has definitely put down
the gauntlet and now Apple it's your
move but with that I'm gonna go ahead
and call it on this one thank you so
much for watching get into the comment
sections and let's have those
discussions about these two phones and
also if you want to see even more
footage from this particular phone you
can head over to my channel where I used
the Galaxy S ten plus as a vlogging
machine for an entire day out in Los
Angeles you can subscribe to my channel
as well youtube.com slash drove a car
and then come right back here to
subscribe to pocket now for even more
and from there thank you so much once
again and we'll see you in our next
