click on it good this is something
really important we need to discuss
about the current implementation of
android battery optimization something
that's been driving me absolutely crazy
and using the LGB 20 of late has been
the really austere battery optimizations
found in the more recent build of
Android starting with marshmallow and
then getting even more aggressive on
nougat as we await battery technology to
evolve to keep up with our current daily
lifestyles we're employing a number of
different tricks to keep our mobile
devices powered throughout the day for
examples newer versions of fast charging
like the supercharger on the mate knife
maybe we really can't get the phone to
run longer per amp but for those times
you do need to plug it in maybe we can
abbreviate the amount of time you need
to keep it connected to a charger the
other side of the equation addresses
software
how do absent services relate to battery
drain especially those apps running in
the background and that's where battery
optimization can go and take a running
leap into a toxic dumpster fire I'm
being really cheeky about this and there
are some things that battery
optimization does well like reining in
those runaway apps that keep waking your
phone up and utilizing the CPU times
they don't really need to be
unfortunately what I've been finding in
my usage of phones like the LG B 20 on
Android 7.0 nougat I don't seem to be
getting any better battery longevity and
those services that I rely on to stay
alive in the background of my phone just
seem to be getting interrupted a very
specific example would be Netflix I'm
really trying to convince my wife to
just fully cut the cord and get rid of
what's left of our cable package we've
been streaming a lot of content through
chromecast to our TV and the way that
chromecast alerts every single phone on
your network to what's playing and
allows them to control what's playing
I'll have to rant about in a separate
editorial Netflix and chromecast a
perfect example a battery optimization
run amok where after about two episodes
of sitcom this management software has
killed Netflix running in the background
obviously I'm not using it so I don't
need it and then if we go to pause or
play something different or just fire up
anything else we have to go through that
dance of reinitializing the phone with
the chromecast over the network and that
interaction just takes so much longer so
much more screen on time closing apps
reopening apps that I can't believe I've
actually
saved battery in the long run and this
has been happening more often with a
number of services I rely on mostly
those services which connect to other
pieces of equipment like my car
management software which connects to a
plugin to the car computer and it's over
a Bluetooth connection and then I'll
finish a long drive and find that my
phone didn't actually properly track all
the information I wanted it to
going back to phones like the otter
eight huawei's custom software for
managing the battery was obnoxiously
aggressive about shutting everything off
in the background now on the main nine
they've actually kind of loosened the
leash up a little bit there's still a
ton of resource management happening and
I'm not sure I believe always claims
about machine learning really impacting
performance over time but I find fewer
apps are just cut off at the knees when
you minimize them from your screen and
of course googles darling the pixel XL
just seems to handle background services
much more gracefully ironically enough I
forgot to charge my pickle before
shooting this video so getting back to
my v20 and you all should know by now
what a big fan I am of this phone but
this behavior from LG has become
extremely irritating out of the box
there's very little to alert the users
to what's going on with their power
management fire up a game and it's
performing really poorly and then you
dig into those battery settings and you
see there's a game optimizer mode and it
takes some time to even find where those
battery optimization settings live and
then the process of manually green
lighting or bypassing those settings so
that certain apps aren't killed in the
background and that's all provided that
the consumer even cares that much to do
that deep of an investigation I think we
know plenty of people in our social
circles who would use something like
this for a short period of time declare
it not good battery and then just swap
it for something else which seems to
work better I know a lot of y'all are
going to be frustrated by me saying this
but I don't have these kinds of issues
when I pick up an iPhone 7 plus so folks
we want to hear from you back in the
early days of Android we all tried to
walk away from those app cleaners and
app managers all expecting that Android
would actually do a better job of
managing this stuff and now Android is
sort of building these types of features
control and management software directly
into the operating system is this the
right way to help us manage our battery
life or should there be better
notifications and better alerts to users
as to what's going on with their power
and drop us a comment down below those
are the kinds of conversations I love
getting in
- as always thanks so much for watching
