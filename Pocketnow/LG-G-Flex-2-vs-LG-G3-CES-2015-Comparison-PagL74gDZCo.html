to last year's model but is it
compelling enough to threaten LG's
reigning flagship let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now with
jaime rivera behind the camera and this
is LG G flex 2 versus LG g3 brought to
you by al key in some ways the new flex
looks like somebody sat on a g3 for a
long time it's got the same sharp edges
the same rear key the same sized screen
just with a slight curve of course the
differences do run deeper than that and
they're both good and bad for the G flex
2 but mostly good on the bad side the
newer phones curve means it's display is
lower resolution than the g3 s Full HD
instead of quad HD that means 135 fewer
pixels every inch which is significant
but remember that these are only five
and a half inch screens unless you're
really in need of super high resolution
you probably won't notice plus the PIO
LED technology on the G flex 2 means
there's no backlight straining to punch
through a dense pixel matte so the Flex
probably won't overheat as readily as
the g3 on maximum brightness almost
everywhere else the G flex 2 comes out
on top at least in theory
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 instead of an
801 50 percent more RAM on some models
and microSD expansion up to 2 terabytes
and because the new phone is a flex
model it's got the new and improved
self-healing coating on the back plus
cover glass that's 20% stronger than
Gorilla Glass 3 in the front you won't
find either on the g3 software
differences are minor and mainly revolve
around improvements to the selfie camera
and a new glance screen on the Flex both
might come to the g3 eventually but even
if neither one does it won't make much
difference
then there's the Flex part the g3 isn't
an uncomfortable phone by any means but
the G flex 2 takes it up a notch with a
700 radius curve that feels great
against the face or in a back pocket if
you bend it it'll quickly spring back to
shape and it looks like something from
the future
in comparison the g3 is nice
looking but lots more understated all
this might mean the G flex 2 comes out
with a higher price tag which might be a
black mark if you're looking to save
money and if you don't care about a
curved design or a self-healing coating
or the absolute best processor out there
hey the g3 continues to be a great phone
but the Chi flex 2 definitely brings
more special sauce in a refined body
that's guaranteed to turn some heads
we'll find out more when we have a
chance to give it a full review and this
is just a first look remember but for
now but we'll just say we know which one
gets us more excited this comparison is
brought to you by the AL key USB car
charger adapter with AI power the most
powerful car charger at the smallest
size in the world
ai power technology intelligently
detects input current to maximize both
compatibility and charging speed up to
2.4 amps each port with overheat over
current and overcharging protection and
48 watt 9.6 amp output the alkies car
charger can simultaneously charge for
tablets or for smartphones at full speed
it's easy to use and compatible with
Apple Android and most other USB
charging devices so hey charge up
