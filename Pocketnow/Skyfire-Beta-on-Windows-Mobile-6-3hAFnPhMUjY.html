it's connecting through Wi-Fi
and here's the start page you see a row
of icons at the top unlabeled so we
don't really know what they do the
bottom right we see a menu tap that we
got a menu some options let's try
clicking on one of these websites
to that work we don't know
seems to be doing something
not really it's no stop button
also note there's no Start menu so I
can't multitask there's no minimize
button so I can't close this and go to
another program so no cloth there's no
connection status so I'm going to know
if I'm connected there's no volume
control if I press buttons hardware
button start menu doesn't work ok button
doesn't work power button doesn't work
and this seems to be stuck
now it's loading something
there we go you can see the whole page
is some doubt and some possible to
reading these things let's go to
however YouTube does work
my audio must be off but you can see the
video is playing panting doesn't seem to
be very good
difficult to get the video interview
maybe if we zoom out
let's go to different page
so here's another feature that should be
turned on by default and doesn't stay on
the smart fit option to do this it will
reload the page and there we go it
reacts the type into an area that will
fit in your zoom we can zoom there we go
so now this is much easier to read
there's no scroll bar so I can't exactly
jump to the bottom of page or and I
can't flick it just have to move it
manually by panning
you can see it loads the page is pixels
so that the painting is quicker and then
renders the rest of it as you that's the
bandwidth allows
pressing the refresh button actually
zooms out all the way it's kind of a
well maybe not so quick but an easier
way to see the whole page again
entering addresses you type you press
this button and then you see the address
bar down here and since the lower bar is
a non-standard user interface we have no
way of choosing different keyboards so
say I'd type something it doesn't
actually put it into the address bar so
that's a really work there's also no tap
and hold menu so I can't paste the URL
here I can't copy the URL so it's kind
of limited and what you can do with this
there's also an option
drag controls now I just turn that on
but you didn't see anything happen so
when I drag this toolbar comes up if I
select the arrow now my dragon will
select text but still there's no tap and
hold button there's nothing I can do
with it there's no copy there's a pace
so nothing i can do that button
collapses the menus so you can see the
whole page without any administrative
debris however I will kind of prefer
some debris user interface elements that
I can switch applications with because
right now I can't multitask well I guess
that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
