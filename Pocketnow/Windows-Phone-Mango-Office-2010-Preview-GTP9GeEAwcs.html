and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview okay so what's new with
office first off before we go into the
office of you'll see that I've pinned a
lifestyle here called new note so that's
going to be quick easy access to make a
new one note notes that's pretty cool
thing so let's go the office hub and
this has been redesigned a bit we get
the notes first they're all different
color now and they scroll vertically
instead of horizontally and down here we
have all notebooks is there and this is
how you make that new button on the
start menu pin to start and we have a
search this is going to search the
titles of all your OneNote notebooks on
SkyDrive and SharePoint really cool
feature especially if you have a ton ton
of notes holy cow so there we are before
we go let's check out there's my test
note so this is going to show you what
is supported in OneNote mobile okay so
up here I have some ink notes and you
can see those do not display here are
some embedded documents it shows up as
attachments and I can tap it it's going
to say do you want to download it so I
can get that and those will open just
fine here's a table that's sporting
checkboxes are now supported ray
numbered list still supported links to
other one note pages that doesn't work
there's some ink am writing movie test
videos work
that works fine
and audio audio recordings from one note
2010 work fine and answer pictures
equations math stuff doesn't happen
shape drawings show up kind of weird so
there's what is supported we've added
some things that's good still missing
some things now in editing we can now
add to do check marks that's good
pictures and audio still there indenting
and formatting is very simple here so
the slight upgrade to OneNote not bad
over here are documents now you can see
these show up as kind of live tile type
things now and what's unique tap and
hold pin to start i can now pin all
sorts of office documents to the Start
menu so this is great for quick access
to something you're working on of course
you can remove it
and PDFs show up here but you cannot pin
PDFs to the Start menu I can open it
though so there's those there's your new
button here's your search button this is
going to search all your office
documents you can choose all that's
going to go to SkyDrive and SharePoint
or you can choose just SkyDrive or you
can choose just own or just your point
and this will this will search filenames
not the contents of the files but still
pretty nice to have searched there
especially cloud search now here's your
locations pain this is the last painting
the office hub down here you can choose
you can add a new location that's for
more sharepoint locations but by default
you got your SkyDrive associated with
your phone account so you can only have
one and you can see shared folders as
well so these are folder is shared by
other people and you can even see some
of these folders are being shared with
other people
easy access there's a video i have on
SkyDrive but what happens when I tap it
and goes to internets forward first of
all which is weird and it says error so
it doesn't stream or download my video
from Sky Drive hopefully that'll be
fixed ooh one thing that was kind of
knowing it I hit the back button I was
expecting to go back to the root of the
SkyDrive but you have to use this up
button instead
so there you go here's a SharePoint site
and this hasn't changed much if I go to
these libraries and still plain text I
can't do anything with it
pictures library doesn't show up here
tasks you can't do anything with really
it's only for accessing document
libraries so there's a SharePoint
document library
now what about some of these Office
programs let's check out excel this has
some new stuff you can now select
multiple cells and
we have Otto some features and we have
filtering
and we have formula editing
look at all that stuff lots of fun Excel
features
of course we still have commenting and
there's some of your other stuff we have
save as and you can choose phone or
SkyDrive no sharepoint I don't know if
that's a bug or it's coming okay there's
some cool stuff in Excel
PowerPoint seems mostly the same
so that's still good
and here's a word document yeah fine so
you can do quick search
but oh no cannot edit word 97-2003
documents I hope that's a bug
there's a newer word document so that's
fine for editing and we don't really
have that much options for editing but
it's okay
these are all notes and this is showing
all of the notebooks OneNote notebooks
on my SkyDrive so I don't have to go to
the web and navigate SkyDrive through
the web interface and find it anymore
they're all listed here automatically so
that's really great so there's the new
office hub lots of great new features be
sure to check out pocketnow.com for our
full windows phone mango preview and
that's it for now
