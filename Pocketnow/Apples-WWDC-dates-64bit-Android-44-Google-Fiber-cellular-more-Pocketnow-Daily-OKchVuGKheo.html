event until cooks up its first 64-bit
kernel to support Android 4.4 KitKat and
as Google's next frontier to become a
cell phone carrier I'm hi Mary better
and I think Google's final frontier
would be to become an airline right this
is parking out daily as always let's
begin today with what's official is
Apple has just sent out confirmations of
WWDC 2014 it's happening from June
second to the sixth and the keynote from
Tim Cook is definitely gonna happen on
the second but the question is what are
we getting we're expected to get iOS 8
at this event though we're not sure if
that's gonna be the final name and we
are hoping that the iphone 6 will be
announced here though rumors say
September but as I can let the most
interesting launch that could happen at
this event would be the i watch as they
do need to explain to developers what to
do with it so that could be the case now
let's are about Intel as the company has
just built it's for 64-bit kernel
running on Android 4.4 KitKat which is
actually the other way around they
actually built a specific cook the
version of KitKat that supports its new
Intel Atom processor it's really
interesting as we have been waiting for
64-bit chips on Android for the longest
time and so far there's been a lot of
talk but we haven't really seen
something like this until now the speed
Intel's new push into actually gaining
traction in the smartphone market as
they tried so bad and they haven't
really gotten anywhere now it's all
about Samsung is we get the first leaks
of the Samsung Galaxy s5 zoom but
actually got the name wrong it's not the
name the leakers saying that this is the
Galaxy K zoom and we don't really
understand what they mean with that K
could it be camera badly spelled or what
but apparently this will not be a galaxy
s device and the question is exactly
what are we getting here as this does
look like a smartphone and not like a
camera necessarily and again like
subscription for full details on what we
saw I also about Windows Phone as
yesterday was definitely Microsoft day
we had everything you can think of
pertaining Windows Phone 8.1 windows 8.1
new notegive devices etc but the
question is exactly when are we getting
windows phone 8.1
as they didn't specify dates they just
said the summer but apparently the
developer build will be ready in the
second or third week of April they
didn't really specify when in april but
late april so stay tuned as once that
developer build is in the market then it
should be only a matter of weeks after
that and folly for the very interesting
news of the day we get some new rumors
that google might want to become a cell
phone carrier I mean they do maps they
do phone calls they do almost everything
so why not a cell phone carrier and as
it turns out the company is considering
doing this in the cities that they have
google fiber and people that have Google
Fiber know how great it is so apparently
they want to do it there but as an mvno
using another carriers bandwidth which
is really interesting since if we want
more speeds than we would definitely not
use other carriers or I don't know
exactly what Google plans to do but at
least you say the question of the day if
Google would become a cell phone carrier
would you want to use it but my
particular case I would say why not i
mean i've seen Google Fiber do crazy
things so I mean that would be a great
option but leave us a comment down below
