today I've got a first-hand look of the
new amazon mp3 store with cloud player
that lets you sync and play your music
from the amazon cloud let's go take a
look perhaps trying to stem off the
forthcoming google music player with
cloud sync we still won't know exactly
what it's going to be called but that'll
suffice for now amazon has upgraded
their amazon mp3 app which before just
let you purchase mp3s from the amazon
store well now you can play them and you
can also play them through what's
calling their cloud player now this app
is available for upgrade or for initial
download in the android market but it's
also available through the Amazon App
Store as well you can go out and get
that for free today now you're probably
familiar with the store where you can go
out and buy stuff but let's go ahead and
walk through a purchase will hit this
and let's say I want to search for
somebody that I just found yesterday on
pandora haley westerner or western rah
Westenra i don't know how to pronounce
her name exactly but that'll do and
let's come down here and say you know
what i want to come over to albums
instead of songs you can purchase
individual tracks usually for about
ninety nine cents or you can come in and
purchase albums that vary anywhere from
a couple bucks all the way up to 10 or
20 so let's go ahead and grab Odyssey
it's going to cost us nine dollars 49
cents when we do that the button changes
from the price into a Buy button go
ahead and do that now it's going to ask
for my password I'm going to do that off
camera and we'll see what the rest of
the purchase experience is like so with
that I've logged in and now I've got a
couple options I can either save this to
my device or something new is I can save
this to my amazon cloud drive and that's
really what I'd like to show you the the
Amazon Cloud Drive lets you have by
default five gig of storage that you can
basically upload your
your music collection into now a lot of
you are saying hey five gigs not that
much I've got an SD card that's bigger
than five gig and so do i but when you
make a purchase and you can see I just
got my purchase notification by email
when you make a purchase through the the
amazon mp3 store of an album that's
upgraded to its kind of spotty but it
looks like an additional 20 or it could
be 20 gig in total so the unfortunate
thing is that does know that the app
that are the the music that you just
purchased does count against that so
it's a little bit frustrating there i'd
like to see anything that you purchase
through the mp3 store be you know
outside of that now says i need to go to
the amazon cloud player or continue
shopping so let's go ahead and go to the
amazon cloud player which is right back
here inside the amazon mp3 app and I now
looks like i have the have the album
here let's go ahead and play track one
it gives you a message about streaming
from the cloud that it's going to adjust
the it's not going to adjust the bit
rate it's going to stream at the
original audio quality which could be a
good thing or a bad thing obviously if
you're on a low speed connection like
edge that might impede your playability
it says also hear that you stream using
3G 4G or Wi-Fi that's kind of obvious to
minimize playback interruptions or you
can also download it to the device and
play offline you're responsible for any
data use its incurred yada yada yada
okay let's not show that anymore choose
ok and then we've got this nice little
streaming indicator and it starts
playing almost immediately and you can
see here it's streaming pretty quickly
I'm already halfway streamed through the
song itself and only nine seconds in so
we don't get in trouble from the the
music labels will go ahead and pause
that but very quick very easy you know I
like that that feature in functionality
let's go ahead and go back we can now
have this nice little player down at the
them if we we want to pick another song
let's go ahead and choose that one I
haven't heard that one before and again
it starts streaming it in it takes about
five seconds to start streaming before
it starts playing and then over here
this is Wi-Fi and it's a pretty decent
Wi-Fi connection it looks like it's
playing very very quickly and easily if
we go to the next track we've got that
same initial pause now what I want to
find out here is after you've streamed
this entirely is there that initial
pause before it starts playing the next
track so since you don't want to listen
to do a whole bunch of this stuff let me
do that off camera we'll get right back
to it so we're approaching the end of
this track it's four minutes 39 seconds
long on a word about 428 right now and
what I'm going to show you here is how
it handles changing from one track which
is streamed to the next track which
hasn't streamed in yet so we're right at
the end of this song and right away it
starts playing that it looks like it's
it's pre cashed the next song which is
great that means you're not going to
have any hiccups or hesitations between
the end of one song in the beginning of
the next so very cool up here when it's
playing you also have this little drop
down so you can get direct access back
to that if you want to go and read your
email or do something else when you
pause that that goes away so overall I'm
really impressed on there are some
settings that you can go into you can
sign out submit a claim code opt into
only downloading over Wi-Fi clear some
caches yada yada yada we can go into our
delivery preferences which we set
earlier in this case we're saving our
purchases to our cloud drive now this
lets us stream them from any cloud drive
enabled device so your desktop player
your android phone and whatever comes in
the future I don't believe there's an
iOS version that lets you play from your
cloud drive yet but I'm sure that will
be coming before terribly long and of
course you've got your streaming
preferences and I'm going to stream this
over any connection type versus over
just Wi-Fi or just 3g cellular and Wi-Fi
so any connection type it's going
work I also can refresh the cloud drive
now this is kind of interesting I
thought this would happen automatically
and maybe it does but if I go out and
make some purchases from my desktop
computer in my laptop save it to my
cloud drive there then this is
automatically going to check every 10
minutes if I want to update manually I
can do that so there's no real push
notification it's more of a time to go
out and check whenever this app is open
so a little bit of room for improvement
but overall for for initial an initial
impression here I really really like
what you can do with the new features
and functionalities being able to play
directly from your cloud drive right
here it's very seamless they've really
nailed the the purchase experience down
so I'm impressed go ahead and give it a
try it's amazon mp3 store now these are
mp3s which means they are not drm
protected which means you are free to
listen to them on any device that
supports mp3s which is fabulous more
people should do that you know so that's
a kind of a poke in the eye out to zune
and a night so excuse me go out and grab
it it's an update to the amazon mp3 app
and it's very well worth your while it's
a shot across the bow for google who is
going to be releasing something similar
that we're kind of calling google music
they have some initial bits out there in
the honeycomb devices that we've seen
there also some apks for the the new
google music player that's that have
been floating around a little bit with
people having mixed results being able
to play them or not but amazon beat them
to the punch and i think they nailed it
they did a fabulous job we want to know
what you think do you like mp3s over drm
protected tunes if you were to buy stuff
from the amazon mp3 store would you buy
it and download it to your device or
which also includes your computer or
would you just save it into your cloud
drive is 20 gigabytes big enough do they
need to up that two more is this
something where you're willing to sink
your existing music up to your new
Amazon Cloud Drive we want to know this
let us know down in
comments below if you have any
experience is good bad or indifferent
also let us know that of course if you
like seeing these first hand looks at
new apps and new features and
functionality give this video a thumbs
up for Pocket Nell I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
