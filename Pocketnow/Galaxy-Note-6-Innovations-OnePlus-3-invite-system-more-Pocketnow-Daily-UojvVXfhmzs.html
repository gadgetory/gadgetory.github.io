Irish scanner and more RAM that you can
think of one plus three reports also
claim that an invite system isn't going
away and if you brick your ipad pro 9.7
you're entitled to something free from
Apple I'm hi Mary vera and I will be
traveling for the next two weeks
starting with Shanghai but I will try to
figure out a way to get to the news even
though getting google services in China
as a nightmare this is pocket out daily
my official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for an iphone
6s or an iPhone 6s plus Sprint is
probably the carrier you want to visit
the company is now offering a buy one
get one free deal with the iphone and it
extends up to the point of the iphone 6s
plus even though you're getting the
smaller iPhone as the other option but
you still get to iphone 6s as if you
want to as well and you can get more
information on links in the description
and speaking of apples some interesting
developments come from iOS 9.3 points to
the cape to fix the whole itunes issued
leading your songs it's bricked a ton of
ipad pro 9.7 inch devices yes i didn't
update vine and it turns out that these
devices were not able to be fixed up to
the point where all you have to do is go
to an apple store and get a replacement
if you're not able to restore it you can
get more information in the description
because of yeah it seems that i think
that's like the worst case of a software
update ever for you to need to go for an
exchange and we've been reading the
comments a lot of people have been
asking when as project are going to see
the light of day we've been waiting
already two years google just teased it
today with a video showing us that it
only got uglier and bulkier but it seems
closer to be ready for production
they're teasing it more for teenagers
which is interesting and well those of
you that are wondering if it's going to
be tested or what there are 30 people
within the project are a team that are
already using as their daily driver but
there is no word on price points or
anything or a release date and for those
of you that are in the market waiting
for the one plus three the good news is
that the phones coming we've seen a ton
of leaks the bad thing is the
to have according to some internal
sources that invite system that we all
despise is apparently going to continue
it seems that one plus continues to have
trouble being able to meet demand and
with all the leaks that we've seen of
the one plus three these just point to a
very very hot device to come let's just
see if it lives up to the hype for the
need of those invitations man and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note
six as we've got some very credible
sources inside Samsung that are claiming
that two things are coming six gigabytes
of RAM which would mean that the
Snapdragon e23 will probably be in tow
even though we know the 820 can push
these but also the Irish scanner
apparently samsung plants to make a big
deal about this and we wonder exactly
how Samsung plans to pull it off given
the fact that whatever else we've seen
using iris scanners is extremely
sluggish and even though reliable
sluggish is the problem which leads me
to the question of the day you know I've
seen a ton of people out there that have
a fingerprint scanner on their phones
and they still use passwords so are you
of the type of people that has a
smartphone with a fingerprint scanner
and doesn't use it would you be using
this iris scanner or not leave us a
comment down below I am the type that
uses it a lot friends you know the way
it goes if you want to get these news
