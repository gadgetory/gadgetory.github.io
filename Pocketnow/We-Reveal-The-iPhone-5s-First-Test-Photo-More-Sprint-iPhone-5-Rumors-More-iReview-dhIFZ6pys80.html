photo pre-orders have already begun for
the next generation iphone and the
sprint iphone 5 rules and rumor mill all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi I'm Adam event and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show we go through all this week school
and they're not so cool inside the world
of Apple's iOS devices the shark this
week off with the cool well the hottest
iphone 5 news this week actually came
from us this may look to you like a
typical sushi bowl but in fact it's an
image that was cropped to make you
believe that it was taken on an iPhone 4
and we were able to confirm that it was
in fact taken with an 8 megapixel camera
instead of a 5 and hey it was also taken
at one infinite loop cupertino
california so it's definitely confirmed
that the image was taken in the apple
campus according to its location data
now what's even most interesting here is
that the image sensor that took the
camera was a 4.3 millimeter image sensor
that actually looks more or less like a
point-and-shoot sensor than your current
smartphone image sensor that we find
currently the iphone 4 has a three point
eight millimeter lens and hey does a
really good job at taking photos so
imagine what we could expect from the
next generation iphone 5 we're expecting
dates expecting rumors so far the image
shows that the device is real that it's
coming the specs are actually really
good and speaking of the next iphone
rumors and continuing on with our
coverage of last week's leak of the
front facing panel for the n 94
prototype of an iphone we were also able
to confirm that iOS 5 beta brings the
FCC ID of the next generation and
ninety-four device designator so our
biggest bet is that this will be simply
an iphone 4 with less storage probably
or hopefully Apple will come up with
something different in design but
remember most probably we will get the
iphone 4 in design for the cheap version
of the iphone and then Apple will use
the n93 prototype moniker at least for
the next generation iphone 5 time will
tell now it seems that sprint has made
more iphone 5 news than any other
carrier lately in on one hand we have a
leaked memo that mentions and this is
within sprint that the iphone will be
released on the first half of October
and then aside from that we have another
post of a Best Buy document that
mentions that spring will be getting the
iphone early October so they do match up
now interesting enough the new coolest
news is having the iPhone 5 or 4 on an
unlimited data plan network because
sprint author said so rumors have it
that spring quill drive sales of the
next-generation iphone through unlimited
data so it does seem that things are
coming well though we still don't really
know what to make a wimax I don't really
see Apple bringing LTE wimax or even a
4g phone right now rumors have it that
that will come until 2012 but again
rumors and well believe it or not
Deutsche Telekom and i hope i pronounced
that right it's just begun accepting
pre-orders for the iphone 5 but nobody
has even announced according to their
spokesperson they've been done doing
this just to avoid being under stock but
when the phone is released obviously
they're not guaranteeing any release
states are even getting out the name of
the device that nobody even has but
they're handing out coupons and hoping
for the best justice everybody else is
now but this be a rumor that points out
to a probable release of the iPhone
everybody's crossing their fingers not
really sure what to make of it on the
software release side Apple has just
released iTunes 10.5 beta 8 for
developers which seems to enhance iTunes
Match though it's interesting that Apple
is not releasing an iOS 5 beta 8 that
goes along with it and well rumors have
it that Apple even release the version
that's already approved for carriers to
begin testing the next generation iphone
and apparently some carriers already
habits but interesting enough the most
important part is that apparently it
brings the new ones speech the text
technology that everybody's talking
about for the next generation device so
interesting enough hopefully that will
be good news now google also seems to be
all over the software front for iOS
devices they've just released an html5
version of google music service and we
all know why that had to go html5 and
not obviously on iowa's itself but you
know aside from that they also release
an application for bloggers that a lot
of people were waiting for
and they even offered more enhancements
for Google+ in their application in a
new release that they just sent out now
Facebook application already got an
update recently and apparently this was
a dramatic overhaul but I'm still
waiting to see it I don't find anything
improved I just see that it's slower and
before we get to the not-so-cool section
guess what adobe is preparing a new
flash server software that brings flash
video to iOS the problem here is that
obviously this tool depends on websites
and services considering that they're
open to provide the tool or not it's up
to them so hopefully they will adopt it
but the problem is remember that already
skyfire brings a sort of engine that
works like this and it doesn't really
deliver so hopefully these guys can
figure it out but again Adobe it's I
mean why don't you just figure something
out because I know Adobe Flash could
work on iOS if you probably just worked
on your own engine on your own
okay so that does it for the cool let's
continue on with the not so cool we were
all excited about a recent leak that we
were able to pull up an iphone 5
screenshot that offered 64 gigabytes of
storage on the about section and
everything else just screamed iphone 5
but it ended up being a hoax sadly a
gentleman from Fort Worth Texas called
Richard women was the one that created
this and well first of all Thank You
macrumors for pointing it out and second
of all I mean shame on you Richard I
mean why are you playing with
everybody's emotions people have been
waiting for this device since June I
mean don't play around buddy not so cool
that's a fair today show thank you very
much for watching I'm high metal iveta
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
