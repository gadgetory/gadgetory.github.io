some winter weather the nokia lumia icon
arrived in my office in this giant
Pelican case why don't we get it out of
the case and out of the box I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
Nokia Lumia icon uncasing so what we
have here is the Nokia Lumia icon for
Verizon and as you can see it came to us
in this giant sturdy heavy Pelican box
we're not sure why we don't really care
why it's just awesome that's all we know
and as you can see it also has icon
they are branded on the front so I don't
know why this exists why it had to come
to us like this but I'm not complaining
because this is awesome it's a new
experience it's different and it's not
just like unboxing any other phone
that's probably why they did this but
without too much delay let's get inside
this awesome case and see what it's
about
yeah if you flip it open you got this
nice red glow that's awesome but you
also have this paperwork here this is
just some standard stuff to tell us
about the phone the Nokia Lumia icon on
Verizon tells us what we've already been
hearing for ages now that it has a 20
megapixel PureView camera 5-inch 1080p
display and a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
Krait 400 cpu that is part of the
Snapdragon 800 chipset inside it also
has 32 gigs of storage which that's not
on here and that's to get 2 gigabytes of
RAM and awesome awesome other things to
boot it's one of the most high-end
Windows Phone devices we've seen
especially for Verizon also just to
clear the rest of specs out of the way
it also has a twenty four twenty
milliamp hour battery so let's get this
out of the way and see what this is all
about so here's the handset that's
awesome we're gonna move to the side of
course and see what else is under here
get to know your phone product safety
warranty guide that is your SIM card and
your two other things that is gonna be
your AC brick your power brick as well
as a microwave you micro USB cable for
gene so standard stuff there you also
get these Nokia purity pro wireless
headphones as well so they've got NFC
embedded as well as user controls and
this nice case and we've also got some
plexiglass down here so yeah actually
down here we also have a wire in case
you don't want to listen to them
wirelessly power brick for AC power
product information guide and under here
we have a micro USB cable so standard
stuff there awesome that it includes
these headphones I want to check them
out I had the original purities not the
purity pros but I definitely want to
check these out and see how the wireless
sounds but let's get all of this put
aside this awesome case out of the way
it's a giant case which doesn't fit in a
view and let's take a look at what we're
really here for the phone itself the
nokia lumia icon on Verizon and this is
one of the first really truly high-end
windows phones on a CDMA carrier and
that's awesome we haven't really seen
anything to this caliber or degree on
something like Verizon or or Sprint here
in the US and that's awesome we've been
waiting for something like this for a
while now so as you can see here the
hardware is very stark and bold and
squared and industrial and I like that I
think Michael probably will as well and
as I said earlier this is a 5-inch 1080p
ClearBlack display so we're happy to see
1080p and we're gonna power at home
while we do this little hardware tour as
well if you take a look at the bottom
all you have on the bottom here as well
as some branding is a micro USB port on
the side you have a camera shutter key
power button the volume rocker the top
is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack as
well as a SIM slot which you can
actually just pop open with your finger
it looks like maybe I can't get to that
but we'll do that later and this side is
completely clear and black then you have
your speaker port here on the bottom
which is nice and big as well as the 20
megapixel PureView camera so this thing
looks awesome it feels very heavy and
sturdy in the hand
and it is powered up let's get started
and see if we can skip through this I
can't remember if you can skip through
without a sim so this thing is actually
running Windows Phone 8 the Nokia Lumia
black update but I don't think it's
actually gonna power on right now or
power up or activate because the sim
card is in the Pelican box I forgot
about that so it's not going to turn on
we can just take another quick Hardware
tour while I say some other things and
close out the video like stay tuned for
the full review which should be up next
week or late late this week at the very
soonest will have some comparisons up
gonna compare this with the 1020 of
course and some other Android devices
and then we'll do a full review on it so
stay tuned for that
