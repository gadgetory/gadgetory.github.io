just landed in Vegas for CES and were
already hands on with this little flaw
way here a follow up to one of the
top-rated budget phones of last year the
honor 6x brings a few neat tricks to the
entry-level smartphone market refining
what made the 5x a fun phone this gadget
feels better pieced together seems are
finished off flush and thankfully Huawei
loses the dimpled top and bottom panels
in favor of a more even satin finish
sides curve and taper a little more
gracefully it helps the foam feel a
touch smaller in the hand with the same
sized screen but otherwise it's a
recognizable family member in this
lineup new for this year the base model
starts off with three gigabytes of RAM
and 32 gigabytes of storage and the
battery gets about a 10% bump to three
thousand three hundred and forty
milliamp hour capacity Huawei is
powering the phone with a new mid-range
chipset walking away from Qualcomm the
Kiran 655 seems like it'll be a capable
performer against the 600 series
snapdragons we've used in the past and
then we get to this camera the first
impressions are impressive it's another
combo where color and light information
are pulled from each sensor then
combined to improve photo detail
saturation and contrast simulating wider
dynamic range and the matched focal
length lenses allow this budget shooter
to reproduce a similar wide aperture
mode found on significantly more
expensive Huawei's from 2016 maybe the
only initial criticism to deliver we've
been a little spoiled by the newest
version of EMU I found on the mate nine
the honor 6x brings us back to the
iPhone Year layout of Huawei's custom
skin where your app drawer and home
screens are combined it's easily
cluttered when widgets are mixed in
between apps and the split notification
shade is a little bit awkward to
navigate even for those quirks though
this xx already feels like a worthy
successor to last year's budget offering
more storage more refined build and an
impressive camera for this tier all
positive steps for a company attacking
at every price point of the phone market
so this is going to be my backup phone
as we stomp around the show floor out
here in Vegas we'll just have to see how
it stands up to a week of heavy use and
abuse as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this

CES 2017 coverage starting soon for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos Berg now some
gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram and
I will catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
