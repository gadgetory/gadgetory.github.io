pocket now calm and this is a look at
the new documents tab in HTC Sense this
comes from a Leo test rom that we think
will be on a tmobile hd2 this is running
manila 2.5 build 1922 it's the first
time in a long time that we've seen a
new sense tab or new tab in touch flo 3d
so excited to look at it and it's quite
robust HTC did a really good job at this
new documents tab I'm going to land over
here and I put three different kinds of
documents onto a storage card and loaded
it on the device so we have an Excel
spreadsheet and you get cool little
previews here which is great I have a
PDF and then I also have a standard word
document now it doesn't stop there
obviously if you tuck if you tap on one
of these it will open it up in the
respective program and there it comes
and I'm going to exit out of that but
there's a lot more you can do with it so
if we go down to all documents we get
this sort of sub interface this sub HTC
Sense interface with buttons along the
bottom various things we can do so right
now this is a listing of all the
documents on the device I can switch
this to a thumbnail view so you can
really see what you're working with this
is really fantastic I'd say that these
thumbnails are a little bit too small to
be actually useful but in some cases you
can kind of get a feel for what they are
but to go back to list of you to clean
things up we can tap up here to search
through documents if you have a lot of
them on your device going over to the
next tab we have recent so we can see
the recently opened documents obviously
I open this one at the top first so it
is in the correct order to the right of
that we can go to type and what this
allow you to do is sort of filter by PDF
or Excel spreadsheet or a word document
if we tap on these little arrows here
we're taken to some details about the
particular document when it was last
accessed and was modified the file size
very useful things and then there's some
really cool email integration so if we
go to the right we get to see any
documents that were received and any
documents that were sent so you have one
place to come for all of your documents
and you can do some other stuff with it
to you can sync email so say it's been a
week I think you actually have to
manually sync this to get the documents
to refresh in the sub interface you can
also change the document source you can
have it stored only I'll only pull the
documents for a male take the documents
from local documents or from your entire
device and there are some other things
here too if we go into settings just a
few different things we can disable
download notification disabled note
roaming notification and you can also
again change where the document source
is kind of redundant from the previous
screen but a really cool way to put
documents all under one place I think
this is going to be a great feature for
the mobile professional or anyone that
has a lot of documents on their computer
and they want to carry them around on
their mobile device so really looking
forward to dissecting this rom even
further and coming up with more changes
that we're going to see and presumably
the tmobile hd2 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
