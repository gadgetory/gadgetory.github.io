larger iPad in the works other reports
to talk about the HTC hema its hardware
and accessories if you believe that
businesses want to block your Wi-Fi
hotspot in the future I'm hanging out of
Nevada and yes I know I look like crap
but I have to drive 10 hours to get back
to the studio let's get the show on the
road this is parking out daily let's
begin today with what's official as the
FCC is dealing with something very
interesting from companies like the
marriott for example as a kindly they're
blocking third-party hot spots from
personal use because of their not making
any money off of it and obviously the
FCC is not considering this to be legal
because first of all it's your hot spot
you're paying for it doesn't matter
where you are you can use whatever
product you're purchasing obviously
Marriott wants to make some money off of
it and yeah that's the reason why they
want to sell you their Wi-Fi or in
addition to any other connectivity
issues but yeah it's really sad to see
that companies want to have a piece of
the pie sounds like this whole net
neutrality issue let's see how it goes
and for all of you that are interested
in the Nokia and one android tablets me
included if you want to purchase that's
have that there are already reports on a
possible date apparently nokia is
planning to launch in mid-february
because of different holidays that are
happening in China and that's the
problem it's apparently launching and
China initially and we're not going to
be able to get it yet iris not sure
exactly what the plans are but hopefully
we do get some official news probably
buy em the BC or probably see yes we'll
keep you posted and for a ton of you we
know that specification czar everything
even though benchmarks don't really
prove that but anyways if you're
interested in four gigabytes of RAM
Samsung is already working on it for
exit 07 processors which is a
interesting 4 gigabytes of RAM it's
finally a point for us to actually be
able to use 64-bit processors in a way
that's intended meaning more RAM more
capabilities and hopefully that will
happen by sometime at the end of next
year who knows galaxy note 5 and
speaking of specifications let's talk
about the new HTC flagship that we've
been talking about for the last couple
of days the HTC he
we get some specifications and we do get
accessories as well we have a 1080p
display here five inches yeah I know but
then we've got three gigs of ram and a
20 megapixel camera at the fact that
will apparently be coupled by a 13
megapixel shooter at the front or a 4
ultrapixel camera in the front which is
interesting addition to that we have the
same dragon 810 processor primarily and
we have this bevy of accessories that
included dot B case in addition to a lot
of other things like subscription full
details on what you're getting probably
mwc will be the time Lucy this new
smartphone and finally for the very
interesting news of the day or should we
say rumors we have one of the very
famous analysts that predicted a lot of
the things that happen with the iphone 6
and iphone six-plus to talk about the
feature of the iphone and the ipad
lineup for Apple he is a pretty much
confirming that Apple is working on a
smaller orage display iPhone and what's
most interesting is that apparently
it'll keep the iphone 6 design which we
wonder how Apple is going to pull that
one off and make it as thin and also
include you know these and
specifications apparently this phone is
not really going to replace the iphone
5s right now really it's going to
replace the iphone 5c so we're talking
about an entry-level smartphone here but
even more interesting apparently he is
also predicting of the twelve point nine
inch iPad pro that's been talked about
but the interesting works here is that
he mentions the business plan to ignite
the tablet market and that really leads
me to the question of the day do you
think that Apple needs a larger iPad 2
boo sales because in my case I don't
think it has to be larger I think it has
to be more usable meaning an iPad pro
with the OS 10 or something like that
but leave us a comment down below what
is your case bren-ji know the drill if
we wanna get it was earlier before this
video is fishy follow us on parking out
our comment subscribe to channel as well
it also follow me on twitter i'm out
there's quarterly data please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw i am highly better thank you very
much for watching we'll see tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
