pocket now calm if you're on AT&amp;amp;T and
you like Windows Phone 7 we've got a
huge treat for you and HTC hd7 that will
work on AT&amp;amp;T pretty cool stuff let's get
to it now what we really have here is a
version of the hd7 which has the proper
bands to do ATT 3g it happens to be the
bell canada version of the hd7 and
unless you know a friend that lives in
canada you're going to have to buy this
thing unlocked it's going to be
expensive for the privilege of having a
phone on AT&amp;amp;T that really wasn't
intended to be on AT&amp;amp;T it's going to
cost you about 700 bucks we know that's
very expensive and we wanted to show you
and give you the opportunity to see what
it would be like to have an HD 7 on ATT
anyhow there now shipping at negri
electronics and a big thanks to our
friends there for sending us an HD 7 now
we already reviewed the hd7 which is on
tmobile of course of the subsidized
price so we're not going to cover this
too much in depth we're going to talk
about the performance on AT&amp;amp;T and just
some overall thoughts but for those of
you on AT&amp;amp;T that really like big
screened windows phone 7 device may be
something you want to keep an eye on of
course on AT&amp;amp;T if you want Windows Phone
7 you can also go with the Samsung Focus
which has a 4-inch display or you can go
with the HTC surround which has a 3.7
inch display and finally you've got the
LG quantum with a slide-out keyboard
totally different form factor than what
we have here with the hd7 so if we go
around to the side of the box we can see
right off the bat UMTS 850 1900 those
are the AT&amp;amp;T beds and so thus this phone
will do a TNT in the u.s. so let's take
off the stone let's just look and look
at it get some first impressions again
we've already covered this phone on
pocket now so we're not going to cover
it in depth just talk about how it
specifically works on AT&amp;amp;T and our guess
is that it'll work very well because all
you need is those band
to match up so gotta cut this open here
all right there we go and let's slide it
out here beautiful device with a large
commanding screen on the front just kind
of knock this out and put it to the side
and inside should come as no surprise
what we get at this point stereo headset
USB cable a little bit of information
about Windows Phone 7 of course nice
full color guide that shows you how to
get started there and we'll put this
over to the side let's look at the hd7
again this is going to be the same model
that you're going to get on tmobile
except that of course it doesn't have
tmobile branding if we go over to the
back we have this beautiful kicks 10
it's a very very thin device in fact
it's almost as thin as the HTC hd7 both
of which half of course 4.3 inch
displays 800 x 480 resolution both are
remarkably thin here on the back you can
see a lot of differences the hd2
obviously didn't have a kickstand next
to another device with a 4.3 inch
display of course the AT&amp;amp;T inspire 4G
but kind of have a similar shape there
with the rounded edges hd7 actually
looks a little bit nicer a little bit
cleaner and I'd say it's it's a little
bit thinner so we're going to talk about
the hd7 a little bit more again this is
a very rare device because you can't
really get this phone on AT&amp;amp;T unless you
buy it unlocked and again for the
privilege to do so it's going to cost
you about 700 bucks and they're now
shipping at negri electronics com we'll
be back with more on the hd7 with AT&amp;amp;T
3g bags that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
