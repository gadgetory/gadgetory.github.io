t version of the galaxy s5 but now we're
taking a look at the Verizon version of
Samsung's 2014 flight ship is it worth
to buy a table Martin this is PocketNow
and this is our video review of the
Samsung Galaxy s5 from Verizon Wireless
Samsung is currently the undisputed king
of Android and has been for a while but
that title comes with a lot of
responsibilities it's expected to drive
the market forward with innovative
features compelling hardware fantastic
software and second to none user
experience as such many have been
looking to Samsung in anticipation of
yet another killer smartphone does the
galaxy s5 live up to expectations over
the changes to minor to capture the
market once again Michael has already
reviewed the AT&amp;amp;T model of the galaxy s5
and we suggest you check out that video
if you haven't already
but we've been putting the Verizon
Galaxy s5 to the test for four days and
here are our thoughts the design of the
galaxy s5 is no more awe-inspiring than
the two prior Galaxy S smartphones save
for a few minor tweaks to its appearance
like the physical science of the radius
of the corners the galaxy s5 looks
almost identical to the galaxy s4 it's a
hodgepodge of shiny and textured
plastics trying to act the part of much
more expensive higher-quality materials
the trim along the edges is a shiny faux
metal plastic and the back side mimics
the perforated leather of a fine golf
club or leather shoe that's not to say
the galaxy s5 is poorly made it feels
solid in the hand
there's no squeaking or creaking the
hardware with a firm grip the same time
it feels in substantial ways just 145
grams which may be heavier than the
Galaxy s4 but it's still comparatively
lightweight for such a large handset
however that isn't all bad the phone
feels surprisingly resilient where we
felt the One m8 needed a case to
preserve its brushed finish the galaxy
s5 feels like it can take some tiny
bumps without much issue as if it can be
carried without a case and be just fine
it's also resistant to the elements with
an ip67 certification for ingress
protection against dirt and water this
is evidenced by the water resistant
cover over the USB 3.0 port and the
rubber seals inside the battery door we
tested it in the shower
challo submersion and under running
water without issue the other major
additions to the hardware are the heart
rate sensor around back which integrates
with s health and the fingerprint sensor
on the front of the device it integrates
with third-party apps like PayPal and
LastPass and operates primarily as a
screen lock but our friend tested it
they had no problem with the scanner
recognizing their fingerprint on each
slide but we had far more trouble with
the sensor which only accepted roughly
one out of ten finger swipes unless we
paid close attention to how we were
holding the device your mileage will
most likely vary the guts of the s5 are
marginally improved and at the very
least on par with all the other top-tier
phones on the market it's powered by the
impressive Snapdragon 801 SOC and a
twenty eight hundred million power
battery it has a 16 megapixel camera
with phase detection autofocus a 2
megapixel front shooter 2 gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of storage a
microSD expansion slot comes with
support for up to 128 gigabytes the
display in typical Super AMOLED fashion
is super saturated at 5.1 inches with
1080p resolution the display bears an
impressive density of 432 pixels per
inch it's incredibly sharp with
exceptional side visibility high
contrast extra inky black levels and an
extra low brightness setting if you're
ok with extra vibrant colors the galaxy
s5 display will be a pleasure to look at
for the next two years or so in all the
galaxy s5 is a balanced piece of
hardware even if we'd like to see the
company get creative and challenge its
design team for once all the aesthetics
of the hardware hasn't changed all that
much the software has the galaxy s5
comes running the latest version of
Android version 4.4 per usual the phone
is running Samsung's custom TouchWiz
software
fortunately Samsung has cleaned up the
look of its software by going with a
more minimal appearance the notification
shade for one has a much cleaner less
cluttered look Settings has also been
simplified no longer is there a tab to
interface but rather a single stream of
settings options more like stock Android
the home screens are also slightly
cleaner while the leftmost page is now
dedicated to Samsung's my magazine
feature a social newsreader powered by
Flipboard unlike blinkfeed
it feels more like a shortcut to the
Flipboard app than a fully functional
standalone reader we found ourselves
looking elsewhere to browse news and our
social feeds as expected the galaxy s5
comes with no show
your features s help for instance it's
even more helpful with the heart rate
sensor though we're still not sure we
want to dive headfirst into Samsung's
proprietary fitness ecosystem you can
see more about how Michael Fisher loves
to exercise in his glimpse into a day
with s health and the gear fit one of
our favourite features multi-window
has returned alongside another handy
software feature toolbox a free-floating
chat head like bubble with quick
shortcuts to some helpful apps camera
voice recorder notes and calculator
these are user definable and Samsung's
usual software additions are also still
present smart stay smart pause power
saving blocky mode car mode and private
mode Verizon has also included its own
swath of float accessories color name ID
cloud emergency alerts Amazon Amazon
Kindle Amazon mp3 Amazon App Store
audible Isis wallet message plus my
Verizon mobile NFL mobile you get the
picture despite the slightly altered
appearance little is different in this
incarnation of TouchWiz we're happy to
see a small visual refresh but the
newest version of software doesn't fix
the one outstanding issue of TouchWiz
how bloated the software is still any
improvement is welcomed with a
Snapdragon 801 over the hood the Galaxy
s5 is a high-performance machine it zips
through menus with ease scrolling pinch
zooming in the browser and opening
applications all happen quickly and
smoothly however there was often a bit
of hesitation when pressing the home or
recent app buttons more often than not
the phone would pause for a split second
before loading the recent apps list or
jumping home no less its performance and
standard benchmark tests is quite
impressive as is the gaming performance
graphically intensive games like asphalt
8 Need for Speed Most Wanted and dead
trigger - all run buttery smooth without
noticeable framerate drops stamina on
the galaxy s5 isn't particularly
noteworthy unlight or moderate use the
twenty eight hundred million power
battery will manage to last through most
days without a midday charge through
heavy testing gaming benchmarks and
taking pictures and video we managed to
squeeze out just over nine hours of
usage and four hours of screen on time
before the phone powered down the power
saver mode should help prolong the
stamina for just a bit an extreme power
saver will sacrifice nearly all
smartphone functionality in favour of
far more stamina data speeds have been
spectacular on Verizon in the Charlotte
metro area we hit peak speeds around 50
four megabits per second down and 14
point eight megabits per second up with
average speeds of around fourteen point
six megabits per second down and seven
point three megabits up
however call quality was below average
colors notably sounded muffled though
audio on our en was loud and crisp the
output of the 16 megapixel camera is
quite stunning in daylight and well-lit
scenes colors were extra vibrant
contrast was high and close-up photos
had a notably shallow depth of field
that said we did have trouble with some
shots turning out blurry and we missed
focus more than we anticipated
not to mention low-light performance
leaves much to be desired
still we fill the outdoor and well-lit
performance far outweighs the camera
shortcomings in low-light and area few
phones have mastered in all we walk away
from the short stint with the galaxy s5
filling somewhat unmoved as if we've
been using a galaxy s4 all along only
after installing a new backplate and
software update sure new features abound
but few of them feel useful or
compelling enough to invoke a filling of
all or wonder with this new Galaxy S
foam still we can tell you this
buying the fifth-generation handset to
one of the world's most popular
smartphone lineups is one of the safest
choices you can make if you want to be
more daring there a half-dozen
alternatives which are just as great
calling your name if instead you're okay
with carrying a smartphone that's a
little bit dull but will still get the
job done exceedingly well you can't go
wrong with the Galaxy s5 for more
