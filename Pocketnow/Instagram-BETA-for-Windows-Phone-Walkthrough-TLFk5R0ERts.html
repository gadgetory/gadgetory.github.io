I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is a walkthrough of the official
Instagram beta for Windows Phone Windows
Phone users have a lot to be thankful
for this November as today one of the
most requested applications was
officially released as a beta mind you
to the public Instagram the Windows
Phone store linked with live at 11:00
a.m. Pacific today for all Windows Phone
8 users and can be currently downloaded
completely free of charge
up until now Windows Phone users who
wanted to join one of the world's most
popular photo sharing platforms were
forced to tread the sometimes dreadful
waters of third-party clients
fortunately some fully featured clients
came to be in recent months such as six
tag but finally receiving official
support from Instagram itself is a
blessing for the platform a badge of
honor
a symbol of acceptance amongst the two
major mobile platforms we downloaded the
Instagram beta as soon as it hit the
store and started toying around with it
and at the surface it seems much like
the official client on other platforms
it comes with the four main views the
timeline or a feed a post from everyone
you follow what's popular and trending
your notifications and your profile you
can fully edit your profile view all of
your own uploads and change privacy
settings you can see all new
notifications make comments like photos
and videos and even view Instagram
videos inline with pictures though they
will not Auto play you will need to tap
to play videos and we're not complaining
about that you can link up your Facebook
Twitter Tumblr Flickr and Foursquare
accounts and you can copy the share
links for individual posts for reshoring
friends photos and best of all you can
receive notifications in the form of
live tile updates on your home screen a
feature that truly makes the most of the
Windows Phone interface it is for all
intents and purposes a fully featured
client and despite being a little
sluggish at times we're happy to report
it seems to work quite well but there's
a small hiccup which has caused a good
bit of controversy tapping the camera
icon at the bottom of the app does not
take you directly to the in app camera
as it does on Android or iOS we're
talking about the square view finder
with Instagram standard camera UI
instead it Rockets you straight into
your camera roll showing you all your
and pictures there is no inbuilt camera
function or is there from the camera
roll there is another camera icon at the
bottom and tapping it will flip you into
an external camera application which
oddly is not the stock camera app from
there you can snap a quick shot and
either accept or retake if accepted you
can proceed to crop and reframe apply
the standard filters frames and other
edits and of course share the video
functionality unfortunately doesn't seem
to work just yet despite the capability
being asterisk on the application
feature details in the Windows Phone
store the toggle is grayed out in the
camera app and if you thought you can
simply load a pre shot video from your
camera roll think again video upload
functionality simply does not exist yet
after all this isn't the final product
and it's important to remember that so
far it's a great start for Instagram on
a blooming platform and rather than
harping on the missing features no
matter how important said feature may be
it's important to remember this is a
beta and it's just the beginning we'll
keep our eyes peeled for development on
this official application but we're
certainly not uninstalling 6 tag just
yet oh and one last thing if you're not
following pocket now on Instagram yet do
