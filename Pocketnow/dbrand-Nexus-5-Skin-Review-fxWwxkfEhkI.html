away a nexus 5 at pocket now I'm not
just any Nexus 5 but one with a special
vinyl skin and if you don't like that
one we're also giving away four more to
choose from it's all from a company
called D brand and in this video we're
gonna show you what it's like to use
them we're no stranger to D brand skins
at pocket now tailor Martin used a
carbon fiber patterned skin on his Nexus
4 for many months and Joe Levi taught
everyone how to apply the mahogany
version in a video from last fall I
asked Joe for some impressions from his
time with the product and he recorded
them from his phone since he was out of
the office at the time it pardoned the
sound quality and the occasional
notification noise D brand skins are
nothing short of Awesome they're amazing
they're beautiful they're wonderful they
are remarkably easier to install than
white imagine and significantly easier
to install than their competition the 3m
adhesive that they use is very nice it
once it's attached it it stays put it
does what it needs to do but it is not
so terribly tacky or aggressive that it
will once you put it in place you're
stuck there forever you can reposition
it just in case you get it off a little
bit and it does not permanently attach
until you really want it to and apply
all of the pressure and everything that
you need I have personal experience with
both the mahogany and the faux leather
in yellow I am a fan of the latter
though it is definitely just a full of
their appearance it is not faux leather
in tact or feel but it does add quite a
bit of a extra grip so when you're
gripping with fingers it's very very
good very nice helps keep that thing
especially on the nexus 4 from sliding
all over the place and flying out of
your hands
just overall I'm impressed with them
I've had other companies send me some of
theirs for just demonstration purposes
they're not cut to the same quality to
the same same exactness as the D brand
ones are and they just don't look as
good
so I'm sold on D brand and I have
purchased every single D brand skin that
I have ever used my brief time with the
skin that Nexus 5 largely backs up Joe's
conclusions the material feels very
high-quality and there's a strong sense
of attention to detail in terms of the
look particularly with the black
titanium and the carbon fiber patterns I
especially like that D brand includes
material enough to cover the side rails
so you don't just have a front and back
of the sticker sandwich and while I
didn't apply the skin myself I've
watched others do it and it seems much
easier than with thinner decals which
tend to bubble my only real complaints
are two the first is a slight fraying of
this particular skin at the edge no
doubt due to the very thin bezels on the
Nexus 5 it's small it's so tiny that we
had to get a macro lens out to see it
but it's still worth a mention my second
issue is the feel in hand and this is
something backed up by Taylor Martin as
you might be able to see the edges of
the skins a rather sharp there's no
tapering here so they're very easy to
feel against the skin this tends to
diminish the smooth feel of the device
and it might lead to an erosion of the
material over time or more likely a
trapping of Pocket lint or dust at the
edges we'd like it very much if dbrand
investigated beveled edges with its next
iteration those complaints aside we're
pleased to report that D brand products
are among the finest we've seen in this
category very much worth the price and
know we're not just saying that because
they're sponsoring this giveaway we mean
it if you don't win the giveaway but you
still decide to spring for a dbrand to
skin we don't think you'll be
disappointed
