pocketnow.com with the new york city
launch event for the galaxy note 10.1
sorry about the noise but there's a lot
of people here again their hands in this
device the note 10 one is running
Samsung's touch with skin on top of
Android 404 with a lot of customizations
for the s-pen stylus which lives down
there popping it out pops up a little
custom side dock there which is a nice
touch for instant access to apps like
Photoshop Touch which is bundled with
the device taking a hardware tore up top
is the standby power button and volume
rocker as well as the micro SD card slot
and USB port finally a headphone jack
there's nothing on the left side nothing
on the right and on the bottom there's a
Samsung dock connector what looks like a
microphone around back we've got just
the Samsung branding below the 5
megapixel camera and flash popping
around to the front responsiveness is
okay swiping between home screens here
not doing anything terribly burdensome
but the software feels responsive it's
no jelly bean but at least we're dealing
with real android ICS here powering that
experience is a 1.4 gig ojos 1.4
gigahertz x no squad backed up by 2 gigs
of ram this display measurement is
perhaps predictably 10.1 inches across
it's an LCD at wxga resolution and
bracketed by two front facing speakers
and a 1.9 megapixel front facing camera
up top this is very obviously a
landscape centric device while you can
rotate it to portrait you probably won't
want to for long because it's awkward
otherwise it feels good in the hand nice
and light but not cheap finally it's
being displayed with one of samsung's
keyboard docks here which obviously it
plays nice with this quick rundown of
the galaxy note 10.1 stay tuned to
pocket now for a lot more real soon
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
