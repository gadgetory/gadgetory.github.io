calm and it's time to give you the
hardware overview of the dell streak
android tablet alright and we're back
and we're going to jump right in and
kind of giving you some info of this
device itself is a very unique device it
is a 5-inch screen which is quite big
for android it also weighs more than
most phones not only because of the
screen but because of the actual
construction of the device itself so
looking right here at the front of the
device we have the three capacitive
buttons if your home your menu in your
back button to the top we also have the
ear piece as well as a front facing
camera and your light and proximity
sensor and then on the back of the phone
itself we have the dell logo with a 5
megapixel camera no flash unfortunate
now this is all metal it is somewhat
hard to tell but this will actually
slide off right here this is the back
piece and that is a metal panel now your
speaker is actually here however the
speaker is pre garbled which you'll hear
in our next video and when we do a
YouTube test the speaker is very very
disappointing unfortunately it's a good
size but it sounds almost like the
people that are talking or talking
underwater it may be this model maybe
the speakers below maybe it's a defect
however right off the bat it's easy to
say the speaker is definitely lacking
maybe 1530 our milliamp battery as well
as your SIM card slot and we're on top
of that you have a 16 gigabyte microSD
card moving on to the right side of the
device we have a dedicated camera button
which is always nice we have your power
button which will turn off the phone as
well as bring it out of the lockstate
and then your volume rocker up down as
well as a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
top of the phone follows that very
smooth finish the right side of the
phone is going to be the connector to
charge while the Connecticut does look
very similar and strike a close
resemblance to the Apple connector it is
not the same now include with the device
is also a sleeve that Dell wants you to
use to actually protect the tablet
itself however so I'm going to keep mine
here is this actually has a gorilla
glass screen which
very unique is this is one of the first
devices to fully utilize that it is one
of the harder screens very difficult to
break and scratch are the rumors it is
certainly a heavier device with both
these sides the whole back panel here as
well as the back battery panel being
made out of metal the device comes in
weighing at around 220 grams which is
pretty heavy once again the 5-inch
screen does add to that factor it's also
going to have a 5-inch capacitive screen
with a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels so
it's a pretty decent picture as you can
see it's much better than some of the
phones in the past and it's up to par
with some of the current devices as far
as the connectivity goes this device is
capable of using both edge and hsdpa for
the 3g as well as the UMTS it is going
to use the GSM signals of 850 megahertz
900 megahertz 1800 and 1900 megahertz as
far as the 3g compatibility goes on this
device there are actually two different
models based on where you're going to be
buying it from the first of which is
actually created for the European market
with hsdpa compatibility of 920 100
megahertz the second of which will work
in the US and some of the other
countries which is going to be
compatible with hsdpa 850 nineteen
hundred and twenty one hundred so they
basically give you that 850 megahertz
band that 18t will use for the 3g it
will come with a 16 gigabyte microSD
card with 512 Meg's of ROM and RAM which
will allow you to install the
applications to the device itself
however you can also upgrade that memory
card like the standard amount to 32 gigs
currently a little bit more on the
connectivity front it is capable of
reaching up to 7.2 megabits per second
on the hsdpa side of things if of course
your carrier is capable of giving you
that amount of signal it also has
bluetooth 2.1 and Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G signal
alright and now it's time for a first
we're actually going to show you a
pocket test of these devices so here in
my left pocket I have the HTC evo 4g as
you can see here you can really not tell
that's there I mean you can see a little
bit here on the back end now on the
right side
i have the dell streak there is a limit
of a portion that actually sticks out it
is much bigger going up a stair as you
can see here it actually gets pretty
tight on the leg on the thigh area and
it does kind of stick out in jab it you
could definitely see that I wonder what
is that in your pocket you can see here
Dell Streak so it definitely is
pocketable if you're gonna run a
marathon I would say it probably gets
uncomfortable after a while I can
definitely see running into a corner and
catch this on something it has that
gorilla glass screen so that might help
it however it does protrude a little bit
overall the device is certainly
pocketable however it is much bigger
than what you are typically used to it
is thinner than the HTC evo 4g thought
of something to keep in mind all in all
the dell streak so far is a very solid
device we will give you an example of
some of the 5 megapixel back camera
pictures as well as some of the
front-facing pictures in our final
review over at pocketnow.com be sure to
stay tuned for the next video in this
series which would be the second part of
the software overview will give you a
little bit more in-depth look at the
browser youtube and actually give you a
speed comparison to the HTC evo 4g this
device interesting you can actually go
ahead and check it out at an agree
electronics com as always thank you very
much for watching everyone please give
us a thumbs up and leave us any type of
comment with any questions or
suggestions you may have thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
