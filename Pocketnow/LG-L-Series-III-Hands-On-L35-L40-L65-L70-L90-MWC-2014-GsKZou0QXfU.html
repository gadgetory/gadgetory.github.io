Hanna behind the camera and Anton LG
booth and we are here with the L Series
free we've got and I'm gonna just read
off of the list because I have no idea
how many are there five actually it's
the l 35 VL 40 BL 65 VL 70 and the l 9 e
and we're gonna start off with the L 90
here not because it's the highest and
it's because it's the first one we can
get our hands on and then we'll make our
way through the rest so this is the LG
l90 and as you can see it looks a lot
and it feels a lot like the g2 mini and
if you look at my cheat sheet which I
will desperately use it has many of the
features from the g2 mini hopefully we
can unlock it the same way there we go a
4.7 inch IPS display of qHD resolution
which is 540 by 960 behind which there's
a 1.2 v hertz quad-core processor
flipping through the back there's an 8
megapixel camera with an LED flash of
course we're no longer talking optical
image stabilization as this is the
lower-end series of LG smartphones
double with a 5 megapixel webcam and
interestingly LG has made a great job in
delivering these brand new phones with
the latest version of Android and if my
cheat sheet is right we'll just gonna
verify that this one also has 4.4.2 of
course all the cloud applications home
button back button menu bubbly speaker
all usual let's move on to see the other
ones we are continuing the
g/l 70 which is the second highest in
ranking of highest to lowest end phones
this one opposed to the L 90 is powered
by a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor
in early quad-core processor so slightly
slower smaller screen 4.5 inches and
WVGA the resolution is also attached
smaller that's 480 by 800 an 8 megapixel
camera is still the same as the
specifications of the l 9e not optical
stabilized and a 5 megapixel webcam on
the front and something which is cool
which we have just found out if you go
into settings and this is valid for the
entire series go to Home screen and you
can select the easy home function and
this is how it looks you have all your
main shortcuts your dial pad your camera
shortcuts messaging contacts and of
course easy access to your applications
and switching back is just a three step
operation go back to the settings flip
back to home screen and we'll flip back
to the L 65 for the third video third
segments I should say of this video and
this is the L 65 we are just unlocking
it we're going down and down towards
lower and this is the same 1.2 this is
notify me that the battery is full which
is always good 1.2 gigahertz local
processor for print 3-inch WVGA we had
4.7 4.5 this is a 4.3 ensure we have a 5
megapixel camera on the back my cheat
sheet doesn't help me with the webcam
but we're guessing it's the same webcam
as on previous phones though it might
not be the case Android 4.4 as usual and
we no longer have the home button we
have the capacitive buttons for back
home multitasking and a button which
will probably switch between the two SIM
cards as this is a two SIM phone and I'm
guessing that that particular button is
a sim switch but let's move towards the
lower end devices and keep this video
going the lowest end of them all the LG
l 35 which has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor the same as on the lowest end
devices except for DLNA which has a
quad-core processor 3.2 inch display h
vga resolution 3 megapixel camera
without the flash and the same android
4.4 kitkat and this one is actually the
only one which cannot be unlocked with
the special naka feature you just have
to simply swipe to unlock and that's how
you use it however dual SIM is also in
that's been a very brief look at five of
the phones from the LG L Series kind of
behind the camera trying to follow me me
trying to following up with use and
pocket now you know the rest thank you
very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
