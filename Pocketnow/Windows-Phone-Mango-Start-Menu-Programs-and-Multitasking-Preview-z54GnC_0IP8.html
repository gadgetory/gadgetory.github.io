and you're watching a Windows Phone
mango preview so here we are and we're
gonna start with the Start menu and here
it is it looks pretty much the same as
Windows Phone 7 the mango version has
some new live tiles though we'll go
through all those right here you see
group you see the people tile has
changed should be some different
animations there there we go
so they got more contact photos come in
sometimes they come in big sometimes
they come in little little thumbnails
there there's a big one coming in and we
have our picture sub is now animated
which is awesome the live tile there
Xbox Live has changed a little bit and
you can pin more stuff to the Start menu
which is great so this is where you're
gonna put all your important stuff for
you know the day or every day you know
whatever you want you can put it here
and over here the programs menu
this has changed a lot previously it was
just one big long list but now we have
alphabetical jump lists menu and you
notice as you scroll the letter stays
there so if you have a really really
long list you can easily get back to the
alphabetical list so that's pretty
awesome now if I let's see if I can
remove some of these these letters only
appear if you have a significant number
of apps installed
well you've also have a search button
here now there's one thing to note the
hardware search button always goes to
thing now it's no longer
context-sensitive so you have to have
little search buttons for the
context-sensitive searches now here I
can do really nice quick searches of my
apps
and if you know I can also search for
marketplace apps right from here so
let's do theirs eBay and I can search
marketplace for more some related eBay
apps now let's look at settings real
quick a lot of things have changed in
the settings looks pretty similar here
go to packing.com for our full preview
to see all the details about what has
changed in the settings for now I'm
gonna show you a couple of favorites
here's the battery saver this is really
nice so when the battery is low it'll
turn on the battery saver mode and it'll
shut off things like push email
background apps all that kind of thing
you'll still be able to do everything
manually but it'll be saving battery in
the background
so here's it also shows you estimated
time remaining and how long it's been
since the last charge so that's really
nice to have this is another great
feature turn on battery saver now until
next charge so say you're out and about
and you want to save some battery
because you don't think you'll be able
to get back to charger breeze you know
very soon turn that on and when you plug
in it'll go back to a full power mode so
that's really great you know I have to
remember to turn battery saver mode off
not the big thing in the settings here's
background tasks now this is gonna list
all the apps that have background
processes I don't have any because this
is a preview and I don't think any exist
maybe some in development but that's
we're gonna show and they'll probably
have on/off switches so that you can
decide which ones can perform tasks in
the background
I almost forgot to show you the big task
switching feature so here we go just
hold down the back button here zooms out
and now I got some thumbnails and we can
really easily choose to switch to a
different program right there now you
see I only have what four here for some
reason it doesn't keep track of that
many I think it's because of memory
limitations since I've seen it demoed
with a lot more so it's really gonna
only show us the most recent ones that's
pretty nice pretty easy to switch
programs let's try with a third-party
app now I can't really demonstrate
instant resume with the task manager
here because third-party apps need to be
updated in order to support it so if I
go here and then I go back to that it's
really guys a restart so there you go
hopefully we'll see some updated apps
for that but we have some time so that's
our quick look at the Start menu
programs list and settings on Windows
Phone mango feel free to go to
pocketnow.com
and find our full preview with lots of
texts more pictures and more videos
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
