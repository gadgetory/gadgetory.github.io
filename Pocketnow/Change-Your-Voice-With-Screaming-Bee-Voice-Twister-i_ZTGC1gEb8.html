Daniel Webster here park.com and today
imma treat a cool little application
that will allow you to change your voice
on a windows mobile device and the
program is called voice twister and it's
by screaming B and the first thing
you'll notice is you have three options
you can change your voice to the pitch
or add an effect so we have a number of
voices we have a space squirrel which is
a high pitch sounds kind of like the
chipmunks we have a giant a robot an
alien and spree lunker so we'll just go
into the space squirrel and it gives you
a predetermined pitch and you can also
change the pitch on this little scroll
bar right here so just leave it where it
is and we'll add it in effect just the
same man right now and to screen right
here is the live recording and it will
actually record somewhat of a live feed
but unfortunately it's more of a delay
they won't actually record while you're
on the phone so what does it start and
then to talk we just hit push-to-talk
and it'll start recording hey this is
Dan I'm just recording another video for
packing.com and as you can see it's
pretty funny so we'll go to another
voice try the giant hello can you hear
me now and that's pretty neat as well so
go to the robot I need to go to the
grocery store and get some milk some
bread and some eggs I'm go to the next
one the alien we have come to this
planet to take it over and of course it
jumbles up your words and it sounds more
like an alien so the next one we can go
to his record and this is where you can
actually save the file and play it back
or send it to someone that you want to
it saves as a WAV format so we'll just
do that hey it's Dan I was wondering if
you want to go to that concert tonight
anyways hit me back my phone
hit stop and we can sit play it sounds
kind of like I'm on helium huh so if you
go to play you can actually set the wav
file that you've recorded so here we
have that one that I've just recorded we
can play that and you can add different
effects when you while you play it so if
I wanted to add an echo I can do that
and I'll just hit play so it sounds a
little bit weird you can't even really
tell what it was but it's pretty cool
effect you can go to the settings and
this will allow you to add a headset so
if you have an external headset you can
do that as well you can also change how
loud and how quiet the microphone is in
your sample rates so 44100 is about CD
quality so that's Brittany and you can
also go to like DVD quality if you want
and the last tab is devices and this
will allow you to select input so you so
right now I don't have a headset plugged
in so it's just gonna go off the
internal inputs of the phone so that's
pretty neat so this is voice twister by
screen B and I will post a link on
pocketnow.com as to how to get this the
program does cost around seven dollars
for the for Jordan but it gives you a
three day trial so you can test it out
anyways thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
