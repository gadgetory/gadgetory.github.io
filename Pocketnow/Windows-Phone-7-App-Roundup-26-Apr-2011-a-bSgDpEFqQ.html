now and this is another episode the
windows phone 7 app roundup and we'll
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it radio hub is a
free application to Bill on the windows
marketplace that allows you to play
radio stations from all over the world
so right here I've searched for Seattle
so I can play any one of these radio
stations that are broadcast either over
the Internet or over the device so let's
just go here and wait for it to buffer
and rear I can listen to the radio
station just cause this and then I can
go over here if I like it can also
browse by country so there's many
different countries available and also
go to the internet urban dictionary is a
free application available no windows
marketplace that allows you to decipher
various phrases and acronyms in our
common lingo so here we have today's
term and it shows that it's a work
sandwich it also gives a definition and
go over to some random words right here
random phrases we can also search for
something so what's that I want to
search for LOL i've just click on here
and it says that the original definition
was laughing out loud so let's just go
back and we can go over here to view the
popular terms and also the most popular
this year stitch is a paid for
application that allows you to turn your
photos into a against a
three-dimensional dome a panorama view
so let's go to my saved a project so
i'll just click on here ok so after
creating my project in the stitch
program now i can view all the photos
that I've created and I can even add
photos to a ceiling or the ground if I
like and cool thing about this you can
go to start free motion you can just use
the accelerometer and you can even post
this to the web or other social
networking sites super monkey ball as a
paid for Xbox Live game in which you
must maneuver this tiny monkey inside
the ball to collect bananas using the
accelerometer and also reach the goal
before the timer runs out so we'll just
move our little monkey around
hopefully we don't fall off the edge and
it's a pretty tricky especially while on
camera so oh no I thought the age and
when you breach the goal hopefully I can
do this see you've reached the goal and
now we've beat the level and we can move
on to the next chain reaction is a free
game available on windows marketplace
the object of the game is to get as many
chain reactions as you possibly can by
positioning a spot where the little tiny
spheres will go and collide in with it
so for this level I need at least two
and I failed so now let's try that again
let's try right here and now that I've
gotten two or more as you can see the
green bar around the screen lights up
and then I beat that level like
continues on like this and there's two
game packs available the 12 classic mode
and the extended at hard difficult
levels so this has been another episode
