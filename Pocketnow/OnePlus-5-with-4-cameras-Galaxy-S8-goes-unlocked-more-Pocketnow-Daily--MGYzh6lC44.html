the dual cameras won't only make the
back of the phone
Samsung Dex customers don't seem to be
very happy with the experience and
Microsoft Talks USBC or the lack thereof
in their surface laptop I'm Jaime Rivera
and every single time that I play the
Nintendo classic and I look for Zul all
I find is toad and then the princess
anyway this is PocketNow daily the
official listed a begin with something
that we've been waiting for for a while
I speak Spanish and the Google system
could not speak it until pretty much
today so Spanish and French are the two
new languages that are being supported
by the Google assistant now I hate the
fact that this project is still a work
in progress there are still very limited
functionality with third-party services
but the great thing about Google is they
continue evolving and I don't know but
Google assistant continues to be a
little more essential the more I use it
particularly with Android wear I thought
with the Samsung Galaxy S 8 NS 8 plus
those of you that do not want to lock
yourself into a contract or to any
specific carrier bloat as of today the
phone is available on pre-orders you can
get it on May 31st the price tags are
obviously as expected 729 and 829 pretty
much yes this is a very expensive phone
but bear in mind this is a very good
phone so far I would highly suggest you
watch our reviews and everything we've
covered about it
now speaking of Samsung one of the
products that it's not me that's not
recommending you use it but apparently
consumers in Korea are not surprised at
all with the Samsung next doc the whole
fact that you can turn your Galaxy s8
into a full-blown computer to a certain
degree as it turns out this product is
being sold like crazy
meaning resold by consumers who pretty
much don't find the use for it and
they're selling it as cheapest $70 and
for exact it's worth nearly 200 bucks
that's saying a lot it tells us that
people don't really care about this
added functionality I can't say I add
myself to the list I honestly haven't
tested it yet but I don't know it's just
I feel that it's probably a little
overkill for what people really want a
smartphone
but that's just me now so the spotlight
over to the company that actually
innovated with that technology but it
didn't really take off with Windows 10
mobile Microsoft assist I'm then over
the lack of USBC on their surface laptop
according to the company two things
number one they love their docking
connector because it enables a lot of
stuff over just one cable I have the
Microsoft dock and I do love it I have
to agree on that one but then the
problem is that according to them the
reason why they didn't adapt USBC for
everything else is because there are too
many USB C cables out there that are
fake it's just too open and it leads to
probably consumers complaining over
their laptop not charging because the
wire is the problem but then consumers
won't think of it that way they'll think
the surface is the problem you know I
don't think that that's a good enough
reason to not support USB C but anyways
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with the 1+5 we are very
close to when this phone usually
launches somewhere around June July and
we've got some leaked sketches that show
us a lot of hot things number one dual
cameras at the back
number two dual cameras at the front and
there is this sort of like a ceramic
back that looks a lot like the Google
pixel only I feel it has a lot better
taste of what we see with the pixel I
feel that whatever oneplus is coming up
with and the fact that they're upping
the ante and giving us dual cameras at
the front will be an awesome move but it
leads me to the question of the day look
at the sketch disclose what you think if
you like to design one number two do you
like the possible added features in my
case I cannot wait to see what we get
but leave us a comment down below we
look to know your opinion Firenze you
