your angelic voice say what the problem
was your jeans it's more than the jeans
I have a samsung phone I will get
Android P in 2021 I think that's gonna
be kind of early actually that's right
it's that time of the week for those
naysayers that thought we weren't gonna
do this again we are here I'm hi I'm ed
we got it with pocket now these are your
comments the pocket out daily recap for
last week
so one Monday the topic was the Google
pixel three Excel the leaks that we saw
and I asked you what do you think about
the design we had 580 comments the pixel
3 Excel not is deeper than deep dish
pizza
oh man all right I'm gonna call this the
comment of the week definitely yes it
looks horrible if that notch is the
final design of the pixel may god help
us I'm serious I do feel that there
could be better design but I do have to
agree with Brandon on his recent video
where sadly the knotch is probably the
best solution for the state of hardware
right now I do get it but then again why
so large or why so ugly or why so
serious I have a pixel to excel and I
would like the three excel not sure
about this nonsense with notches but I
do hope the front-facing speakers are
louder and sound better than the to
excel oh my god so I'm actually working
on a video that has to do with the pixel
to excel this is gonna be an awesome
collab with somebody that's great but I
can't tell you much right now and yes my
speakers have degraded over time they
sound really bad lately a lot of
distortion I do agree then on Tuesday we
talked about 49 for Android bear in mind
this was before the unpacked event I
asked you if you were looking forward to
it and we had 355 comments maybe Samson
needs to lower their prices of it so my
egg and afford one no wonder their sales
are low and yes I do agree definitely
bundling for tonight or the whole
strategy that they have is a nice way to
drive sales but I do have to agree my
god that price for the Galaxy Note 9
$1,000 is a lot of money I'm not a gamer
but I am looking forward to the new note
9 can't wait you know it's funny the
note line was never a gaming lineup
which is the oddity we still have a lot
of testing with our review unit but so
far battery life is great performance is
good hopefully it does live up to
playing games as it should
I've got a question Jaime if for tonight
comes out to Android will you buy the
battle pass I know who picked this
comment Diego yeah I would buy the
battle pass but I know it's not gonna be
for me it's gonna be for you but on
Wednesday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 again we still had not
seen the official product which is right
here I asked you what do you think about
the design
because again there were leaked videos
and everything we had 357 comments I
like the front of the no date I prefer
to be 30 though I'll beginning the note
9 just because of the s-pen of the
snapdragon 845 I do have to agree in the
past the updates when it came to
Qualcomm Snapdragon processors were
mainly just speed but now the
capabilities just the whole data speeds
and everything on this Snapdragon 845 or
epic and definitely this new s-pen makes
it quite compelling I don't like the v30
from the front by the way but I'm not
saying it's ugly the note 9 is just a no
date with a better fingerprint sensor
placement very similar to how the s8 is
compared to the s9 that's where Samsung
prophets are gonna fall until they
design change or change the design I
guess yes and no we had a long podcast
yesterday where we discussed a lot of
this just how much the s-pen has now
evolved to be what it should have always
been so I don't agree with you in that
part design wise yes when it comes to
the s8 n s9 but in the case of the s-pen
definitely there are more features and
some of them are actually not gimmicks
they're worth it even though I'm a big
Samsung fan I'm buying new iPhones this
year it's been pretty disappointing this
year for Samsung so I guess next year
I'll go back if they truly make a great
phone with a foldable that's a foldable
device I don't know man I will have to
be proven that point just like bear in
mind I never got the galaxy note 1
I didn't like it I was like that phone
is too large obviously they proved their
point if they can show me that a
foldable design has a purpose than sure
I'll have to review it anyways but I
don't know we'll see
then on Thursday the rumours are the
dates for the possible event from Apple
September 12th I asked you what Apple
products are you looking forward to as
we hear that there will be a ton being
announced
we have 367 comments I'm looking forward
to the 10 plus only reason I got the 8
plus versus 10 is the size yes better
specs and all but I have bear paws for
hands and I need the plus phone I my
hands are not small dude and I just feel
that the plus variants have been just
you know when you blow up a phone just
because you want to make it larger but
you don't move the buttons to an
ergonomic placement I feel that that
doesn't make sense
and I've hated that from Apple for the
past couple of years I like the 10
because it's literally a large display
on a smart on a smaller form factor the
question is they're gonna do this with
the Plus we'll see iPhones n plus as a
$1000 wasn't high enough huh I do hope
Apple does something about those price
tags like seriously I I wish that
consumers would have proven me right
when I said all right people are just
not gonna buy this thing because it's
too expensive and we've got the eight I
was proven wrong people were willing to
buy the question if they're willing to
do it every year I don't think so man
but we'll see I'm looking for iPad pro
love using the iPad pro 10.5 for media
consumption and a little bit for
workload oh my god so this iPad pro has
literally enabled most of our videos
because of this sennheiser microphone
you can connect to it which is what I
use for videos I your script this right
here along with the audio I love the
Apple pencil to be able to highlight
what I do like for me I am a huge iPad
user but my case is different I know
it's not the case for everyone so yes
that is what I am looking forward to as
well what the next iPad pro will be like
and finally on Friday the topic was the
Galaxy Note 9 yet again mainly because
well we had a leaked video from Samsung
we heard about the price tag and I asked
you what did you think about it we had
430 comments so what is the point of a
press conference for the Galaxy Note now
because of the league's yeah definitely
this was probably like the most leaked
phone ever but I guess they did a good
job at keeping the hype I think that was
the purpose no phone on this planet is
worth more than $600 to me you know when
you have a device like the one plus six
I totally totally agree with you
hopefully Samsung will lower the price
of the note 9 sadly no it is worth
$1,000 which is pretty much $75 more
expensive than the note 8 there are some
benefits there's double the storage when
compared to the note a definitely a
better s-pen so it's like if they're
charging you more money but they're
actually giving you back more which is
that at its storage capacity that you're
getting the larger battery the far
better processor so it's not that I'm
justifying the price tag I'm just saying
I get why they're charging more is it
worth it well we've got a long review
pair
coming up so let us know in the comments
what you would like for me to test from
this phone will compare since you would
like to see so far I've been using it

been surprisingly better than I expected
