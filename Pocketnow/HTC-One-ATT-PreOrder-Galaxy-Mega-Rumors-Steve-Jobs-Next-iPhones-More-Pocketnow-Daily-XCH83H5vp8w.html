and launch date on AT&amp;amp;T the samsung
galaxy mega phablets get rumored and the
next iPhones were a product of Steve
Jobs I'm hi Mary Beth and stop looking
at me funny it was a great game and a
good time this is parking out daily
let's start the day off talking about
HTC as the company has made it official
you can pre-order the HTC One on April
fourth and then get to the Bizon stores
on April nineteenth sprinters doing
pretty much the same thing only a day
later for pre-orders you could do it on
AT&amp;amp;T for two hundred dollars after a
two-year contract for the 32 gig model
and then it's an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive the 64
gig bottle is for three hundred dollars
after a two-year contract if you
preorder on AT&amp;amp;T will get the HTC media
link HD and there are rumors on radio
shack of you preorder on April fourth or
whatever Radio Shack is gonna do this
you will get a free $50 google play
store gift card which is great so
pre-order away and continuing on with
HTC there are the first league renders
of the HTC first then it's not first
anything that's the name of the phone I
can't understand where they come up with
these names but the point being is that
if you look at the interesting
capacitive buttons at the bottom this
device does not look like Android or
Windows Phone or it could be Android and
this is probably the facebook phone so
April fourth I mean you never know and
then let's move over to windows as
yesterdays rumors talked about windows
blue being windows RT merging with
windows 8 and now we've got rumors that
windows blue will be called Windows 8.1
as apparently that changes to this blue
update will just be enhancements and not
really a newer version of Windows it
makes all the sense in the world there's
really nothing wrong with windows 8 pro
just windows RT so hopefully they will
bring some better enhancements and
windows blue will not be released two
years from now now let's talk about
iphone the district attorney recently
contacted Apple because well there's so
much i phone theft out there that they
wanted to implement the sort of kill
switch for the iphone and feature
devices but interesting the government
liaison from Apple responds that sadly
they cannot make any of these changes
because the next two generations of the
iphone were designed at the Steve Jobs
era so just think
about it the future I phones are already
made now meaning are we getting new
technology and finally for the
interesting news of the day you know how
much we've debated over the fact that we
don't know if the Galaxy Note 3 will
have a 5.9 inch display or a six point
three inch display but wait no more
apparently this is not the galaxy note 3
apparently there is a new lineup of
galaxy mega devices where you get a
galaxy mega 5.8 which is a five point
eight inch display and then a galaxy
mega 6.3 which is a six point three inch
display and then it begs to wonder if we
are getting a galaxy note 3 and not a
galaxy mega we're getting to duel sort
of lineups but anyways that leads me to
the question of the day how big is too
big for you when it comes to smartphones
and before you come to me with those
that's what she said jokes well in my
particular case a 5 inches on a display
is pretty much the best for me I feel
that that's not too big not too small
but leave us a comment down below do you
really think of that 6.3 inch display
galaxy mega holds any water and of
course if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet broke mushy follow
was on parking now that comment
subscribe to our youtube channel as well

you liked what you saw I am hi Mary vet
and as always thank you very much for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
