we are here in London at the loony I
event looking at the Nokia Lumia 925 the
new kid on the block let's see what this
bad boy can do now there's a reason I
have the HTC One here with me because
the HTC One as well as the iPhone 5 is a
complete aluminium built which means
that it's made out of a single slab of
aluminium the Nokia Lumia 925 is also an
aluminum phone but the aluminum is only
on the rims on the edges so as you can
see here this park here all the way
around this is a really good feeling
aluminum piece but the back is still a
polycarbonate and the reason I have here
the 808 PureView with me it's because
first of all we have polycarbonate on
the 808 PureView as well and after today
the 808 PureView in my book is still the
king of camera phones but enough about
that this is the Nokia Lumia 925 we've
seen the Nokia Lumia 928 a couple of
days ago for verizon USA this is
basically almost the same phone and
they're both almost the same as the
Lumia 920 we've got the earpiece up job
just above the Nokia branding being
pulled out a front-facing webcam a 4.5
inch AMOLED screen with Nokia's
clearblack technology with a 1280 by 768
resolution the usual back home and
search buttons for Windows Phone
flipping to the side we have the volume
rockers power button and the quick
shutter button nothing on the other side
now these parts right here are will be
where the antenna parts of the phone are
and Nokia says the aluminum is an
awesome awesome antenna you will have
awesome reception with this phone
flipping it to the back is where the
magic happens
is a polycarbonate plastic very very
very soft to the touch a dual LED flash
right on top of the eight point seven
megapixel camera sensor which might be
the same as the one on the Lumia 920 and
the Lumia 928 more recent we have
verizon but actually the camera module
which is equipped with the car outsized
optics has an additional sixth lens
which helps for optical image
stabilization in those low light
performance conditions down lower we
have these three connection points which
serve for a cover on the back which is
compatible with qi wireless charging
standards will have that in just one
second and right on the bottom we have a
powerful speaker which nakia
specifically called out other than that
we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
up top micro USB port and sim card slot
this is the only internal storage option
flavor available that's 16 gigabytes of
course you had the online options for
SkyDrive and as far as the colors are
concerned we're going to try to get the
second option we have this white /
silver version and also a black version
so that much about it this was the Nokia
Lumia 925 this wasn't I'm coming from
you from London either watching pocket
now and this was Lumia 925 on
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
