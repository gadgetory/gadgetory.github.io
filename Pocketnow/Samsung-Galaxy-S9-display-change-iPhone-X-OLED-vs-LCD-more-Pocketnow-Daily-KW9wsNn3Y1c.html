in 2018 with LCD being the standard for
the rest photographs of a Chrome OS
tablet with an Acer logo and unknown
specs emerge and Samson just came out
with the weirdest phone unlock system
ever I'm Terry Crews and the Old Spice
Power
stop playing with the script hey
meribella this is parking out daily the
official loose today begin with deals if
you're in the market for an iPad pro
this is probably the best time to buy as
Amazon currently has refurbished iPad
pros for as little as well as but just
30% off bear in mind these are the most
expensive iPads you can buy I'm talking
about the latest generation and it seems
that the warranty is still there so I
would definitely consider there are
details in the description and we've
been covering rumours of the galaxy as 9
pretty much all month so I'm just gonna
tell you that specifications have been
pretty much confirmed everything we've
heard 8:45 6 gigs on the plus regular 4
gigs on the regular but most important
we've got these renders that show is the
phone from the front this time and I
don't know if you notice but the bezels
seem asymmetrical it seems that the top
bezels are taller than the bottom bezels
pretty much as we see with the galaxy s
8 active so yeah galaxy has nine and s
nine plus you can learn more in the
description as well now let's talk about
a Chrome OS tablet and this is really
interesting we know of Chromebooks but a
Chrome OS tablet we haven't and there's
the straight show going on where Acer
pretty much showed off this tablet
running Chrome OS there are no
specifications no details it's just the
tablet so it seems Chrome OS is going to
take a hop into other form factors now
let's talk about this very interesting
Samsung patent for another way to unlock
your phone we've seen fingerprints we've
seen face we've seen retina we've seen
everything but blood flow patterns
there's a patent that's already been
filed by the company that shows that
they figured out a way to do this as
well and are there any doctors in the
comments that could explain how that
could be there
right like seriously how can a phone
measure your blood flow pattern leave us
a comment if you know how and finally
the most interesting news today have to
do with the next generation iPhones in
2018 we heard that the iPhone 10 is
going to die and there going to be three
new models now for those of you that
were expecting that these were going to
be a regular and a plus with all Ed's
apparently that's not going to be the
case it seems that there will be only
one oled iphone and then the two others
will bring an LCD and we've heard that
the LCD models are going to be the less
expensive ones but obviously it also
seems that we're not going to be getting
a plus iphone 10 whatever or we're not
really sure it leads me to the question
today I mean how much of a deal-breaker
now that some of you have already tried
the OLED iPhone how much of a
deal-breaker would it be for you to go
back because in my case I actually fired
up the iPhone 8 plus before making this
video and you know because of the way
Apple implements OLED it's really hard
to tell the difference so for me it
wouldn't be but leave us a comment down
below we love to know your opinion
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow was on pocket now
Todd comment subscribe to our channel by
hitting this button up here you know
watch yesterday's parking out daily up
here and our review of the iPhone 10
down here you can also follow me on
Twitter home address quoted me that I
run into the ground at home it'll be
better please give this video a thumbs
