significant force in Android smartphones
today and now it's time to put the
newest member of the family to the test
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is our Samsung Galaxy s4 review
last year's galaxy s3 stretched the
bounds of what a smartphone could
include Samsung went out of its way to
cram as many features as it could into a
compact elegantly designed package and
in large part it's succeeded with this
year's Galaxy S flagship the company has
tamed that ambition somewhat samsung
says it wants the galaxy s4 to be a
device you can recommend not just to a
tech enthusiast but to your mother as
well it balances amped-up specs like a
13 megapixel camera with new tutorials
and an easy mode for first-time
smartphone users and from hardware to
software it aims to alienate no one this
device is much less aspirational much
more iterative read our full review at
pocketnow.com and follow us on the
social feeds for all of our exhaustive
galaxy s4 coverage but before you go
anywhere we've got a review to do let's
jump in the galaxy s4 hardware
incorporates touches of its immediate
predecessor with those of the galaxy
note 2 and the older Galaxy S 2
resulting in an aesthetic that's vintage
Samsung the real innovation here isn't
in a revolutionary new casing design but
in Samsung's ability to pack so many
improvements into a smaller package the
screen is larger than last years and
stocked with improvements five inches on
the diagonal Super AMOLED and 1080p with
the pixel density of 441 pixels per inch
in person it's stunningly beautiful
sandwiched between it and the removable
2600 milliamp hour battery on our
American review unit is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 processor clocked at 1.9
gigahertz backed up by the usual 2 gigs
of RAM as some global versions of the
Galaxy s4 will ship with samsung's new
Exynos 5 octa cpu and our unit here is
not one of them the power pack isn't the
only thing that's removable Samsung has
stayed true to its style and included
support for micro s
d cards to augment the on board 16 32 or
64 gigs of storage depending on your
carrier and how deep your pockets are
also included are added sensors radios
and transmitters in addition to the
usual accelerometer compass and
gyroscope there's a barometer
thermometer and hygrometer aboard in
addition to an IR blaster for
remote-control duties our sprint unit
here features CDMA and LTE support as
well as Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11
and AC wireless charging is not
supported out of the box but an optional
back cover is due this summer to enable
that functionality it's all packed into
a housing that's thin at 7.9 millimeters
and which feels even lighter than its
130 grams would suggest it's got a more
refined appearance than last year's
Galaxy s3 with a shinier mid plate and
very thin bezels but the hyper glaze
coating detracts from the nice stippled
texture on the underlying polycarbonate
the glossy coating is a fingerprint
magnet and unlike the gorilla glass 3
protecting the display it's also very
easy to scratch you might want a
protective case if you're planning on
keeping the galaxy s4 for the long haul
while the hardware is familiar from 2012
this software is almost identical our
demo unit arrived running Android 4.2.2
but aside from the galaxy s4 s sharp
1080p display and a few tweaks the
experience is just like using any other
high-end Samsung smartphone running
TouchWiz some of those tweaks are useful
like the added toggles in the
notification area and the lock screen
widgets that come with the new version
of jellybean others like the confusing
tabs settings menu and the brightened up
dialer are not as welcomed Samsung is
making a renewed push to embed itself
into your media consumption with the
Samsung hub a Content store and
aggregator for an inconsistent selection
of books video and music the books
catalog is beyond anemic but the music
and video categories have a fairly wide
array of choice unfortunately there's
nothing really special about the UI and
the feature set doesn't particularly
standout unless you're an avid user of
your Samsung Account if you already use
Spotify Netflix Google Play or
a combination of those to manage your
media there's not much reason to switch
to Samsung's ecosystem on the plus side
the Peel powered watch on home media and
remote control application works well
and it offers a ton of features for
those who get most of their
entertainment from the living room
Samsung is also baked a galaxy note
feature into the s4 air view this allows
a user to hover a finger over the screen
to trigger previews of specific content
or to magnify text it works well in apps
like the gallery and the special build
of Flipboard but it suffers elsewhere
like the email and messaging apps where
some threads just refused to provide
previews at all the companion air
gesture feature is much the same useful
in a few circumstances but not reliable
or far-reaching enough to justify its
inclusion at best it's a gimmick at
worst when it misinterprets a hovering
hand as a gesturing one it really
interferes with the operation of the
device we're not sure if we have these
added features to blame for the
occasional lag or stutter that we see in
TouchWiz but whatever the case it is
occasionally there and we don't like it
a device with hardware this powerful
should exhibit no lag whatsoever
there are nice flares here like the
inclusion of s-health out of the box so
you exercise aficionados can stay fit
and story album to collect your photos
and print them using a third-party
service if you like there's also a
helpful suite of tutorials and
descriptions for each of the new device
features but this year even more than
last it seems like Samsung is just
aimlessly tossing new features at the
user without first perfecting the
experience of each one it's hard not to
wonder how many of these new features
are going to wither on the vine over the
course of the coming year
anybody remember s voice fortunately
there's one area where building features
on top of features has resulted in a
very compelling package the camera while
the sensor has been boosted to 13
megapixels over last year's 8 that's
less impressive than the addition of new
shooting modes like drama shot animated
photo and even dual shot all of which
helped the galaxy s4 maintain camera
parity with competing offerings from
Nokia and HTC the viewfinder has also
been cleaned up and augmented with
software ripped
right from the galaxy camera resulting
in a simple bright and fun shooting
experience there are some downsides we
don't love the reduced field of view of
the new camera compared to others on the
market or the default setting of 9.6
megapixels out of the box and we wish
this shooter featured improved low-light
performance also photos and challenging
lighting situations can get a little too
noisy for our taste but for a smartphone
camera the galaxy s4's module does a
nice job of walking the line between
user-friendly and powerful we tested the
galaxy s4 over the course of seven days
on Sprint's CDMA and LTE networks
between New York and Boston reception
during the review period was solid
outperforming the HTC One and indicated
signal strength speeds on Sprint's LTE
network were good not as good as some
competitors but averaging around 10
megabits down and around five up
Sprint's 4G build out is very spare at
the moment lagging behind AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon and 3G speeds on evideo are
quite slow we sometimes had real trouble
maintaining a connection to either
sprint network including a two hour
stretch of no connectivity whatsoever in
New York City's Upper East Side so
you'll want to make sure to research
Sprint's coverage situation thoroughly
where you live and work if you spring
for the Sprint version of this device
the galaxy s4's voice performance was
fair during our review with callers
rating our audio consistently around
seven out of ten but the phone's noise
cancellation underperformed a stiff
breeze easily disrupted our calls
fortunately Samsung has improved the
loudspeaker for speaker phone calls we
wish the speaker were around front as on
the HTC One and Galaxy Note 10.1 but at
least it's louder Samsung is known for
good battery life and that holds true
for the s4 that if I scored a 470 on the
antutu battery test placing it above the
HTC One score of 408 what that means in
real life is that we're usually able to
get a solid day of moderate to heavy use
out of the galaxy s4 your results as
always will vary but heavy users can
always bring for a spare battery due to
the swappable design the galaxy s4 can't
be considered in a vacuum the landscape
might be less crowded these days but
there still
significant competition out there from
other manufacturers some phones feature
prettier hardware than the s4 and others
offer better design software but few of
them pack as much power and
expandability in such a Savelle casing
while we'd have liked to see Samsung
blow us away with a groundbreaking
smartphone in 2013 the way it arguably
did in 2012 the simple fact is that that
can't happen every year and more
importantly it doesn't have to Samsung's
2013 flagship is a competent well
balanced fully featured smartphone no it
doesn't really inspire us and we might
not recommend it to mom or dad just yet
but for the tech-savvy and even the
average user it's a very good choice we
give the Samsung Galaxy s4 an eight
point eight out of ten
