now we have lost count out of videos but
we have still one more for you we didn't
want to leave without looking at another
galaxy product we don't evenly cover
DSLR cameras and pocket now but this is
a camera which is from the galaxy family
and runs Android this is the Samsung
Galaxy and X and once we get the screen
back you'll see that this is the
preferred operating system on samsung's
DSLR as the camera is starting up let's
run through the specifications real
quick this is a four point eight inch HD
Super Clear LCD screen it's running
Android 4.2.2 and it has two gigabytes
of RAM 16 gigabytes of internal storage
the camera itself is a twenty point
three megapixel camera and it is powered
by a four thousand three hundred and
sixty milliamp hour battery of course
radios include LTE connectivity as well
as 3G connectivity for those who don't
live in LTE markets Wi-Fi a BGN Osio
bluetooth 4.0 and with a swipe we can
get back to the Android menu which is
just your basic Android operating system
going in for the applications you can of
course spot all the icons which are
familiar to you by now from from
smartphones or from tablets you can
install more from the Google Play Store
and you can of course always jump back
to the home screen by using these
persistent buttons jumping back to the
camera this is where Samsung did some
modifications we have the mode selectors
we have user specific menus for modes
like manual
shutter priority aperture priority
program mode and of course the bullet
which
brings you these Samsung specific modes
there are a ton I believe about 30 or 32
modes the camera also suggests modes for
your specific shooting scenarios we're
not going to go into any more details
it's just interesting to see Android
being the platform powering a DSLR
camera which also happens to have
interchangeable lens with compatibility
with all other Samsung NX
this was Anthony Knight probably leaving
London and thank you very much for
watching as always
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
