introductions
OPO has well established itself as a
reliable smartphone manufacturer that
has something for everyone from
flagships to mid rangers from rotating
cameras and faux leather bags to
aluminium from color OS the more recent
project spectrum I'm Anton de nada
this is opals latest smartphone the r7s
and you're watching our unboxing and
first impressions if somehow the 5-inch
r7 was too small for you and the 6-inch
r7 plus was too big Oppo is giving you
more choice with the r7 s however it's
not just an in-between phone while it is
positioned between its siblings
it not only borrows the pros from both
but it also takes it up a notch the
unboxing experience is good as we've
learned to expect from Oppo by now with
the phone that Center and a nice
presentation of the bundled accessories
you get AV ooc rapid charger and its
respective USB cable you can spot both
of them by the green accents a pair of
headphones and a clear silicone case
should you want to protect the phone
without concealing its looks and yeah it
looks good and it feels just as good in
the hand
after all opal is as of recently the
official sponsor of FC Barcelona gold is
currently the only version of the phone
and this could probably be the only
reason for you to look away while it
looks good in person not everyone's a
fan but if you move past the shade
you'll immediately have a great
sensorial reward once you pick it up
from the 2.5 the glass that's slightly
curved on the sides to the nice fit and
finish chamfered edges clicky buttons
substantial in hand feel and the super
deep blacks of the AMOLED screen once
you turn the phone on it speaks premium
regardless of the angle you're looking
from and then you turn it on and you
meet color OS oboes own android 5.1.1
based custom user interface it's story
is similar to every other Android OEM
skin out there what its advantages and
disadvantages
snappy is the proper word to describe
the user experience after the initial
setup process and some brief time spent
with the phone we can say that the r7s
offers a fluid experience that shouldn't
come as a surprise as the phone packs
four gigs of ram more than its r7 and
even its r7 plus sibling the processor
is the same octa-core Snapdragon 615 and
the 32 gigabytes internal storage can be
easily augmented with the help of a
micro SD card that shares its slot with
the second sim and the removable tray by
the way both Sims being 4G enabled we
are not quite sure how the 3070 milliamp
power battery performs but if the r7 and
our seven-plus are of any indication you
shouldn't have any problems whatsoever
especially with the included v OC rapid
charging system that will easily top off
your phone in less than an hour
additionally Oppo claims that a five
minute charge will give you two hours of
talktime something of course which will
have to confirm ourselves but this also
depends a lot on the network you're on
and speaking of networks
there's an international a us and the
Taiwanese version of the phone with
support for LTE bands according to the
region last but not least we had to fire
up the camera and while it's no iPhone 6
galaxy note 5 g4 orb Xperia z5 premium
your stills will definitely stand out
from those made by other mid-range
smartphones and even some flagships a
pleasant surprise
that's the proper first impression for
the oppo r7s a good looking phone to
attract attention
snappy performance the beautiful screen
powerful speaker rapid charging and an
above-average cap will tell you more
about the oppo r7s in the coming weeks
