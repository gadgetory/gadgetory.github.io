or container look at the samsung saga
from verizon wireless samsung saga is a
cdma gsm enable phone is a video data
connection it supports Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi connections as well has built-in
GPS for navigation however the GPS is
currently locked so it's only available
with the only used by the VZ navigator
application from verizon that should be
changing the first quarter this year
they should be opening that up with a
firmware update so the third party
applications can also use the GPS so
I'll be looking forward to that take a
quick tour here on the top we've got a
headphone jack and it's not a standard
3.5 millimeter jack so you need to have
a custom set of headphones to access
that we've also got a camera on the back
so 1.9 megapixel camera no flash no zoom
just to the standard camera for taking a
quick snapshot I've got a lanyard loop
along the top does not come with a
lanyard it does not come with the with a
headphone set along the side here we've
got a charging Jack which is the
proprietary samsung jack as opposed to
standard USB Jack prefer to see the
standard USB so you can use any cable
lying around your desk I've got a camera
button and a reset button if we open
this up with that the 1300 milliamp hour
battery at last about 36 hours was about
the use I was getting before I really
felt like I needed to charge back up the
battery usage the meter within windows
mobile drops pretty quickly and then as
it gets down to the last quarter or so
of power it it seems to slow down
dropping so you may see sudden drops but
then it may last pretty good while and
at last quarter charged as a microSD
slot on the side which is covered up by
the battery cover to keep your car
protected
and along the front here we've got a
qwerty keyboard I was concerned the
buttons looked a little small but using
it there raised up enough and have good
good enough separation that my thumb's
were okay to press buttons and
distinguish between them as i was typing
didn't really have any typos you don't
have any arrow keys to navigate within
text you'd have to use the optical mouse
here to do that which at times could be
a little bit tricky not as convenient as
the d-pad or having some sort of arrow
keys to navigate as you might find on a
slide out keyboard the screen is two
point six inch 320 x 320 resolution
provides a good look to it on the side
here is a button for changing the use of
optical mouse between a navigation mode
and a mouse mode i sometimes found using
this optical mouse as you go to click it
to tap on something the mouse would jump
and you might click the item beside the
item your intended click not a major
problem take some getting used to if you
used to using a d-pad I think overall i
prefer the d-pad but it's not a bad
experience using this the phone overall
I tend to like it I don't know that
switch to from my current t mobile wing
I prefer the larger screen even though
the resolution is in this group as great
as this one I just prefer the larger
screen to work with gives you a little
bit more just to see on screen and slide
out keyboard gives you a little more
space to work with but overall not a bad
phone a pretty good hardware package if
you're looking for a nice windows mobile
phone for international travel samsung
saga might be something with dad just
remember to take your charger with you
wherever you go so that you are ready to
charge at any time that's the samsung
saga hardware tour join us again as we
take a look at the software here Neil's
