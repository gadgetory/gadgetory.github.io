as your way of unlocking the speed you
need this is the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus
what Samsung calls as the camera
reimagined the idea of comparing two of
the best Android phones of 2018 at this
time of year is truly enticing when it's
famous for being really aggressive about
pricing and the other is famous for
becoming really affordable after it ages
so let the games begin
I'm hanging out at even our pocket now
and this is 1 plus 60 vs. samsung galaxy
s
we're in the United States you probably
noticed just how much fanfare was given
to the 1 plus 60 for finally making a
launch in a US carrier and we're also
sure that it makes you wonder if it's
worth considering over an already
established product from Samsung
visually both devices aren't really that
much different and you might even think
that this portion of the comparison
belongs to the galaxy given its added
premium but it's actually the other way
around see the 1 + 6 C doesn't just
launch with a fancy treatment in the
glass to make it less prone to
fingerprints and smudges but this is
Gorilla Glass 6 versus Gorilla Glass 5
on the galaxy s 9 plus we also have
better dimensions on the 60 which is one
millimeter smaller one millimeter wider
and less than a millimeter slimmer and
four grams lighter all while sporting
200 milliamp hours more of battery than
the s 9 plus and then internally even if
we have the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
on both devices the 60 can extend to a
gigs of ram versus the standard 6 on the
s9 plus it starts at double the storage
at 128 gig versus 64 and has way faster
charging than the s9 plus yes the galaxy
does have expandable storage but the 60
is dual SIM if you choose the
international variant really the only
spots where the s 9 plus wins is in
sporting and IP rating for water and
dust resistance where the 60 is splash
resistant but no rating was provided
also with the inclusion of wireless
charging which the 16 doesn't have and
oh yeah the galaxy s 9 plus does have a
headphone jack where the 16 doesn't the
galaxy does include a more immersive
experience for consuming content though
we're talking quad HD plus resolution
versus Full HD plus we're talking curves
all around this gorgeous infinity design
as well and we also have more features
being supported like HDR 10 where the 60
only claims the DCI p3 color gamut where
the 60 wins is in having a larger
display at 6.41 inches diagonal vs. 6.2
on a slightly smaller body but then the
s9 plus swings back with the lack of a
knotch and stereo speakers which improve
content consumption
our love for a few key essentials that
Apple hasn't named iPhones our lover of
key essentials has nailed ever since as
for biometrics the galaxy has the
conventional fingerprint scanner at the
back and then iris scanner at the front
but the one +60 makes the galaxy look
really old but it's on display
fingerprint scanner along with one of
the fastest face to unlock features that
we've tested hardware is really tight
between the two but I do feel that the
60 wins in a few more key areas in the
galaxy as for the software let's just
call the oneplus 60 the winner one more
time I know that there are some of you
that like Samsung's experienced UX but
there's a reason why the company is
teasing a new UI at its developer
conference this approach is already due
for a change
sure it looks fancier and yes I do love
the denser grid of icons yes I also do
praise the edge menus which I depend on
constantly but the major problem is that
all this fancy stuff comes at the
expense of it being stuck way behind in
versions of Android I'm actually one of
those people that doesn't really say oh
I prefer stock Android at least not for
the aesthetics though the reason I do
care is because it's easier to update as
the one plus 60 is already rocking the
latest version of Android Pi it already
confirms to the new pixel pill gesture
navigation approach and it even brings
its own gestures which I consider to be
better and which the galaxy doesn't
include if software updates speed and
performance and simplicity are your cup
of tea than the one plus 60 is the
winner yet again now in all fairness I
can't really say that I notice any
crippling lag on the s9 plus even with
all its floats the 60 does navigate
menus faster simply because there are
barely any animations but even when
playing games both devices perform great
also of an essential like battery life
is what you care about then let's give
the crown to the 60 I did this funny
test the other day where I put both
devices off the charger for a full day
without touching them and the oneplus 60
was still at 80 percent battery while
the galaxy s 9 plus was scratching 30
there was seriously just too much going
on in the background and then in regular
use the 60 ends
the day with enough juice to give me an
extra one while the galaxy has nine plus
ends the day fine but you'll need a
charger every night and then when it
comes to phone calls both devices
perform great data speeds are also
fantastic as both devices on the
t-mobile network are using the same
modem from Qualcomm which performs
awesome
now with the galaxy s 9 plus the feats
the one plus 60 is in the camera you'd
assume that the newer 60 would win this
one but it seems that Sammy has been
hard at work in updating the s 9 plus to
be on par with the note 9 for starters
the s 9 plus has better specifications
thanks to a 12 megapixel camera with
dual F 1.5 or F 2.4 aperture a 26
millimeter equivalent and 1.4 microns it
also has a 12 megapixel F 2.4 telephoto
a 252 millimeter equivalent and microns
that are standard sized the 60 on the
other hand has a 16 megapixel camera at
1.7 aperture a wider 25 millimeter
equivalent but only one point to 2
microns meaning that it won't capture as
much light in dark scenarios and I won't
even waste your time about detailing the
secondary camera as it's more an
assistant during the day photos are
great on both and you'll even have a
hard time telling the difference in back
let scenarios I do have to praise
oneplus for its great dynamic range even
if I feel the galaxy does a better job
at capturing detail the problem is once
you stack both phones in low-light
scenarios
surely the oneplus 60 has nightscape for
long exposure but even that does not
compare to the galaxy s 9 plus you
simply can't beat physics with larger
microns faster aperture and a larger
sensor the s 9 plus really owns
low-light to an insane degree portrait
photography is good on both devices with
a 60 rendering more natural results in
my opinion but the s 9 plus wins in
having the option to toggle how much
background blur you want or none at all
when it comes to video recording I like
the results on both devices great
civilization great detail though I drift
more to the 60 when it comes to it being
less warp II and then more to the s 9
plus R its color though selfie video is
a
by the s-line plus because it has the
Edit advantage of 2k resolution where
the 1 plus 60 is stuck at 1080p to
conclude I think it's fair to say that
this is a very close call sure the 1
plus 60 has the better specifications in
some areas but the galaxy also beats the
60 in others I do prefer the software
approach of the 60 and the battery life
now that you can subsidize the 1 plus 60
on t-mobile and that there are some
insane deals for it the pricing makes
this comparison even more challenging as
sure you can find deals for the galaxy
but they aren't as aggressive as for the
1 plus 60 we do have to call a winner
though and if this were my money I'd
give this comparison to the 1 plus 60 I
feel that you're getting more value for
your money and a more future proof
product for the long run the galaxy s 9
plus is still a great phone a fantastic
contender but even with the current
deals the 1 plus 16 makes the galaxy
look overpriced definitely a better
option in my opinion how about you which
one would you pick let us know in the
