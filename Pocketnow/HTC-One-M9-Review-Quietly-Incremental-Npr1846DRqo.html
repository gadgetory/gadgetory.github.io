bears a look and feel right out of 2014
and for that matter 2013 as well in a
period of startling reinvention from the
competition was sticking to the formula
the right move let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our video review of the HTC one
m9 HTC has made a name for itself
over the years with hardware of
uncharacteristically high quality and
the m9 continues that tradition the new
phone adds double anodization to last
year's brushed aluminum housing giving
our silver and gold review unit a
two-tone dual finish appearance to go
with its substantial feel in the hand
last year's wraparound sides and
slippery coating have given way to a
blockier build and the somewhat tacky or
finish and the result is a phone that's
easier to hold than the m8 though i
could do without the razor-sharp edges
on the backside fortunately case makers
like spec have already started churning
out accessories that make the m9 a
little easier on the palm less likely to
get scratched as well but then of course
you're covering up the design one of the
phone's main selling points HTC has
finally relocated its power standby key
to the side for easier locking and
unlocking and atop those buttons sits
the micro SD card slot making for a
fairly crowded side rail the m9 brings a
familiar face to the equation with a
Super LCD 3 display flanked by twin
speakers and protected by a sheet of
Gorilla Glass the whole thing held in
place by a single piece bezel in a world
where super high resolution displays are
gradually becoming the norm the pixel
density here might seem a bit low on
paper but in real life I never once
found myself wishing for a higher res
what I did want was something a little
more adaptable with some competitor
screens able to go much dimmer and/or
the m9s display feels somewhat limited
by comparison the boom sound speakers at
top and bottom have gotten even more
capable with the addition of Dolby is
5.1 surround
the price for the sound quality hasn't
changed the m9 is still taller than many
smartphones due to the speaker's
themselves and the gap beneath the
display which accommodates hardware
displaced by the speaker's large chamber
size if you ask me the trade-off is
worth it
against other smartphones with front
firing speakers the One m-9s sound isn't
always louder but it is richer and
cleaner the audio upgrades carry over to
the earphones as well with the
increasingly common 24-bit audio support
bolstered by a dedicated amplifier
whether you use the included earbuds or
you're wrong
HTC took the opportunity to refresh its
Android skin with the m9 shipping the
new Sense 7 atop Android lollipop the
tap to unlock gestures are convenient as
long as you remember that their motion
activated they depend on you picking up
the phone first double tap to get to the
lockscreen and depending on the time of
day you'll get a customized
recommendation for where to grab lunch
dinner or a mid afternoon coffee nearby
since has gotten a slight visual upgrade
with more transparency throughout and
the predominantly flat look of Android
lollipop you also get a space for an
extra button in the home key row
probably best used as a toggle to
trigger the notification shade though
other options are available as well also
HTC's 9x9 multitasking view is back and
it now spans more than one page to
accommodate more cards in its quest to
separate the software experience from
the old desktop models of your HTC has
implemented what it calls Sense home a
widget that tries to determine what apps
you'll need based on whether you're at
home at work or out on the town in my
testing it delivered about halfway on
its promise I like the new downloads
folder for corralling recently purchased
apps but the behavior prediction wasn't
great it took several days to learn my
preferences and even once it got to know
me it was constantly shuffling at
positions around which was annoying the
irony is that while you're waiting for
it to learn you're getting to your apps
via the app drawer precisely the thing
HTC is trying to leave behind the whole
thing is great in theory but as of now
it feels a little under
on the brighter side blinkfeed remains
for quick surfing through your social
and news feeds and it's more
customizable than ever before
speaking of customization one of our few
complaints from sense 6 was how
difficult it was to make it your own
with only four color schemes to choose
from HTC has more than addressed that
issue with sense 7 bringing an entire
theming engine so you can tweak and
tailor everything from the keyboard
color to icon shapes to typefaces or
have the m9 create its own theme based
on the colors in a photo you take
speaking of photos if you're a pixel
fanatic you'll be right at home here HTC
is stopped trying to reinvent the wheel
with the m9 s camera as chewing
ultrapixels and duo sensors for a more
conventional 20 megapixel camera it's
now protected by sapphire cover material
a good thing since it protrudes slightly
from the casing you might think that's a
result of adding Hardware stabilization
but no oh is is not on board the camera
software has been revised and now
includes a full suite of manual controls
as well as a host of more modern dare I
say more hip photo effects that will
keep creative types entertained for
hours face fusion is fun enough and yeah
creepy enough with people you know but
get celebrity screenshots in on the
action and watch the lulls flow double
exposure is a neat trick allowing you to
blend elements from two separate photos
to create something entirely new for
something a little crisper you can blend
photos using shapes and edgy masking
it's all much more artistic than split
capture though that's still here too for
shooting with both cameras at once
flying particle effects from snow
flurries to bubble storms prismatic
overlays it's by far the coolest effect
suite available right out of the box the
m9 s got itself a fun camera
but is it a good camera well that
depends on what time of day you're
taking pictures the viewfinder is a
snappy as ever and HTC has finally
calmed down the wild exposure swings
when using tap to focus and if it's a
bright or even an overcast day and
you're outside snapping away you'll
really appreciate the high resolution
which delivers crisp detail and fairly
nice color particularly in the cooler
tones move indoors and as long as the
light keeps up the photo quality does
too but with an F 2.2 lens and no
optical stabilization photo quality
diminishes dramatically as the light
gets dimmer the phone has trouble
keeping focus in low-light environments
and the propensity to favor the cooler
side of the spectrum gets much worse
switching from automatic into night mode
makes for much brighter photos but the
longer exposure time paired with no
optical stabilization leads to motion
blur more often than not and digital
noise is just everywhere
fortunately HTC hasn't completely put
its ultrapixel technology out to pasture
the m9 z' front-facing camera is
basically a repackaged version of the
main camera from the m8 which makes for
awesome selfies in low-light or
otherwise the end of the day what makes
the m9 s camera worthwhile is the
feature load not the raw performance
this is a very fun camera to play around
with whether you're blending faces with
Facebook friends or spamming Instagram
with double exposures and if that's
mainly what you're going to use it for
you'll be fine but it's underwhelming in
low-light it's often straight up bad in
camcorder mode and its focus has a
tendency to wander in many situations we
shouldn't be seeing issues like this on
a flagship smartphone in 2015 especially
not from a manufacturer that's come up
short in the camera category so many
times before
finally there's the m9s day-to-day
performance I wasn't sure what to expect
from the Snapdragon 810 and it's widely
reported thermal issues especially given
the m9 s metal casing but over eight
days of use on t-mobile us I never found
the phone too hot to handle
it never heated up during normal low
impact stuff like email texting and
tweeting and since was as responsive as
ever it's still one of the snappiest
Android skins around I can only bug the
phone down when installing many apps at
once and I could only get the phone to
run hot with graphics heavy games like
sky gamblers air supremacy even then
after 30 minutes of flying the metal
casing was only 99 degrees Fahrenheit at
its hottest point a half-hour of asphalt
8 immediately afterward managed to push
it a bit past that but the highest
temperature I got was 103 still far
short of what we've seen on some older
devices those games did blast a sizable
hole in battery life as you might expect
an hour total between the two of them
knocked me down by 50% that's not
uncommon though and with typical use
including everything from social surfing
to turn-by-turn navigation I was able to
get between 14 and 16 hours between
charges on the m9 without resorting to
HTC's extreme power saving mode we
advised that our review unit was a
European model we'll have more details
on voice quality endurance and network
performance once we test a US branded
sample so what we have with the one m9
is the very definition of a small subtle
upgrade an HTC knows it the company
wants you to focus on the little things
with the one m9 with its beautifully
crafted hardware and best-in-class
third-party interface that's not hard to
do if you already own a One m8 you could
definitely be forgiven for sitting this
one out
the m9 is for people who haven't owned
an HTC phone before like an S model
iPhone it's meant to be familiar rather
than groundbreaking accessible rather
than revolutionary it's a worthy if
unexcited custodian of HTC's reputation
for
connick smartphone design we have much
more on the HTC One m9 including video
samples and many more photos in our full
