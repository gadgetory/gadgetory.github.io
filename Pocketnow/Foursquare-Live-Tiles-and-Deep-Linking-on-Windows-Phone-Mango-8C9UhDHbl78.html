calm and I'm going to show you a few the
new cool features in the foursquare app
for mango so let's check it out first
off let's see how the deep linking works
so I'm not going to tap the force crack
on I'm going to the maps and then I'm
going to go to the local Scout and say
we're here this is a location card so
I'm going to swipe over here and now i
have foursquare search as an app that's
going to go straight to foursquare
search for that location and then i will
be able to get to that location and now
i can check in and read tips and all the
normal things you could do in foursquare
so that's a really great way to quickly
get to locations from outside of
foursquare now let's go back and get
straight to the for scrap
so we're starting it again and it's
going to load some places and here's a
cool feature I can tap and hold on a
location and then do fast chicken so
that's pretty much two steps to do check
in so that's pretty cool now here's
another feature each location now has an
option to pin to start so now that
locations right here I can always access
it and quickly check in right from the
start menu and but look at that it
flipped over in there's picture pretty
cool now it also supports fast app
switching so if I hold down back you can
see there it is and it is usable right
away there's no resuming restarting so
that's really excellent as well
still has to load things and that's kind
of slow so that's it for the new cool
mango features in the foursquare app
pretty nice that's it for now
