saw last year one of our favorites with
the Sony Xperia tablet Z and now we get
to see its successor the Sony Xperia
tablet Z 2 I love these names we're at
the sony booth sony behind the camera
high memory better let's go through it
okay there are a lot of really cool
things about this tablet but let's be
specific about the coolest parts first
of all we've got this plastic aluminum
mold on this tablet with a plastic back
this time we do not have a glass back on
this tablet as we did last time but it
is just this then if not a little bit
thinner when compared to the tablet Z
and we've got this gorgeous 1920 x 1200
display sadly it's not a high high
resolution display as other tablets but
if you look at it honestly it does look
very very well there are no viewing
angles issues on this tablet as we've
had with previous sony products in the
past that looks really really good but
aside from that what we have as an 8
megapixel camera on this tablet at the
back we have the same exmor r technology
aside from a 2 megapixel camera at the
front and apparently it's got some smart
social camera features aside from that
another one of the cool enhancements of
this tablet is the fact that we do have
friend fine speakers even though they do
look smaller according to sony they will
do a great job at work now there are
some LTE and Wi-Fi variants for this
tablet we've got NFC we've got an IR
remote blaster here MHL and well aside
from that we also have a Snapdragon 801
processor clocked at 2.3 gigahertz three
gigs of RAM SD card support up to 64
gigs and we also have 16 gigs of
internal storage aside from a 6000
milliamp hour battery so far I'll tell
you this much it feels just to like to
feel like a tablet but it is a gorgeous
thing we will definitely be testing it
in our pocket and labs very soon but
I'll tell you this much there's probably
one of the best android tablet I've seen
so far high meadow a letter from
pocketnow.com Tony behind the camera
we're at the sony booth and we've got
more coverage coming up soon
