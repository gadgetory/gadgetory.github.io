smartphone offerings some are great at
harnessing simplicity others it being
the best all-rounder there are some that
do a better job at addressing the audio
file and video creator and then there
are the phones at the thigh everyone at
offering greatness for nearly half the
price so when Samsung claims that the
new Galaxy Note is designed to do bigger
things a phone that's even priced on the
premise that it can help you achieve
more well that's kind of a tall order
the question is can it really deliver
I'm high metal even out with pocket now
and let's find out whether Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 review brought to you by D
Brand when Samson created the phablet
category with the Galaxy Note the idea
was to blur the lines between smartphone
and tablet instead of buying two devices
why not just buy one that includes a
smart stylus as a cherry topper fast
forward to 2017 and even the diehard
naysayers have learned to admit that
there is value in a more precise user
interface and what makes amzing Zapote
special is that competitors still
require you to buy a tablet for that
experience while the note is a more
portable and utilitarian approach as
such the Galaxy Note 8 achieves the
basic principle of being a gorgeous
smartphone the glass on glass finish and
the aluminum trim sandwich perfectly to
achieve an amazing feel in the hand the
sharper corners at the top and bottom
evoke a more Notepad feel but the taller
aspect ratio addresses the need of
making it feel like a phone as well at
6.3 inches diagonal this is the largest
display ever built into a galaxy note
with curves on the borders to create the
infinity display effect that we've come
to praised with Super AMOLED technology
punchy saturation is a given and a 1200
nits this is the brightest experience
you can get for direct sunlight
it's internals are the most powerful you
can buy on a galaxy as well or unlock
very in sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
processor six gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of storage and yes this is the
only portable notepad in the market that
you can also get wet and actually use
while wet thanks to ip68 water and dust
resistance if you're a fan of black
phones this is a pitch dark as it gets
so prepare for the fingerprint
reflections and smudges the orchid gray
color option will do a better job at
addressing that or do what we do and
just let a deep brand skin take care of
that and to get the obvious out of the
way you will hate the placement of the
fingerprint scanner having the iris
scanner set up as an alternative can be
convenient even though it can be
unreliable in direct sunlight second yes
this is not a one-handed phone no matter
how large your hands are Samsung bundles
software to help you achieve quick rich
ability but this is that one phone you
actually want to be large the rest of
the time see as an au-pair replacement
you actually need the larger canvas the
jot notes comfortably reach ability is
not the only thing the software does
right samsung experience 8.5 has
designed around the operation of the
s-pen it is your surrogate Mouse when
you need it it helps you glance at
information without the need to select
it it helps you turn this phone into a
notepad without even turning it on and
to be able to enjoy this experience I
would not install the third-party
launcher if I were you
our preview video goes into all the
details of what the software can do my
final verdict is that Samsung has
clearly stayed away from its gimmicky
past
I simply love how app pairs helps me
launch my favorite combo of applications
and how it's made the edge display
relevant to me secure folder has killed
my need to have a company phone than a
personal phone and now I won't show you
my personal conversations to prove it
but the combination that continuously
makes the Galaxy Note my daily driver is
how it blends with Microsoft tools
OneNote continues to be my favorite
notetaking application and to be able to
scribble on my notes sign documents on
the fly or doodle my excel sheets is
just priceless yes these services work
with your finger but the precision
provided by the s-pen has no room for
comparison and last but not least this
whole contextual approach of VIX B has
really won me over lately it definitely
deserves a separate video and we'll be
working on that in a near future I've
been using the Galaxy Note 8 for nearly
two weeks between New York City and San
Diego California
in typical Samsung fashion phone calls
are loud and you can make them louder
through software and the speaker will
also get the job done like my only
complaint is to have a single firing
speaker on a phone this large as
immersive as this display can be
muffling the experience throws
everything out the window for content
consumption
or if you want ITIN devil now those two
extra gigs of RAM have proven to be
quite valuable with this phone the
experience is fluid a hundred percent of
the time and near games will play
without stutter no matter how much you
try to tax this phone and then the added
bonus of Android 7.1.1 has actually
brought some peace of mind when it comes
to battery life those concerned with the
smaller 3300 milliamp hour power pack
will be happy to see that this phone can
actually get through a day of heavy use
and that's what the gear s3 piggybacking
on Bluetooth no this is not a phone that
will get you beyond the day and it's
about my only complaint in making this
fully replace an inanimate notepad also
in typical Samsung fashion this camera
is the best option you'll find when it
comes to the whole zoom approach the
photography I was actually not a fan of
portrait photos until I started using
the note 8 and it's not really because
of the effect but what I liked the most
is that you don't really have to stick
with this photo you can dial back the
effect or switch it off but hey Quan is
our expert and his real camera review is
already live all I can say is that
Samsung continues to surprise with one
of the most reliable cameras in the
business saturation and detail are given
and manual controls always come to the
rescue whenever you want to dial
something down which I use constantly
with low-light photography
Samsung is also my favorite when it
comes to selfie photos though selfie
video continues to be my pet peeve
because of its horrible crop I'd use
video more for the primary shooter
though I joined hewan and not liking the
whole zoom control blend it to the
shutter button even though the final
experience in video is actually really
good
to conclude I think it's appropriate to
recall on the galaxy s 8 as the best
all-rounder that phone that does the
best in all scenarios this means that
the Galaxy Note 8 doesn't just achieve
the same premise given its similarities
but actually allows you to do more what
they're doing more actually adds value
to your day is really up to you and
we've tried to portray those differences
as much as possible in our coverage my
needs have had me rely on galaxy note
since its second-generation and after a
bitter year of time off with the note 7
debacle I'll gladly admit that this
feels like coming home bottom line you
don't need an S Pen and if you see
things from that perspective than
coughing extra money for it might not be
worth it for you and let us know in the
comments if you'd like a separate video
for the s-pen just to help you decide
and all honesty I don't use it all the
time but boy is it great to have it
around every once in a while the s-pen
along with the whole ensemble of
features makes the Galaxy Note stand
apart it's not just any phablet I can
definitely consider this a product on a
category of its own and I can easily
recommend that as the best phablet of
2017 and folks remember you shouldn't
settle for a smudge and fingerprint fest
with your new Galaxy Note B brown skins
we'll eliminate those fingerprints and
add some grip to your upcoming Galaxy
Note 8 or any galaxy phone for that
matter
