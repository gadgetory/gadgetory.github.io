number two for us both on camera number
two can mean a lot of things true that
we'll just say it's the good stuff it is
the good stuff this is eva 2016 i am
high never be better I'm one Carlos back
now this is pocket now let's wrap it up
all of pocket now is Eva 2016 coverage
is brought to you by XCOM global so to
begin disclaimer this is actually our
first Aoife number one but number two
both of us this is our first trade show
covering the show flow together and it
is an awesome experience on you're an
awesome guy it was actually getting to
tag team this with you because I've
covered these kinds of events by myself
and this is a lot more fun but then
again this trade show oh it's big well I
mean it is it's one of the world's
largest consumer electronic shows but
it's also in a really large and spread
out venue and then there are so many
amazing little sightseeing opportunities
around Berlin that the companies that
were at they're showing their products
you know we had a lot of commute time
between these different setup oh my gosh
the challenges of trying to get this
video footage up to you guys up on the
youtubes I was definitely something that
a I personally wasn't completely
prepared for no it was challenging too
much commuting too much even there are
just Navy an idea there are shuttles
within the mess up just for you to go
from one booth to the other just over
how complex was i definitely appreciated
that because my dogs is tired i had no
problem getting all of my step goals in
for this week oh yeah but regardless of
that berlin was beautiful accommodating
we cannot wait to do it again the people
here were a lot of fun the food was
great absolutely looking forward to this
in future iterations of hepa the beer
was great the beer with a half of ison
some of the things we thought were
really hot from the show floor actually
this was a great year for wearables and
so after the asus press conference got a
great first look at the a suzanne watch
three definitely something we're going
to be interested in checking out in the
future a Seuss's first circular watch
face design and it you got to spend some
time with the gallic the gear s3 the
samsung gear oh this is interesting so
Samsung rented the tempo drone for this
event obviously it's a circular design
district hollow on the gears 3 I found
that to be probably the hottest product
interesting that it's a wearable it's
just Sam
just really nailed it with this product
they forgot the whole geekiness they
started remembering the average person
actually wants a fashionable watch and
that's what I consider to be the best
part of the gr s3 right well and also
seeing a sous take some of those design
cues you know the rose gold accents the
stainless steel body really addressing
the form because we've got a lot of the
function in place that we've got a lot
of the tech now is this something you
really want to wear on your body does it
complement your style and that that
conversation was echoed throughout a
number of the other manufacturers
putting out wearables this year indeed
indeed and I was also surprised by
Huawei yes we got a para phones out of
Huawei this year the Nova and the Nova
plus um again adding to that competition
in the sort of mid-range market that
four-hundred-dollar / euro price point
is getting increasingly competitive just
like the fact that Nova looks like a
mini Nexus 6p which is awesome what they
it was smart for them to build on that
and actually the MediaPad I'm three
looking like the same you know taking
someone's what we liked about the p 9
and sort of curving it around sort of
softening the edges and I have to admit
it I mean a year ago talking about
Huawei was we wouldn't but then Huawei
launched the Nexus and the company just
has continued to push the bar absolutely
design and and where we were sort of
under estimating them as a manufacturer
in North America they've come out full
force with a number a range of products
that I think are very exciting they even
taught us how to take a selfie now
obviously not everything is perfect I
think that the huawei segment was the
perfect segue for the fact that where
were the flagships oh yeah think about
it sony announced their new exploit that
was the one flagship we guys so we have
the xperia x ian the xperia x compact
and i have to say like while it was fun
and it was interesting playing with
those devices on the floor it was a very
underwhelming right I feel that Sony has
lost a lot of mine chair a lot of loss I
like the company that we knew a decade
ago oh wow Sony we don't see that
anymore and it's actually the result of
the company's products lately i mean the
x performance underwhelmed everybody
there was nothing no performance there
whatsoever but then again I guess
guess the point that I'm trying to make
is this was the freemium mid-ranger
event after it also covered a lot of
wearables and a lot of fitness products
very little everything else no flagships
the only flagship that could have been
announced at this event is currently
having explosion problems we'll probably
cover that in future videos very soon
yeah about you what do you think well I
thought we got a good response on the
axon 7 mini again sort of adding to that
discussion on Rangers but absolutely
nailing that topic internet of things
the way that we connect all of our
devices to our various smart hubs and
communication outlets we actually have
we have to appeal to you guys out there
in the community out there in the
audience because we have something of a
quandary you know when we're walking the
show floor and we're seeing some of
these amazing innovations with smart
refrigerators smart microwave smart
toaster smart washer and dryers yeah how
we are supposed to broach that subject
with you guys out there in the community
because obviously our beat is something
usually a little bit more stuff that can
fit in your pocket lesson appliances and
washing machine we're not refrigerator
now or but we've seen amazing progress
in connecting those devices to hubs to
Wi-Fi to computers into smartphones and
tablets so really we could be curious to
hear from you all how should we go about
covering some of the stuff when we have
access to it so that we're also not
inundating you with a number of applying
that and I guess the reason why that is
so important as a question is because
Aoife is mainly that this is a trade
show for appliances it's huge but it's
full of TVs refrigerators I've never
seen so many blenders yeah smart blender
smart blenders and companies are using
this trade show to showcase the future
of their connectivity obviously it's
going to take some time you're probably
some of you will probably only by a
smart blender but in the case of us I
don't think I'm gonna replace mine you
know I'm good right now I've got it I've
got a ninja now obviously aside from the
hot stuff the challenges there were
things that really surprise this and
that's that's a tall order for us geeks
yeah well I mean every time I walk a
show floor I want to walk away with
something that I wasn't expecting that
bloom you
that knocked my socks off it blew you
away cuz you hadn't seen it the yoga
book from Lenovo was a product that I
don't know if you see our outro from mwc
that is the product that we saw back to
me then that was still a prototype that
we could not talk about it was announced
at this event it was everything that we
expected it to be I love the fact that
there's an option for Windows but what
do you think you have the hand the
hands-on opportunity yeah getting to
spend some time with it it's it's such a
fascinating example of what we can do to
come up with creative solutions to some
of the challenges inherent in mobile
year so first of all it just looks like
it came out of the movie Tron you know
like he's typing what I'm lessers it's
so cool so that that effect works really
well and then also sort of bringing back
we're looping around to finding some of
those great analog interfaces so when
you you set a piece of paper down on it
and you're drawing on that piece of
paper and you have real pen and ink and
then that's translated in a really great
way in a digital way as your screen that
works really really well but my biggest
surprise was the price tag yeah and that
we're coming in at reasonable prices for
a bleeding edge interactive surface a
completely unique product yeah totally I
think the price tag was the most killer
part of it I cannot wait to review it
I'm looking forward to that one but then
that was your surprise my surprise so
this is called as ignorance or whatever
so I had no clue that the fossil group
for example was a group I've been a
fossil user aware for 10 years I love
their watches and then I walk in and I
learned that obviously they acquired
misfit that's right um but so they have
misfit in their portfolio but then
fossil is also an odm so they came up
with their lineup of q founder watches
now we've got the q wander wander and
the marshal but because they're an odm
to companies like michael kors to
companies like Scoggins your sample I'll
going on so now you can get a michael
course android wear smart watch because
fossil has created that platform i think
this is awesome i mean we don't wanted
android wear to take off for the longest
stories are growing right and i think
this is the smartest way to compete
everybody knows Michael course everybody
knows a lot of these companies like like
you and you in your case for example
yeah I'm gonna hear Scoggin Fanta I know
you were going on like really checking
out the michael kors
I used to own an old scoggin watch and
so to then see what they were doing with
connectivity with fitness tracking with
notifications on a very simple watch but
then in a hybrid way you know it's not
Android where it's something you need to
fossil it reminds us of the co ji dou up
but in a much better implement and more
stylish it a lot more private
implementation I feel that that was
smart in the case of smaug and clean and
then also you know just the practicality
of having a connected device that's
giving you notifications and alerts that
you don't have to charge about four
months every six months and then to see
that into flip it and and know that
there's increasing competition for that
kind that style of watch but we got to
spend some time with Withings you know
so post Nokia acquisition who they also
are coming up with their own solutions
for I think they're watch lasts for 25
days on a single battery and it's a very
similar implementation very clean
efficient watch face and a very simple
style for delivering you pertinent
information while tracking heart rate
and your sleep cycle and an active heart
rate monitor built into it I mean this
is exactly the kind of progress we
wanted to see again we don't want all of
our tech to just advertise geek all the
time sometimes we need a little geek
chic that we can blend in a bit better
but anyways this is our surprise tell us
about you in the comments down below
what surprised you about FIFA 2016 we
already told you what we thought this
was a great show such a pleasure to
cover it was he a lot of fun man we
gotta do this again I know maybe um
maybe something in like Barcelona I'd
love that see you there instead of
paying horrible roaming fees when
traveling abroad or the hassle of buying
another sim why not try a smarter
