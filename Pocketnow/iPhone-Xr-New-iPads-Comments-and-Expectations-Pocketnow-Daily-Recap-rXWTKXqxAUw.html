you're gonna be at the event say hi
we're gonna be there and have some fun
for those of you that won't do not
forget to sign up for the live stream
pocketnow.com / 1 + 60 for more
information in the link in the
description i'm is a type of guy to try
on shirts that fit just right and then
go a size smaller dude if only shirts
would not shrink in the dryer pisses me
off after the bus for the LGV 20 please
the LGBTQ 20 just got oreo you mean
after the funeral drink every time hi
miss says I have to agree I have to
agree you're gonna get drunk that's
right it's that time of the week I'm hi
I'm everything up this is pocket now and
this is the pocket now daily recap your
comments for last week the news on
Monday were about iPads and the rumors
that the headphone jack was going to die
but for reason the iPads were gonna get
extremely thin up to the point where
it's just not gonna fit I asked you what
did you think about that and we had 516
comments iPads being primarily a media
consumption device I feel like a
headphone jack is even more important
than it is on a phone yes definitely I
will definitely complain about the lack
of a headphone jack on iPads but then
like if you've seen for example the case
of the asou Sark rog phone you've got
pretty much two USB seaports like if
they would give me that or give me a
lightning and a USBC connector I'd be
fine like for me it's the fact that you
only have one port and iPads have 10
hours of battery life where flights the
China or 15 thickness is no excuse to
lose the headphone jack who told Apple
we want a tablet that thin anyway okay
so what I like about iPads the most is
that they feel like a note pad they feel
like a notebook something that you can
write on and Barcelona I just scored
another goal right now I'm actually
watching the game aside from the camera
we're currently 5-1
sorry about that but yeah I mean I feel
that iPads have that advantage that
they're so practical you don't even
think twice about having them in a book
bag and that's why I really want them to
get thinner Apple is okay with a camera
bump but can't do an earphone jack bump
the too thin
thing is a lame excuse you know I've
seen companies pull it off with Ethernet
ports that's probably not a bad idea but
I feel the mechanism would probably be a
loss of space as well and then on
Tuesday we were in London I was covering
the mate 20 Pro which oh my god like I
have it right here it's actually helping
me control the camera and I asked you
what were your impressions we had 352
comments can we say that it's already
the best vote of 2018 yes I can probably
say that there's still more I we're
taking our time with the review because
the software wasn't final now that it is
- well no wait I got the razor phone
update I'm waiting for this update so
once that software's final I'll tell you
if it is or not such a shame that this
beast doesn't come to the United States
such a shame indeed I was talking to
certain people yesterday and they were
like my god I had that made 10 Pro I
really want that made 20 but then this
and that and yeah it's a bad problem
mate Tony Pro is the business move aside
everyone else iPhone 7 plus user I know
well I have to say that if the mate 20
Pro wasn't such a dramatic departure
from everything else I'd say yeah no you
know it's a me-too phone but it's not
and then on Wednesday the topic was the
pixel 3 Excel there were news that we
finally got a Samsung panel back and
that's the reason why the display is
better I asked you what you thought
about this if that influenced your
buying decision and we had 505 comments
ok the display is better than expected
hopefully not blue gate but there's
still no expandable storage and no
headphone jack and it's just an Android
version of the iPhone it isn't that the
Android version of the iPhone the
display is better but but it's not that
bright and if you're taking if you're
out in bright sunlight and you want to
take a photo you would assume that your
galaxy or whatever other phone you have
there takes better photos just because
the display is brighter and you get to
see more color it's not it's actually a
great camera but the problem is yes I
don't feel the display is great it needs
to get brighter no I'm not buying one
this knotch
is bigger than my forehead dude and it's
bigger than mine and that's a tall
statement dude it's bigger than my
forehead and that's really hard to
achieve so my god I'm willing to buy a
pixel 3 Excel Samsung displays are great
Samsung displays are
I just wish that we had Samsung displays
fully because I mean you have 1000 nits
on the galaxy note 9 and then this pixel
I think this pixel is not any higher
than like five or six hundred something
like that oh my god then on Thursday the
topic was the Apple events that had a
just announced on October 30th which was
also the date for the oneplus event
which I'm currently here for and I asked
you like if you had to pick which event
would you go to as well back then there
was no change to the oneplus event we
had 347 comments I have no interest in
Apple products but I have even less
interest in notch phones without
headphone jacks can I just go to the bar
instead first rounds on me
oneplus event hands down I'm glad I
won't have to choose anymore yes oneplus
event I'll see you there Apple product
launch is boring oneplus just became one
- by removing poor Jack so ignore both
and enjoy life I don't think that's the
case I feel that there are things about
the oneplus 60 that will make it
interesting obviously we have to see the
phone first but I'm also excited about
the iPad event I'm not gonna lie I
really really want a new iPad i I need a
replacement and then finally on Friday
the topic was the iPhone 10 are the
product had just been released I asked
you were you ordering one of these
phones and we had 316 comments waiting
to see the oneplus 60 and the Galaxy S
10 before making a decision I don't
blame you on that one dude price of
iPhone 10 R is more than its display
capability holy Apple you know not just
that you still have devices like the
iPhone 8 plus that have a subpar display
let's just call it that way compared to
everything launched this here and most
products launched last year and also
priced crazy so yeah I ordered three
iPhone 10 ours three different colors
red blue and coral god dude that I all
right enjoy it have a good one I hope
that's it for the bargain now it's daily
