we're going to spend a little time
checking out this retro mashup of a mid
ranger but first we've got to get it out
of the box I'm Juan Carlos bag now for
pocket now and here's our first
impressions of the iPhone se tearing
open the packaging there's immediately a
sense of deja vu the phone greets you up
top as per usual a little packet of
papers won't ever be read but the
stickers are a nice touch
underneath we've got the ear pods the AC
adapter and a lightning cable this
cheaper iPhone outfitted like any other
iPhone might be as per usual and then
you hold the phone in your hands and
yeah it really is an iPhone 5s shell did
you think they were gonna be any
surprises there because no there are not
any surprises but that's not really
what's interesting about this little
bugger though rockin my preferred space
grey metallic salmon pink was getting a
bit old on the 6s we're back to flat
sides and sharp rectangular corners a
circular volume buttons are back the top
mounted power button is back and the
slightly thicker overall shell means
that the new 12 megapixel camera sensor
is flush with the rear casing it's kind
of fun going back to an iPhone which can
stand up all by itself and it's a petite
throwback to the classic TV ads
featuring one-handed use your thumb goes
from here to here
of course what makes this phone
interesting is the fact that internally
we're using most of the guts from the
iPhone 6s the first boot was super quick
now setting up the phone is a new device
is a bit of a chore with all of the
security and prompts and logins that
takes a minute to chew through and then
when you get to the home screen and it's
just a crazy snappy little iPhone the
paging through apps and the notification
shade and quick settings and even
training the touch ID sensor is very
familiar terra-tory I really do have
some funny mixed feelings taking this
phone out of the box on the one hand we
always want companies to push the
boundaries of design and technology on
the other hand it was a happy homecoming
seeing that my old iPhone 5s bumper case
was already a perfect fit a lot of folks
were
probably hoping for a fresher style or
at least Hardware more in keeping with
current iPhones but then you fire up the
camera and it's so much better than
anything i phone fans have had before
and a gadget this small yeah I'm a
little torn on this one on paper is
pretty cut and dry
iPhone 5s body with iPhone 6s brains but
I have a few more questions about this
little guy than I thought I would
following this initial encounter who is
this phone for how well does it compete
against other mid Rangers and how do I
feel about this kind of recycling all of
those questions and more will be
answered as we take the iPhone se out
first spin put it through its paces and
report back with reviews and comparisons
as always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
more videos like these and hit that
thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos now you can chat me
up on Instagram and Twitter is some
gadget guy I will catch you all on the
next video hey Siri what's 42 divided by
zero and you split them evenly among
zero friends how many cookies does each
of your friends get see it doesn't make
sense
so Cookie Monster gets them all no no no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
