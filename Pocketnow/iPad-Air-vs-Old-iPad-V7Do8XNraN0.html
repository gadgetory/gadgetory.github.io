older iPads I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the iPad air
versus the iPad 3 while the competition
is rapidly closing the gap Apple is
still very much the dominant force in
the tablet market last week it launched
the fifth generation of its incredibly
popular tablet series the iPad air
lighter thinner and more powerful than
all before it how does it compare to
iPads from yesteryear let's find out for
this comparison we're actually using an
iPad 3 not an iPad 4 the major
differences between them however are
fairly minimal they support the same
exact design but the iPad 3 features the
a5x chip set instead of the a6x the old
30 pin connector instead of lightning
and a 0.3 megapixel front camera to the
iPad 4 is 1.2 megapixel front shooter
the differences between the previous two
iPad models and the newer iPad air are
much more exaggerated and notable first
design the second through fourth
generation iPads all featured the same
design tapered edges by bezels and a
speaker grille located on the lower left
corner of the back side with the
relatively large size all older iPads
had one unfortunate quality in common
weight the iPad three and four for
example hit the scales at 652 grams the
iPad 2 at 601 as the name suggests the
iPad air is much lighter it weighs only
one pound or 469 grams
meaning it's 28% lighter than before
this weight reduction is due in large
part to the smaller physical footprint
it's nearly two millimeters thinner and
sixteen point two millimeters narrower
than the iPad 3 and it's casing is
effectively a scaled up iPad Mini
chassis sporting the same lower radius
edges speakers along the bottom and
separated volume buttons instead of a
combined rocker thus narrower design
also gives the iPad air a shape that's
more like into a sheet of paper or a
16:9 aspect Android tablet versus the
more squared nature of older iPads while
these smaller dimensions may seem
miniscule on a nine point seven inch
tablet they're quite impossible to
overlook with both tablets in hand the
iPad air is unbelievably thin and light
for such a large tablet it's lighter and
physically smaller than any comparably
sized Empowered
and for that Apple deserves a lot of
credit also like the mini the air comes
in two color options space gray and
silver the older iPads also come in two
colors white or black the difference
however is that both color options on
the older iPads still sported the matte
aluminum finish on the back only the
Front's for different colors when
talking specifications the changes are
far less dramatic at 9.7 diagonal inches
both the iPad 3 and air feature 2048 by
1536 pixel resolution displays with
density ratings of 264 pixels per inch
both come with 1 gigabyte of RAM and
both are rated at 10 hours of use time
though the iPad 3 has a 40 2.5 watt hour
battery in the air has a 32 point 4 watt
hour cell both rear cameras capturing
maximum of 5 megapixel images but like
the iPad 4 the air comes with a 1.2
megapixel front camera to the iPad 3s
0.3 megapixel shooter internally the
biggest difference between the iPad 3
and air is their respective chipsets the
iPad 3 ship of the a 5x with a 1
gigahertz dual-core CPU the iPad Air's
64-bit a7 chip comes with a 1.4
gigahertz dual-core CPU both displays
look equally fantastic producing vibrant
yet realistic and accurate colors as
well as offering wide viewing angles
great contrast and deep blacks at 264
PPI they're both incredibly crisp and
put simply both displays or gorgeous in
terms of build quality
neither tablet is better than the other
but obviously we favor the lighter more
slim and narrower design of the iPad air
fortunately none of these dimension
changes come at the expense of usability
or ease of use they in fact make the
tablet easier to hold particularly for
extended periods of time as it typically
goes with Apple devices there are
practically no differences in the
software between these two so we won't
waste too much time on the software
aspect of this comparison both tablets
run iOS 7 taking full advantage of the
new refined interface control center and
the numerous tiny improvements such as
task switching Notification Center or
limitless folders on the software side
of things there are only two notable
differences between the iPad 3 and iPad
air airdrop support and 64-bit
architecture unfortunately the iPad 3
dozen
come with airdrop capabilities though
the iPad 4 and air do in the a7 chip
inside the iPad air is a 64-bit
processor meaning it can take full
advantage of apps with 64-bit support
and the associated performance
improvements that said it could also
lead to apps which are more susceptible
to crashing the area that separates
these two tablets the most however is
performance by no means is the a5 X in
the iPad 3 bad in standard usage opening
apps composing emails web browsing etc
the iPad 3 is perfectly snappy and
smooth the iPad air powered by the new
a7 chip is an entirely different
ballgame it's a split second faster at
just about everything you can throw at
the tablets opening switching and
closing apps but where the iPad air
begins to leave the iPad 3 in the dust
is game performance the iPad 3 is no
slouch but in graphic intensive games
such as asphalt 8 it begins dropping
frame rates quite regularly providing a
less than desirable experience the iPad
air doesn't even begin to bat an eyelash
at asphalt 8 or anything else we've
thrown at it thus far performance is
absolutely stellar still the iPad 3
holds its own especially for a tablet
that's over a year and a half old the
loudspeaker however is something we're
far more fond of on the iPad 3 located
on the lower left corner of the back of
the tablet the speaker on the iPad 3 is
much more difficult to cover up on
accident then the dual speakers on the
iPad air which is separated by the
Lightning port in the middle of the
bottom edge the iPad 3 speaker may be
rear-facing and not quite as loud but
it's certainly more out of the way and
more difficult to cover up or muffle
with the palm of your hand it's also
more bassy and things are once again
much more level when talking about
battery life and camera performance like
every full-sized iPad to date Apple
rated both the iPad 3 and air at 10
hours of usage we haven't had a chance
to fully put the iPad air to the test
quite yet we're saving that for the full
review but suffice it to say these two
are on par with one another in the
stamina Department and let's just say
they don't disappoint
finally cameras both come with the 5
megapixel sensor fixed to their
backsides and unsurprisingly both of
those image sensors capture comparable
images for tablets their image quality
is passable even impressive in some
cases at
five megapixels other cameras will
undoubtedly supply far more detail but
the color reproduction is accurate
vibrant contrast is passable and the
images simply aren't dull like we've
experienced with other tablet cameras
this still does nothing to fight the
stigma or awkwardness around snapping
photos with a 10-inch device so should
you turn in that old iPad for the latest
and greatest model should you search
around for a cheaper used iPad or
splurge for a brand new iPad air
depending on the circumstances we might
offer different answers but there's a
definite cause to spend extra cash this
time around the internal upgrades might
be miniscule but the performance
benefits of the a7 chip paired with the
extra slim and lightweight chassis is
more than enough to sway us in the
direction of the iPad air the weight
difference may only sound like a small
plus but trust us after you've held both
you won't want to go back to an older
iPad is the weight difference
game-changing no is it noticeable and
significant absolutely and for a device
built for portability a huge difference
in weight shouldn't be taken well
lightly so for us it's the iPad air
through and through that's all for now
