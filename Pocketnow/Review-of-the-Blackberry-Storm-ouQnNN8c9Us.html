editor for pocketnow.com i've had the
blackberry storm kicking around for
quite a while now i think i've used it
long enough to be able to give you guys
a very thorough user review of it so
let's go ahead and get started
first things first email and web
browsing side it's a phone and it's got
to make good phone calls for me and sit
in my first experience with Verizon in
quite some time and I've been thoroughly
impressed their network call quality is
absolutely fantastic
on my ends I hear no white noise on the
other end
people have reported hearing no
background noise no buzzing no fuzzing
nothing very crystal clear phone calls
it's really close to Verizon for that
obviously your results are gonna depend
on your network coverage but if you do
have substantial of Verizon coverage
you're not to have any trouble and I
think you'll really enjoy the call
quality of the phone speaker volume is
the loudest I have ever heard on a
speakerphone you heard it during my
software overview when I was playing a
video and playing music it is really
loud coming from just that tiny little
speaker right on the bottom but couldn't
be more impressed with the speaker
quality I really enjoy having a
removable battery which is nice for the
power user if you need to pop in a new
one or something should happen to your
battery it's nice that RIM decided to
make that an option and it's always a
positive experience
it's a 1400 milliamp hour battery that
you can go ahead and swap out I also
like that the memory is upgradable
meaning it uses a micro SD card which
can go all the way up to 16 gigabytes
right now which is quite a lot of
storage and should that increase in the
future I believe sandesh is working on a
32 gig you'd be able just to pop it in
so that's nice there's expandability
before the future email is fantastic on
a blackberry blackberry email so that as
good as it gets
I've used you know I've used tons of
email clients email on the iPhone
Windows Mobile email and really nothing
nothing comes close to blackberry as
push system it's actually fantastic I
actually get devices or emails on my
device before it shows up on my computer
which is quite impressive so that's
really been something I've enjoyed the
BlackBerry OS is fantastic it's
intuitive its elegant you know really is
just a very
an easy to use device an easy to pick up
also the phone is completely world
capable meaning it also comes with a
built-in SIM card in the back so if
you're traveling outside of a CDMA
network which is what Verizon uses the
phone will seamlessly switch over to GSM
and not just regular old edge speeds or
slow GSM speeds it actually has European
3G ban so if you're traveling abroad
you're going to get your same blistering
speeds that you're used to which are
very nice and those would be GSM three
speeds 3G speeds one thing to note about
the 3G that this does come with on
Verizon when you're here in the u.s. is
it's CDMA meaning you will not have the
ability to do simultaneous voice and
data so if you're talking on a phone
call on your board you want to check
your email and you won't be able to do
it this time around so some of the cons
about the device the operating system
was adapted for a touchscreen meaning it
wasn't meant for it and I think it
really shows the BlackBerry operating
system on a device like the bold or the
curve is very intuitive and meant to be
used with the scroll ball with the
touchscreen it's a little bit squirrely
and occasionally feels like a very rev
one device when you're scrolling doesn't
always recognize your finger when you
push and doesn't always work when I try
and answer calls using the touchscreen
it doesn't always register there really
have been some minor tweaks and quirks
but I think those can be fixed and
remedied very easily with an
over-the-air software update which is
capable of happening on the blackberry
storm which is very nice so my basic
gripes you know just early
implementation I think and early
adopters are always gonna face those
sort of issues I also wish remitting
include a threaded SMS application
that's not found here all you've got are
your sent messages and receive messages
show up in a mailbox and if you want to
reply to one you have to go down to that
sender or find the sender or create a
new one implementation of the keyboard
is a big deal and RIM was touted it's
clickable screen I was expecting
something really revolutionary and it
wasn't revolutionary it was more an
evolutionary advancement it's almost
identical to what Apple included on the
new MacBook and MacBook Pros keyboard I
really do like the click mechanism
though well it may not have set the word
the blaze like perhaps was promised it
really becomes very intuitive and I
found that was missing it when I was
typing on other touchscreen devices the
keyboard the sure tech keyboard is fine
it's usable just like a pearl and when
when it's in landscape the full QWERTY
it's a little bit hard for me to get
used to I've had the phone since
Thursday and I still haven't quite
gotten the hang of the QWERTY keyboard
yet so there certainly is a steep
learning curve the registers are made
actually there's a point in the middle
of the screen which registers the taps
so if you're typing on the periphery on
the edge occasionally those taps won't
be recognized which can be a little bit
daunting and definitely something to to
keep aware I'm rather to be aware of I
really also enjoy one thing to back up
here I do enjoy a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack that is always nice and the
beautiful screen for watching movies and
videos so guys overall I've been very
happy with the blackberry storm but it
has a lot of things left to go to get it
right and a lot of things left to go
before it can be a complete Windows
Mobile or iPhone competitor because
right now it's just not so out of a
five-star scale I'm gonna give the
blackberry storm a solid three but it
has a promise of really hitting at 5
stars and maybe me having change of
scale up to 10 stars I think in a few
months
once the rim works out the kinks it'll
be a top notch device they were a little
bit under the gun to get this out I
believe time for the holiday season I
think it really shows in some in some
ways
so guys John Rhett enger' for
pocketnow.com with a review for you of
the blackberry storm hope you guys
enjoyed go ahead and leave some comments
down below and I will talk to you guys
soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
