to be all about waterproofing in a new
home button rumors of the samsung gear s
3.2 some glamour partnerships in tow and
it seems that google might finally throw
a bone to Chrome OS I'm high Meadow
iveta and probably one of the things
that I didn't like the most about
Deadpool was the guy's obsession over
chimichangas this is parking out daily
the official news today start with
Motorola those of you in the market for
a SmartWatch that can do running and
some sort of fitness well the Moto 360
sport is currently on sale for two
hundred dollars in the links of the
description it's actually a very good
deal it's probably not my favorite
fitness watch over all but it's
definitely a very good running watch
that also does android wear that the
sheen get also expected to reach india
very soon and speaking of smartwatches
those of you that are considering the
Samsung gear s2 well we might be closer
to the gear s3 than we thought it's
apparently slated for Aoife and
according to some trusted sources this
watch is going to be all about fashion
partnerships seems that Samsung has a
couple in toe with the idea of boosting
the whole purpose of the gears 3 it was
probably one of the better smartwatches
last year but it's probably one of the
most confusing ones at least in my
opinion and speaking of confusing things
we still don't understand the purpose
for Chrome OS except for the fact that
these are really really cheap computers
but it seems that google plans to do
something about it we thought that the
pixel see was going to kill it but no it
seems that the Google Play Store support
might come to Chrome OS earlier than we
thought probably google i/o and it seems
that there will be as many as 1 million
applications supporting Chrome OS now we
don't know exactly if these are android
applications supporting Chrome OS or the
google play store it's just going to
open up to Chromebook applications we
will keep you posted as we learn more I
have some very interesting rumors come
for the Apple watch we are hearing that
Apple plans to revamp a lot more than
just the internals because we hear the
design will remain the same apparently
apple plans to bring an Apple watch too
with a cellular radio and even though
we're not exactly sure if this will mean
that the Apple watch on its own will not
necessarily connect to the iphone
anymore or if this will just be a
variant of the Apple watch sort of like
what we currently see with the iPad but
it would make a compelling reason for
you to consider what the future of the
apple watch will be Apple really wants
to make the watch about apps I never use
the apps so let's see if that one works
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with the iphone 7 other
sources now are claiming that there are
two very important changes with the
iphone
some of them might go beyond just the
design apparently waterproofing is a
major deal and for those of you that
didn't know the iphone 6s has a certain
degree of water resistance even though
apple doesn't really doubt that it has
and another change is apparently coming
to the home button we're not sure if it
means no home button at all but
apparently it will receive a change and
it makes sense with 3d touch even though
again 3d touches another one of those
things that I really do not use at all
but it does lead me to the question of
the day would you prefer for Apple to
keep 3d touch and get rid of the home
button or vice versa keep the home
button get rid of 3d touch and make the
phone cheaper because in my case I would
rather keep the home button and just
figure out something else for 3d touch I
wouldn't want to lose it but then again
it was a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get these
news earlier before the video was filmed
