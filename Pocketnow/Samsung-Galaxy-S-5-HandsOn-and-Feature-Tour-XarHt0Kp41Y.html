PocketNow here in New York City for the
Samsung unpacked 5 launch event live
stream from Barcelona Adam Lane is
behind the camera and right under this
cover or a bunch of Samsung Galaxy s5
let's see if we can pick one out and
uncover its secrets so folks here it is
the modern and glam look of the new
Samsung Galaxy s5 we got the blue one
the demo unit here in New York which I'm
actually really really pleased about
Samsung presented this device to us in
about five different categories we'll
just go through it real quickly for you
there's that display Super AMOLED 5.1
inches not the 5.2 we were expecting but
really what difference does it make it
is a gorgeous display in person colors
really pop is to do on most AMOLED
displays this one though has adaptive
color profiles which apparently go above
and beyond what we're used to seeing on
the market particularly in dimming
Samsung's great screens I've never
really been able to get dim enough when
you're reading in bed or something like
that
and probably this one does - Brad you
here to test that out but that's one of
the claims here and of course it
wouldn't be a Samsung device without our
new settings it's great these are some
of the rounded icons we saw in some of
the preview materials for this event
TouchWiz is still here in force very
very similar to what we're seeing on
something like the Galaxy Note 3 you can
see there's not much difference in terms
of TouchWiz appearance but the dynamic
elements of it the movements and the end
things are quite different
they're very smooth on this down right
here of course we'll have to spend more
time with it in the real world to really
know
come around the back connectivity LTE
category for Wi-Fi AC and my mo Samsung
is claiming double effective download
speeds once again we'll have to see this
is the camera so why don't we see if we
can get a close-up on that there the
cameras a 16 megapixel Mountjoy Samsung
is calling out fast autofocus 0.3
seconds to get focused before a shot is
the claim advanced HDR as well and
selective focus as well so you can take
and select your focus after the shot is
taken there's the speakerphone down
below let's see if we can not that we're
going to actually do this but just to
see yes
looks like the back cover is removable
party which says the 2800 milliamp hour
battery that was probably removable as
well that is despite the fact that this
device meets ip67 standards for dust and
water resistance the first for a non
active Samsung Galaxy S device very very
impressive and about that battery
Samsung is claiming 12 hours of
continuous video playback and with the
ultra power saving mode they're claiming
24 hours the standby at 10% do you know
anything which would be a really really
impressed versus if so we will
definitely test that again first and
while this may look like just a regular
old Samsung home button it is not it is
in fact a fingerprint scanner not the
touch and hold that we're familiar with
from the the iPhone 5s but instead a
swipe a swipe down from the screen you
have to swipe across the button on the
slate and this is how you teach the
Gauchos five here
bring a friend if this seems familiar to
you it should we saw something very
similar on the HTC One max except it was
located around back we really didn't
like that swipe the swipe action as
opposed to the press and hold on the on
the other version of the fingerprint
scanner but we'll see see how it goes as
you can see this is a learning process
and you can use this as a secure element
to access things like PayPal and so on
and under the camera here we take a real
close look you'll see what appears to be
an accessory for the camera or another
piece of hardware support in the cameras
that is not the case it is in fact a
heart rate sensor galaxy s5 featuring
more of a more of an exercise focused a
fitness focus than any other Samsung
device that has yet been released
there's an all-new s health app as well
and that plays with the all-new excuse
me that plays with and plus
compatibility so devices that you use to
monitor your fitness and they use that
ant+ standard this device will play
nicely with on the inside as health you
can see there's kind of rounded redesign
the similar UX elements to what we saw
in the magazine UX from the note Pro
these kind of bubbly kind of things
really smooth I mean it yes it's been
flattened a little bit yes it looks
better but it's just the responsiveness
itself I mean it's it's quite a quite a
responsive unit in the hand it feels
nice this pattern you know on the blue
one it looks great and the Goldman it
looks well you decide to how it looks
but it does lend some needed texture to
the back of this device certainly at
first feel we prefer it to the galaxy s4
anyway that was a not so quick look the
Samsung Galaxy s5 and the
pack five launch event in New York City
