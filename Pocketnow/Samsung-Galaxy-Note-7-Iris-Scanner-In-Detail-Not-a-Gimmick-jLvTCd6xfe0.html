gimmick King so it makes all the sense
in the world for people to consider the
Galaxy Note sevens Irish scanner to be
one until you test it and learn that
it's not I'm Jaime to be better with
pocket now here with a detailed look
brought to you by deep brand pocket aus
galaxy note 7 coverage is made possible
by D brand manufacturer of precision cut
vinyl skins for smartphones tablets and
other gadgets go to D brand.com slash
galaxy to pimp out your new galaxy note
7 if you grew up with me watching
Minority Report you will know just how
long ago the concept of iris scanning
has been a dream the idea of interacting
with gadgets without touch was pure
science fiction
up until the Lumia 950 changed that and
the galaxy note 7 perfected it to set up
iris scanning you can do so when you set
up your note 7 for the first time or
within the security settings you'll see
a prompt for irises which then ask you
for your phone's password since the
sensor uses near infrared illumination
Samsung disclaims that for it to work
you have to be either indoors or away
from direct sunlight you also need to
remove glasses contact lenses and hold
the phone from ten to fourteen inches
away from you what's most important you
can only register one pair of irises so
this is pretty much the only security
feature that works only for you if you
hold the phone away from you as required
the detection takes seconds far less
than setting up a fingerprint scanner
well then you can also set this for a
web sign in so long as you're using the
Samsung browser for samsung account
verification and obviously unlocking
your phone the user interface offers
cool mask previews for you to align your
eyes when unlocking but once you start
using it you'll notice that the service
is so fast you won't even see it unless
your eyes are not aligned you simply
turn your phone back from standby
swipe from the bottom and your in that's
simple so yes speed is definitely one
reason why this is not a gimmick
but the other is Samsung secure folder
this allows you to store things
privately in a folder that only you can
unlock through your iris or well there
are other means but again if you want
this to only be accessed by you
I'd suggest you use the iris scanner
once setup you can add pictures video
the standard stuff of other secure
folders but to make matters cool you can
even have an extra copy of applications
within and login with a separate account
sure the usage scenario for any of this
could sound a little shady but seeing
objectively this allows you to protect
company accounts from accidental
interaction from kids or simply somebody
who needs to borrow your phone for a bit
overall I have to admit that I'm
impressed by what Samsung has come up
with here the service pretty much just
works but obviously we'll have to report
back on our full review to tell you just
how useful it turned out to be after
constant use folks this video was made
possible by deep brand to pimp out your
new Galaxy Note 7 simply go to deeper
