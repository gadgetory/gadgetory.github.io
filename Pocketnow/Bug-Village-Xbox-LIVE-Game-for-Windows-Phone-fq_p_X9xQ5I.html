and we're gonna do a quick preview of a
new xbox live game for this phone let's
check it out alright this time we have
bug village so the new xbox live game
and it is a free download in the Windows
Phone Marketplace however there's a
gotcha to that and I'll get to that but
let's just go straight to play so this
game is about building a bug village so
you can make little houses and that'll
attract bugs ants bees and whatnot and
so over here is my village I have two
huts already a couple some flowers there
a little fence and over here is my
garden
where I will place little piles of stuff
for the bugs to collect and you see
numbers next to each thing so that one
costs 100 so many acorns there's my
acorn count at 498 left there's my coin
count I have five sometimes some of
these cost cones see that one costs ten
coins so you see my answer carrying this
these little piles back over to the
houses so that's what they do if I tap
it i can press hurry that'll cost me a
coin and it'll skip this whole time
limit see that's going to take another
nine minutes for them to collect that
pile whereas this pile is going to take
two hours now right here are my missions
so this is what I have have to make my
ants do they have to do a 3-2 our tasks
from these small pile and that's what
they're working on over there
and this is another one two 15-minute
tasks from a small pile so I did one of
those and that's what they're working on
over there sometimes we'll see some
other bugs floating around here and you
can help them out or get rid of them if
they're bad guys I don't see any right
now and sometimes you'll want to feed
your insects so here's a sugar cube and
we can choose different types of food
and you see all those costs acorns or
coins as well up here's my number of
bugs I have two ants and that's that's
their hunger health levels or here's the
shop so if I want to build another house
it's gonna cost me that many acorns or
that many coins so you can see some of
them are locked and you can also plant
decorations and your bug village there
again each thing costs coin or a car's
there we go so they're working a cool
thing is even though this is going to
take a couple hours to finish if I go
away from the from the game it's still
gonna count so I don't have to be
running the game the whole time you know
you can come back later and see if
they've finished and then you know feed
your bugs and one that now the thin is
for the coins and acorns you might want
to get more in order to speed things up
or just progress a little more quickly
instead of waiting to earn more coins
and acorns so you can choose which
quantity here but what happens is it's
gonna make you buy them for real so
there's my I got to use Microsoft Points
to buy a thousand acorns for 160
microsoft points
same with coins so that's where they're
gonna get the money the game is free but
if you really want to get into it
you're gonna have to buy some some of
this stuff with Microsoft Points and
that's pretty much the basics of this
game you see some cool 3d graphics and
we basically just wait for our insects
to progress through the game and get to
the next level let's go back I mean many
real quick we don't have much options
just music sound effects achievements
you can check them all out there and of
course leaderboard is there and we have
a add for more games and just a little
about dialogue and that's about it so
that's it for bug village I hope you
enjoyed this quick look at this new game
it'll be out tomorrow in the Windows
Phone Marketplace give us a thumbs up
like this video and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
