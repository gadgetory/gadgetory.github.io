pocketnow.com let's take a trip in the
wayback machine and take a look at one
of my old phones
it's the HTC vision better known as the
t-mobile g2 around here and it's runnin
jellybean let's go take a look this is
the HTC vision also known as the
t-mobile g2 this is the phone that has a
nice spring out slider if we look over
here it's got this really interesting
opening and closing mechanism that a lot
of people thought was going to be just
all kinds of fragile and would break as
you can tell here even though the phone
itself is very well used that hinge is
just fine so any of you who are thinking
that this was not well constructed your
concerns were unfounded it's got a nice
physical keyboard which back in the day
I love physical keyboards I've now moved
on to on-screen keyboards but hey let's
go back and take a look at this now what
makes this newsworthy today is well
running Android 4.2.1 jellybean know
before you get your hopes up this is not
official HTC has not gone and pushed an
update out neither has CyanogenMod
although this is a cm 10.1 nightly it's
just been modified tweaked and somehow
shoehorn to work on this hardware so
let's take a look really fast let's go
through some of the stuff first of all
we've got CyanogenMod statistics right
over here with error reporting turned on
go back home let's flip around a little
bit and see it's relatively fluid if we
open up our app drawer I don't have an
awful lot of apps installed a little bit
of screen D sensitivity whether that's
part of the ROM or just the age of the
screen I don't know but overall I mean
take a look at how smooth this is not
quite as fast as it could otherwise be
but overall for the
latest and greatest operating system I'm
really really quite impressed now a few
things that were missing here inside
camera camera does work it does take
pictures it is pretty nice you'll notice
we don't have photosphere that's kind of
to be expected if we come in we can go
in and change our settings over here a
little bit of lag a little bit of
slowness just things that you might
expect use the power button for the
shutter there it's not wonderful but you
know it's really not supposed to be you
saw some lag there when we were trying
to go back home out of the camera app
would I use this as a daily driver
absolutely yes if this were the phone
that I had and I just bought it on eBay
for 25 bucks 50 bucks
I would totally route it I would totally
put this build of CyanogenMod on it and
and run with it now again not an
official CyanogenMod ROM this has been
picked up by a third party and that
third-party developer I'll have full
kudos and credits over at pocketnow.com
deserves all of the thanks for getting
it to work over here and getting it to
work as well as it does does come with
the stock browser browser not Chrome
browser so that helps speed things up
just a little bit seeing some lag here
because I don't have my Wi-Fi connected
at this point but that's that's not a
wrong problem at all I had it connected
earlier today so how does it benchmark
we tried deep bench - we tried quadrant
not fabulous by we're testing phones
that bench up in the five thousands some
of some of these benchmarks this didn't
perform quite that well for the exact
numbers make sure you head over to our
article at pocketnow.com
I'll have a link to that article at the
bottom of this video overall though I'm
really impressed if you want to try this
on your old t-mobile g2 or HTC vision
I'll have links on where you can
download the ROM just go ahead and flash
it flash gaps with it and you're done
you're up you're running it works and
it's beautiful and it's jelly bean and
even have Google now you can swipe up
but you can just tap into it if I had an
internet connection it would be a little
bit better than just doing this but
Google now right there and it works
beautiful thing so what do you think do
you like seeing old phones given new
life with up-to-date operating systems
if so give the video a big thumbs up if
you've got questions comments tips or
some other devices that you've been able
to get CyanogenMod 10.1 running on or
jellybean in any other flavor we want to
know about that in the comments over at
pocketnow.com again questions comments
head over to pocketnow.com let us know
in the comments down there that's where
we're going to be spending most of our
time answering those questions for
PocketNow showing off old devices
running brand new operating systems I'm
