are you really getting your money's
worth or is this only minor iteration LG
has made some pretty big changes to
their G Series phone and now it's time
to see what's new and improved I'm Juan
Carlos back now for PocketNow and here's
part one of our LG fight the g5 versus
the g4 LG's newest flagship features an
interesting mix of top-tier specs and
novel features immediately looking at
the older g4 this is a completely
different design language we've been
seeing subtle curves from LG since the
first flex and now instead of a gentle
concave bend to the screen we've got
convex tapers to the forehead and chin
screen size has also shrunk from 5.5
inches on the g4 to 5.3 inches on the g5
the new LG screen is smaller it's a
little thinner it's not as wide but it
is ever so slightly taller than the g4
it replaces it's the first generation of
a whole new design language the g5 is
built out of more premium materials and
covered in a fancy paint it feels nice
in the hand but there were a number of
LG fans who were fond of the leather
backs available for the g4 even though
the g4 has a larger screen that leather
back was a little grippier helping it
stay in the hand a bit better there's
also a nice symmetry to the rear of the
g4 that single camera sensor flanked by
flash and laser focus lining up with the
power button and volume rocker it's an
experience which is wonderfully evolved
over several phone generations the g5 s
dual camera setup in circular power
button gives off something of a
surprised look we trade summer ergonomic
benefits to the fingerprint sensor on
the back is wonderfully placed but LG
fans have been trained to look for
volume controls back here - I also ran
into some issues shooting the camera
test is returning the volume rockers to
the side of the phone made it easier to
misfire the camera especially lining up
ground level shots are bracing the phone
on a surface lastly for design while the
battery door is a novel solution for
building a rigid phone the g5 has a few
rough seams running around that chin not
only can you not unsee them I find
they're pretty good at trapping Pocket
lint though the g5 s action on swapping
the battery feels a lot nicer than
ripping the back panel off of a g4
in comparing performance we shouldn't be
surprised at the Qualcomm 820 powered g5
andele outperforms the Qualcomm 808
powered g4 both of these phones are
running marshmallow the g4 using LG's
older stock UI the g5 I had to install
Nova Launcher as the ATT review unit we
have doesn't have a simple fix for
returning the app drawer navigating
through the UI one probably won't notice
significant differences in sliding
through home screens or pulling
notifications I do notice better and
more communicative responses to screen
taps on the g5 though this helps a lot
with multitasking especially when
running the phone hard the g4 will more
often halt just a fraction of a second
long enough to make a question whether
the phone properly registered your input
gaming is another area where the g5 wins
for having a more powerful processor I'm
still having issues with graphics
intensive titles like Marvel future
fight but other graphics heavy games
like asphalt 8 load faster and play
smoother on the newer phone these
displays are pretty similar in actual
operation both feature quad HD
resolution and the point two inch
diagonal difference doesn't make for a
radically different usage experience the
g5 actually has a slightly lower screen
to bezel ratio on that front face the g4
making more efficient use of the front
panel while LG says they've improved the
quantum IPS LCD tag I can't see much
difference in the high brightness modes
when using the phones in daylight the g5
of course comes with a handy always-on
display which can deliver helpful
at-a-glance information like time and
notifications this is a touch more
helpful than the g4 sliding gesture
which takes just long enough to wake the
screen you might as well have just
turned the phone on moving to the
cameras this battle is also interesting
for how similar these two phones perform
to be sure the g5 s crazy wide-angle
second camera bring some fun flexibility
to the table but the main cameras are
nearly identical in our tests similar
sensor sizes exact same resolution
similar image stabilization similar
focusing performance similar lens
distortion without labeling we'd be
hard-pressed to point to any
identifiable differences between the
photo output from both of these phones
the g5 does save a higher-quality video
file in nearly 50 megabit per second UHD
video over the
30 megabit per second video on the g4 a
color and contrast are improved but LG
hasn't included any new controls for
manipulating that video neither phone
has exposure controls neither phone can
shoot 60 frames per second HD video
neither phone can change metering video
quality has improved but the look of the
video from both phones will still look
fairly similar for both being full auto
shooters and audio playback is another
area these two compete against each
other closely speaker performance is
very similar though a consumer would
make the decision in which position they
prefer the speaker to fire bottom firing
on the g5 rear firing on the g4
headphone audio quality is also very
similar on both devices generally good
tone and a fairly flat EQ though I would
probably describe both phones as being
somewhat plain or dull what's
disappointing to see on the g5 is a
noticeably less powerful and feeding
your headphones maximum output is lower
than the g4 and the noise floor is
slightly higher though the g4 is more
prone to Distortion
LG was really hedging their bets on the
standalone DAC unit for the g5 improving
audio quality as playback here will
probably feel like a step backwards for
most consumers it makes the news at the
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen DAC not shipping to North
America doubly frustrating testing
battery life between these two phones
should be handled with a touch of
skepticism the g4 we're using is almost
exactly a year old with its original
battery facing a brand new phone on its
first week of charging looking at our
video test streaming 30 minutes of HD
video over Wi-Fi on 50% brightness the
g5 drains 7% of its battery putting it
lower mid-pack on this test while the g4
drained 8% well that doesn't seem like
much of a difference as a standalone
benchmark real-world performance is
better on the g5 both phones are running
lean by dinnertime but I'm likely to
have more run time left on the g5 even
though the battery is 7 percent smaller
than the g4 though we lose overall
capacity the g5 does seem to employ more
efficient hardware so let's wrap this up
if you're on the g4 is the g5 a
worthwhile upgrade your Lee updates are
tricky comparisons the g5 introduces a
new design and fun features like dual
cameras in a modular base but the g4
shows it still has some teeth left in
this fight besting the g5 and headphone
volume matching main camera performance
and display technology while not falling
too far behind in battery life even on a
year old battery as with many of these
comparisons if you're coming from our
first generation G flex or a g3 the g5
is an easy phone to recommend but folks
on the g4 you can likely stay put unless
better processor performance is
absolutely necessary of course this
wasn't the only phone in LG stable last
year and the g5 faces even tougher
competition from the fab
side of the equation which we'll cover
in our next comparison video as always
