pocket
calm and this is part one of the video
review for the HPI
200 series I have the HPI pack 210
Enterprise handheld here I'm gonna go a
little bit in through hardware in this
addition on the top we have a glossy
finish at the top it's really nice the
only thing I don't like it's it's a
fingerprint magnet it's really smudgy we
have a 4-inch beautiful VGA screen here
at the top it's really really nice
probably the only thing I haven't liked
about it is the fact that it has a
little bit of a sense of feedback it
it's like if it had a plastic film at
the top and then the screen at the
bottom so when you press something it's
a little it's not that sensitive all the
time and you feel some feedback when you
touch it so when you try to use a thumb
keyboards it's a bit complicated at the
beginning at the sides we have a little
bit of a metallic finish you'll also
find on the iPAQ 100 series really nice
and a rubberized hear feel at the bottom
you notice this is a square device it
doesn't have really rounded edges at the
bottom so even though the device is big
not as big as anybody would say but it
it does really feel big in the hand
because of the fact of the design
probably of HP would have considered
making the device a little bit rounded
at the bottom that's the iPad 100 series
it would have been a bit more
comfortable in the pocket so what do we
have here going through the different
buttons available we have the power
button here we have the mid like
indicators here a lighting detector here
which actually controls the backlight of
the device one interesting thing you'll
notice here and I'm trying to light it
up is there's a little bit of a hole in
the I HP icon which well we I could
assume that probably the speaker that's
at the back is linked to this or it
could be something better you never know
we have SD normal SD support with SDI Oh
support compact flash which is really
really good for the device we have a
record button which is a little bit hard
to press because it's really really
flush into the plastic and the bottom we
have the microphone jack and then we
have expansion bay connectors what the
manual says which is actually just your
connector for USB or for charging and
this is the proprietary jack that I
mentioned that you have but it's really
interesting that you have a mini USB
connector here and I
it actually takes many USB cables and it
sinks in charge of with them but it
doesn't bring them included in the box
which is weird but well it's it's an
option then we have a 3.5 millimeter
audio jack which is really well welcomed
because it's really hard to carry
adapters all the time around we have a
reset button right here at the side and
it really does say reset here we have
metallic feel stylus sort of the same
material that's on the side its I would
have expected it to be larger because of
the size of the device but it's
acceptable I could say it's acceptable
then pretty much we have a 2200 milliamp
hour battery as I mentioned before the
BGA screen which is beautiful we have a
Marvel px a 310 processor with 624
megahertz Wi-Fi 802 BT Bluetooth 2.0
with EDR and then probably the
interesting part is if we go to settings
and then we go to memory we have 256
megabytes of ROM out of which 156 mega
bytes are available as I'm trying to
focus here and then out of the 128
megabytes of RAM that are offered there
are 79 mega bytes available pretty much
my only complaint with the device as of
what's been working on is HP retails
this as an enterprise handheld and they
they claim that the size of the device
is practically because this is a laptop
replacement I would have to object to
that I mean I am an enterprise user and
I would definitely like for something
this big definitely I really want
something this big in screen size but I
would have love for it to be light and
thin to fit enough in my pocket this is
actually a pocket PC but it's it's
really funny that it really fits really
bad in the pocket it's really really big
for the pocket we have my HDC Herald
here at the side this practically the
only device that I have that is just as
thick but like I mentioned these round
curves really do make a difference in
size then just to go on with the
hardware we have a calendar button here
we have a start menu button we have the
for movement with an action button
buttons really do feel good on this
device just to mention not it as opposed
to the iPad 100 series we have an OK
button and a male button these are
actually mapable and then you can
actually choose to even use these as
soft keys if you want or different
options I am gonna be toying with the
device as it's now on pretty much my
impression besides size is it's really
nice it's really snappy a really
powerful device I would say definitely
the most powerful device Windows Mobile
classic available right now and I hope
you enjoy it this is pretty much it for
pocket now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
