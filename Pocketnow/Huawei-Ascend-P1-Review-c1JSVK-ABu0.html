office is in America specifically in
Boston so it's not that often that I get
to review a device that hasn't received
an official US carrier launch well today
that's changing I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow comm and this is the huawei
ascend p1 let's review it it's kind of
tough to know where to start with the p1
it was announced back in January
officially released in May and flanked
and somewhat overshadowed by the
announcement of other Huawei devices
like the quad and the p1 s so the p1
just kind of slots in right in the
middle there it's part of always attempt
to break out of its budget phone
reputation but it's not the best of the
pack so it's kind of a weird phone to
try and classify let's take a hardware
tour here the p1 stands out from the
pack through sort of sheer force of
restraint it's a very understated device
it packs a 4.3 inch display which seems
impossibly small nowadays maybe a
testament to how ridiculous the Jumbo
phone phenomenon has become down below
even though it's a phone designed for
Android ICS we've got the persistent
capacitive buttons for home menu and
back up above the huawei branding barely
visible there if we can get some light
on it the earpiece grille and the lens
for the 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera there's also a notification LED
hidden behind the speaker grille which I
always like to see I should mention that
while this device is black there are
other color options available such as
white and pink so while we're here let's
go ahead and briefly cover what's under
the hood
the p1 is powered by an OMAP 4460
chipset a dual-core cortex a9 CPU
running at 1.5 gigahertz that's backed
up by a gig of ram four gigs of on-board
storage and microSD expansion up to 32
gigs around back there aren't too many
surprises an 8 megapixel primary
with a dual LED flash capable of
shooting in 1080p and video mode over to
the side barely visible here is a noise
cancelling microphone then there's the
very pretty I think Huawei logo here and
down below on this sort of Nexus s like
humph at the bottom is the speaker
grille off to the side here the whole
back is finished in this kind of
carbon-fiber like pattern which helps
liven it up a bit but the feel is
straight plastic and the smooth slippery
material really picks up skin oil
readily you'll be wiping this one on
your shirt a whole lot the real story
here is on the sides every time I let
somebody hold this phone they were
marking how slim it is and that's for
good reason
the device isn't as slim as the
forthcoming p1 s and it doesn't quite
get down to the Motorola Droid Razr 's
7.1 millimeters but at 7.7 millimeters
it's definitely one of the thinnest
smartphones out there because it's such
a slim device though it feels better in
the hand then the wide Droid Razr does
I'm talking about slimness on the face
of the phone it feels really great in
the hand on the side here we have the
micro SD card slot
standby key up on the right hand side
within the easy reach of a thumb if
you're right-handed over on the left we
just have the volume rocker down below
just the microphone and up top the SIM
card slot that's a full size SIM not
Micro SIM the three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack and the micro
USB port up top as for how it feels
I'd call the experience of handling the
p1 average Huawei has sealed the 1760
milliamp hour battery inside the device
which will be a downer for some of you
but that plus the Corning Gorilla Glass
up front results in a casing that's very
rigid
there's no creaking or flexing here the
phone feels solid
let's talk software for a minute now
Huawei is running something very close
to a stock Android ICS build with the p1
with the version I tested running 4.3
there is some customization going on
here though with whywe making some
tweaks that are both good and bad first
we have the lockscreen which
resembled the lockscreen on some of the
newer builds of Motorola's blur skin
from here we can unlock to the right or
we can jump directly into the camera
messaging or phone applications and once
we're in the next customization that is
immediately apparent are these set of
toggles in the notification tray you can
turn these off if you want to but just
like they are in samsung's touchwiz
implementation they're very very handy
to have we also have the option to
enable a custom-built Huawei launcher
called 3d home which kind of cartoon
Ã¡five the whole experience you get these
kind of bigger icons these custom
widgets a cube like 3d sort of switching
experience and the occasional cutesy
animation like the one that happens in
the calendar icon here with the waves
washing up on the beach overall I found
responsiveness on the p1 to be superb
especially if I left it in the 2d
configuration the UI delivers a tight
quick experience with a minimum of bugs
and crashes where it was a problem
though was the keyboard
I keep jinxing myself I said the
keyboard on the HTC One X was bad I said
the one on the galaxy s3 was bad the one
on the p1 makes either of those seem
like a vacation
it's almost unusable the keyboard looks
inviting it's got these big tall keys
that you can adjust and it's got a
couple different themes to choose from
if you don't like the stock colors
there's even a cool feature where you
swap to the side to get the numeric
keypad and swap to the other side to
come on back but the minute you actually
start typing on it the disaster is
evident the user dictionary is not well
calibrated and for English at least out
of the box and the autocorrect is
shamefully bad it isn't as a matter of
fact it's not even really working at all
and that's happening in all keyboard
modes now these problems even happen
when I use the stock ICS keyboard or a
custom one which says to me this is a
problem that runs deeper than just the
skin maybe a later soft
we're version can fix this but if you're
a messaging or email hound particularly
with the English keyboard I can't
recommend this device just based on the
keyboard performance let's talk about
the camera for a second the 8 megapixel
shooter on the back of the p1 performed
pretty well in my experience given
enough light images were sharp and crisp
and had good color saturation and all
that kind of stuff lower the light a
little bit though and you get a lot of
noise that starts to creep in with the
cameras focus also suffering as well
there's also a bit of shutter lag that
will cause some blur if you're not
keeping your hands terribly steady more
so than on other devices I've tested
recently there the usual array of fun
features like burst shot and panorama
mode and they work fairly well overall
the camera experience is decidedly
average I tested the ascend p1 on AT&amp;amp;T
and primarily in and around the Greater
Boston area and in keeping with the
theme of the day the p1 performance was
well right about average voice calls
were clear and crisp in my testing with
the usual smartphone caveats
speakerphone performance was a little on
the tinny side and earpiece volume could
have been a bit louder callers said they
could hear background noise from a busy
city street indicating that either
Boston has noisier than I realize or
that noise cancelling mic on the back
isn't doing as great a job as it could
reception was fine over HSPA and even
edge when I ran into a few coverage
holes up in Salem battery life was
acceptable in my tests the device should
get an average users through a full day
though power users will want to keep a
charger handy I didn't run into any
problems either in the stock browser or
in Google Chrome both of which loaded
sites just fine and did their jobs as
well as they should even high-octane
apps like Netflix performed well and
managed to avoid sucking the battery dry
while doing so gaming performance was
just fine on this device though with its
non gargantuan display size and lower
spec sheet the p1 wouldn't be any gamers
first choice popular titles like Angry
Bird
space will run fine though the proximity
of the soft keys to the display here
might give you some trouble if you get
too excited about things now as far as
more graphically intense games my go-to
tester explained is might not be the
most graphically intense game of the
bunch
but it's still pretty beefy and the p1
runs it just fine you can see the full
array of benchmarks in my full review at
pocketnow.com so for my first two away
phone the ascend p1 has done ok it's a
pretty average phone it's got a lot
going for it then it's also got a few
strikes against him I like that the
phone feels slim and slender in the hand
without feeling too cheap or chintzy and
I like that it fits easily in the pocket
I like the carbon fiber like pattern on
the back that along with the phone's
slimness helps it stand out I like its
display which isn't the best but
certainly isn't the worst I like it's
snappy UI performance it's reliable
software and the useful tweaks that
Huawei has built into Android ICS in
fact I like its software performance
overall and most of the time I like its
camera I don't like the use of the
old-style capacitive keys or the
cumbersome way Huawei requires you to
pull up the multitasking display I don't
like the hard corners of the device
which aren't comfortable in the palm or
against the ear if you're talking on the
phone I hate the keyboard no matter
which one I'm using and I don't like
that the camera needs ideal conditions
to deliver good results much of the time
finally while I don't really dislike its
hardware design overall I don't really
like it either
while it's slim it's very middle of the
road and really that's what defines much
of the ascend p1 experience besides the
keyboard it doesn't really do anything
terribly but it doesn't do a lot in an
exemplary fashion either it's a very
average very mid-range very unremarkable
device so if that's what you're in the
market for and you value a very slim
Android phone experience then the ascend
p1 should do just fine I give it a three
out of five
