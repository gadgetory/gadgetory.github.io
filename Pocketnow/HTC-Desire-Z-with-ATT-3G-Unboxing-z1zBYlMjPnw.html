pocketnow.com the HTC Desire Z is an
awesome Android phone especially if you
like a slide-out keyboard that really
feels good problem is it's only
available on t-mobile with the g2 and in
Europe
what about AT&amp;amp;T there's actually a
version of the Desire Z that will do 18
T with the 3G bands and we're going to
unbox it for you right now
let's get to it
all righty so let's get to the unboxing
this is a very rare device really hard
to find HTC really doesn't advertise
that it actually exists but you can get
it at Negri electronics comm and we
thank them for sending us a units review
so let's try to get this open here kind
of tight alright finally got it out of
the box here and beautiful looking
device nice sized box has a nice
slide-out keyboard here a sort of pop
like hinge we already reviewed the g2 on
Pocket now so we're not gonna talk in
depth about this device but just wanted
to cover it for all of the 18 - users
out here so I'm going to take off this
plastic oh here are some specifications
so of course this has an 800 megahertz
CPU and there it is right there 850 1900
megahertz bands that is what you need to
do AT&amp;amp;T 3G here in the US and in some
other parts of the world I should add so
here we go alright and looks like this
slides down maybe maybe not and here it
goes Wow beautiful display with the
device right on the front a really nice
looking device has a desire like look
it's part of the desire series obviously
let's pop it out and put it aside for a
sec sure we're sure we're gonna get the
standard HTC accessories in here there's
really no surprises these days
the charger and headphones and that's
what you expect let's look at this
device been off the table a little bit
so here it is the HTC Desire Z with AT&amp;amp;T
3G Benz let's check out this Wow that's
really cool how it pops out it really
does do a little jump they were able to
actually make the device thinner by
using a special kind of hinge here and
you can actually stop it in the middle
which is kind of weird hopefully that
won't break off but it's got a really
cool action to it we can take off this
plastic so we can see the keyboard in
its full glory
really nice feel very similar to the HTC
Touch pro2
which had probably one of the best
keyboards of any smartphone and here it
is the touch pro2
the keys are bigger on the touch pro2
and also of course you get the tilt
screen on the desire Z's
there's no tilt it's just a popping
mechanism but that's really awesome just
have to
so fast could imagine that would annoy
people but it would also be pretty fun
to do let's look around the device we
have a metal battery door here says with
Google with HTC Sense this is an Android
2.2 device should be really really fast
great performing smartphone you can
release the battery door by switching
this off battery anyhow we'll talk about
that in future videos let's compare the
desire Z in size to other devices so you
just saw it right next to the HTC Touch
pro2 actually very similar size similar
size screens and of course the keyboards
are quite different we already looked at
that but it's just so fun to slide out
this keyboard let's take a look next to
the Droid 2 which also has a slide-out
keyboard although it's not a popping
slide out it's just a you know move it
forward non spring assistant let's
compare the keyboards of these two
devices I really like the layout of the
desire Z it's staggered it's the keys
are separated by space whereas here on
the Droid 2 they're kind of Chiclets
style
okay let's look at the desire Z next to
the iPhone 4 again all these devices a
lot of these devices have very similar
dimensions in terms of height and width
but then when you talk about thickness
the the iPhone 4 is definitely a lot
thinner but the desire Z is quite thin
for a device with a slide-out keyboard
devices with slider keywords are
typically thick like the touch pro2
but the desire Z is able to do it
without so much thickness and one more
comparison let's look at it next to the
Windows Phone 7 the Samsung Focus
obviously has a much bigger display 4
inch screen whereas the desire Z has a
3.7 inch display and of course the
Samsung Focus of very thin device pretty
cool so got a lot more to talk about on
the HTC Desire Z with the AT&amp;amp;T 3G bands
again if you want one of these of your
own go to Negri electronics comm one of
the very few places you can find this
device it's very rare but if you like
the desire Z when you have ATT this is a
good choice we're gonna talk more about
this device soon if you liked the video
please give it a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
