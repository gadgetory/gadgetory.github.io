coming to the iphone 7 camera but not
much Sony's Eva press invitations point
to a ton of gadgets to come the Galaxy
Notes have been just launched with a few
deals you might want to consider I'm hi
Mary vera and I wish I was celebrating
this friday but I've got more work just
like last weekend this is bargain L
daily
official news today begin with deals for
iPhones which is rather odd but you'll
get it when I explain it Verizon's got
three hundred dollars off the iphone 6
plus 6 plus not the 6s plus we're
talking about a year old phone that's
about to get to become a second year old
phone with whatever gets announced very
soon but still three hundred dollars off
pretty much sets that phone almost half
price if you go for the minimum storage
variants I would never recommend you buy
that but if you're desperate for an
iphone and you want to pay a good deal
and you want get the larger iphone yeah
that's an option i want to deal that i
would highly suggest you consider comes
from HTC the company has a hundred
dollars off the HTTP 10 and 4 color
variants and by four color variants it
includes the red one that i wish i could
get my hands on knock knock HTC that is
such a gorgeous color option for phone
so obviously it is unique but then again
the HTC 7 continues to be one of our
favorite phones of the year it's sad
that it hasn't gotten all the fanfare
that it deserves but it would still be a
really good bye be considerate and I
know we've got more deals today but are
part of news actually mainly because
it's friday and fridays are definitely
slow most of the time this time the
galaxy note 7 which just reach retail
some of you already have the phone in
your hands i'm sure you're enjoying it
and you know that there are deals of you
pre-ordered or if you continue ordering
as a noun till the end of august so you
either had the choice over the gear fit
to or 256 gigs in a storage card i would
go for the gear fit two hands down but
the other thing is that there are other
deals in addition to gear vr you also
have options for the deer 360 and others
that i would have to sit you should
follow the link of the description
because they have a lot to do with
barring a note 7 in order to get deals
as well the spotlight over to sony we
don't really talk about sony much lately
telling the xperia smartphones after
being such great phones have become such
blah options lately but hey if you're in
the market for a sony xperia the company
has a just announced what to expect for
eva and a sort of a teaser we're going
to be at Ethan Berlin covering it live
and we've got all the products you can
think of from
PlayStation 2 PlayStation VR to another
smartphone probably two other
accessories so it seems that Sony wants
to play this one really hard I saw the
sense of the world Sony I mean come on
you really need to go out with a bang at
least because your xperia x smartphones
i'm not so good and finally the most
interesting news today have to do with
the iphone 7s we've got trusted sources
that are finding parts for the iphone 7
iphone 7 plus or seven pro whatever than
a maybe and following the leaked renders
and the leaked dummy units it seems that
yes we're only getting one camera on
this iphone 7 the regular small variant
and the only benefit you're getting here
is optical image stabilization out this
is not necessarily a bad thing on the
contrary it's a great thing but
hopefully we get better sensors as well
sadly that has not been confirmed just
yet seems that if you're gonna want that
dual camera it's going to have to be on
a larger variant which leads me to the
question of the day if you're given the
option to buy one phone or another what
a dual camera make you want to go for
the dual camera variant or don't you
really care because in my case i have
seen benefits like for example on the LG
g5 which continues to be one of my
favorite cameras on a smartphone but
that's not the case for every phone
