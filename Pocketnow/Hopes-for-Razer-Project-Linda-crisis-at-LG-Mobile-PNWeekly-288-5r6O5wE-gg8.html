news post show will I phones get their
performance back after the battery
throttling scandal will we ever see a
real consumer release for razors project
Linda and just what the heck is LG doing
with their future phone line up we've
got a lot to talk about so make sure
you're charged and ready for episode two
eight eight of the pocket now weekly
recorded January 19th at noon pacific
this weekly podcast is where we dissect
and discuss those gadgets that make our
lives mobile smartphones tablets and
wearables it's all the stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and trying
to talk about a razor phone wasn't a
who's on first dial exercise of sorting
out different manufacturers I'm Juan
Carlos bag now senior editor
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mister Jules Wong on
the East Coast how's it going buddy boy
oh well don't mind me I'm just looking
at XML text wondering what the heck is
going on for my webpage here but that's
just that's good but we always strive to
bring you the most attentive and
conscientious podcast we can while also
she's already out the back end code on
all the the fires that are happening
this is just wondering who the hell is
talking about which story here and why
the stories are not popping up that's
that's the key I mean I post the
freaking rundown you know two hours and
admit and I you know I would hope to
have all this sorted out but instead
it's oh why why why would I have things
well prep we can we just wing it will do
alive do it yeah really Java SE runtime
now wants to install itself and it's
great well I always fan of the Java here
I don't I don't I could do away with
this by me I need to get prepped I need
the time Jules to flingy
in the first two minutes of the podcast
but I want to jump back in do just like
kind of a little CES recap on our own I
know you guys were able to produce
live show from the show floor I wasn't
able to join you this year for that but
some of the other cool things that we
saw from CES and just some of the fun
that you guys had run around and
covering some mobile stuff Jules what
were what were some of your favorite
finds at CES this year I had no
favorites if you saw the video that
Jaime put together after our podcast
with the mobile tech podcast manure and
the group there you would have seen you
wouldn't have able to have seen the
first take in which I was just all
Janette generic and like oh this is my
first big trade show and I'm super
excited for it I mean you were stepping
up to the to the big show this year they
were you know doing the videos and
putting you on the cameras no you have
to choose a favorite part you have to
choose the best product you can't just
no no you you have to say this is the
definitive thing and I reluctantly chose
project Gemini which you know and I mean
I think that's gonna be one of the you
know things to watch for but not
necessarily my favorite I didn't look at
to explore the show floor more than just
the heck is going on with this video or
that video I mean and if I did you know
and nothing really caught my eye and I
was thinking off there at this time like
one of these things is gonna catch my
eye and maybe never found it um this
song is dedicated to a man who just
didn't see anything cool today
like as Jules becomes Cameron to my
Ferris Bueller I mean but the nice thing
about CES is that you'll also catch them
like some cool experimental stuff I saw
the video that I may put together on
some of the crowdfunded initiatives that
companies were showing off on the show
floor didn't even catch anything wacky
and I think ooh like did you see the
Star Wars we want to go robot the robot
was awesome I thought that was great it
looks great it's just well you it's not
for sale and it's it's not a purview I
can't just like turn on an app and get
this robot
well okay if we're gonna keep things
more focused on mobile because this is
the pocket now podcast there were a
couple extra things that I saw on the
show floor that I thought were a lot of
fun my experiment for CES for my
personal stuff was to see if I could cut
daily vlogs all from my phone so
recording all the video doing all the
editing the rendering the uploading 4k
videos and I constructed a mobile rig
with with a gorilla pod and a baseplate
and a job yeah no I mean like a really
as pro is possible to try and get the
best I had a luma cube do all the
lighting and that that was my big
experiment and it worked way better than
I thought it would have in fact I don't
feel it really slowed me down a lot for
doing quick and punchy vlogs so we're
always trying to put out like you know
extra little side content or you know
Instagram stories or something you know
we're always trying to kind of keep the
story moving throughout so what are the
upload speeds never managed above three
megabits per second it took a long time
to upload 4k video but I mean again that
would have taken me the same amount of
time from a laptop is from a phone I
mean like everything still seemed to
work just about as quickly as if I had
done it all from my laptop and so there
were a couple of things on the show
floor that I felt were really exciting
for mobile production and so you know at
the Osmo to the new DJI handheld gimbal
it it looks like a nice refinement over
the first Osmo the first series of Osmo
gimbals but really it's the price point
seeing them clean up the product a
little bit give it a slightly bigger
battery even though now it's not
removable but now it's $130 yeah that
was a crazy thing that was that was
insane to see that and and I you know
this is one of the top names in sort of
consumer facing video stabilizers
gimble's that kind of a thing the the
quality of video with drones that they
do it you know and so yeah that's crazy
it's just crazy
and an alongside that I think for the
for the back end
workflow cuz you guys got to see the new
Asus phones right we're havin a little
time with the that was like you know it
had a big battery and you know it's like
the mid-range everything that 2017
bronze kind of thing well and and you
know again I think Asus is still trying
to play that price war but one of the
things that blew me away at the Asus
suite was the Zen screen go I it's a
it's a mini portable professionally
calibrated monitor that it's all powered
off of USB C and it has its own battery
to so it won't drain your other product
so you plug it into a laptop and it
shows up as a second screen but I
plugged on there demo unit which is
still a prototype it's not even a
finished commercial release yet it's
gonna be coming out q3 I plugged my
phone into it and it instantly screen
mirrored without having to do any other
apps or drivers or anything so I fired
up my video editing software on my phone
had this amazing display see what I was
doing and and like they're saying that
the price point on that's probably going
to be between I sub four hundred dollars
is what they said so in that three to
350 where I mean we're gonna be talking
about project Linda a little later in
the show an all-rounder
professional-grade calibrated monitor
it's just a murder right and no touch
screen by you want the larger workspace
and you want a bigger field of view to
look at that it works with everything
and it's a one cable connection is a
really exciting idea to me like that
something like that could be a huge
benefit for people who are trying to
work on the go yeah I can see definitely
has its uses for the mobile production
suite it's just one of those things I
feel like that could mean I'm not sure
well maybe you could make things more
fun now you know it's always about
efficiency and about you know just
getting things quick done and as well
wrap together as you know possible for a
mobile setup but yeah I'm not sure if
this will make things fine necessarily
because it's another piece of equipment
that you have to lug around even though
it's like you know good for the size
it's still another thing right but what
I'm looking at is we've got a number of
companies experiment
thing with changing form factors like
project Linda is a great example of a
proprietary solution which works for one
phone to give you a bigger workspace and
something like this where you I mean you
would have been carrying around like a
tablet in addition to a phone and now
you can blow up this work experience or
you have a work laptop and you want a
secondary screen a second monitor to go
with that laptop you don't have to cart
a TV sized device just for extra work
space like you just want to keep your
video output on that so you can work
your timeline on your main computer or
you want all your plugins if you're
editing photos just all off on one
little screen so you don't interrupt the
the bigger display on your laptop again
there are fun applications like you know
you can watch movies better you can see
your video on a bigger screen if you're
using it with with a phone but for me
this is a Productivity dream is to have
this modular portable you know Universal
accessible monitor which I thought was
just extremely well done and yeah I mean
as long as they don't have to check bags
at the airport because these one you
still don't have to pull for a tablet so
if you added this screen and a phone
technically well I guess now you do I
mean it's a sheer you know give or take
OS system but then again you know just
having one thing powered the whole you
know a set up is kind of gold but in any
case I think that is definitely
something to be appreciated and we'll
talk more about that we would get to
project Linda in the news how about that
I'm gonna throw them out there real fast
the Garmin speak I'm super super stoked
about this live in California every time
we get behind the wheel of the car I
feel like I'm taking my life into my
hands it's it's a little - but better
well it's a little dash camera and and
I'm kind of holding out my fingers here
because it is you know about the
circumference that I'm kind of showing
right here sticks up under your rear
view mirror and it off it will give your
car Lane Guidance and accident collision
detection so if you don't have those
things
already built into your car it's gonna
give you that it's got a dash camera
built-in so if anything happens you've
got a DVR of all of your driving that's
great and it's got a tiny super simple
heads-up display that tells you how fast
you're going and gives you very simple
turn-by-turn simple forward arrow left
arrow right arrow and distance to your
next turn and for the newest version
this year they've incorporated Amazon
Alexa so you can also ask it you know
while you're driving like hey what's my
next appointment or hey what what's
going on in my schedule or you know play
the Seinfeld trivia game with me 0:01
car assistant that people have been
walking wanting out of their smart
speakers at home 200 bucks 200 bucks and
it brings some of that smart speaker
stuff into your car it gives you a
heads-up display that you can keep at
eye level you don't have displays that
eventually you'll be like wondering if
you could speed read the phone 4:05 and
like record games like Oh
Californians know you can never speed
around the 405 it's always a
bumper-to-bumper and then the last thing
something that I'm playing with right
now I'll be getting a review out on this
shortly years ago I did a review on a
product called the backtrack mobile and
it's a it's a portable Bluetooth police
grade breathalyzer that connects to your
phone and this year the company showed
off two new products one is a keychain
sized version of the backtrack mobile
this is the backtrack c6 and then later
this year they're gonna be releasing a
skin sensor so it reads the alcohol
content of the sweat in your skin and
you can wear it like its own standalone
wearable if you want to wear it like a
fitness band but it's actually designed
to replace the watch strap on your
SmartWatch so you have an Apple watch
you can keep a sensor on your wrist
super discreet you never have to show it
off or no one will ever know what it is
and all the time it's going to sit there
and monitor your the blood alcohol
content of your sweat so you can get a
real-time glimpse of just what your
level of intoxication is throughout the
evening phenomenal like piece of
lifestyle tech because this kind of
stuff is is dangerous we're seeing rates
of DUI over the last year have actually
increased so even with uber and lyft and
taxis getting cool apps there are more
people getting behind the wheel
inebriated than there were in years past
and so something like this I think can
be a very valuable piece of information
for people that are looking to have a
good time but are also looking to try
and do that safely self impairments in
terms of drunk driving I think I'm not
sure how I feel about that I just you
know if I'm gonna drink I'm just gonna
take the subway home or get it lift
anyways because I don't write at all
that's well yeah I mean that that's a
private for you I'm not saying that you
we're gonna want to do this but I I
actually for two of the parties that we
were at for wrapping up CES I was
walking around with this thing and it is
kind of interesting like the first time
someone sees you blow into a
breathalyzer in public there are just
cut and aah fish nests of like what's
this guy's got problems why is he
walking around with a breathalyzer but
with these little interchangeable tips
so that you can like hygienic ly pass it
around it became sort of the fun party
game of like just how and even about the
bottle man you know and you clean it off
alcohol is a disinfectant it's fine
you'll be fine
um pass it around but that's one of the
things like once you kind of take the
stigma off of it it's just really
interesting to check in because I think
a lot of people know about how many
drinks they can handle if they have
experience with alcohol but they might
not know how many drinks will actually
put them over the legal limit and so in
a car heavy state it's always kind of
gross and insidious that in California
you kind of can't get anywhere unless
you're driving so I don't go out at
night and hang out at bars cuz I'll have
my car like I'm gonna have a couple
drinks and then get back in my car or
I'm always having to hitch a lift or an
uber or something like that so again
products like this I feel are just
really nice lifestyle adaptations that
people can use and this is the the
newest version of it is not that
expensive this thing retails for 50
bucks
so the c6 it's about the same size as
the clicker for my condo gate and it
works surprisingly well so I've been
very impressed with this company I think
they're making some great lifestyle
products instead of like $50 every night
you you know wanna like higher DD or
something I don't know you know but I
only just adds to the
gushin you know and it also gives you a
little bit of insight like I have a
really good idea now of like how many
Bourbons I can drink before I'm gonna be
running into problems or it's not just
I'm taking a guess well I weigh about
170 pounds and I don't know this drink
is like 80 proof so if I have two of
those and maybe I'll be no no don't mess
with that
don't try and guess what your BAC is
there are some good products out there
that I think can help people out I mean
don't be like me that could you know but
get this like very nasty little bruise
in the elbow because not because I was
drinking but because apparently there's
this hotel that doesn't know how to pull
down its pool railings correctly so
awesome and so did you like you throw a
fit about like liability I'm going to
call my lawyer mmm I got to take away a
bathrobe and better call Saul would be
so disappointed in you right now I think
uh you know those are some of the fun
other other products that I saw at CES
there were a ton of really crazy things
especially checking out CES for gaming
gear and PC hardware building and stuff
like that so CES is really known for but
there were some really fun lifestyle you
know companion devices not always the
most exciting show for phones but I
thought I saw some really cool services
that we can now start doing more cool
stuff with our phones and with our
mobile apps and services yeah more life
stylist less strife style yeah we're
totally gonna make that a t-shirt for
the show we're gonna yeah merch
yeah right now hashtag merch have steak
brands it's $50 at pocketnow.com not
really
hashtag one in joules Paul we're gonna
now fly to Japan and let's not go there
let's you know instead of doing that we
should talk about some news for the week
of January 15 2018 this is all the news
that is fit to podcast Apple had a huge
bonanza this week with an announcement
of a 350 billion dollar capital plan for
the next five years thanks to the recent
reforms in corporate tax rates in the
United States one of the other pieces of
news that CEO Tim Cook
made in an interview with ABC News
revolves around the startling
controversy for older iPhones he said
that users will soon be able to toggle
the throttling of of the throttling off
through software with a future update
the behavior was put into place to
prevent battery malfunctions and device
shutdowns Google's fuschia OS cuts put
into a pixel book in a semi working
States in terms of interface by Ars
Technica as though the applications
picture is still far from finished the
pixel book has been in works for about
three years now and was one of the this
excuse me future iOS has been in the
works for three years now the textbook
was one of several Intel based test beds
for the experimental OS that is to work
on found tablet and laptop platforms of
upcoming Motorola phones has ran Android
life detailing devices in the Moto G 6
Moto X 5 edmodo z3 series all of them
have come up with 2x1 displays and some
of them have intriguing things going on
with the fingerprint sensor lit into the
nitty-gritty later on project Phi is
introducing a bill protection a feature
that caps the bill amount depending on
how many users there are on an account
and individually charged on a pro-rated
basis up to up through six gigabytes of
usage and then we'll have free access at
full speed up through 15 gigabytes the
user can then choose to pay for more
full speed data or stay with slower data
for free through the end of the month
razor could launch the project when a
smartphone laptop hybrid with a razor
phone sequel in September that means
coming from a source 2 for Android Lynda
debuted at CES as the latest in many
concepts that have yet to go on sale
from Razer and worldwide it could cement
razor's involvement in it mobile and
finally Huawei has published a video
promoting a fast charge technology that
can promise smartphone battery up to 48
percent capacity in five minutes
the only problem the video was first
seen at a symposium in 2015 that
quotable batteries were more popular in
phones and that's what this technology
is predicated on we've yet to suss out a
reason why the videos been remixed and
republished you got any guesses why I
guess is as to why no but that
definitely seems to be something that is
again a current a part of the current
zeitgeist you know the Apple story
battery Health battery longevity and
then no more flagships with removable
batteries is something I think people
care about so I think it's it's just
like revisiting a concept or revisiting
an idea that is resonating right now I
mean we can make it cool again we can
like start talking about and get getting
all like the the social armies riled up
and I think any company in Huawei
especially they're the number three in
the world anything that a company can do
to act as a differentiator is a good
marketing tactic right now you know the
the difficulties that we're seeing from
manufacturers like LG and HTC Huawei
doesn't want to just coast on their
current market market penetration they
want to see if they can't build on their
fan base and so yeah they want away well
that's profusely to our friends at
Huawei I mean people care about right
now like what's going on with the
battery in my phone and I think their
timing on this is right to revisit this
as an idea yeah yeah indeed dad and you
know introducing Goverdhan right the the
whole graphene ball fast charging tech
there are gonna be some some competing
solutions to fast charging coming on the
horizon very very soon are out right now
and you know there's there would be more
news to be made out of this because you
know they'd be promoting the heck out of
it then I mean that's then and this is
now so I still want my graphene balls
let's
I think we talked about some other
things like such as Apple who you know
it's very big week for them they're
gonna pay billions and billions in
repatriation taxes and also apparently
you're not going to see a cheaper iPhone
just because they got all these savings
you know whether economic trends thought
is that if they get tax savings in any
ways that will pass on to the consumers
but instead we're just being told that
innovation costs what innovation costs
so there you go you get you get that oh
yeah and that's right
Murray's batteries well I don't know
that's definitely one of the bigger nice
stories coming out of this is better
disclosure again Apple got burned
because there was confusion surrounding
this this topic and there wasn't the
kind of transparency that people expect
now with one of the most
mission-critical lifestyle companion
devices that they carry it was a very
bad look for Apple for them to be
monkeying around with the performance of
these devices it brings up a whole new
conversation on things like what should
a premium smartphone contain to offset
some of the ways that a smartphone can
age you know like if we activate the
full power of an iPhone and after a year
that can cause system instability then I
think it's on Apple to put in a bigger
battery so that there's a buffer zone as
the phone ages in that battery degrades
I don't think it's sufficient to say
you're 7/8 $900,000 smartphone has the
bare minimum capacity to drive the CPU
at full power for six months like that's
not okay but at least now consumers have
a little bit better transparency on on
on what's actually going on with their
phones so I just closure that comes out
of a lack of disclosure and now they're
trying to make sure now is trying to
cover their bases and who knows what
else they might be hiding in the next
kind of you know barrier in this race so
I mean we'll see
whatever but I mean getting on to the
other sort of political
- I you know giving giving employees
bonuses that's nice
I $25 in that stock yeah cool I'm happy
to see that and I'm happy to see that
they're one of the few companies that
made a big announcement out of giving
their employees bonuses and not then
going on to lay off hundreds or
thousands of their employee maybe even
announce it like some what some source
inside the company he passed on an email
Bloomberg and they had to confirm it
with Apple so it's like yeah you know
like you know who is it wasn't Verizon
one of the first like hey we're gonna
give all of our employees bonuses
because of this new tax plan you gonna
5,000 of them mm-hmm yeah so I mean you
know right before the holidays whereas
this you know it's just yeah after the
holidays and none of the seasonal
impacts are coming into play so I mean I
mean you could just they could justify
it as something that was part of the you
know average yearly cycle for jobs but
that doesn't take away from the sweet
sweet irony from it yeah again a bad
look for a company like that so
hopefully this is an apple who's gonna
participate better an apple that's
actually gonna pay their taxes and and
do business in a way that's a little bit
more up front a little bit more
transparency a little bit more clarity
as to what they're doing that that to me
out of all of this that would be a
positive ramification of some of these
changes well as the world's largest
corporation you know having that
discount from thirty five percent to
fifteen point five percent on the
repatriation rates when you're talking
about two hundred fifty two billion
dollars it's still a lot but it is
galling that they held their taxes
hostage until they got a better rate
like I don't think that's an apple
I would want to do business with I don't
think that's an Apple that still
qualifies is us cherishing it as an
American company but this is a step
towards I hope you know a better
relationship between how these monies
are sort of extracted from this country
and then paid back into the system so
that everyone can benefit the math
that's that leaves owned you know that's
like two hundred forty five billion
dollars going back in with
like seven billions left for a Regional
Park you know just you know maintaining
the businesses outside of the US which
is you know fine and all that when you
put this as part of the overall view
with the 350 billion dollars you're
going to lots of data sensors to a lot
of the new facilities including I think
those one in Reno Nevada another there
it could I'm not sure if this is the one
that was on an end still or something
entirely separate but one in Culver City
you know near Hollywood because they're
getting into more of the media play with
the original series and stuff and
they're doing a lot of money just to see
I'm not sure if that's part of like the
the capital plan or the investment plan
in the United States and make it great
again and whatever but I'm like the one
thing I can be fairly confident as Apple
with Tim Cook at the head I don't think
they're too mega I don't think corporate
corporate tax reform for them they you
know Tim Cook said it it benefits them
and you know it's helping them create
jobs 20,000 up to 20,000 a lot not that
a corporate tax rate is also being
appropriately paid because I mean we
went through the same thing with Apple
migrating to the EU to the to Ireland as
a tax haven and then still not paying
the EU what they what they thought the
tax bill should be this is coming in
from Renato Laporte using the PN weekly
hashtag Renato writes I am oh this
should contain it should contain a
warranty if you better dollar phone
talking about the battery if you buy a
$600 phone you expect it to run okay for
a long while yeah the battery won't last
the same as the first day but if it's
affecting performance after one year
replacement should be free and and I
think a lot of people would probably
agree but this is also one of the ways
that Apple was able I feel to build a
larger profit margin into their phones
is the bare minimum battery for the
smaller iPhone to get you through the
day but as that battery degrades you
have zero buffer room you have zero room
to lose battery capacity and total power
output which is necessary to drive a
powerful CPU and GPU at their max rates
one starts to question whether that $29
replacement fee for the battery usually
$79 is should be considered more of a
bill in price instead of just something
some accessory kind of deal of service I
mean it's tough and it's tough to
unravel because these are also priced at
the premium end of the market so what
are our expectations and what should we
demand from a company but switching
gears because I also really want to jump
into this one I the the article written
up on fuchsia we talked about this the
potential successor to Android or Chrome
OS we weren't really sure it was more of
an experimental project but seeing more
and more development working on this and
that it's already being tested on
current hardware solutions is a positive
step towards a Google and Android a
Chrome OS merge the ability to compete
more readily against other operating
system solutions and and kind of drive
consumer mobile products into a smoother
faster more streamlined development
cycle I think it's still way in early
days because what will make this
platform are the apps in the new they're
supposedly many bridges to codes like
Swift which originally was an apple but
the Creator has moved to Google so
that's that's an interesting move as
well as Kotlin and all these others that
Google is cooking up and the standard
languages as well Java and the like so
yeah in terms of working all those into
like a single design paradigm whether
material design gets carried over in the
future I mean that's and how these all
these link up interact and provide
services to the users that's gonna be an
interesting path for where you're going
but in terms of the interface I mean
it's for me it's intuitive it's simple
it's clean it's what I've always wanted
in terms of just a you know mobile
workstation so props so far at least
what really pretty yeah so if you and
will just do a little painting by sound
here so at the lockscreen you know you
type in the lockscreen and it's
obviously integrated into Google you
would get your account information like
that the home screen you know you got
the wallpaper you got central fuchsia
button which you know the sides of it
you got all the data the information the
about network connectivity time device
status whatnot at the bottom you're
gonna find a familiar Google bar with
the feed below it with all the cards the
information that you need and then as
you get into apps as you you know find
your way in if the apps
they'll be piled on top of the
information bar so you can just go back
to them whenever you want so I mean it
feels intuitive to me now I mean really
nice considerations on kind of building
on the user interface and user
experience that we all kind of
understand at this point it's an it'll
definitely be a stray away from just the
Android ecosystem that we totally
understand today but not so much so that
I think it's going to be detrimental
ultimately though I still think this is
probably Google's best hope for
rectifying some of the problems on
things like updates and we recently went
through all the stories about meltdown
inspector those are hardware issues
patches can fix some of the security
holes from some of these from some of
these issues but if we expect people to
continuously live more and more of their
daily lives their personal information
their banking information their medical
information out of mobile devices we
need an update an update path which is
better than what Google currently has
with them putting out new software for
Android it going to a manufacturer who
then tweaks it it then going to a
carrier who then tweaks it and
eventually getting delivered to
consumers months maybe even a year after
that update was actually released from
from the developers so if fuchsia can
can get on top of that timeline in a
more iOS fashion then that to me will be
the biggest win I know there will be apt
teething pains but
it's becoming a bigger and bigger deal
that people are not really getting the
support they pay for with mobile devices
so what Ars Technica which you know did
the whole testing article it says
dramedy Ron Adam can't even say the
guy's name Ron I'm a a Oh easy for you
to say Bakula is that there you know
there is no there would not be a
physical install medium and therefore
there you know in my opinion there would
not be the benchmark the version that
you know Google would use so I'm not
sure whether there is a more room for
OEMs to play around with fuchsia but
we'll have to see it's still far off
we're still years away from any final
workings to this so on but it's
definitely interesting to just keep tabs
on this yeah definitely definitely
something also worth keeping tabs on
real quick moto xiii uh what do you
think modular phones the completion of
the Moto Z experiment they a so what
leaked along with the other Moto X and
Moto e series phones what I really like
Moto's entry and mid-range strategy I'm
still not quite sure they found the
killer niche or the killer app to get
people excited about their flagships no
not yet I mean just the single slate
slide that we found on the one the
highlight motive mods for the z3 which
is a 5g judgment supposedly or you know
we could infer that basically all these
radios don't like the radios that would
come on the road is e3 or not when have
support for 5g and this would just be a
tack on to allow the phone to support
those speeds and those networks and
those protocols but I mean the you know
that's that's one cool feature that you
know you just get that get instant
faster day more especially if it could
also like go all the way back to like
the Moto Z like the first one I mean I
would actually be pretty sweet you have
got like a battery backup with a 5g
radio array built-in
you could just slap it on that would be
epic that'd be great
I mean and the the use case would
practically be like a very small pool
but still that I mean just the thought
of that reverse engineering that is just
amazing I'm seeing a different port here
instead of like the sixteen dots that
we're getting at those 16 pin connector
at the back it's a more kind of abstract
more you know metallic lozenge line
thing at the bottom yeah we'd like it
would be able to fit it would be able to
those pins but I'm not sure if it's
exactly the same kind of deal we're
working with I mean Motorola promised
that this would be around the pin design
would be around for at least one more
year so maybe we'll see this be inter
compatible well fingers crossed and
something you don't need to cross your
fingers for real quick because I want to
get to project Linda but talking about
project Phi because I am a project file
user I thought that was a nice
consideration of putting a maximum cap
on what you get charged for I
I wonder do you think this is gonna make
project find more desirable for people
who are shopping the various MVNOs out
there cuz here like the thing is that
priced competitiveness after the Sprint
t-mobile thing fell apart the merger
fell apart has been very you know it's
dried up it's been dried up and the only
thing that Sprint has done I think now
is started to attempt to go at and like
switchers again and it's been forecast
by analysts that they wouldn't be doing
the whole promotional thing as heavily
as they have done in the past so with
that if nasai mean $80 is where we see
AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and even some t-mobile
plans at this tier you know
Landon it's right up there the 15
gigabyte limit or the throttle point is
kind of low compared to the rest of them
but even still 256 kilobits per second
is something I wouldn't you know you
know cut my eyes out for so it could be
okay because I'm looking at t-mobile
right now and if you because they're new
one plan is 70 bucks a month for one
line but I mean yeah it's the basic deal
that they have and so that it's we'd
already be streaming it's like limited
hotspot yeah you know like if we're
we're talking about you know so if you
if you want so seventy bucks in line for
one line and if you want unlimited HD
streaming then it's only $10 more and
that also gets you unlimited Wi-Fi on
gogo
enabled flights more it slower speeds
internationally than what's offered from
Project Phi but it will bump up the
speeds to more like 3G speeds in most
countries you know like that's still at
that $80 a month thing and I think you
you you you're having to worry less as
you get closer to like a 20 gigabyte cap
where project Phi is gonna stop you at
15 isn't it something isn't it 21 22
well the thing is that gigabytes a month
is when they will throttle people a big
point about just raising that cap
because oh well or network is doing so
great and that would also add in a
Netflix subscription yeah and you know I
mean third there isn't yeah they're so
like services I mean you know I mean
t-mobile also ties you down in turn
right but the difference is is that
you're you are actually you are actually
paying $80 a month whereas Project Phi
you're only paying for what you use but
I just think it's it's kind of
interesting watching where we all kind
of end up with these different dollar
amounts like you know maybe a couple
months you you are under that 80 dollar
cap if you were
really heavy smartphone user on Project
five that could be kind of nice but if
you do a lot of traveling man like
trying to crunch the numbers in the math
on what makes sense for what regions is
is pretty tricky right now yeah I mean I
I mean I have no further thoughts since
II's Sprint's and I both in the same you
know use case I'm just like yeah I can
deal with both and this makes it more
affordable you to say that so so so
pitifully I'm with Sprint
we're weren't the last carriers in the
u.s. to actually go to five g's so yeah
a long wait for us you know what let's
let's switch gears and talk about talk
about something a little more
imaginative a little bit more fun spend
some time with project Linda I got to
spend some time with project Linda what
do you think I thought this was a
beautifully polished implementation of
an idea we've been trying to achieve
since the dawn of pocket computer phones
too many moving parts
seriously I'm being really serious you
do you think it's it's too complicated
I mean if with the whole the engineering
for the USB C port because you connect
to the shells so I mean let's you know
you put in your razor phone because it
has to be a razor firm and it can't just
be eight Nicole Scott said that a pixel
to excel fit in the area it doesn't
recognize the shell doesn't recognize it
so there's that but you put in your
razor phone you press the button in
order to get that drilling sound and
have the USB food and then you you know
it's great in in principle you got just
like a 256 gigabyte disk for extra
storage and another like however much
batteries there is on to the show and
you get that with the RGB II keyboard
and it's nice and fancy I don't
there's a root there's room for Android
on this thing
I would much rather prefer it be an AC
PC and always connected thing with the
windows but you'd want to see a mixed
operating system environment not like
what Huawei and Samsung are doing with
their screen sharing and Dex
technologies no no III mean I have more
use for Windows apps than Android apps
at this point especially given you know
the variety of programs as opposed just
one good program here on Android that
you have to really search for the Google
Play Store and whatnot so I think I'm a
little bit more positive on this than
you are if only because of my experiment
in producing with my phone during CES is
that mobile apps aren't there yet but
they've gotten so much better at getting
me through a huge chunk of what I would
use my laptop for that III think there
is a consumer today who could benefit
from a mobile only approach and I think
that'll only grow over the next couple
years because of these innovations in
screen sharing screen mirroring and
making Android recognize different
display aspect ratios and resolutions
and so I mean you're not wrong having
windows on arm could be pretty epic as a
Qualcomm 845 that can switch back and
forth between operating systems could be
cool but I worry that that's gonna make
I mean like I played with a Windows
Android tablet way back in the day and
it was a terrible experience and I'm
know we could do better talking about
glute situation I just want Windows 10
on the thing well and we all know how
windows phones are going you know like
yeah yeah I mean come on if you
regarding like if our urine to be
working between those things but I mean
like you looking at the looking at where
like Chrome OS was and looking at where
Android is I mean from my LG v 30 I
wrote out scripts in Microsoft Word you
know I'm using Microsoft Word on a
little Bluetooth
keyboard I was able to record high
quality audio and edit it on the phone I
was able to keep a timeline with three
video elements five audio tracks text
transitions and the ability to mix
content so I was pulling content from
two different phones all in 4k rendering
folk 4k upload that to to youtube do all
of the same like SEO stuff that I need
to do on YouTube and it was all through
mobile apps and services and I think if
I had just had more screen real estate
to work with it wouldn't have been that
much different it only would have been
slightly less powerful than how I would
have used a proper laptop in the same
working conditions totally wouldn't work
for the way that I work out of my office
I'm working from a desktop proper
workstation that thing's a monster I can
do so much work there but on the go
gaming laptop wouldn't have been that
much different or that much faster from
how I was working from my phone I would
agree but I would enjoy doing it more on
a gaming laptop as opposed to because
like again I like I took out my
essential phone for note-taking I was
doing the whole you know trying to get
the keyboard I could do it just as fast
as I needed it to but if I had gotten my
Eve V that you know I got and you know I
started typing onto thinking and it it
was a dream like I probably boards right
right we've seen all these experiments
like the a sous line the PadFone and the
foam pad and the transformer line of
tablets that could then dock into a
laptop style keyboard cradle we've seen
Motorola had their lap dock you know it
was a really awkward you'd have to plug
the phone with an HDMI and a USB port
and then you know not being able to use
the phone for anything because it was
plugged into the back of this laptop
laptop shell connected Project Linda
actually does the one thing I think a
lot of us were asking for where it turns
the phone into your trackpad that I mean
like I've been asking for that since
like like the very very first Android
phone
the first droids were out just give me
something that can connect to this
especially back then since a lot of
there were numerous ones out there that
had HDMI ports so again ready yet but
when you're talking about like hey I was
using my essential phone to try and
write notes and then it felt so much
better to do that on a proper keyboard
project Linda sounds like the right
solution to mix phoned and lustre screen
capabilities it does it does I don't
need to kill it as a concept I just mean
to I mean the software is not there yet
for me at least so I mean I I would I
would completely agree we were talking
about this before we went online I think
the thing that I would completely agree
with you is also just the notion of it
being a proprietary product you know
yeah moto mods it makes me a little
nervous like I'm gonna buy a really
expensive phone and a really expensive
laptop shell and it's not that's it
that's the one product it's not gonna go
anywhere if I try to move to another
manufacturer or even a future phone
update from the same manufacturer could
still burn me well if it's a shell then
you could do a little bit more
engineering with you know if it if it
were a matter of size of the phone and
just having to cater to that you could
do a spring thing or something like that
like that you can make it Universal oh
yeah so I mean it's not just so well one
would if there's that's that's why it
was oh yeah yeah go ahead no summer I
mean
some other manufacturer that you know
can take this concept and get it to the
Patent Office quicker than razor does
maybe we have something here and who
knows what will happen well that's
that's and that takes me back why front
to the top of the show why I was so
excited about a Seuss that Zen screen go
Android phones seem to do a really good
job of screen mirroring now in a way
that's seamless one cable connection
USBC done and you're often running on a
larger workspace and I don't think it
would take much to add a keyboard and a
trackpad to that environment and have
any phone you would lose touch screen I
think I don't know that you'd be able to
do this with a touchscreen but I don't
think it would take much to your
solution that would that would mirror
your screen in a useful way give you a
mouse cursor and a keyboard and get you
off and running that would then work for
any phone that you used with that
comparable tablets have spoiled me at
this point because I I don't like this
here this laptop and yeah there doesn't
have that screen I'm just like what what
that I have to move my mouse all the way
over here I have to set this it could be
fast and that well you know wait I can't
get miss click because it was to suck
I'm like from from working on from
working on just like different Windows 8
tablets from back in the day and the
surface and let that's why when I bought
my gaming laptop it was like I need
Thunderbolt I need a higher resolution
than 1080p and I'm not giving up on a
touchscreen and I there was only one
laptop that it fulfilled all those at
the time of purchase which funnily
enough was the razor blade so I'm one of
those triple snake in the razor
ecosystem kind of guys while you're
pulling that out we do have a tweet here
from from Jonas gamau from PN weekly
hashtag P and weekly raise the project
Linda should have been what Microsoft
showcased with Windows 10 mobile when it
was first introduced and I agree
especially because we saw with the Lumia
950 that continuum project I actually
found my continuum
doc I was digging out my lumia 1020 to
do a revisit on the Lumia 1020 camera
and in my box o windows phones I found
my continuum doc and it just made me
really sad that we hadn't really you
know that Microsoft gave up so early on
ideas that are now becoming really
popular and if they had done that on
Qualcomm 820 and Qualcomm 830 hardware
that this stuff would have run so much
better than when they introduced it on
the Qualcomm 808 I'm sorry I'm just
paying attention to my Eevee here and
just you know you are digging that thing
so tell the folks at home and especially
those of us who those who are listening
to our podcast not watching the video
stream you've been playing with the
Eevee for a little while was that your
that was my up that's my personal
purchase and Jaime is doing a review for
pocket now but this is my personal
purchase over here and you know - so far
so good
the keyboard is just the best for me
like like not pitching and the travel
are just nice and get being used to you
know touch you know touch screens with a
stylus and and just you know regular
trackpad you know I was able to very
much more quickly switch between two
different windows and you know type in
different text fields and all that which
I need to do for my job and it was just
it's like that really has improved my
workflow by at least 10 15 percent so
yeah I'm just so far so far the
experiments been a success I mean where
did you where would you see something
like this fitting into the more
traditional like manufacturer ecosystem
of surface other traditional
manufacturers out there I'm just doing
this selfishly and and just using it
from my own tools I understand on on
whether or not you think that this is
this is the the right competitor
opposite you know like HP came out with
something similar
has had something similar I mean
everyone do something similar to wooden
one form factor and you know it's up to
people's this you know minds to say hey
I want a tablet or I want you know
something that has a keyboard or whatnot
or I want an actual laptop that can
actually fold out that you know stays
hinged but you know doesn't you know it
doesn't work so I mean that's to
people's preferences I think the the
concept of just having a screen as
needed is here to stay and it's just a
different in a matter of you know
engineering just being able to have it
available have it as a choice yeah so um
we're getting coming into the in
territory in this podcast but we do want
to spend a little time talking LG we got
a number of tweets from people just
talking about the the current strategy
walking away from the G series name may
be releasing phones later in the year we
got a few here this is from at fat
produce on using the p-n weekly hash tag
which company do you think will be in a
better situation going forward LG or
Sony because Sony actually had some
stuff to show off at CES and then Asli
work with yeah right and then also
following that up with I wonder if the
suits at LG know where their weaknesses
really are based on the decisions they
are making right now huawei had better
advertising taglines leading up to CES
then LG has had ever for their phones
and I think he's trying to make the the
comment or the observation that maybe
the problem isn't with the phone and
it's with how the company is is
disclosing announcing and advertising
their products what do you think Jules
it seems to me that if a company a major
mainstream manufacturer were to try and
take some risks right now not just
dumping out a new product sounds like
the right kind of risk you know maybe
taking a step back reevaluating the
market and not just following lockstep
trying to compete against the galaxy
might be a better play than releasing a
phone which will continue a trend of
selling as well it's not just a matter
of competition of time it's a matter of
competition of product and I wouldn't
say that the March release a time frame
would be the most important thing to go
it would have been nice to have you know
seen just a little mid-range action at
the very least but all we're getting
apparently is either first of all a new
red color of the v30 and also this rule
right now that there's an AI enhanced
v30 coming up at MDC which you know
rehash over rehash that's that's fun but
that's a problem I mean iPhone users
have had the same form factor for four
generations of iPhone now like the V 30
is a gorgeous phone if I could get a V
30 next year with just refinements to
the camera a new chipset and more
storage wouldn't that be I think I think
whatever fans that LG has garnered have
less patience for that compared to other
manufacturers and that LG's design is
just is not I mean it's it blends in
with the rest of them and with them
being a third place a third string or
whatever string they are it just blends
in because people are only apt to
encounter an LG phone by happenstance
you know like if LG had gotten after the
advertised so LG announced the V 30 then
it took weeks it took like five weeks
before we had availability and pricing
in different regions and then it took a
couple weeks before those things were
actually in on store shelves by that
point we were already talking about
iPhones imagine if they announced the V
30 a week later it was on display in a
t-mobile or a Verizon store and then the
iPhone came out how the iPhone would
have felt derivative of what LG did with
their design you know the iPhone would
have felt like the the the phone playing
catch-up it wouldn't have felt like LG
was struggling to keep up with the
competition when they were the first
company to come out with two by one
aspect ratio displays
and the v30 helped refine and pretty up
what we got with the g6 I think that's
one of their biggest problems is
consumers don't pay attention to tech
media like tech fans do so they're not
gonna wait around for a phone to come
out at some point and then hope that
it's good they want to see it they want
to play with it they want to touch it
you know touch it and poke it and do
things with it and then if they hear
about it and they can't do that then
they forget about it okay so if later
and try and make up that if LG could
retcon its reputation I would much
appreciate that but it can't again it
doesn't have the room to do so because
you know if they they're not reaching
the same people as you know Apple does
just by scale just by whatever they're
they're able to target so in you know
the Apple you know like people have this
confirmation bias or this I'm not
necessarily confirmation bias but just
familiarity or this ecosystem bias where
they're kind of stuck in it or they
think they're stuck in it it's actually
easier than they think to transfer all
those files and whatnot between
ecosystems
I mean ecosystem changes I think are
actually a pretty big deal for general
consumers I mean there's a lot of
anxiousness and pressure that goes into
that but one of the things I like
there's like the Android like migration
we're not actually plugging in the cable
but I mean it's like you know everything
that you have to change in moving from
one manufacturer to another not
necessarily even ecosystem does create a
little bit of stress you you go to do
something on your phone you don't want
to think about navigating the UI you
just want to do that thing on your phone
and there's that momentary confusion
muscle memory confusion of doing it I
don't want to discount that but what I
mean is Apple has that reputation that
you've described and I think a major
reason why is because of the way that
they advertise and and I think LG could
catch up and change up their their
reputation a little bit more
aggressively if they put more care and
attention into properly releasing a
product like don't wait two months after
you tell us about it before we
can see one in a store that's that's
ludicrous but then also following the
conversation after the phone is launched
Apple doesn't give up on advertising the
week after the iPhone goes on sale they
continue to put pressure on the consumer
market throughout the year to remind
people that their products exist and
that their products are premium and I
think if the v30 had that kind of
conversation from the manufacturer
consumers would start to build a little
bit more faith that the manufacturer LG
continues to care and support their
products whether or not that even earned
it would be the perception I mean you
know it hasn't started because they
haven't been doing that thing but that's
just getting them to base zero and it
has oh not like until the day my weekend
hasn't talked to them because they
haven't done it yet tell me what that is
what is the V 30 commercial that you've
seen tell me one V 30 commercial that
you seen the hit record thing where it's
like everyone's dancing and happy and
stuff and that's it people we're happy
oh there is one other V 30 commercial
out there if you're if you're on YouTube
TV they are paying for an ad buy where
people talk and FEM eclis about
capturing moments and doing cool things
and it's very hipster and it's very
contrasting and it's very sepia tone
like god bless the LG v it is I mean I
to camera you know confessional style
disclosure of the amazing things they do
and then at the very end it's just that
little LG splash screen with the V 30 on
I mean like it has nothing to do with
the product you would never associate
the product with the commercial and you
instantly forget about the dry drab dull
tone of the commercial by the time the
commercial is over that is not how you
advertise a product you know I don't say
I don't want to say rip off Apple but
learn some lessons from Apple and
Samsung as to how they generate an
emotional relationship with their
customers and see if you can do the same
L
offer something that no other phone does
it is the world's best headphone jack
built into a mobile device and we've
never seen a commercial on that that is
an easy 15-second commercial to create
around a feature that they can
definitively and objectively say is the
best on any product that's currently
available for consumers to buy and then
I don't think that's a thing that was
Hatcher captured you know a 10-4
audience but the fact is they haven't
tried it yet so we we haven't seen them
try anything yet aside from this like
feel-good advertising this fun
light-hearted advertising in this
anthemic advertising and none of that
works Jason Statham in a bunch of crazy
costumes doesn't work try and actually
talk about your product they think they
are being different by just by not
talking about the product they're not
trying to sell you anything right those
those Devils at you know the street so
here's the thing here's where I'm
positive on LG bowing out of the first
half of the year I bet they will have
difficulties placing orders with
Qualcomm for chipsets and I think that's
one of the things that was a minor
stumbling point for the g6 is that it
launched with the a21 when we knew newer
phones were right around the corner with
more powerful processors so that puts
that takes some of the pressure off of
LG trying to compete and trying to do
you know trying to buy up manufacturing
lines before you know Samsung gets in
there and sucks up most of the market
that I think is actually a positive but
if we get to the second half of 2018 and
we don't see an LG that's continuing to
join the conversation on their products
continuing to better support their
products because they don't have a new
phone out in the marketplace I would
hope to see better support for their
existing phones I'm still waiting for
Oreo announcements and and downloads and
betas on my V 30 that would be nice then
I think LG's dead in the water in the
second half of the year if we don't see
them the the
manufacturer trying to raise its own
visibility they can't expect consumers
to just figure out that their products
exist well but hope that the LG's Joseon
seong-jin who issued the direct order to
stop the development apparently of the
g7 has his mind where it should be in
not up the bottom of where should well
I'm hoping again the I think there is a
potential for them to do something
pretty killer and I think trying to beat
the iPhone to its launch whatever
follow-up to the iPhone happens at the
end of 2018 and then also release this
is the big little combo what would have
been a g7 alongside what would have been
a v40 and you just make it the same
thing that Samsung does with the Galaxy
s8 and AG acts Galaxy s8 plus you know
just just focus on doing one line of
phones in two sizes for all markets all
regions don't mess around with some
features in some regions and some
features and others and deliver just the
most simplified premium experience that
they can that would be a huge step in
the right direction for LG we've got a
couple of tweets here with the from the
PN weekly hashtag a lot of people out
there talking about LG this is from
James Vincent hashtag pan weekly LG
should keep the G range it's what we've
come to know and recognize don't change
something that works they need to market
their products better I never see
anything from them when they're
launching something new from Andrew
Wallace also following up some of his
previous comments on PN weekly honestly
I don't think LG ever recovered from the
boot loop controversy either in terms of
consumer mind share and I think what
would go a long ways towards improving
that that that optics those optics would
be more regular software updates for
their current products the v20 is
woefully under supported in my opinion
the V 30 is already starting to feel the
same Renato Laporte let's be honest the
g6 launched a long time before the s8
and it didn't help LG was there showing
the g6 to the world
we were all talking about s8 rumors and
how fake the fingerprint put out fake
the fingerprint placement does so as
important as timely launch and
availability is promotion put some
pop-up stores and stands in places ads
be active on social media get a deal
with snap and Instagram and work to make
the best Android social media phone
camera ever
I don't know but do something and lastly
again from James from James Vincent LG
don't really seem to care about their
products they never replied to any
tweets either they don't interact with
their customers it's the perception of
the brand I think is the biggest deal
yeah
and so LLG life's good but are they
listening good are you doing the
listening what good is there to listen
with the LG LD listen good I think I
think that's the perfect note to wrap
this show up before before we jump into
my end spiel I just want to say thanks
