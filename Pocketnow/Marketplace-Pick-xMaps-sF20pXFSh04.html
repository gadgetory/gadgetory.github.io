pakka calm and many people use their
mobile phones as a navigation device
when they're either driving or hiking or
biking or pretty much anything nowadays
but one downfall of using either Google
Maps or Bing or any of these web enabled
mapping programs is that you have to
have an active data connection to use
them and in certain areas around the
country say the mountains or any
outskirt lying areas there isn't going
to be that data connection and this
program is called X maps and what it
allows you to do is to download maps
before you go on a certain trip or
whatnot so all I have to do is select
this tab here and i'm going to select my
area so let's say I'm going to go
there's mountains right here so I don't
get the best coverage if i click on
let's say i want to select this area i
can select the entire state of
washington and now I just all I need to
do is download but I'm going to select a
smaller area to save some time so let's
say I'm going to travel to this area
right here select download so i can
either select low detail or high detail
and d lower the detail the smaller the
data download will be and higher the
detail the larger the download will be
so this one's about eighty five
gigabytes so i don't think that i will
need that high of detail so i'm going to
go to let's try the five megabytes and
i'm going to download ok so it's
finished downloading i will say download
successful and i'm just going ok ok so
now i can zoom in to view my map but i
didn't use a very high detail when i
downloaded so it's not going to show too
much detail of course so i'm going to
zoom in a little bit and once it stopped
at my no data then I know that I need to
either download more or just rely on
this specific map right here so if i
want to download more all I have to just
click here to zoom in and click download
and it will begin downloading that map
and load it so anytime I want to go to
my current position I'll have to just
click here and click back and it will
take me to my current location and we
can zoom in and we can view my current
location
so this is another marketplace pick and
the program is called X maps and the
mapping program would be very good if
you're going to travel outside the
country or if you're going to go into an
area with not the best coverage so I'm
going to go to download cell data here
from the menu and this allows you to get
cell phone location kind of like on
Google Maps how its able to locate your
device using the cell phone tower so i
can either i can download cell data from
any of these at certain areas around the
world and this program is free on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
