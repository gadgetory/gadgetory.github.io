days and it's also on iOS and it's a
wonderful app and I like it and they're
not paying us anything to say that but
we like it especially now because we are
in the running for the best of stitcher
2013 specifically best tech podcast and

at the time but maybe things have
shifted over the past few days you know
we promoted it some more hopefully got
some more votes but I'm worried just
with about like the second and third
fourth place results those were a little
more fluent so maybe something
interestings happen we'll find out next
week cool all right yeah get your votes
in for that that's gonna be really
interesting to see what our reader base
thinks about the current landscape
Taylor where you're trying to say
something there before we moved on yeah
the stitcher Awards aside if you check
out stitchers website and look at that
rankings and technology section we're
actually 35 up 15 from when this started
so thank you everyone whoa wait hold on
so what are those numbers mean I
actually didn't know this yeah we were
in the top 50 of all tech bobcat podcast
through stitcher
before this whole thing started for the
nominating Zand but all that started the
stitcher Awards before that all that
started we were like 50 and in the top
50 now we're 35 we've jumped 15 spots
since last week when I looked at it yeah
dad hey everyone really this american
life is higher rank than us that doesn't
sound right but that's that who listens

in an awful awful way you cheated get
out of here didn't get in good I'm glad
you didn't don't know saying someone
else shouldn't don't cheat contests
don't listen to Taylor Martin the bad
influence of of 2013 hey speaking of the
holidays do you guys know what I'm
wrapping up get yours Yolo review the
yola days you got closest Adam down okay
hooray for awful words that are made up
so yeah yola has viewers and listeners
will be aware yola has sent us a review
device which we've spent a little over a
day and a half with at this point we
have an unboxing and a first impressions
video up I have been the one using it in
the States here and it has been an
experience and it's so crazy and I just
wanted to point out that we are still in
the midst of our pseudo review period
we're not gonna have a traditional
review on this device because we
actually can't test it to its full
ability here in the states it's just not
built for this market so what are the
bands that it has so it's got gsm 850
900 1800 1900 and UMTS 920 100 and
that's it oh god okay that explains a
lot yeah so like actually Tony asked me
the same question this morning he was
like yeah so what's what's your problem
i can't shoot i'm like because it's he's
like isn't can't you throw a tmobile sim
in there is if that weird bands like no
it's just no bands that i can use you
assume like 80 is going to work for
everything pretty much but not if we
don't have the 1900 in there and there
was 858 1800 and
uh 9 and 9 950 yeah and 10 20 100 so
like I don't know it's um that's been
frustrating so I've had to carry around
a mobile hotspot if I want to use it in
public good that's like when I was
reviewing the Xperia Z um it was not
compatible with anything here in the
states and I was stuck home edge the
entire time of unit will you had edge I
don't even I have GPRS when I'm not when
I'm not telling to a hot spot so yeah
it's right it's kind of rough there but
you know it's okay it's not ending on
the phone by the way I mean like the
phone is not built for this market so
that's what the point is that's not why
we're not reviewing it and because we
can't effectively do it if ever I yola
is built for an area where we have a
reviewer station then we will absolutely
give it a real review what's what to I
was just saying like you using I'm on
GPA or GRPs GPRS generally a packet
radio service fun fact that's what it
stands for that comparing to edge in in
in two days he works like this in
flavors of unacceptable yeah yeah it's
like saying oh my car has triangle
wheels and the other guy complaining
that his has square wheels and you know
it's an episode of Mythbusters yeah now
but anyway that aside radio
compatibility side it has been really
interesting to work with a new platform
because we really don't get the
opportunity to carry around a phone with
a new platform all that often I got to
speak to marc dylan yeliz head of
software development the other day and
it's it's been a really weird brain
exercise I wanted to ask you guys when
was the last time you picked up a
platform that was new to you whether it
was a newly launched platform for the
world or just new to you do you remember
like what that felt like anyone can go
no yeah it's the last one I did i think
i actually used webos before android so
Android was the last new platform I used
oh I think I'm in the same boat as you
each other because I first used android
uh when I got no windows an EVO window
of course it's windows phone yeah oops
this gonna be Adams answer to cuz he
moved on to Windows Phone as his daily
driver after webos right
yeah yeah and also Android so I mean
I've yeah it's it's I've been in tech
support for so long it's pretty much my
job to be able to pick up anything and
figure out how it works so I mean I
don't really have the same learning
curve that a lot of people do whatever I
just I have to know I and I understand
and appreciate why you're saying that
but I'm gonna tell you what if I sent
you this yola I I would love to just
film you for a day as you tried to
figure it out actually I did this last
night I gave it to my friend my good
tech tech buddy Chris Larson he was
across the table from me we were having
dinner after a show and I was like here
you go man you figure it out and I took
enough photos of him and his girlfriend
and everyone else trying to figure it
out that it became a nice animated gif
that I posted a Google+ today how
gesture reliant is it navigating through
it's entirely gesture rely on Jesus
which which is you great like normally I
think if you listen back to enough of
these shows I'm the one sitting here
going like guys we need to get rid of
buttons gestures are the best things
ever and I still believe that and in a
lot of respect sailfish OS uses them
intelligently but but what about like
accessibility is it I can't speak to
accessibility I mean just from a from a
day-to-day usage standpoint from someone
of from a somewhat of normal a bit of
the typical abilities rather it's it's
very very tough for me to get used to
because it is so reliant on sideswipes
and swipe some different directions like
you know how Windows 8 does that thing
where it's like okay swipe in from the
right to do your charms bar and then
swipe up for more so I think so this is
like that except the gestures in the
first place I think are a little harder
to get used to because i don't i don't
know of any other OS that makes you
swipe in from the sides to go back to
the home screen it's usually a swipe up
so that takes some getting used to it
first but then there's swiping down on
any screen gets you to a menu that comes
down from the top but then swiping down
from the top bezel turns the screen off
double tapping turns the screen back on
and swiping up from the bottom bezel get
you to notifications which I don't think
you can dismiss by sliding them so you
have to address
every notification to clear it um so
it's like yeah it's very it's it's an OS
that that is frankly gorgeous visually
but using it from ad in a day-to-day
situation and I'm only two days end so
on monday i might feel differently here
but i'm just kind of frequently
perplexed by how to use it but having
said that are we at you I mean your job
is to use mobile devices that is that's
why we pay you oh and so yeah right and
so wondering at that good at what bugs
me about what you're saying is that you
know your two days in your your you swim
in mobile devices every day your two
days in and you're still having trouble
using it your average consumer is gonna
look at this thing and today I don't
know how to use this and they're gonna
go straight back to the store with the
receipt not for the average consumer is
not the point of this it's like the
alternative to everything else so you
guys have both brought up two great
points and marc dylan brought this up on
our call to your first point yeah the
average consumers so this is you know we
have a relationship with yola that's
that's very good and i love talking to
them in person on interviews everything
like that i can usually tell when
somebody is going to two Bs me so this
sounds like a like a like kind of a bsp
our copy story but it's not did they had
literally a grandmother you know how you
always make that example were like your
grandmother would love this phone
because it works great that's why we
have the granny score you know unscored
for me thing right oh i thought we had
that for you uh-huh
I mean no so literally a grandmother was
one of the purchasers of this initial
production run of yola phones and she
ran through the tutorials and she picked
it up in pretty much no time now as if
that's a result of her if this being her
first smartphone maybe that might be it
yeah I think you definitely do have to
throw away any conception of how a phone
works we'll kick it up like it's about
the only things it has in common with
androids iPhones and my windows phones
is that you slide things around on the
screen and that's about it like you can
tap on them so how does it how does it
compare with with blackberry 10 as far
as the gestures and everything go if you
go into it thinking that it'll be at all
similar to blackberry 10 you will have a
much harder time than if you just forget
blackberry 10 exists because well I'm i
don't i don't mean that i'm saying i had
trouble with with blackberry 10 and all
the way that all the gestures were yeah
not because of how different it was from
android or anything but just because
it's just cumbersome because there are
so many different gestures that
sometimes you wanted to do one thing and
something else would happen and it was
inconsistent he has one time you wanted
to do something and you swipe the same
weight later and something else happens
to see i don't i don't find that to be
the case much with blackberry 10 but if
you think that about blackberry 10 and
then the yellow device will probably not
be for you um one thing i see a double
on yeah come from your little your daily
experience video with it was talking
about how you have to be your very in
control of what's going on and to be
aware of what it's doing is there a lot
of contextual stuff and like the
gestures will get / based on you know
what screen you're on where you are in a
menu is that what you were getting too
yeah the OS doesn't actually like change
things on the fly like it doesn't try to
dupe you you know it's not like a mean
OS but you but you do have to remember
like i was saying before you have to
remember that tapping on some part of
the screen and pulling down is way
different from swiping in from from a
bezel and the same function like you can
close an app by swiping down from the
top bezel but if no app is open on the
screen then swiping down from the top
bezel
lock the screen and while when I say
that out loud it sounds like it makes
all the sense in the world it sounds
like of course it does i mean that's
yeah that's how things should work in
practice at least in my case and maybe
i'm fried and maybe I'm old I don't know
in my case it results in me never really
knowing how to work the phone so I can I
think I can relate that to the way that
action launcher works and I know I
always come back to this but action
launcher is actually pretty heavily
based on gestures and you can open your
app drawer and open actually widgets on
top of whatever application you're using
from swiping from the bezel oh and yeah
so if you're in the home screen swiping
anywhere so okay so if you have one home
screen swiping from right to left
whether it's from the edge of the
display or if it's just swiping right to
left opens the quick page which has art
a quick doc whatever it is has widgets
and things in it if you swipe left to
right and you don't bring like swipe
from the edge of the display so if you
swipe from the middle of this display
left to right ending a very good fiction
yeah it's kind of difficult to explain
but I think it's the same way like it
works differently in different scenarios
so if you have more than one home screen
you have to swipe from the edge of the
display to open the back door okay yeah
so it is that same thing we're like it's
very sensitive to what what specific
gesture you're making you know that I
kind of didn't make sense I just sir if
I want go ahead i wonder if maybe we're
moving towards and god I'd this would be
kind of cool actually when you really
stop and think about it wonderful movie
moving towards like a build-your-own
gesture type interface where we know
where it's like you know sure if you
want to swipe up from the bottom that'll
open up your home screen but what if you
as a user want to swipe in from the left
and open up your home screen and be
really cool to have like a whole know I
would be in figura below gestures that
you do cuz I would love to have a phone
that you can control extreme you know
one hundred percent with gestures but I
would like to have some input as to what
those gestures are actually going to be
so in that respect this this phone might
be right up your ass
because violas entire concept and
Stephen said a little bit about this
before number one yet this phone is not
for the average consumer is for someone
who wants to be luke like literally
unlike like it's for someone who doesn't
want to use one of the existing
platforms so in that respect this thing
fits the bill it's nothing like anything
I've used before except for possibly me
go but I haven't used that before so but
the end of earlier release version of a
go on the n9 by the way clarification
but so there's that and it's also for
that quote that Steven mentioned from
marc dylan where it's like this is a lot
more like using a manual transmission
car than an automatic car because you're
you do have to be involved with it but
as a result of that added work it's more
fun so then I asked Adam about your
point I was like yeah so what if you
guys are big on collaboration with the
users like this phone is built for for
the fans and you know you're encouraging
all this feedback from the community
could we at some point see a change in
gestures if enough people were like yeah
I'd like to up swipe from the bottom to
go back home screen and it's no
different than the way like hot corners
on on Mac os10 is what do you know what
are they like are those user
configurable yeah like they don't do
anything at all unless you set them up
right and when you set them up you can
set them to do whatever you want and
Yolo has a community specifically that
they've built specifically for this the
site even though it's in their press
release the site is not live it's going
to be at together yellow calm right now
you can't get to it it's got to find a
wall but that's where you're going to be
able to like offer all this feedback as
a yola user and if the company is to be
believed and I see no reason not to
believe them they're really going to
take that feedback and use it to change
the product going forward so I think
that's awesome and there's a lot of
awesome stuff about this device and you
can see it all we got to move on but you
can see it all in that video the Steven
talked about and I've got another one
coming up on Monday kind of sounds like
we crapped on it but it's it's not that
it's just that it's so different and
that's really commendable before we do
move on I have to ask you real quick
about the android app compatibility
layer
you had some issues getting things to
work well did anything actually you know
really work without issue though well I
know the answer to at least part of that
question do you yeah because I randomly
sent you a hangouts message earlier
today and you look that was so good in
that was so so cool yes Stephen thank
you for bringing this up when I finally
did manage to sync my google accounts to
the two yola it behaved as normal it
imported contacts and did all that kind
of stuff and it frequently forgets my
google login so I kind of have to
constantly relog in which is a giant
pain but when it works it to step it's
so funny is this exactly right Taylor
and the two step is actually what's
causing the hang-up but when it works
well it's surprising me in a way that
the pre surprised me in 2009 and in some
ways with synergy because hangouts is
somehow is integrated so although I have
not downloaded an app to handle it or
anything like that when I when Taylor
sent me a hangouts message earlier it
just the yola informed me and I was like
how do you know and then I went to the
notification screen and it was like yet
you want to respond i'm like yeah okay
and then I had this hangouts
conversation through the yola messaging
interface on Yoda I was like that's
really awesome I didn't expect that what
a wonderful little piece of you know
surprise and delight I've found sounds
like Windows Phone and facebook chat for
a time before Facebook broke it right ya
know exactly exactly right and like the
webos energy concept with them with
google talk or google chat owes it was
called back in the day okay so that was
really radical and then Steven answer
your question about the apps the ola
store is almost completely barren in
terms of stuff that i use and in terms
of apps in general it's very light but
the Sailfish is still in beta i should
mention as it did in the video so that's
not entirely unexpected so to fill the
gap they've got the y and x store which
is part of the Yandex search engine
monster company in Russia but that's
like a smaller subset of Android apps is
eighty-five thousand or so now so you
can download those to the device if you
sign up for a Yandex Store account which
cream side note as well I believe you
can I have not
so I mean it's got you know the Android
runtime is capable of running seven then
somebody was on a commenter was very
helpful and said hey you can download
the Android app store the amazon
appstore as well so it was like oh
really so then I downloaded that and
that's how i got my facebook app on the
phone so right now on the on yola i have
twitter facebook skype drag racing
firefox in Evernote I mean that's those
were the things I needed to put on there
right away and no Sparkle no Sparkle yet
I'm gonna draw article on there so you
needed drag racing I just needed a game
to test I really didn't need it so how
well does it work if you just
straight-up sideload map I give an APK I
do not know yet I'm gonna try that this
week i I'm sorry I haven't tried that
yet I should what now you know i I've
you can you can take this so far and I
want to go as close to enthusiasts as I
can without completely leaving average
consumer behind so average consumer is
going to want to download apps over the
air sideloading like in no world is side
loading a value add that you can
actually pitch to a regular person side
load this he's no i'm pretty much i'm
pretty sure side loading this to hipster
versions what I mean that says yeah it's
so unhip stir so anyway that that's what
I meant to say but the point is there's
there's some work left to do the apps
run okay the on-deck storage crashes
sometimes but it's in beta so it's broke
this is why we're not reviewing it is in
beta what nope road you have a limo TG
sport job Rosby OTG you got that yeah
can you plug in your frickin USB stick
to this phone if not it not buying it
did you see what I bought this week I
didn't yeah you're a little micro SD
thing yeah the little me Nova a micro SD
card reader that you put into a micro
USB port you're gonna make that one dude
who hangs out in the comments and bashes
any phone without that support so happy
yeah I know I know yeah okay can now
test it but you bro you'll broke jebra
so that's so that's yola yes your phone
for now we're still obviously developing
our final opinions I can't wait to spend
a weekend weather just to see if I get
used to it or not so thanks to yola for
sending us the demo unit and watch our
video if you have not the videos
so therefore Stephen do you want to do
want to kick us off with the Android day
a category why not very good let's do
android okay so we have this LG GX it
popped up on the radar not more than a
week or so ago and it was really really
confusing at the time because the specs
made it seem a whole lot like a phone we
already knew quite well the optimus g
pro from back what 10 months ago by now
and LG finally did announce this thing
this week sort of surprisingly it's one
of those phones i guess moved really
really quickly and now it's official and
again it sounds exactly like the g pro
so it's it's a confusing phone in that
sense the the size is the same the
processor is the same ram storage camera
it's a G pro in my kiss vog wanting to
reposition things with this G branding
rather than the optimist branding it had
coming up here the g2 but yeah that's
the site it was too easy to say and all
right miss G pro right now they're like
oh TGS 6l chicks yeah that's what we're
gonna call it right the end of course
you know once the g3 comes out we're
gonna want to say like G acts to refer
to the entire family can't do that now
can't do that now yeah too easy but this
one like I saw the story and I was
excited because GX sounds like a pretty
cool name like it's like a sweet and
then I show up at the story I'm like oh
there's no curved screen oh there's no
back buttons oh it seems the g pro which
was Taylor you reviewed that right i did
and i had a three-foot antenna in it
yeah flex that's what makes it unique
enough states gonna battery the size of
an aircraft carrier geez what was with
the red optimus g pro didn't do their
3140 milliamp hours ain't nothing like
3500 get out of here all right with the
optimus g pro that was one of us i think
i was stuck on either 3g or edge with
that one as well because that's what
happens when you get all these korean
devices so you know they're not built
for america so you could stuck with this
device that you can only use in certain
ways right but Obama
yeah that's never gonna get old I don't
know why this would exist except for to
make me upset over the name yeah the LG
GX I'm upset I'm upset by this so let's
move on I don't want talk about anymore
what's the next second what's there's a
week of overseas phones I'm really like
yeah well this one is interesting
because of well um it's said what's the
Xperia z1 there's a new version of it
that just got confirmed for China back
on its own is not interesting at all the
interesting part is what this means
about the what we've been calling the
z1s and we've been following this guy
around for weeks now and at first it
seemed very clear this is going to be
the international version of the z1 app
which is just a smaller version of the
z1 but unlike so many small clothes we
see it has all of the great hardware of
the full-sized version reason them
fitting excited right there I think it's
just plural FCC is going to plural Z 1
like this these are Z ones they are good
but we saw these pictures we couldn't
make sense of a phone that looked a lot
like the z1 but with some slightly moved
around parts the headphone jack infinite
replace the front facing camera shifted
around this at least confirms what we
were seeing it's just another version of
the z1 for China but it leaves a
question remaining how is this mini z1
actually going to kind of
internationally in the u.s. probably
shouldn't care about it that much since
Sony's made it clear that it doesn't
really care about getting phones on
carriers here anytime in the near future
but you guys in Europe you might want to
keep an eye out for what actually comes
of this it's just a lyric service
advisory it's all we're doing here it's
up so that was a little soft intro
that's just to just to get you ready get
your little relaxed get you get you
excited for or maybe worried about this
next thing we're gonna talk about I find
this headline the most believable thing
I've read in months I believe all of
those three
already in a little bit refuted has it
really it has see this is why I'm not a
newsman tell us what the headline says
yeah well the ongoing saga of the galaxy
s5 brought us to a finding where someone
thought that we might get a 2k display
for the sky and I know there's been a
lot of comments readers about hating
this 2k term how it's it means the same
thing as 1080p pretty much does 1920
pixels that's almost 2k just deal with
it guys this is what we're calling the
2560 x 1440 displayed for now maybe
it'll change it probably won't but just
it's a 2k soon we're talking about the
galaxy s5 might get this 2k screen like
we're seeing on a bunch of phones out of
China right now and it could also get an
iris scanner of all things lord I don't
know guys till we'd of it we talked
about this on the pocket i alive this
morning anyway yeah we did we had some
good ginseng around you didn't get that
email I have to forward that to write
the second actually I'm going to ok
right now so while you do that I'll say
we had some listeners or viewers asking
some questions about their our thoughts
on an iris scanner and it's like I mean
this seems this if there was a company
out there that was going to try and do
this on a phone oh it would be Samsung
does anybody disagree Apple doing it too
yeah but that's this seems I mean that's
scary this is something I hold watches
other companies too but Apple where you
go Michael's stupid thinking this is
such a fundamentally bad idea that it's
never going to happen you need really
really good optics crazy because you can
eat a good lens and there's not just
room for a good lens in there and it's
not even just that you might mine yes
yes I mean the reason a lot of these
things fail the ice cruel didn't work in
the dark for a reason and this isn't
going to change anything here wow this
is cool there's gonna be people in movie
theaters trying to unlock their phones
and like screaming at damaged Oh like
it's just it makes me think back to face
unlock like it was a really cool feature
for like a week since no it was cool for
a week show up like an hey I'm like my
phone by just holding it up to my face
and
and uh you know after like a week or so
after you forgot to shave a couple times
and and your face slightly changed
because your hair was longer and
different things it's like I don't I
don't recognize you and you're not going
to get into your fault and then but when
it got improved later and then that
stuff was fixed like it was too late
because the buzz was already blown
everyone had already been like gimmick
that half works all the time but and
whatever and this is my hearing else
doesn't anybody else remember the
product demo I don't remember who was i
thank euless Samsung where they actually
tried to show off face unlock during a
product demo and it didn't work yeah is
it was a that watch while I hold of
something my face and it does nothing
that was google and samsung what they
were releasing the Galaxy Nexus that's
exactly what it was I was watching that
live yeah okay I was watching the 10 I'm
like I still remember that from the
whole face lock thing I'm just like
great it doesn't work you're fired okay
well not it works for me for several
weeks and I kind of liked it for a while
but I talked about this on the wife this
morning the reason that it doesn't work
so well is because you have to change
how you get into your phone normally
you're looking down at your phone zactly
and it's it's like chest level or waist
level depending on what you're doing can
ever ever hold your phone straight up
and out of your face sorry so to unlock
your phone you've got to hold it up
straight in front of your face and it
just looks awkward it's awkward it's
uncomfortable it sucks yeah exactly
that's what I was just gonna say like it
should know it should be able to learn
what you look like from like waist
height and like that's how you unlock
your phone like take the average between
waist height chest height and boom there
you go but there's a huge contingent out
there of you know non-serious smartphone
users who use their phone mainly to
check out their hair looks with the
front-facing camera like you guys are
crazy I always pointed at my face when I
use my phone well yeah I mean that's
true but so it let's not get off the I
lock though because we got an
interesting email apparently at CES this
year is going to be a this isn't like an
da or and if i write that they're just
there on the list right far as i know
it's not in da
alright well I'm not gonna set another
covered with that there will be an
exhibitor at least one exhibitor at CES
demoing technology like this and and i
think i'm gonna go to that booth i think
i am telling them and go with you and
bring make a video we have we have a
friend of the booth who didn't get the
memo that i should be copied on emails
yeah well you forget these things i know
but like you know I'm she i also had
dinner with it anyway it doesn't matter
let's i'm jealous of your BFF itude can
you tell um what some things people
don't have to try for maybe shud i am
maybe shut up and go go go away so this
all is coming this get a room you two
let's move on to this to the meat of
this story so the samsung galaxy s5
could feature a 2k display alongside an
iris scanner but Steven tell us why we
shouldn't believe one or both of these
things well then yesterday there was
this benchmark result going around one
of the many model numbers that we've
been fielding as a candidate for the
galaxy s5 and according to this antutu
result it only had a 1080p screen now I
should be clear that the translations
came from the Chinese and 22 site
mention something about how this might
be locked to only function as a 1080p
display despite having the capability
for a2k you know as to make it easier
during development I don't know why they
would do that but maybe maybe not it's
far from a certainty I guess is what
we're getting too yeah and I don't know
guys I'm going to say something that's
imminently predictable the iris scanner
even though it probably won't work well
i think that is still the more exciting
news here 2k every time I see 2k bat it
around whether it be comments articles
whatever now Steven you may disagree
with me because you wrote an editorial
that's to the opposite thruster I just
think that I I think you're all being
manipulated not you guys but everyone in
the world I mean the industry is
manipulating you to care about this and
I cannot fathom a world in which human
eyeballs will be able to determine that
a 2k screen is so far superior to a
1080p display that you would prefer the
two case I don't see you can see it bro
don't see it but as a great bro
get out of your tea bro but I put some
more coffee in your mouth what I was
trying to get out with the point of that
editorial is that while if there aren't
the as you know jaw-dropping differences
between 1080p and 2k as you get with
like wvga versus even 720p um your eyes
still can pick up on some of the
differences especially with situations
that push the limits of the display like
if you have a line that's very nearly
vertical but not quite if you're gonna
get the aliasing the stepping among the
eggs they're right even with a high res
screen like 1080p you can still see the
art of acting there and 2k I mean it's
not going to make the phone using
experience a whole lot better but your
eyes just going to pick up on things
looking more natural and looking at me
you're right it's definitely going to be
a more marketing push than anything but
I do think there are some actual
benefits to it and the trade-offs aren't
as bad as a lot of the naysayers might
believe well my problem with it is okay
so you have this very very very marginal
bump in what the display is going to
look like because if we take 1080p now
if we take a 1080 p SL dc-3 slc on Syria
yeah we get 3 display which is I guess
regarded by most as probably the
best-looking smartphone display right
now the one on the HTC one yeah a great
display is phenomenal yeah why would you
want to in marginally improve that when
you're gonna have to have more power to
push more pixels it's just that it's not
that much more power though but I I mean
what doesn't it have to be like if the
pixel density is that high doesn't the
backlight have to be brighter in the
case of an LCD yeah you have but we're
not talking with the power to switch the
pixels isn't going to change that much
because we're dealing with smaller cells
at the same time you're dealing with a
lot of different things that could
affect it negatively the point I'm just
trying to make is you're looking at a
tiny tiny tiny bump in how good it's
gonna look if if it's even visible
if you can even tell and it's all really
for marketing that's really all it's for
I would rather them improve 1080p which
is I think going to be kind of like the
terminal resolution if you will for
smartphones unless unless the five years
down the road no smartphone is smaller
than six inches but I would cry then but
the point I'm trying to make is is even
the slc d3 display has problems samsung
Super AMOLED display at 1080p has
problems they're not perfecting this
display technology they're just bumping
resolution and bumping resolution and
dealing with problems like the SOC d3
the blacks on that they're not pitch
black in it might be a limitation of LCD
for for blacks vs amulet because i'ma
let if it's black the pixels aren't on
yeah but yeah but even I mean once we
get some problems once we start talking
about problems out of this granular you
can then qualify anything as a problem
AMOLED screens are not totally black
when they are off because the glass
layer on top of the screen transmits
some of the glass as some of the light
from the lit components oh right so
exactly so at what point do we say
enough you know at what point do we stop
saying like you know what when it's
great nicked Michael yeah we wouldn't
win Eddie Murphy in the fat suit punched
the camera in that horrible movie he
didn't actually hit me in the face so
this screen sucks like no that's not you
need to get to a point where it's like
this screen is good enough now let's
move on and anyway right I want to just
saying 2k is useless on a phone that's
what I needed this that's my opinion
what are the family so let me let me ask
it this I want to kind of move this in a
new direction before we go on we don't
do this very often but there's a piece
of listener mail that fits this
perfectly and asks an awesome question
so we're going to do listener mail at
the end of the show but this one right
now is from phillip humber ooh who is
from Kenya nairobi kenya and he says yes
you do have fans in Africa thank you
Phillip before I ask my question let me
just say you guys are the best hands
down I appreciate the podcast and the
effort thank you sir thank you for
listening but I personally think we're
pretty good for hands you know i love
that your internet connection
slight decided to troll your so hard
because I've no idea what you just said
we're pretty good at Tesla coil awesome
n-not at Tesla coil don't even start
with that somebody in your house just
started downloading a film my cell phone
spreading now Adam hold on i'll let you
say that in the second of its limited
phillips email you're a larger number of
pixels i was thinking he says the higher
the screen resolution the higher the
pixel density right a larger number of
pixels means more power usage which in
turn there's a better life whatever
we've talked about that already on the
show but it depends on the size of the
screen philip asks do you think that
there will be a time whereby we will
have the option to reduce the resolution
on our device screen and save on a
charge i'm saying this because we're
being teased with 2k possibly 4k screens
i see this is overkill because the HTC
one is gorgeous at 1080p will we be able
to revert to 1080p on these future
devices and reduce the battery
consumption sorry for long email keep up
the good work oh yeah i'm voting on
stitcher daily you don't deserve a win
cheers phil still thank you oh thank you
thank you for the question the question
is I understand the query chat point
where users can define their own
resolution based on situation like can I
scale down the resolution on my display
if I would rather have three percent
more battery power than killer is that
talking about my limit XD scaled up to
2k or running in a 1080p window in the
middle of the 2k I think running on a I
think he's talking about scaling I mean
I wouldn't change any of these yeah you
can't change the resolution that
resolution is a hardware feature so so
anything you do after the phone is
already built is just going to be a
software thing it's going to be
upscaling downscaling you can shut off
every other pixel and you could have
like a really weird looking like 80's
dealer yeah 3 inches of bezel around you
but I do understand what he's asking and
and it's not exactly what he's asking
but there's an answer to something
similar good said I would I was uh yeah
I was I had the same question about
jumping to 1080p like why would we jump
to 1080p when 720p it looks great and
1080p is going to do nothing but burn
more battery and it's not necessarily
true the technology that they're using
in the newer 1080p panels is actually
more power efficient than than some of
the order of 720p panels yes you have
more pixels to push your processors are
working harder your GPUs are working
harder everything's working a little
harder but the the panel itself is
actually more power efficient so mmm it
really depends I can't remember where i
found that it was one of those super
technical sites like a non-tech or or
something to that degree but yeah it's
something where an in an engineer had
really broken it down to a very finite
answer and oh yeah it's just like a lion
club type story I wonder yeah I don't
think it was Brian but it may have been
I don't know but I read it and they were
talking cuz that I wrote an editorial
and basically this this article that
this person wrote completely debunked my
editorial made me feel like an idiot
that doesn't happen very often and I
love very humbled yeah I was a very calm
evidence cuz I'm like oh my god brain
gift yeah but I was I was happy to be
wrong so there there may be something
with 2k and 4k but the the problem that
that really happens there is what
Michael was talking about you have to
have a brighter backlight to make it
through a much higher resolution display
because the pixels are smaller mm-hmm
and they're tighter together and there's
very very little space for a backlight
to sikh guru so i don't know i can't say
whether 2k or 4k displays are going to
be more power efficient but I I would
stretch to say that 1080p is kind of
that sweet spot for a phone yeah I think
I think we're probably the same page you
and me there but we're talking a lot
about hypotheticals stuff here with 2k
displays not a lot of them exist in the
world as a matter of fact I don't even
know if there is a phone out there in
the world with a2k screen Steven can you
shed any light on this I think I just
might be able to whoa yeah so the last
month or so they've been talked out of
China for I think two or three companies
that have been either been teasing this
or been hearing rumors that they're
finally going to introduce a smartphone
with a 2k display oppo is one
of them but VEVO has beaten everyone to
the punch and launched its xPlay 3s whit
sure enough has a 2560 x 1440 display i
disguise a six incher and I think that's
interesting because Chalmers is talking
about how he loves the HTC one's display
and I was curious exactly what this
means pixel density wise on a screen
this big yeah and in fact of the matter
is 2k on a six inch screen is just about
it's a little higher but it's within the
same range as the pixel density you get
an HTC One it's 490 ppi versus 470 or so
ppl yeah that's which they involve our
man that's definitely the same ballpark
especially considering it's arguable
whether any human can tell but we
already had that conversation everything
else seems really great about this phone
tube has got a decent size batteries
Snapdragon 800 another three gig ram
phone I mean the software who knows but
right hardware wise it's got everything
isn't it amazing how like this changes
at least for me this changes the whole
mindset about this thing suddenly it
doesn't seem that absurd because if
you're just doing this if you're using a
2k resolution or thereabouts-- to get me
a 409 dppi resolute pixel density on a
six inch screen well then I'm like yeah
of course you would do that why wouldn't
you because as you say we're big fans of
the HTC one screen that's 469 and this
should be in the same neighborhood and
if they did Steven did you do the math
and find out what what it would have
been at 1080p on this guy I did not
pixel density calculate her someone talk
while I do this math are you looking at
six inches at 1080p yeah that's correct
okay I'll do it really quickly diagonal
screen size in inches what is it 19 it's
367 wow you are very fast you guess I am
360 said yeah so 367 vs 4 90 at that
point even then it's an arguable case
even that I think a lot of people
wouldn't i wouldn't go children but i
would i would love this that's a point
percent reduction so that's a pretty big
number yeah at that point it's it's the
difference between 720p and 1080p
on a 5 inch foam and that is a
difference we made fun of before but
which we ultimately decided oh wait no
it does look better yeah maybe and I
have no qualms yeah I have no qualms
with 2k on a 6-inch phone but under that
six-inch threshold I think it's 1080p
really is more than enough these guys
are going to soak up the press these
VEVO folks because this how old is this
post 1218 is like a two-day old posts
come over 100 comments yeah that phone
has everything so so it's something I've
been saying a long time is that HTC they
make these killer phones and then they
skimp on one aspect or Samsung does the
same thing where they make this killer
device and there's like you know it's
got three gigs of ram and all these
other stuff an end next on camera yeah
like what are you doing and this this is
the first one I've seen that's just
everything so 2k three gigs of ram
Snapdragon 800 32 gigs of internal
storage choice vivo I've never seen her
device from vivo before I think the only
thing that this does not have at least
as far as the specs they released is a
optical image stabilization in the
camera it's a good it's a good to good
answer my question thank you feeldoe
telecommunications company from and the
answer you were looking it up or from
typed brazil it looks like a major
virgin mobile phone company ways to get
a phone from yeah portuguese for alive
is the name of his vivos translation hmm
and it's a subsidiary actually of
something else huh headquartered in Sao
Paulo Brazil looks like they have a
rocket ship in the front yard which is
pretty cool yeah nice oh it's a tower
but it looks like a rocket ship anyway
so I guess I absolutely maybe is vivo
gonna be good nice is people gonna be at
CES I love this is like a discovery
session for us yeah we should check that
out you know why you while you check
that out I found a really kind of funny
headline from The Associated Press where
France France it's not sexting it's
texto pornography I like that better
texaco pornography that's one word by
the way it's a very German way to
combine words like this it is
that it's run word it's txt opor in OTR
aph IE yeah text okay last section
better well we are at the we're coming
up on a 50 minute mark we're still deep
in android territory we'll see if we can
get a look at that 2k smartphone maybe
for once Jaime Rivera will be able to
secure a review unit that he doesn't
have to ship three times to get to him I
know we are running slow but while we
were talking about ces and companies
were not very familiar with showing up
there yeah I wanted to mention quick my
zoo is making a u.s. bush and will be
coming to us yes / I think the first
time I just added mizzou to our to our
list of would be nice two visits nice
mm-hmm we have a lot to visit in those
three days we have so much we owe my god
is going to be nothing like Aoife where
we had almost no appointments and we
were just wandering like this is crazy
so let's move on to my favorite piece of
news all month except it's only halfway
awesome I kinda know let down I know I
know it this is about the Moto X I'm
going to announce it this is about the
Moto X and I want to announce the the
wooden option is finally available I
well-phrased Steven by the way cool
image that was a joke initially it was
like moto got would but I couldn't rein
yourself that's that oh man you could
have to boil add publish button sounds
like AG is headline though it does it
does the other thing is so we only got
the bamboo option and I don't think is
bamboo even technically would it sure it
is is it sure it is here's my problem
with the bamboo so with the evony you
live in a bubble yeah yeah the ebony
that Michael is like just really targets
were channeling over yes has a back the
back trim is black so on the normal Moto
X the trim on the side is one piece on
the wooden moto X's the trim is divided
in two halves so on this one the back
half of the trim is white on the bamboo
on the ebony it's black and you can't
change that and get a bamboo phone it
has white trim on the back so if you
want a black front
you have a black front trim a white bag
trim bamboo in the back and then a black
front then you have an accent color too
oh and I like it's just no although it
so that that sucks but at the same time
the bamboo needed to be paired with the
white you could not have paired this
wood color with black and head it look
good that's what ebony is that what's
the lighting was no exact what I would
call that phone I would call out the
storm trooper on Endor so yeah that is
true and you compare it with black for
some contrast now it would look you're a
cretin only a very Philistine beauty on
American get that it is three colors on
the bag won't be home I'm not lying blue
and bamboo black blue and bamboo no
white blue and bamboo that's why they
photographed this the way they did I
would do it the other way I'm out you
know I wonder if you could see danger
someone else likes gay in the road now
it's just an option standard moto maker
that's not official dude that's what I
want to do I want to get a moto x strip
the protective film off the wood and
varnish at a different dealer I want to
be a weekend xray that would be fun
Taylor do it for mod 0 dy dollars today
on today's video and today's baccano
video we're belt sanding a moto x sounds
good to me yeah I think this is to a DIY
pack were you you pick your own color
and varnish it that would be so cool
that would be like the awesome hobbyist
phone ever let's propose that to Yoda
and we be coming together yellow calm
yeah I'm willing to sell this idea
decided let's get him on the air uh what
I was about to look at something else
and I can trim it so we have no word on
the on the ebony availability right no
they haven't says and and you know what
makes me supremely upset so I bought one
with the $150 off option mm-hmm I can't
exchange mine for bamboo or even if
evony were available the hundred and
fifty dollar promotion is not eligible
like these are not eligible for that
promotion alright so we've seen them say
they can't deliver these on time we've
seen them say they're more expensive
than you thought they were going to be
even though you knew they were going to
be more expensive and now we see them
said you can't exchange them I'm telling
you they can't make these in volume like
these half these are a very limited run
because they don't foresee crazy demand
I think mmm it's true and and that makes
me sad because i'd be willing to pay you
know hundred dollars more because i
still get 150 off so i would still be
you know if you dollars cheaper than the
normal Moto X if you have a dollar so
what are you gonna do I mean you can't
almost anywhere wouldn't you know it sir
what's a hundred fifty dollar promotion
has returned today and the bamboo option
is explicitly excluded from it yep Tanya
you know the thing is they don't want to
level like 40 million forests to make a
bunch of wooden smartphones like bamboo
grows like weeds it's hard to get it to
stop growing around here that's a good
yoga we'd see give me your new weed
phone um let's hold different like a
layer yeah take my band please I would
love to talk about the Moto X for the
rest of the show but we have to move on
them and that sad part of really quickly
Moto X what is it I have to send mine
back that is very sad yeah the button on
the side of mine is it's almost flush
with the side yeah the volume button is
almost flush and I can barely press it
would you say that ain't right today
right well there's your problem like I
got 150 off we're gonna give them a
jacked up volume rocker and it sags and
not process that one and no no doubt no
doubt I really want a reason to return
my nexus 5 so I can get one of the ones
with the firmer buttons and the tiny
little Center all changes yeah yeah the
buttons on the moto or the Nexus 5 you
can hear them rattled yes what about
that well yeah I kind of mine yeah what
about what about what about like if I
were shopping for samsung stuff in like
the real world what if a little bit if I
have where would their buttons be like
it would it be like an apple store we
have to move on Michael yeah we do eral
segue michael is the embodiment of the
oscar music that swells when is it true
i did you get a sound to you on the show
to like to put that in when we need to
play them off yeah let's go what's the
story here's James like click bait for
commenters everybody loves apple stores
they're fun to go to their laid out
nicely you see all them nice hardware
there take your stuff in kathak geniuses
work on it it's a nice retail experience
and apparently samsung is looking to get
itself a slice of the same action
and it hired one of the guys who was
instrumental in designing the apple
store as we know today and so Samsung it
already has some retail locations um the
ones I'm familiar with it usually within
other stores I'm not used to seeing
standalone samsung retail locations but
apparently that's the intention and it's
going to start bringing is straight-up
samsung stores two locations across the
United States sometime I guess starting
next year hopefully hmm okay your honor
you can clearly see here the shape of
this Samsung store is exactly the same
this is our table 18 inches in height
their tables are 24 inches in height one
of them is bamboo the other is mahogany
I don't understand the similarity yeah
well the corners the radius of the
corners they're all the same now these
flat screen displays are very similar to
the CRTs used in this store that doesn't
exist I got lawyers just started
salivating for this news at the beach k
service get out of my court your honor
they're using iPads to display the
information for their products rather
this by the way I was I there was a
horrible joke i just made but now i want
to open a store with like in that it
specifically says no to flat screen TVs
I just want CRT's in all of my sty will
sell you some of mine happy to me
awesome what were you gonna say saying I
think we're gonna say something uh I
mean just makes a lot of sense for
samsung how much I think we shouldn't I
get harp too much on this it's gonna be
like Apple but just making its own
retail location it fits with Samsung
they have Achebe's they have home a book
do they have like stoves and things like
LG has not stopping visually washing
machines yeah yeah yeah they've home
appliances I think it makes my samsung
samsung could have a retail location
like this we was gonna buy a samsung
microwave in college because i was not a
sprint fighting have my microwave from
college it's a samsung it's the best
microwaving awards were like heavily
marketed at at us when we were in
college because they were like hey they
got some colors on them and they're like
fancy and new looking hey we need a
microwave and it looks like one of those
old Macs
so you should buy this it's totally not
a computer and because I remember some
had like some strange like spherical
windows on them that world that they did
look like the candy colored imax though
it was awesome no but you're right
Stephen there's no reason Samsung
shouldn't open retail sorry and you know
we started to see this at trade shows
where they like in the city that hosted
the trade show if you went to the mall
nearby like Samsung would have three
standalone booths just kind of kicking
it be like hey you want to see the new
Galaxy Note really all right I'm going
to get some hairspray but all right and
it sounds like fun like so it makes
sense that they would parlay this that
expertise and they were very well run
into retail presence because they sell a
wide range of stuff so it's just going
to be you know the microsoft store had
to endure being called the colorful
apple store so the samsung is going to
get the same crap but it'll be
interesting to see if they decorate them
differently if you value your your
intelligence and your brain cells do not
scroll down to the don't comments I made
the mistake of Samsung Sam crap equals
douche bag like
people no one no one in check is good at
those types of jokes like the the types
of jokes that that like X bone is the
best one I've heard in a long time but
that's not even like a derisive comment
it's just like this is funny like
phandroid I sheep or any of the other
real long shots and rams yeah like it
that's not even doesn't even shut up
sorry way oh my god I'm dumber yeah no I
didn't want to scroll down there and
then I did and now I'm we're all Dumber
for having her let's close it out with
with some of additional Samsung news
before we happen to Windows Phone uh yes
so we've been hearing a lot about
Samsung tablets over the last few weeks
and it's been kind of disparate rumors
looking at one or the other and then
just today someone thinks they figured
out how a lot of these guys are going to
start arriving and we're already talking
about the idea of a tab 3 light which to
me didn't make much sense because the
tab 3 7 inches would replace is already
pretty crappy to begin with but anyway
it seems like it's happening so in
addition to the light we're also going
to start seeing if this rumor is
accurate a pro series of Samsung tablets
and it looks like Samsung might be
dropping the yearly numbering like has
become so vogue now with apple and the
nexus 7 so we're just going to see the
galaxy tab pro coming out next year
eight point four inches was mentioned a
10.1 and this plus size 12 point 2 inch
Galaxy Note that we've seen a lot of
signs of it had FCC clearance and
everything that could be the note pro
12.2 so don't look forward there might
just be pro and lite versions of
everything yeah so we're not gonna hear
Samsung we're not going to hear samsung
galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition my god
allah in the wind willing now oh my gosh
when i was reviewing that like ass oh my
gosh but I that that 12.2 looks like a
43 aspect ratio really yeah that's a
mean it's beside the note 10.1 oh I
would not put much faith in this render
here i am not sure the provenance of is
but we saw the there's an FCC filing for
the note pro 12.2 it's clearly
white screen integration let me cool i
think that it does these brand names do
need cleaning up so i think this is good
news i don't know this is way to do with
them well is probably no but the same
time you know hey I'm down with
simplicity when it comes to this so I
think everyone's tired of overdone brand
names what they're there's nothing
simple about this galaxy tab 3 light
galaxy tab 3 pro galaxy tab pro 8.4 like
no you're I mean it's not perfect but
it's better than galaxy tab 3 7 and your
galaxy tab 3 7 and 7 point 0 Galaxy Tab
3 10 2014 edition yeah Rev 2014 yeah any
simpler remembered samsung galaxy s4
epic 4g touch HTC evo 4g LTE right yes
yeah because we need you with the LT in
the name my god but the point I'm trying
a cuttable 4G LTE to what guys you're
gonna have a their current lineup which
is way too many tablets to begin with
and then they're going to have a light
in the pro version for all of those
another guess it won't every single so I
mean it would be awesome we have a new
tablet student to review within the next
week uh I might die yeah well that's
that's that's the kind of the state of
Android right it's it's a giant
ecosystem full of devices that are
raining on us all the time it kind of
doesn't matter what they're going to be
called we're going to review them in
either love or hate them we reviewed all
of them in like we could review all the
pros in one review that sounds awful
sounds like a horrible thing I would
never want it's put a reviews this is
what's wrong with this stuff now here's
the galaxy tab pro in all sizes but
fortunately there are eco systems out
there that are just as exciting but do
business much differently and with that
let's move into Windows Phone Adam doubt
can come back Oh Adam wake up well let's
elbow Adam doubt awake I'm just waiting
for the noise isn't there supposed to be
a noise now yeah that happens thanks to
the magic of post-production Adam okay
wait next thing you're gonna tell me
that the TV shows don't always have live
studio audiences oh I gotta go now yeah
I've poking holes in your view of the
world you want to tell us what the first
news story is Adam the Lumia 929 launch
date is rumored and that there's
actually a couple of different stories
here about the 929 and the icon and the
icon name and all that fun stuff so this
is the first time I've taken a look at
this image of the 929 which looks a lot
like a in this one looks a lot like a
droid DNA just because of how big it is
would you make sure you're looking at
here I'm sorry for the Lumia icon story
the 929 launch date rumored got it let's
look at DNA yeah because of the curved
display edges and maybe just the angle
to shut it but this thing looks really
pretty from this angle actually from
yeah besides that Verizon logo it wasn't
a comedian I was a region of the other
the other end ur fone arena for the icon
could be getting even longer and it's
weird because it's a black phone on a
black background so it just looks all
skewed and weird and I'm just like that
can't possibly be right and and then I
look at the the other picture that you
guys are looking at and okay sure enough
it actually does look normal but you'll
see what I mean if you click over to the
icon could be getting even longer for
sure the interesting thing about this
possibly dropping numbers from the name
I would like to see Microsoft get away
from the numbers I I lost interest in
the numbers a long time ago myself the
you know 9 29 28 922 920 and a half yeah
I just yeah I would like I would like
rather seen names I'd like to see maybe
like themed names you know I dis metals
really you like the nitrous even I think
the number idea was a great concept I
don't think Nokia implemented very well
because there wasn't obvious reasoning
to how the numbers work like we
understood you happy 800 then 20 more
means upgrading from windows 7 to
Windows Phone 8 but then we start
getting like well what how many numbers
the ad for a dual sim that variant or
you know I think at the 929 why
is that an odd number it's it didn't
make sense was the problem so listen I
Stephen my mother I was going to make a
counter argument just to your point I
think that the numbers do make a degree
of sense all in the state's all of the
phones ending in one hour t mobile
phones all the film's ending an eight or
verizon wireless phones like there's
carrier coding that that makes a degree
of sense there and you know the phones
generally get higher in quality as you
go further up the line numerically so
500 600 700 you know and so on that's
true but I wouldn't like to see I would
like to get rid of all the carrier
variance to begin with I don't see horse
I still don't see why t-mobile has to
have a different phone than AT&amp;amp;T does I
just I'd good BB well it's trying to
figure out what they do after the next
generation so after you know the next
generation of the 1020 that one's kind
of clear they're gonna just keep going
up but 920 what's the next generation
after the 929 29 all these little then
where did they get the money all right
no yeah because they can't make it the
1020 so I see your point yeah they press
the mold do something crazy like 19 20
and I things get really weird cuz the
yellow because I wouldn't I wouldn't be
surprised to see the next generation 10
20 be the twenty20 if if Microsoft
retains the same in convention but I
wouldn't like that is it which would
actually be a really good name special
edition Barbara Walters phone like it's
just I like Barry ran into the same
exact problem because they started in
like the low thousands and then they
went up all the way to the 9900 and then
like cry or didn't have a phone code
name to 10,000 like they say hi to judge
to blackberry 10 because they weren't
have numbers yeah they overran the looks
good so awesome too because they were
gonna meet the ex and I was like oh the
bbx sounds awesome but then they
couldn't do that but yet got to an
absurd point where I was looking at a
blackberry product called like the 9950
and like cuz you you don't have any room
left yeah so I actually wrote an
editorial about that way back in the day
like what are they gonna do they just
start over at wonder illicit doors and
go home yeah one test answered while the
switching with the Nokia numbers to
possibly going with words is
interesting on its own what about the
whole Nokia and Lumia part of the
equation are we going to see Microsoft
keep either of those well it's a good
question because some people are
speculating that the whole icon thing
because it's basically nokia spelled
backwards if you do it in a fun way is
all i'm gonna be in command yeah so it's
like AI KO n is was no no no no no thank
you yeah I don't know I personally I
think that's one of the great tragedies
of this acquisition to be honest today
is that the Windows Phone didn't need
any help becoming more obscure I know
it's been improving of late a lot more
people have been buying them these days
thanks to a variety of factors but it's
still a real struggle for that platform
to get any kind of purchase in some
markets so and removing a name as
vaunted as Nokia from the phones or
nokia if you prefer is just really not
going to help out at all and Lumia so i
hope the lumia less weight is no they
were able to retain that weren't able to
retain the lumia brand is now getting
lumia and asha brent was so microsoft is
yeah yeah but but nokia is its cuz like
yeah I have had people be like oh is
that that knew that that Lumia thing so
yeah that brand name is dependent rating
to a degree but it's nowhere near
everybody knows what a hell ok iphone is
right it's gonna be so gonna exist in
Star Trek time according to JJ Abrams
like with my 1020 most people didn't ask
me if it was a Lumia they asked if that
was the 41-megapixel phone yeah is that
a new phone with the crazy camera I get
that a lot and I like that so it Lumia
doesn't have a lot of weight not
especially not to agree something like
galaxy does so yeah yeah so did it's not
that important it's not that established
I think Microsoft might be better off by
just tossing it to the wayside and doing
their own thing you know but then again
I mean then I would agree with you if it
was another company but I just I don't
see Microsoft coming up with it with a
very compelling we're gonna call this
our surface foam at the right and rather
side to these rumors with the timing of
it because we've also been hearing about
it was a phone i think the many penny
Moneypenny and it got some rumored
numbers 6 20 x 1 ashore
it's in the 600 range but if we're
hearing about those and we're also
hearing about 929 going icon this was
presumably the 929 would come out first
so is that not actually going to be
called icon is this stuff about many
penny wrong we it's not clear yeah I
don't know I want to talk a little bit
about the tablets and we're gonna kind
of come into iOS here in a second but
first I want to I want to make mention
of the fact that our own Taylor Martin
has a has an obligation to attend to and
he's gonna have to leave early is that
sad everyone i said i'm crying myself a
little i'm gonna find out that they're
not bumped out i don't have to insult
you anymore wait you don't have
shattered pieces of my life and move on
it's all right Sam I gotta go finish
this G flex review before midnight
review rebuttal thank you view rebuttal
a little go ahead Stephen say it I have
no idea what you're talking about your
ebuddy that's great well listen but
before you go I think it'll be time for
us to answer one listener mail question
if you don't mind because I think Taylor
you have some interesting insight into
this and we're just going to sprinkle
these throughout the podcast I guess
because I wanted you to address this
this is from Thomas huffmaster we've
said this on the pocket I live but that
is the best name for a human every first
of all great job of the podcast as
always I've been listener since the
begin of the weekly we remember you
Thomas thanks for sticking around this
whole time concerning google wallet do
any of you know if you can tie a bank
account to your google wallet rather
than funding it with a debit or credit
card I've been thinking if they were
possible I could do away with my current
debit card and use the google wallet on
my phone along with a google wallet card
funded by the same bank account what are
your thoughts on that concept and do you
think it would motivate more people to
use google wallet best regards thomas
health master Terrence lab you're not on
this podcast Taylor Martin what do you
think about that you absolutely can I
want to double check that but uh that's
I think how I have mine set up right now
is I don't have a credit card on it
actually have my bank account you can go
through and set up different bank
accounts but are not bank accounts but
different payment methods or
yeah that's what they call them payment
methods but your wallet bount balance is
basically tied to a bank so oh god yeah
that's how it works and the way that I
think the best the best way to say that
the google wallet card works is you know
use google wallet and if you don't have
data or something goes wrong you've got
your wallet in the wallet card but i
think the best the best except it I
guess use for it that I've heard is
leave it in your car um like like just
leaving your dash and if you tell me
where you parked yes no but if you
forget your wallet at home you've got
your google wallet card mmm so yeah it
mean it's really cool it's a good way to
budget I think do you think it will
donate more people to use Google Wallet
do you think this is going to be like a
part of the pitch I think it's still the
very niche thing like I don't think a
lot of people are gonna get a google
wallet card um yeah I've got one I got
one like it's me immediately it was like
sign up and I got it like two days later
but uh I haven't used it not once he has
not used mine I activated it and then
it's SAT there like I already have a
bank account and I've for bank accounts
like why do I need a google wallet card
mmhmm yeah Adam actually did try to add
something substantive there but his
connection cut him off which was very
fast God rolling you yeah i just added a
second second dial up phone yeah oh
thank you for being a good sport adam i
want to ask you to chime in but we do on
release Taylor here so um Taylor get out
I'm kidding teller thank you for joining
us as always if it's been a lovely time
and I hope your review rebuttal goes
smoothly yeah you might hate me after it
but it's okay that's alright man we
gotta disagree sometimes now you won't
hate me I give you a I pay homage to you
several times and and how right you are
except for the display thank you sir and
that's all I ask is a little homage to
end my 2013
yeah boys say goodbye to Taylor later I
will see you guys uh I don't know maybe
the next podcast maybe not peace out
Taylor but at some point okay yeah at
least at least CES before then maybe
yeah maybe not we'll see you'll be happy
to know that I'm upgrading to HughesNet
gen4 so well don't know what may be able
to talk next time I don't know what any
of that means did you say something it
sounded like something cut you out Adam
oh my I'm kidding I'm kidding it's not
true is coming through clear as a bell
good bye Taylor goodbye good day well
Taylor retweet this Martin is gone and
we still have news to cover so let's get
back to Windows Phone listeners thank
you for your indulgence and allowing us
to take that little segue into Thomas
huffed masters email thank you for the
mail Thomas and sorry about the
scheduling wonkiness of this of this one
of our last shows for 2013 where are we
gents I think was just sprinkle listener
mail throughout the entire podcast room
for the rest of the show yeah just no
just just dump it or where let's just
let's just throw it to throw caution to
the wind to go for it and you gtalk
crazy talk I might know if the icon
comes out I think we're gonna talk a lot
about it so I kind of want to move on to
this possibly canceled tablet you want
to tell us something about this student
yeah so ever since or even maybe even
before the 2520 came out we've been
hearing about the possibility the
smaller nokia tablet it just seems like
it would it would inevitably get around
sooner or later we didn't know quite
when but now this is rumor that it's not
gonna happen that nokia's executives
have decided to cancel this thing and
it's not really clear why but the site
reporting is my Nokia blog seems to
really rely on the source I don't name
who it is but you get the impression
that they're plugged in and have given
reliable information in the past so why
might nokia want to kill off at eight
point three inch tablet it seems like
it'd be a great you know way to fill out
and sign up a little bit it does but i
mean i have to wonder if this is a
function of the fact that they're about
to be acquired yeah yeah you know
anodized work this wasn't far enough
along in the roadmap for us to go to
release on this and dump it on with the
rest of the nokia world stuff so we'll
make yourself you can take this if you
want it
which may be what's happening because
we're also hearing not to get ahead of
ourselves here but about it has surface
mini that might be in the works and from
what we're hearing about the features
that it might have it sort of we heard
in the past the Nokia might be
developing a touchless control gesture
based system that might end up
premiering on the surface mini for
Microsoft so Adam doubt you've had the
first generation service for a little
while surface and what do you think
about this would you want to control a
smaller version of it with gestures I
want to go all minority report on you
absolutely that would be cool I mean you
know it's this is not dissimilar to what
they've been doing with to what
Microsoft has been doing with the with
the Xbox the the thing the kinect thing
yeah I you know they've been doing a
gesture controls on that now that's
coming from across room I don't know how
well it's going to work with a device
that's you know three feet in front of
you or even sitting on your lap and I
don't know how goofy you're gonna look
on the train doing these gestures move
here you know it's it's an interesting
concept and you know it's kind of like
it's kind of like the yola you know
gestures it's like it is it can how
intuitive is it gonna be how hard is it
going to be to learn and and how useful
are they actually going to be and is it
going to be solely reliant on these
gestures or is it going to be just
something that you add on like not
unlike the samsung air gesture Neil's so
yeah this is a lot to be seen from it
but I mean I think Microsoft is in a
good position to do something like this
based on their what they've done with
the Kinect it's weird though how we
really seen many RT tablets in this size
range now do we see any tablet part will
the dell venue was a venue 8 tablet was
that is that an RT tablet that's pro no
that was full yeah yeah yeah this is
compro a ensures that our full when it
windows 8 yeah lenovo has 12 right right
can you tell we don't we don't get these
in much um Wow all right ya know so i
guess i guess we haven't I mean
nokia with the 2520 is kind of the only
company so far to have made me really
compelled by NRT product and that's a
function largely of the hardware to know
what's great surprise but also the
software i think has matured enough to
be certainly acceptable to me I don't
know about anybody else out there but
it's interesting you mentioned the
software because I can sort of get the
feeling that this lack of 78 inch RT
models might have something to do with
you know this merger we've been hearing
rumors for the longest time between RT
and a windows phone or maybe Microsoft
it doesn't know what software would be
best for a device in this range yeah
could be I I'm looking forward to
hearing about an event you know I think
we're we're overdue to hear to hear
about some developments here that are
that are major then aren't just kind of
iterative I would love to see a 7 inch
Windows Phone device of some sort I
think that really has a lot of potential
you know especially if they can combine
some elements of RT maybe the horizontal
scrolling you know from the home screen
something like that but I would
definitely love to see some type of 7
inch Windows Phone device almost there
with the 1520 I mean have you have you
played with the video I think Gillian
I've you know a little bit in the cell
phone store but not any real hands-on
time I'm sorry actually I wanted to get
that out to you but they needed it back
rather promptly so I'm sorry we didn't
get to have that out to you for your
impressions but next time it's giant as
you know i mean it's matt oh yeah I
would not I wouldn't mind a 7-inch
screen but if that chassis gets any
bigger I think I'm not going to be able
to to uh to endorse it and personally to
my friends and family but the the 1520
is definitely as big as they come in
terms of that so it was slightly down a
little bit further down the line the
1020 still my preferred windows phone is
finally getting the Lumia black update
isn't that right ray yeah
a don't have a 720 no Sam I'm quite
excited about this I don't use digital
negative files but an update to the
nokia camera app is delivering that
capability so you can shoot in raw if
you're the kind of photographically
inclined person who would buy a 1020 did
you still have the 1021 you will
absolutely yeah I use it whenever I
can't whenever I'm not carrying a review
device it's gonna be my holiday phone I
think some commas and ever really
curious to see some examples of what
this these new DN keys look like so even
if you're not gonna be doing that on a
regular basis Mike you think about
providing us some comparison shots no no
no I'm not going to do that but actually
there's a plan of foot for us to provide
that in the hands of a much more capable
photographer Adam Lane I suppose that
would work yeah he's going to shoot some
comparison shots I think back to back
before and after the update so yeah we
should be able to see just how much this
improves things awesome so let's get
enrolled out what do you think gentlemen
is it time for us to transition to iOS
news and then listener mail to close out
the show me thanks the plan would let's
see what iOS has to offer all right go
ahead any gentleman who'd like to read
that first one it's exciting let me be
bashful it is the season for gift giving
an apple as a side if you get things
started a little bit early with its 12
days of gifts this is a program that
it's run in the past unfortunately
actually this is sort of kind of
comeuppance we're in the US so used to
getting everything available to us now
you know google launches some new
service we get it the rest of y'all have
to wait who knows how long in this case
though Apple's been doing this 12 days
of gifts promotion for a couple years
now it was in Europe it came to Canada a
little while back and it's finally
coming to the US and even though the
actual stuff doesn't get started until I
think the 26th so it's actually a
post-christmas thing it already started
early yet made a download from Lord
available popular singer the moment so
if you go to some but okay if you have a
phone
running iOS 7 or better you should
download this 12 days of gifts app and
keep poking away at it because these
downloads whatever ends up coming is
only available for the day that it's
announced so you can't like roll in on
January seventh and get all of these at
once yeah when I first saw this headline
i was thinking i always think it was
something similar to what Microsoft was
doing in their stores cuz they had like
the two weeks of like you counted
products like they have like only like
three days and good ones though right
well still but the the good days that
they have a really good monsters yeah oh
man I would I almost went to a microsoft
store several times except i was gonna
get fired well there's always next year
yes waiting the city of google does a
big thing i know last year I ended up
buying a ton of apps they made available
quite cheaply the one thing I saw Google
today made the the classic will ferrell
movie elf available for free download we
had the place to learn only the standard
def not the high death but that's free
now and hopefully more stuff coming from
google but this is what Apple's got for
now nice what about the little piece of
orphan mail our orphan news that got put
into the iOS category because we needed
to Pat it out a little I like this
little bit of wearable news from from
our friends at pebble this is big news
isn't it it is yeah pebbles finally
putting together a fishel App Store to
download software that will run on your
when your pebble right on your wrist
there they've been really improving
their sdk a couple times this year is a
big release back in a spring another in
the fall so adding new capabilities
there been your third-party places you
go to to get these apps but pebbles
trying to make this nice and official
everything on there is going to be free
at least to start with so it's very very
promising news is going to add a lot of
functionality to an already very useful
SmartWatch ya know because it's even for
me who is willing to go to like off-site
locations on the internet to go find
watch faces and stuff and all that kind
of stuff like it's like the convenience
of having a non device App Store is
indeed
not be matched in my view it has a lot
of credibility to the device as well oh
true Absalom you know so now you don't
have to you know sideload we're going
back to that term you don't have to
sideload any of these apps or watch
faces onto onto the pebble so it
definitely adds a lot of you know
credibility to to the device and hey
we're legit now we got some apps right
right right right there's a commenter
who says or we could wait for the
neptune pine LOL which reminds me i
should say that there's a whole lot of
watches out there that i imagine we can
see a lot of them at CES that are sort
of promised there in kickstarter phase
there in indy gogo phase some of them
are produced and there's just there's a
lot of vapor where's not the right term
because they actually haven't come they
they haven't failed to deliver yet but
there's a lot of like prospective
devices out there the guys from hot
watch are tired of me bothering them
every month like it's gotten to the
point where like the initially friendly
email responses are now down to one line
and you know one every other other email
so whatever you're Michael not yet yeah
so be available later so anyway I just
wanted to make the point that we are
still doing what we can to get our hands
on new wearables and I hope to see some
at CES I think it I think CES is going
to be full of that kind of news for at
least a part of one per day how many
google glasses do you expect to see on
people just going around four per hour
yeah at least yeah maybe i'll get my
face on one who knows moving on to I
think we have to kind of wrap up we're
at the time where we usually and and we
have two more pieces three more pieces
of listener mail to go we can't skip it
because we skipped it last week and
because this is some pretty cool stuff
in here so let's move on to listener
mail Adam why don't you kick us off with
the first piece of mail here ok so this
mail comes to us from men gyan i hope i
pronounced as i don't know i think it's
min new yen i do have a market and i got
that wrong every single time you see I
don't even ask people what their names
are I just ask them to spell it because
I don't even want to guess anymore so
this moment ago it's my hair ok so
ask do you think that the HTC finance
program is a step to get away from the
carrier IDK it's just I don't know it's
just a thought popped into my head and I
wonder if you guys feel the same way if
you read this thank you you're welcome I
love your work thank you and keep it up
we try we will try indeed Thank You Man
yes um I actually found this I actually
found this finance program to be very
very intriguing a little bit yeah I
don't know a little bit short-sighted so
as a refresher ask me HTC launched this
financing program which we talked about
in a previous episode where you can
basically pay for an HTC One overtime
with no interest so that's what I'm
talking about here yeah what you found
it short-sighted Adam yeah i thought
well i find it yet to be very
short-sighted because it's your pain for
the phone over two years if i remember
correctly right yeah we talked a little
about that you can an appeals the
short-sighted consumers dead that's
that's what I mean um yeah I just I
don't you know it says people hey I can
get an HTC One for 25 bucks okay yeah
and you're gonna be stuck with that for
quite some time now but I suppose that's
similar to what's going on with the
current carrier subsidization plus if
you take this finance program and you
combine it with a TNT's current offer of
i think it's like what fifteen dollars
off a month of your not on contract if
you call them and ask them for it uh-huh
you know now you're getting now you're
getting an HTC one for ten dollars a
month kinda sorta so maybe that's not
such a bad deal after all because it
wouldn't be for subsidized to the
carrier it be subsidized to the to the
OEM yep like Dudley that big a lot of
sense Wow I'm not saying it makes any
more sense but it loses cheaper I mean I
don't think this is a move directly like
I don't think this is HTC like saying
well we're done with the subsidy model
and we're going to go do our own thing
like I think the proposition is not
compelling enough for this to make any
real dent in anything I think this is a
way for them to experiment with very low
stakes in a new model I think it's very
cool I just don't think the adoption
rate is going to be terribly high so
while to answer listeners question I I
think that this is not a way for them to
get away from carriers I think they're
just trying something out to see what
happens and the data they use from this
may be used to either end this or build
out this program in the future who knows
I think would also be intriguing to see
what would happen if they were to offer
this finance program on the next device
not last year's device well and they may
well do that I mean that you know you
don't want to do that blind I mean not a
lot of OEMs do this period so you know
this could be the trial run prior to
them saying hey guess what that
financing thing we intrude on the one
now it's available for the two hey oh I
just wonder I wonder how many people I
haven't problem where they can get over
the psychological impact of well I'm
going to pay six hundred dollars for a
smartphone yet don't have six hundred
dollars lining around I think it's
looking for a very specific type of
customer I don't know maybe specific but
I think it's a wide I think it's a
customer who is in ample supply because
I can very easily access the part of my
brain that like a knows he doesn't have
six hundred dollars just sitting around
but I feel like those customers are
going to be swayed by the subsidies that
they're gonna find comfort in that yeah
possibly sure but but even the
subsidized price is still like 99 or
even 199 depending on the carrier and
it's like what you're telling me that it
cuz it's zero down right look because
you're telling me I could just pay 25
bucks a month and yeah I could have a
new phone my god yeah and then I'm now
I'm gonna go out to chili's with all
that money I saved and for my date as
this is this particular finance program
is this us only or is this worldwide I
assume us only these things all these
are well I'm just wondering because I
mean if it is worldwide you know
subsidisation is pretty much I'm it's
largely a us-based concern you know if
you live yeah you know if you live in
europe or whatever you are dropping six
hundred dollars for a phone at the store
so I mean this could be a way to appeal
to those consumers as well yeah let's
just toss one financing when you can
apply at 18 tease webs or HTC to website
it's just any different than tossing
down a credit card to buy the phone no
it's like you got a best buy you get the
card yet
percent per year oh there you go %
that's that's the deal thing yeah but I
mean just as speaking to stevens point
about you know if you don't have 600
hours laying around yeah you can't
afford it if you if you have six hundred
dollars left on your credit card and you
could pay $25 month that way lord knows
I've been living like that for quite
some time yeah I I don't see a u.s.
qualify requirement here so yeah so I
mean this could be a way to appeal to
the worldwide consumer as well it's a
good question we don't have the we don't
really have a very specific answer but I
think we've speculated plenty shall we
move on to the next one indeed yes this
one is from Ricky Paul and I love this
question in the last 30 years of by the
way i want to mention Ricky Paul thank
you for writing in Ricky's piece of mail
was long enough to like if you rolled it
out onto the asphalt like a plane could
take off I'm a feeling this is a segment
of a larger piece here definitely is i'm
sorry Ricky thank you for writing in we
just don't have time as you can tell we
always go over time this podcast is very
long we just don't have the time for all
your points but your number two point
was my favorite one so in the last 30
years Ricky Paul says man has witnessed
the mobile phone drastically decrease in
size but now all of a sudden they're
growing again do you think there's ever
going to be any market for smaller
handsets at all I like every in two
months I just somebody else asked this
question and I'm like god I hope so yeah
Apple seems to think so absolutely but
even like the iphone 5c feels like a
miniature phone when I pick it up
nowadays yes but yeah it's apples not
getting any smaller I'm exactly exactly
yeah but not not not with the pace that
everybody else is no but I don't think
we're gonna have a return to old form
here yeah exactly i don't see a future
every pic see right now god right right
right right like i don't know about you
guys but I'm looking forward to 2020
when people are walking around bag
phones again so that's I'm a little
scared of that of one of these futures
where it's like yes if things get
miniaturized to the point where if we
want to carry a carry on a voice
conversation we can put on a special
earring like an oversized earring like
in Elysium
because then I feel like devices get
really boring it's just like here's that
thing I have to put on it's like a
wristwatch that you can only you know
customize so far and then the device you
carry for data consumption is a tablet
that's may be flexible that's that you
can roll up I don't know what it is but
I just don't stephen i agree with you i
don't see us returning to a time where
like smartphones small tiny phones are
in vogue again in that said because they
could be really functional now I really
couple weeks back about what if Samsung
put the s pen on a tiny little like four
inch or three point five incher the big
problem with these phones at least for
me is that it's harder to interact with
the touchscreen but a stylist on problem
solved well true well then you're back
in the world of the HTC touch again like
to know what I does looking you know
what I'd almost like to see is is a
point where smartphones just become more
of a series of peripherals that work
around a central hub of a device and
maybe that could get smaller you know
like you mentioned with the with the
earrings and then you have the goggles
that can go with the earrings and then
you instead of some type of watch
display and then you just have this this
you know sort of like a thin brick that
you slide into your pocket that is
feeding all these various personal
hotspot ever information yeah because
Wi-Fi or blue transferware like a more
like a data aggregator if nothing else
you know just something you know that
basically serves is like the in these
the central hub to all these other
devices that are all working together I
think your hub would be on your watch I
think that's the thing i think a hub
would not need to be carried separately
that enough he used to your spinal cord
there you go yeah it is embedded in your
thigh meat yes i think that like the
this idea is really cool and it could
result in a very small phone being cool
again but I don't you know we're never
going to see the day of the razor again
or more appropriately for what we're
talking about with smartphones something
like the palm that I 500 remember the
folding palm device I was going to say
the vir sure the vir oh yeah of course
we've got tons of those here thanks to
you and s load of them yes if you will
one of them with Android on
but I wish you know there's a good point
at him and I wouldn't have thought of
that but man ricky paull i think that i
think you and i probably have similar
dreams sometimes because i think back to
buying the Veer on release day at an
AT&amp;amp;T store and just remarking at the
tiny size of it when it came out of the
box and continuing over the next three
or four months to remark it how tiny it
was how much I would forget it was there
in my pocket sometimes and and yet how
functional it remained doesn't get that
well weren't exactly right exactly so
you know I I wish and I hope that
someday that large phones aren't the
aren't Archer requirement for high-end
phones and we'll just see your Bush I
think the like mini phones get more
powerful last year you have it's like
the mini versions of phones maybe that's
true that's true we've stopped making as
much fun of them like yeah I guess we'll
see in the meantime we'll just keep
writing editorials advocating it indeed
advocating for it who wants to wrap up
the listener mail so I thank you recap
all for your email I haven't read one
yet all right steven is gonna be the one
I think it's from Anthony yeah Anthony
Nardiello I love this one this is great
this is the the perfect one to serve as
the last mail cause it's a holiday
question yes yes let's hit it Anthony
says hello pocketnow team I am a huge
fan of all your work and hope you guys
keep up the good work I do have a
question though as you know it's the
Christmas season and when asked what I
wanted I replied the 2013 edition Nexus
7 good choice my dad is not the biggest
fan of tech and tried to tell me that I
already have something like this in my
ipod touch 4th gen I tried to tell Nexus
7 is completely different than my ipod
but he won't listen and he wants to know
what would be the best way to tell him
the difference in this please keep in
mind he doesn't care about specs no do I
wants to know how to convince us outta
convinces dad that these are not the
same thing I know haven't we all had
this like can you all remember back to
when you were a kid and like your
parents just didn't understand that
thing whether you were trying to get a
gift or trying to like do something and
your parents like no
I say you already have something just
like this you want the Pokemon you get
the Digimon with ya yes sooner yes
perspective last week s for Star Trek
DVDs then you get the Star Wars
collection or sitting in back panel
actually oh that's a horrible statement
nightmare no well so I do you guys have
an idea of like I feel like the answer
to this lies in an analogy like how do
you translate this into something that
your dad will understand who's your
daddy engines in anchor it's yes I can
see if this is a problem what he doesn't
get how the Nexus 7 is different from
the ipad mini but this is apples and
android on ranges wait literally no I
mean it's just it's it's a tablet it's
not an iPod I dad I'm sorry you're wrong
yeah he kind of have TVs in the houses
that are different sizes point2 you know
the third signature in the kitchen and
the 60 ensure in the living room and see
do you see the difference here right but
those TVs just sit there and they serve
the same function whereas the ipod touch
and that in the nexus 7 you rented you
can do many of the same things on each
one but they also they're very very
different and they provide a very
different user experience for a variety
of reasons and i feel like this is much
more like saying that that a bicycle is
equivalent to a pickup truck because
each one gets you from A to B right
right yeah no it's done even just by me
the tablet clown yeah that'll did
that'll do it at him yeah totally um
nice work it's good point out how old it
is i mean the 4th gen ipod touch dates
back to what 2010 point out how a 2010
car is not as nice as a 2014 model in a
car though like it's like a 24 2010 car
is not as is not going to serve my
purposes as much as a 2014 you know what
did dodge ram you know it's it's such a
gulf in capabilities in every measurable
sense it is better if you want to use a
tablet to use a tablet instead of using
something as a tablet it's also it's
it's like you know
vcr versus DVD player you know it's I
mean I wouldn't say sure I wouldn't say
the ipod touch is necessarily a VCR
equivalent of technology but still it's
just it's it's old it's outdated and
okay Anthony look I'm gonna I'm gonna do
you a favor here just listen pay
attention very closely I'm scared
already I want you to take your ipod
your ipod touch 4th generation and the
next time you have to next time you have
to go to the bathroom want you to take
that with you and I want you to oops
accidentally knock it into the sink dad
now I don't have anything get me the
tablet this could backfire really easily
this is the worst at my side ever heard
Anthony I don't listen to adam he's
never gonna be on the podcast again
there's no has liability
actually at having dropped a phone into
the toilet once i can tell you you don't
want to do it at all but that's why I
stopped it in the sink at least I am I
ain't edit in that for you know so
Anthony I really think the the answer
lies in first of all I mean if you can
you're probably gonna want to do this
yourself because i'm not i'm not sure if
you're gonna be able to convince your
dad here but find out what analogy makes
sense to your dad the car one is really
lazy it's the first one that came to my
mind but there's a better there's a
better analogy out there and just say
hey listen you know old and busted
versus new hotness exactly that's
basically but it but it's not it's not
buzz it's not old and new it's not that
they're different product categories and
the key lies in making your data
understand that it's not that like what
i have is old and boring it's like what
I have doesn't serve the needs that this
other thing does and if all that fails
man just gather up the best google nexus
7 commercials and show them to your dad
because tell me want to read books on it
you could go yeah i can use i want to
study with it there isn't a google
educate your thing down just another ask
dad for a google play gift card there's
that too there's that there you go
there's that or you know yeah cash yeah
does that my best friends call me cash
okay we've all been there and
we've we've we've been in that situation
and at some point fortunately you you
get to a point where you don't have to
you can you can provide these things for
yourself but until then we wish you all
the all the luck in the world trying to
convince your father and let us know how
it goes please write back in and we'll
we'll share that news with our listeners
and listeners if you have advice for
