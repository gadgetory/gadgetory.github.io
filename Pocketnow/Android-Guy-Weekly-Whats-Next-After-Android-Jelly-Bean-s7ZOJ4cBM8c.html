really don't care about google has been
naming their Android versions after
desserts from cupcake to donut all the
way up through Ice Cream Sandwich and
jelly bean so that begs the question
what's next well they follow their
alphabet scheme we're up to version k
and what starts with the letter K pause
for just a minute and think desserts the
start with k there's a google search out
there that you could do but let me just
spoil it for you key lime pie that's
probably what it's going to be called
and there's some rumors coming out of
google i/o that people at Google are
already referring to the next version of
android as key lime pie how about
versions well Ice Cream Sandwich was a
big step up from honeycomb I don't need
to tell you that but it was a step from
version 3 point something to version
four point oh the latest version of ice
cream sandwich is 4.0 point for the
point four at the end being primarily
bug fixes we were kind of disappointed
to be frank when jellybean came out as
version 4.1 not a huge step forward
luckily what was included inside the
operating system seems like a huge step
forward even though the version
numbering wasn't so again that begs the
question what's the next version are we
going to see version 4.2 maybe a jump to
4.5 or even a jump all the way up to 5
point oh I don't know I'd like to think
that it's going to be a major jump up to
version 5.000% 4.2 4.3 we might even
skip something all the way up to 4.5 but
it's going to be an incremental build
that's my guess regardless if key lime
pie is going to be a major version or
a minor version what's going to be
included in it well let's start with the
no-brainer bug fixes we know that there
are bugs in every version of every
software that ever existed just kind of
sad to think that we have some of those
flying in space ships and satellites but
I digress we're going to see bug fixes
in the next version of android things
that we don't know about now that will
be discovered and fixed will be
implemented either along the way as
minor patches or all together in the
next version of android and probably
both so people that are running on jelly
bean or ice cream sandwich now we'll be
able to get the bug fixes in the interim
but then all of us will be able to get
them one version whatever we want to
call it comes out in key lime pie so
what else improvements now of course
we've got UI improvements and we saw a
major leap with UI improvements with
jelly bean / Ice Cream Sandwich the UI
itself really didn't change all that
much we saw some additions with google
search and what was it Google now Google
today it's still too early to know what
these things are called it's a joke for
you guys who are paying attention but
we're going to see a lot of these minor
improvements to the UI the major
improvements to how we experience the UI
voice will be improved touch input will
be improved the way we look at things on
the screen will be improved so we're
going to see these improvements that are
behind the scenes that just make the
entire Android experience that much
better so what else are we going to get
hardware never sleeps okay I know you
can put into sleep mode and turn it off
and stuff but follow with me okay you've
got people that are spending their
entire careers doing nothing more than
figuring out what the next version of
the processor is going to be how the
next CPU is going to work how to cram
more cores into a smaller space well
this is marching ever onward so we're
going to see course operating systems
built to take advantage of all of the
progression that we're seeing with
hardware's so what kind of hardware
support are we going to
right now android runs pretty good could
run better we need to get better 64-bit
support or any 64-bit support then again
we need hardware that supports that as
well we need better multi core support
honestly multithreading is great but
we've got to find some way to do it
better and not just better the OS level
but better at the app level as well can
they do that through the vm i hope so
that way we won't have to have
developers write code specifically to
take advantage of a multi-core
environment because the vm that the app
runs within will just do it I know
that's a lot of technical mumbo jumbo
but it means faster when we talk about
hardware we also have to talk about
platforms or form factors and we already
have smartphones we have tablets of
course now we have a Google tablet we
also have google TV which for some
reason we didn't hear too much about at
the keynotes Google i/o this time around
and now we've got this weird funky ball
thing the Nexus Q by the way Q is kind
of a play on words / q q ue ue you know
like a line because you can queue up
that's a different video but we're
seeing all these advancements and
improvements in hardware platforms we
need to make sure that the operating
system plays nicely together and really
does it seamlessly so we have a similar
albeit not identical user experience
between the different form factors and
everything plays nicely together in fact
plays not only seamlessly together but
intuitively together that's something
that the operating system is going to
have to continue to evolve and polish as
we go along so now we've talked hardware
let's talk about apps now I know apps
aren't an integral part of the operating
system but the operating system exposes
new AP is or allows you to do current AP
is in a different way so that
applications can take advantage of them
they can look better they can be faster
they can tie into new inputs new sensors
new libraries so of course we're going
to have apps that have to
advantage of that as well we've seen
that with Google Apps in fact literally
minutes after jellybean was announced a
good chunk of the google apps were
updated to take advantage of some of the
new stuff there does that mean that it
doesn't work anymore in previous
versions of course not but it means that
if you've got an up level version of the
operating system now you've got all
these cool new advancements and features
that you might not have in a previous
version or the previous version might
not look as nice or might not be as
pretty google has been really really
good setting an example of how they can
do that and release a new version
without sacrificing down level user
experience and over time build in a lot
of the same features and functionalities
that the up level versions are getting
into the down level versions of the
operating system pretty much negating
the whole Android is fragmented argument
because they're handling that in the
code in the apps themselves the OS is
just a platform on which apps run anyway
so that's my thoughts what about yours
what do you think is going to be coming
next in the next iteration of Android
and do you think it's going to be called
Android version key lime pie or is there
some other k dessert that you think we
might get maybe they'll get rid of the
whole dessert naming scheme all together
and just call it Android k like they did
with the Nexus Q I don't know let us
know in the comments down at
pocketnow.com of course give the video a
big thumbs up if you liked what you
heard and of course share it with your
friends and subscribe to the video
channel so you don't miss out on our new
and upcoming coverage for pocket now and
