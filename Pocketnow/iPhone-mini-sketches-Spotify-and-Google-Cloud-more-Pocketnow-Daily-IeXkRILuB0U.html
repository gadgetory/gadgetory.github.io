sub what to expect Google and Spotify
make a weird move that has a feel of a
skeptical and Sony goes official on some
of its future plans for the Xperia I'm
hi meri behna and I know there are cars
running around there's a lot of echo
here let's just call this the air B&amp;amp;B
edition of the Bakken out daily pass the
official news today begin with Sony we
weren't a little skeptical over what the
company was going to deal with the
Xperia lineup and now we know the
company has come official that the
Xperia Z lineup is no more they've
confirmed that indeed the xperia x
performance is going to be their new
flagship and we kind of wonder exactly
where Sony is going with this s it's not
necessarily a bad phone but then the
Xperia Z was just great they just needed
better marketing or whatever let's see
what happens in the future as obviously
there is a tall order for Sony to regain
its limelight other official news are
rather weird we thought that haven't WC
was pretty much over IV hey nobody goes
to the show floor on the last day but
Samsung just came out and launched its
new charm wearable lineup that has a lot
of designs and they kind of kept it
silent but again today it's official at
mwc we don't know any price points yet
all we know is that it's a step counter
that includes 18 days of battery life
which is better than any Fitbit so stay
tuned we'll get it for review at some
point and tell you more about it and for
those of you that have been waiting for
the HTC One m10 the company finally goes
official what the teaser a very
interesting one we were worried about
some of the champers that we saw in some
leaks and seems those Shaffers are
coming as part of the leaks but in
addition to that we also notice the
power of 10 on the hashtag at the bottom
it's gonna be called the 1m 10 we just
wonder exactly what sort of an exponent
is gonna be and Michael just reminded me
of math equations with this so yeah it's
gonna be rather interesting and a very
interesting move that just happened has
to do with Spotify and Google as well
they are rivals in the music business
Spotify is really good at what they do
but the company has just migrated it's
music to google cloud services and a lot
of people are already speculating could
this be the first step in to Spotify
becoming
acquired by google google does have the
money i just wouldn't like this to
happen as spotify behavior as a start-up
is really their key to success the fact
that the company is aggressive and
they're nimble to do it but hey we could
just be wrong or we could just be right
we'll see and finally the very
interesting leaks of the day have to do
with the iphone 5s iphone mini however
you want to call that thing we get to
see schematics today and this time we
seem to find another iphone 5 it looks
like an iphone 5 in every single way
probably the antenna lines you know that
the glass at the back will probably
change we still don't know exactly what
Apple plans to do with this update but
we wonder why the company plans to
retain the design we've also seen other
leaks of an iphone midi that looks
identical to the iphone 6 so it leads me
to the question of today if you had to
pick which one and please don't say none
I mean flick one at least would it be
the iphone 5 design or the iphone 6
design that you would rather keep i
would prefer the iphone 5 design to be
honest with you i just would wish they
would do away with the sham furred edges
which is what made the phone look really
ugly after a little wear and tear leave
