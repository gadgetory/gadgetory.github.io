back and some added features to match
the current lineup we get rumors of
Samsung's foldable smartphone and the
fact that it might launch earlier than
expected and more leaks of the LG G
seven think you emerged and no I didn't
say thank you I'm Jaime Ravenna and
Thursday's are Fridays Fridays junior
and Tuesday's Monday senior man Diego I
didn't get the joke this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you want to get yourself a
brand new Samsung Galaxy as my interests
line Plus and Samsung's online store you
can currently find $150 off for pretty
much the regular variant and then pretty
much $200 off on the galaxy s 9 plus
though there's a catch this is the AT&amp;amp;T
locked version you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the LG
G 7 as Evan blast has already chimed in
pretty much we're getting ready for a
launch I guess he estimates a launch
date on May 2nd and pretty much
everything that we needed to know about
this phone is shown in these renders
from the typical fingerprint scanner
button in the back to dual cameras to
the fact that we do have a headphone
jack in this phone thank you and yes
there is a notch and we also get to see
some color options you can learn more
about them in the description as well
now let's talk about Samsung's Galaxy X
that foldable smartphone that we're
expecting at some point we were hearing
28:20 know we're hearing probably 2019
and bear in mind
apparently this phone will bring three
screens not - it's gonna be foldable but
there are gonna be three screens all
three 3.5 inches apparently the external
display were served for notifications oh
okay that's that's cool actually the
idea is interesting you can extend the
display to turn it into a seven-inch
tablet
alright I'm already curious let's see
what we get now let's talk about the
iPhone 10 for those of you that are
wondering what the numbers are the
numbers continue to drop the market
share keeps dropping
apparently it's currently drops 16% up
to the point where yeah we have heard
rumors that Apple is going to
to another color Aryan to probably
spruce up sales and everything now the
most interesting part is the fact that
every time I get on the New York City
subway I see everybody using an iPhone
10 that's one the second is that well
that pretty much falls into what
customers have said in surveys where
people are apparently very satisfied
with the phone okay
I'm not particularly with battery life
stay tuned for after the buzz on that
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with the iPhone se to get ready it
seems that the code name is Jaguar why I
don't know but anyways alright so Jaguar
it'll bring a glass back apparently
it'll also support wireless charging to
bring features that are matched across
the board and well it'll also get
thinner according to the rumors that we
saw yesterday this is all interesting
and all but mass production has already
begun according to the league so we
should expect that at WWDC which is
pretty much the only event that we've
got announced by Apple coming soon so
anyways and today's question let us know
would you care about an iPhone se - I
mean what are your thoughts
is there still a market for small
smartphones it was a major hit two years
ago when it launched but I don't know of
the stats are pretty much the same let
us know in the comments down below I
sure I'm interested friends again if you
