reality the BlackBerry a10 gets spotted
in leaked photos and Microsoft's plans
for restructuring include their own
phone I'm hi meri beta and Microsoft
would this be the real windows felt like
the real real thing this is fucking out
daily let's get all the boring news out
of the way first and you know that means
the Moto X's Google is now apparently
planning to spend 500 million dollars in
advertising this phone which makes me
wonder why they didn't do that with the
Nexus phones as well but still we've got
some leaked photographs of the full
chassis of the phone assembled you'd
wonder why that thing is so thick and
apparently within the verizon roadmap
that also got leaked today the Moto X is
included and then you also have the
motorola droid ultra lineup that's just
going to be weird let's see how that
goes LG is up next as the company is now
boasting a new very thin display
technology for smartphones and just like
last year that new very thin technology
that they had last year made it to the
optimus G and then it came to the iphone
5 and then the Nexus 4 so it's expected
that this display unit that's actually
five point two inches diagonal and two
point two millimeters thin is going to
make it to the g2 and then to the iphone
5s and then to whatever nexus phone we
get eventually so let's see how that
plays out blackberry is up Nexus we've
got the first leaked photographs of
their new BlackBerry a10 that's planned
to reach the market in the fall and well
it looks like at the blackberry z10 and
the q10 had a baby but then the z10 had
the dominant traits because it doesn't
have a keyboard and it looks a lot like
a z10 so we're trying to figure out what
the differences here are most probably
better specifications but then again
according to the league's this phone is
not necessarily any better than the z10
or at least not apparently so let's see
how that plays out as you'll notice that
odd design you know the white bottom the
blacktop let's see how that plays out
because apparently you will have that
carbon fiber design at the fact that the
q10 has microsoft is up next and it's
been widely rumoured that Steve Ballmer
is working and single-handedly on a new
restructuring program for the whole
company now interesting according to
this restructuring even though they plan
to merge some departments and probably
let some people go apparently the
company is going to focus more on
products assign meaning hardware
products and within that lineup we do
see that there is a smartphone within
their plans we just don't know how
Microsoft is really planning to go about
this because obviously they've been
saying that Nokia is the real windows
phone and then they launch the windows
phone 8x and they said that these are
the real signature windows phones so we
don't really understand how Microsoft is
planning to give us another real windows
phone let's just hope it's better than
the Lumia 1020 we're about to talk about
and finally for the hot news of the day
no guess finally unwrapped their Lumia
1020 yeah that's the final name this is
pretty much a Lumia 920 in
specifications and design but it's got a
huge camera hump for 41 megapixels of
awesomeness and why would you want so
many megapixels low for lossless digital
zoom and also this camera brings better
technology than the 808 PureView for
low-light performance so this is pretty
much the best smartphone in the market
right now when it comes to camera
technology there's just no way around it
and it's really aggressively priced if
you think of the features that you're
getting there compared to even the
iPhone 5 or the galaxy s4 so I do think
that they have a very compelling product
here so that leads me to the question of
the day is the nokia lumia 1020 your
next smartphone and it doesn't matter if
you come from iOS or android is this the
next phone that you're considering in my
particular case i'll be honest with you
i'm not really considering switching yet
but yes this is the first windows phone
that i'd be willing to buy and specially
at that price tag for everything that
i'm getting in the package so leave us a
comment down below what do you think of
the Lumia 1020 do you really like it or
not of course it's always for an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and towel rolled mushy
