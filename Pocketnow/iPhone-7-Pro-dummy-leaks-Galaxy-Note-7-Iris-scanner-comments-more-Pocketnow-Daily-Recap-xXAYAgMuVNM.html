nothing like pocket now before bed
thanks but that sounded weird damn those
Monday jokes never gets old Monday's
never get old either that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi Mary that
at this is it now and this is the
bargain out daily recap for last week
unmon day the topic was some high
resolution photos that emerged that the
iphone 7 and i asked you if you would
mind that the 4.7 inch iphone 7 would
have less features than the larger
phablets we have 150 for comments is it
just me or the leak of the probable 4.7
inch iphone resembles the ipod touch yes
and it's been that way for the last
couple of years i think that Apple has
been moving into that design ever since
the iphone 6 pretty much the iphone 7
looks photoshop just look at the sharp
shadow area on the camera i'm not
convinced you know i'm not convinced
either but it doesn't mean that that
iphone renders doesn't look bad at all
it will want new features to make them
upgrade if Apple is going to withhold
features from the 4.7 inch iphone
variants then I don't see it selling
well which is pretty much would happen
with the iphone 6s in this case
particularly and that's the rumor for
the iphone 7 because remember 10 years
of iphone happens pretty much until the
next generation iphone in 2017 which is
when we're expecting a lot of changes
it'll probably be the case on Tuesday we
had some leaked images blurry ones for
that matter of the galaxy notes of an
edge that I asked you what do you think
of the design we had 825 comments I
don't mind the thickness at all because
I need more battery there is no
confirmation that there will be but it
would be great am I the only one that
likes the edge I actually do like the
edge and in the case of the note it does
have some sort of palm rejection which
is always our complaint with the galaxy
s7 edge in the galaxy s6 edge+ in the
past the edge feature looks cool as hell
but the functionality wise I got my
doubts about it in the bigger phone like
in the note maybe it would be much more
uncomfortable not necessarily one of the
things we loved about the galaxy s6
edge+ were the thicker metal chassis
borders which allowed you to be able to
grip the phone better hopefully that's
going to be the case with a note that on
Tuesday the topic continued with the
iphone 7 we saw some dummy units of the
iphones
and pro and the iphone 7 regular variant
and it seems that this pro variant is
going to have a lot more beef the
features and I asked you if you thought
that was a smart idea we had 186
comments how does it make sense this
makes it unfair for consumers who prefer
the smaller cheaper option not just
smaller and cheaper but also easier to
use if Apple beefs up the iphone pro
it'll be twelve hundred dollars cuz it's
Apple you know I'm actually gonna agree
on this Apple has been doing that with
the pro lineup and particularly with
this iphone prophet gets to be that
expensive it is sort of like Apple but I
think it would hinder the market a lot
galaxy note 7 will be more pro than the
iphone 7 pro guaranteed and I also agree
not necessarily because of the S Pen but
because of all the bevy of features that
are included in the note lineup
definitely the Galaxy Note has always
been a better phablet it's sadly just
not an iphone now on Thursday the topic
was the iris scanner we had some leaked
images of the user interface and we
noticed that you have to actually hold
the phone rather close to your face
we're talking about the note 7 by the
way I asked you to think that the iris
scanner would be a useful feature or
gimmick we had 854 comments of course
it's a gimmick I mean Samsung is the
gimmick King you haven't used samsung
phones in a while haven't you LOL i love
how the Lumia 950 950 XL had the iris
scanner first but only now everybody is
talking about it that's because both of
those phones really sucked the Irish
scandal will be great for me and many
others who live in areas where you need
to wear gloves often holding the phone
to your face to unlock is much more
convenient they're removing your gloves
or swiping the unlock pattern oh my god
I have to bait it for the longest time
what the purpose of the iris scanner
would be and you pretty much solve it
right there I would have never thought
that true gloves make it a terrible
usage case for you to use a fingerprint
scanner and it's awesome to have that
added feature man thanks a lot for your
comment and finally Friday the topic was
again the iphone 7 because we had a
leaked seven second video of the phone
and i asked you what do you think about
this leak we had 749 comments be honest
the 66 s have better design in my
opinion and I'm glad it's your opinion
dude
half of the world doesn't agree rather
wait for the iphone 7s or eight I don't
see why would anyone buy this thing no
amoled no water resistance no
edge-to-edge display like if you know
what the features are gonna be right not
impressed Apple they should just call it
something else and save the iphone 7 9
until the 2017 iphone you know I've
always debated the whole purpose of
using numbers with the iphone since the
iphone 4 and the past it was about the
features now it's about the numbers and
then it just becomes confusing all the
time just call it the 2018 iphone 2017
iphone i cannot agree more in my opinion
that's it for the pocket out daily recap
