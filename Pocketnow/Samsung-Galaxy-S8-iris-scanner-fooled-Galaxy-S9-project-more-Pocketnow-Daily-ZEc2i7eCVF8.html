Samsung's iris scanner so long as you
follow all the steps we already hear
that Samsung has begun working on the
Galaxy S 9 and t-mobile's battle with
Verizon also includes ways to start
going crazy today
I'm Jaime Rivera and what I love about
coming back the studio number two is the
shirts that I always leave behind this
is pocket out daily fun fact this is
actually the second time I record this
video yesterday's lighting was terrible
and I'm still trying to figure it out
but anyways deals LG g5 B&amp;amp;H $300 and you
get the 360 beat are with it I love
those goggles I wonder why doesn't every
other company do that so for 300 bucks
that's crazy
another interesting deal is not really a
deal at the beginning $229 for the
Samsung gear 360 version - I love that
gear 360 and I still do feels a 229
bucks it's a little too overpriced but
if you bundle it with a galaxy s 8 you
only pay $50 for the gear 360 would that
be worth it yes it would I highly
recommend it as well now it's not about
t-mobile as the company continues to
show how aggressive its and carrier plan
can be exactly a week from now you can
actually go for this new plan where
t-mobile pretty much pays for all your
fees and Verizon and you can actually
bring your Verizon phone and activate it
on t-mobile
they figure it out for you it includes
Nexus sorry it pixel devices I hate that
I still get confused with that and then
even iPhone devices so learn more about
it on like at the description those of
the spotlight over the Samsung and the
Galaxy S 9 yeah I know it's kind of
early for us to talk about it but
apparently Samsung doesn't want to wait
for the late launch cycle that it pulled
this year with all the notes southern
debacle apparently the company wants to
get this phone out early next year up to
the point where we already have the name
project star for the Galaxy S nine
what would Star mean let us know what
you think in the comments and finally
the very hot news they have to do with
ways to fool your infrared scanner on
the Samsung Galaxy s8 it turns out
somebody already figured out that if you
print out an inferred copy of your eye
and include a contact lens over that eye
you can actually fool the iris scanner
now bear in mind it's not really easy
for you to print it in four
a copy of your eye or to make its exact
size for the contact lens it is
obviously an ordeal but it does prove
that there is no such thing as foolproof
security it actually leads me to the
question of today what do you think even
after this would you still trust the
iris scanner or not in my case I will
because again it's very complicated to
fool anyways but leave us a comment down
below what do you think friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the video was filmed
although I'm firing out our comment has
got subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one
you also follow me on twitter
high-mounted photos that are on
instagram at high memory better please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
what you saw I am a metal even I think
so much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
