pocket now here at MWC 2013 in barcelona
we are checking out the caterpillar
booth which has something that we didn't
necessarily expect to show up the cat
b15 smartphone and ultra rugged device
let's have a look at it so this is the
b15 it is a very very rugged device as
we said in the intro very similar to the
Kyocera torque we saw the other night
except obviously styled differently and
branded with this very recognizable cat
brand and it feels a little bit like the
boots that you would wear or the you
know the forklift that you would drive
or something which I guess is the idea
this is a compound manufactured device
it is obviously not going to win any
contests for smelt nests or anything of
the sort but it is meant for folks who
need a rugged phone it is built to I
believe ip67
for recognization it is waterproof it is
it has no problem with immersion it has
wet finger tracking as well so if you
happen to get up with the screen is
soaking wet pulled out of the pond it'll
actually still work and a lot of devices
won't this is scratch resistant Gorilla
Glass up front and refreshingly the
Android build is not 4.4 as we see on a
lot of kind of mid-range durable phones
which is 4.1.1 on this unit it is dot 2
on another unit here this one is is a
little bit older we were told and
obviously all usual stuff here 3g Wi-Fi
bluetooth onboard media player all that
kind of stuff but very rugged device the
third to be branded by caterpillar but
only the first smartphone this is a 5
megapixel camera around the back VGA up
front so just a quick look in case you
need something that's going to survive a
fall into a swamp whose bottom is lined
with razor blades this is going to be
worth your consideration
Michael with pocket now Tony behind the
camera stay tuned for more from MWC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
