now and this is another episode of the
android application weekly in which we
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it if you like to
cook or you just want to impress someone
the all recipes application on the
android market which is free is a great
program if you're having trouble trying
to decide what to make so all you do is
shake the device or you can either slide
your fingers over to select the category
and let's see we have cheese for
breakfast let's view the matches and see
what it's come up with so it looks like
this bacon cheddar patty cakes got
pretty good rating so we'll click on
that so here we can view all the
ingredients and directions you can also
view a nutritional information and send
it to ourselves and add it to our
favorites or crop ellipse is a great
game for anyone that likes puzzle
adventure games so the object of the
game is to more various objects and we
also need to gather these coins what we
want to do is get to the final stage of
the level so right now I have to place
this haystack on this button so that
this door opens and it continues on like
this let's see here just go through hit
this switch and it will move that
platform so now i can grab my hagen and
i probably use it for another portion of
the level so when you reach the end of
the level you move on to the next step
booth is very popular application
available on the iOS platform and is now
available on android for free so what's
that i wanted to turn brad pitt into a
large person will just go start and
we'll choose a photo ok so once i
selected my photo we'll begin face
detection i can move the I positions
around and the mouth let's see here
there we go in the chin and as you can
see it looks pretty funny to make Brad
Pitt rather rather fat so if we want we
can also revert it back to make it then
and we can share that with our friends
and whoever dragon live blackjack is a
free application available on Android
Market Village to play blackjack ii you
can either play with your friends
hopefully in the near future says it's
coming soon so probably play with your
Facebook friends in the near future so
anyways this game is pretty simple you
start out with 15,000 chips or so and
you can bet here so let me deal and if
you never play blackjack probably stand
that one and it looks as though I tied
with P dealer so let's try that again
the game continues on like this I will
probably stand and it looks as though I
lost on that one you ninja is a pretty
challenging our Cade style game will
begin playing here and we'll just go to
story and the object of the game is to
transfer from the top and bottom of the
screen like this in order to pass the
checkpoints and get to further point in
the game let's see how well I can do on
this one so here's another checkpoint
and I need to pass these other obstacles
if you do get stuck at something like
this it pushes you back and you
apparently died so this has been another
episode of the android application
weekly and if you like our videos make
sure you gives a thumbs up and also
leave some comments down below the name
