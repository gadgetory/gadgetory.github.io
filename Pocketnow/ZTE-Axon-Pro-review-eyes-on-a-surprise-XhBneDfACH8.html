deliver sensations throughout your
neurons those can include taste touch
and emotions like surprise and we were
surprised when Chinese manufacturer ZTE
made a move this year that brought a
competitive unlocked smartphone
stateside as Huawei is determined to
seriously catch up in the US across 2016
we end 2015 with a look at what the ZTE
axon pro did to shake up our conceptions
of a budget focused phone maker did it
succeed in getting the company name out
I'm Jules Wong you're on pocket now and
the answers in our video review the axon
design language is American made
specifically Seattle based design firm T
help to decorate the triangle tracks
along the speak grilles and cameras
we'll get to those in just a bit and
giving the sim slot and buttons all the
right exposures and all the right
treatments to that effect the volume up
contact as well as the dedicated shutter
trigger get the grid of triangles for a
subtle refinement of style aero class
aluminum coloured falen blue on our unit
is bounded together with black
polycarbonate end caps for a more
balanced less slippery feel in hand a
special antimicrobial pane of Gorilla
Glass 3 stands up from the body pulling
out of its top and bottom edges
it houses the capacitive keys which are
reassigned Bowl but must be used and a
sharp made quad HD LCD spanning across
five and a half inches the greens get a
little more favored in the gamut but
it's otherwise a pretty accurate display
that can keep very dark or glow like the
Sun silicon comes in the form of a
Snapdragon 810 processor there's four
gigabytes of RAM and non expandable
storage options of 32 or 64 gigabytes
for phone that prides itself on high
fidelity audio there's only one front
facing speaker on this device so ZTE got
this one half correct there are also two
special DAC chips that enable 32-bit
playback
and just for giggles we have the JBL a13
earbuds included with early bird orders
all that sound where gets a heaping dose
of Dolby Digital sound tuning with
different preset configs and Emanuele II
cues to bump up the bass or pick up more
throaty tones there's a reason why
Dobies been around for a long time and
we're glad to hear so many ingredients
put together for a relatively affordable
but nice in-ear listening experience
elsewhere on Android 51 1 ZTE takes a
more aggressive approach to skinning the
OS compared to other OEMs without going
overboard though that includes a couple
of themes but no theme store there are
bloat apps including two fitness apps
but there are only five of them total
and you can disable them right from the
app drawer the rather lacking zSpace
info page takes over the Google male nav
swipe shortcut but that can also be shut
down and there's no option to see your
battery percentage which means you'll
have to get a third-party app for that
the axon Pro includes a task manager so
you can track how it handles CPU and RAM
and disappointingly it does so rather
poorly details after we take a look at
the pictures this thing takes speaking
of just tap the dedicated shutter button
twice any time you want and you're in
the V finder if this weren't ZTE and
instead HTC we'd be talking about a duo
camera setup but instead we'll settle
for saying that a two megapixel focus
assist sensor is paired with a 13
megapixel camera on back apertures wide
autofocus is fast and you can get
shutter speed down to 190 thousandth of
a second the front ciders got eight
megapixels on it when testing out the
somewhat confusing bouquet mode where
you can adjust the focus after the fact
well it works just as mediocre li as on
the HTC One m8 after effects seem to
choke on blurring out the clothes in
subjects sometimes - other than that we
have a pretty meh shooter overall there
is no stabilization and even with phase
detection the autofocus just doesn't
want to behave sometimes you might have
a tough kill added in the door
GART even in the dim and during the day
you'll find negotiating with the Sun or
sky to be a tough proposition
occasionally the phone does favor
blowing highlights out just a little bit
video spools up to 4k it does a decent
job as far as we can tell stepping back
a bit you could definitely grab some
decent snaps from this camera just don't
expect much more from it we had a hard
time taking calls with our axon Pro unit
they'll have to hunt for the earpiece
once in a while since it's offset to the
right noise cancellation was either too
aggressive or just not working at all
one of our test callers reported that he
couldn't hear us for a 20-second stretch
of time using the phone as a phone was
challenging to say the least
t-mobile speeds around Greater Boston
have been average gaming performance
with the 810 has been smooth and warm
but not hot while multitasking has
generally been a smooth experience Ram
prioritization issues occasionally
strike up you should be able to listen
to a podcast while scrolling social
media or some web pages but at some
point the podcast app just gives up the
ghost this isn't what a phone with four
gigabytes of RAM should do for a
non-removable 3000 milliamp hour battery
on a heavy streaming media diet the
screen was lit for three to three and a
half hours over an eight-hour day on
average ZTE solar investment in the US
market has taken a lesser position as
the axon Brandt has been replastered for
use in yes China and we really don't
know what to expect from axon around
these parts in the near future so given
how far we is so ready to put up a fight
in the US with facilities and a CES
launch it's going to be critical for ZTE
to take step two with some contemplation
how the next phone will look feel run
and most importantly spread despite
writer to the contrary for ZTE to change
the smartphone game in the u.s. it will
either need network carriage or an
irresistible product so how does step
one set this all up
well the axon Pro hasn't exactly loud us
with its price tag the software hardware
combination well potent and pleasantly
plain might prove to be a problematic
long-standing drain and while there has
been a software update to address a
major complaint about the cameras we're
still left wondering where the
commitment is to marshmallow that is
part of the axon Passport promise ZTE
made to customers and it's a good
promise to the company just needs to
follow up on it and after all this talk
about security holes in RAM management
fixes
we're in doubt as to whether we can
recommend buying this phone to you and
when you put it next to the Moto X or
the oneplus 2 well you might be happier
paying less if the company wants better
traction for the axon 2016 better be a
better year for ZTE in the USA and that
actually means paying better attention
to all of the competition we hope to get
to you more coverage of ZTE at CES this
year in Las Vegas so follow us on pocket
now at pocketnow.com and everywhere we
are social app and for all of the pocket
now team
I'm Jules Wong at point jewels on
Twitter more from us later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
