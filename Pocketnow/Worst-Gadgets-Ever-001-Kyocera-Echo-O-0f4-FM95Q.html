the fiercest competitive markets ever in
the quest to stand out from the pack
some companies make bold moves and
succeed brilliantly others are more meek
and fade into the unexceptional
background still others fill the space
between innovating once and then
endlessly iterating over and over again
then there are those that just screw it
all up
thanks to choices that are either too
bold too meek or just plain old
absolutely insane these are the products
that fall flat on their face they're not
to be mocked but the lessons they teach
should certainly be remembered and
that's what we're here for
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is episode one of worst gadgets
ever so back in February of 2011 Sprint
announced an industry-first event that
they were really trying to make a big
deal out of when journalists got to the
event they found David Blaine in a tank
of water on stage sitting underwater
holding his breath for something like
almost eight minutes and coughing up
goldfish and lighting cigars underwater
and yeah sprint was setting the stage
for a magical unveiling and they threw a
lot of weight behind it and what we
ended up getting was the Kyocera echo as
a refresher let's take a brief hardware
tour in it's closed position the echo
looks like a well there's no real way of
getting around at the echo looks like a
complete dumpster fire an offset LCD
panel in front here is flanked by two
metal inlays top and bottom below which
sits three capacitive buttons for the
Froyo build of Android that was already
a bit dated at the time of release
taking a spin around the sides and back
here you can see that the industrial
design is absent Kyocera has never had
the best eye for design if you ask me in
the echo is the finest example
that this thing is brutal with the sharp
corners and seams galore cheap buttons
on the side and it's it's a heavy heavy
brick part of the reason for that added
thickness and weight of course if the
echoes headline feature weren't obvious
enough popping the unit open reveals
first off that it's a very cumbersome
unit to open but eventually the hinge
locks into place and your bulky
cumbersome oversized phone becomes a
bulky cumbersome under sized tablet sort
of speaking that hinge this isn't broken
or anything this is how the hinge sits
in its deployed position it makes
putting the echo down on a desk or a
table frankly a ridiculous experience
akin to a busted seesaw it even feels
wrong in its pseudo laptop half deployed
position like this Kyocera made a big
deal at the announcement about how many
patents they had on this ridiculously
over engineered super copper alloy hinge
6 if you care it was clearly the high
point of their design prowess and it's
just so so awkward I mean it feels
durable but it's definitely not the
finest example of engineering I've ever
seen in all the hardware on the echo is
a great example of how not all bold
design choices are good design choices
that's lesson number one for the day but
that's only half the story here the
echos big software advantage was
supposed to be this ability to
simultaniously righted term which key
acero is pushing as this new powerful
way to multitask within Android now back
in the day in the pre ICS time period
when Android multitasking was not as
visually elegant this seemed poised to
be quite a big value add of course it
didn't turn out that way as with most
specialized software builds the echos
custom software head of limitations only
certain apps could
accessed by tapping both screens at the
same time in stock configuration the
simultaneity messaging phone and Kia's
Hera's custom cue view or view cue app
which lets you watch videos while
browsing other videos running to apps
side by side doesn't sound like rocket
science today with samsung's new Galaxy
Note 10.1 offering side by side app
running ability and windows snap
features starting to bleed into tablets
but this was early 2011 and the echo was
trying to address a gap in the market
that really needed addressing outside of
webOS the lack of elegant multitasking
and smart phones was a real problem that
needed solving the problem
it wasn't elegant the dual tap to open
of the multi-tasking menu meant
multi-touch was enabled in some apps and
it was disabled in some other apps some
crucial apps in tablet mode like the
gallery sure you could watch videos
while you were taking care of other
business but the pitiful number of apps
which supported the feature meant you
couldn't say check your email with the
Gmail app while doing anything else you
had to use the stock built-in app not a
great experience and the simulcast
content that this phone wasn't really
going anywhere
really how could it with a bezel thin
but still there bisecting the displays
and in so-called tablet mode even normal
usage without simultaneity lonely
yielded a 4.7 inch diagonal screen area
more square sure and okay for the time
but much smaller than the more
utilitarian phablet screens that started
showing up in devices like the Galaxy
Note and while we can't ding the device
too hard for its lack of responsiveness
and this was the era of Froyo after all
it needs to be said the echo was a laggy
laggy phone frame drops and skips and
general sluggishness pervade the OS
also there was never much pretty about
Froyo and the echos hardware and custom
skin don't do it any favors if you're
going to try to build next generation
hardware don't saddle it with half-baked
software that's lesson number two
in all it's hard to demolish the Kyocera
echo not because it's a bad device I
mean this thing is a train wreck but
because I hate coming down on companies
that try something new there's so little
that's new and exciting in smartphone
hardware these days we've written about
it countless times at pocket now
everything's a variation on the same
dull slate with a big display so it's
always nice to see a company really
strive to do something different fun and
interesting and on paper the echo was
all of that a phone with a hinge that
carried six pending patents dual screens
that transformed into a tablet when you
wanted it to
it sounded like every geeks dream come
true unfortunately where it stumbled was
in execution and those stumbles were bad
enough and big enough that the
obituaries were being written almost as
soon as the echo launched unfortunately
in the world of mobile technology as
elsewhere it's not just about what looks
good on paper it's about what actually
works well in the real world the Kyocera
echo didn't folks I'm Michael Fisher
