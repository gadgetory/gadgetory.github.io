include dual cameras believe it or not
the Google pixel to my touch a few
essential features and there seems to be
yet another one + variant in the works
I'm Jaime Rivera and after eating more
pizza than my stomach can handle it's
time for the news and a diet this is
PocketNow daily after a few weeks in
Barcelona the last thing you'd expect
our official news everything happened at
the event right now let's talk about the
possibility of a Nokia flagship we were
expecting to see something like this at
MWC
and know we got the Nokia 3310 which
actually want but apparently we will be
seeing a flexible just happened
somewhere around June and it'll support
the Snapdragon 835 processor in addition
to other goodies that we should expect
the only thing is that the rumours claim
that we might not be getting a slice
camera we will see about that other very
interesting rumors come from the leaker
extraordinaire mr. Evan Blaz apparently
we are getting something from oneplus we
just don't know exactly what it is
all we have is a tweet from them with a
wallpaper from never settle toned in
black and him claiming you know what
this means
so could either mean a1 + 3 T in black +
1 + I would really want one of those but
it could also mean the 1 + 4 we will
keep you posted as we learn more as well
the spotlight over to the Google pixel -
we don't know exactly when we're getting
it and we've got some not so trusted
sources that are claiming that one thing
that phone will change is the headphone
jack apparently that is going to die on
this feature variant and this is really
sad this is one of those things we
weren't expecting to get from a company
like Google mainly because it's not like
if you're getting any better audio with
USB C or with lightning so only more
fragmentation to come and yes we kept up
with those rumors that there might be
refurbished variants of the Galaxy Note
7 being launched in India then we heard
Samsung officials say that it won't
happen but the interesting part is that
we actually notice that there is a code
name being called grace R and for those
remember grace was the code name for the
galaxy note 7 so our could being
refurbished and this is a rather
interesting development as if you think
about it it would be great to get the
galaxy note 7 it was a great phone we
just needed a better battery hopefully
they figure that one out and finally the
very hot crew verse today come from
Samsung and tweeted by Samsung we've got
the company's X and O's department
tweeting that the new chip they're
making be 88 95 is going to bring
support for dual cameras and guess which
is the first smartphone to be rocking
that 88 95 processor of course it is the
Galaxy s8 now bear in mind we haven't
seen any leaks of this dual camera
module in the galaxy s 8 plus which is
the device we're expecting to get with
that dual camera but this pretty much
just lays everything flat on the table
this is definitely something that's
coming but it leads me to the question
of today if you had a choice
what type of approach would you prefer
from a dual camera when it comes to the
Samsung Galaxy s8 what you want the
Huawei approach which is the monochrome
sensor and the color sensor would you
want the LG approach with the wide-angle
lens or would you prefer the iPhone
approach with a telephoto in my case do
white angle all the way leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
