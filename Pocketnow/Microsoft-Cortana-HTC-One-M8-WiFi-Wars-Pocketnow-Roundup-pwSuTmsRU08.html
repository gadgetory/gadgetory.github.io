PocketNow roundup the HTC One m8 our
full review has been up for a while now
but our coverage has continued a pace
this week at pocket now we examined the
ups and downs of the devices extreme
power saving mode that advertises weeks
of standby time but at a cost we also
take an even closer look at the mah
controversial duo camera following up
last week's photo dump with a feature
showing off our favorite pictures taken
with the device before pivoting to
software Joe Levi thinks other OEMs
could learn a thing or two from HTC's
willingness to open key features like
blink feed and Zoe to other Android
phones while I speculate about what a
one m8 running Windows Phone might bring
to the table that Nokia devices haven't
speaking of Microsoft the company
announced Windows Phone 8.1 this week
and among all of the new features
there's one in particular we are quite
excited about Cortana the new voice

the company on equal or better footing

integration and innovative new features

the accessory he used to achieve that
feat in an editorial on the Zagg
Bluetooth keyboard check that out along
with Adam doubts piece on why he never
wants to touch his smartphone again and
Joe Levi's warning that a new logo on
the boot screen won't solve androids
