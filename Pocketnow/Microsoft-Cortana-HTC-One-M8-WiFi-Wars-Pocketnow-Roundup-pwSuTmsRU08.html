wearables Android logo a Microsoft
powered HTC One m8 a new voice assistant
for Windows Phones exploring the tablet
only lifestyle that's what's been
happening on the editorial pages of
pocketnow.com this week so if you don't
often venture outside of YouTube here's
everything you've missed in five minutes
or less I'm Michael Fisher and this is
PocketNow roundup the HTC One m8 our
full review has been up for a while now
but our coverage has continued a pace
this week at pocket now we examined the
ups and downs of the devices extreme
power saving mode that advertises weeks
of standby time but at a cost we also
take an even closer look at the mah
controversial duo camera following up
last week's photo dump with a feature
showing off our favorite pictures taken
with the device before pivoting to
software Joe Levi thinks other OEMs
could learn a thing or two from HTC's
willingness to open key features like
blink feed and Zoe to other Android
phones while I speculate about what a
one m8 running Windows Phone might bring
to the table that Nokia devices haven't
speaking of Microsoft the company
announced Windows Phone 8.1 this week
and among all of the new features
there's one in particular we are quite
excited about Cortana the new voice
companion for Windows Phone looks to put
the company on equal or better footing
with Apple and Google in the personal
assistant department and tailor Martin
predicts that with her deep level
integration and innovative new features
she'll be a major win for Microsoft
unless exciting news we've also got some
opinions on the new Microsoft Office
suite
Taylor Martin is back once again with
thoughts on the Suites price tag on iPad
while Jolie vied chafes that it's still
not available on Android and Adam Lane
chips in with some speculation on the
future of office in the Windows Phone
space
in other news and tablets wearables the
android logo Wi-Fi differences and the
world's longest mobile tech podcast it's
a question we've seen asked and answered
all across the internet for years can
you make it through a workday using just
a tablet for your computing needs and
it's a question we addressed in this
week's video experiment here on YouTube
but tailor Martin goes into detail on
the accessory he used to achieve that
feat in an editorial on the Zagg
Bluetooth keyboard check that out along
with Adam doubts piece on why he never
wants to touch his smartphone again and
Joe Levi's warning that a new logo on
the boot screen won't solve androids
problem of brand confusion but will a
new Wi-Fi router solve your problems
with signal confusion cool segue right
well Joe has the answer for you there
too with an examination of the
differences between eight or 2.11 AC and
N two gigahertz and five gigahertz and
the answers to a bunch more nerdy Wi-Fi
