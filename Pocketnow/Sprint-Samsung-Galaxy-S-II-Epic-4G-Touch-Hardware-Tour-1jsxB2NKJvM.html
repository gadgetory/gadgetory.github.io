pocketnow.com today we're taking a
closer look at the hardware on the
samsung galaxy s2 epic 4g touch from
sprint so sit back relax and enjoy the
show so on the front of device we have
the four capacitive touch buttons that
we saw in the unboxing we have a
notification LED the speaker grill a
couple of you know sensors and light
sensors and the like and then the
front-facing video camera the 4.5 2 inch
screen super amoled plus and we'll get
to comparison in just a minute for that
on the bag we've got a kind of a plastic
finish that's a little kind of hexed and
it's kind of brushed across the whole
back of the device this is the only
place where you see the sprint logo and
the galaxy s2 displayed as well we have
the 8 megapixel camera with flash and
then it's got a little bump down here
and the speaker grill foot speaker phone
is back here as well moving to the side
we have the volume rocker on this side
and then on the opposite side we have
the power button and really nothing else
the edges are kind of beveled here along
this edge is a little bump right there
beveled inward rounded corners which
makes it feel really really nice in the
hand and then here we've got the
headphone jack on the top really not a
whole lot to see a very plain-looking
outside device very lightweight easy to
hold pop off the battery cover here no
near-field chip here that's that I've
been able to find a no access to it
maybe they'll add a door since its you
know Google Wallet was just released but
so far 1800 Miller hour battery and the
micro SD card slot
and there is no included micro SD card
with this device it just has 16 gigs of
internal memory 1 gig of ROM barmy 1 gig
of ram and really it's very very snappy
and we'll get to some of the benchmarks
in the full review but really this this
device is very very quick the
notification LED is really nice to have
the cameras so far have been outstanding
we'll see some more of those samples in
the final review if we take a look here
at in comparison with the original epic
you can see it's just a little bit
longer obviously a little bit wider due
to the screen size here and it's as thin
as the keyboard was on the epic 4g the
original epic the screen colors on the
samsung galaxy s2 are a little the
contrast a little stronger on this super
amoled plus which means that the colors
are a little more rich and deep compared
to the screen on the original epic but
otherwise you know it's not really that
much of a difference even at fulbright
this one's a little bit brighter but not
by very much compared to another device
such as the photon so here's the photon
of course I have the screen right in a
set to auto right now it's just a little
bit thinner a little bit longer screen
is different technology we're looking at
a pentile screen here on the the
motorola let's go ahead and take this up
to full bright
there's Fulbright there and in
comparison here the colors look really
kind of washed out it's it's probably
not in the video so much but the color
difference between what black is here
and what black is on the Samsung device
night and day difference the blacks on
this are so much more incredible this is
almost kind of a hazy grey look here
come in comparison which is is very very
noticeable and there's no pixelation
like the pin tile screen has Wi-Fi
Bluetooth the typical pieces that you
would expect the resolution is 480 x 800
it can do 1080p out it can also record a
1080p video and the one thing the good
and dimension is that the bluetooth is
actually version 3 battery life on the
epic 4g touch has been outstanding I got
about 16 hours of battery life before
the meter actually popped up the first
day of use that was with three hours of
solid phone calls in addition to surfing
the web and setting up the device and so
on and so forth and that's been pretty
consistent today I'm down to about
thirty percent right now and the it's
been on for about 12 hours or so give or
take once I took it off the charger and
frankly that's that's fantastic for this
sort of device you can see here battery
usage so 12 hours and 12 minutes and
then look here at these status it's at
thirty two percent so it's got another
few hours before it's going to pop up
that battery air you know battery low
message plug your device in so data
speeds on the epic 4g touch have been
outstanding in 4g mode getting 12 down
and 1.4 up and here is the eight and
then 10 or rather not eight but this was
a point 8 down as
Chinh tu 3g mode and then back into 4G
for the 3g service has been what I
expected now the Samsung 1.2 gigahertz
Exynos processor is really really fast
on this device everything is just butter
smooth transitions even with all the
widgets on the screen with the swapping
back and forth between the screens is
extremely fast very little lag giving
other than what you might see in the
animations and if we scroll down here to
this functionality which will demo more
in the software view but you can see how
fast I'm able to scroll back and forth
and back and forth between these zones
which is just simply outstanding as far
as a performance on the device so far my
only complaint here is the lack of the
near-field chip and the possibility that
it might you know have been better as a
world phone as well but that could have
also increased the size it with the CDMA
and the GSM built in to the same device
that wraps up our closer look at the
hardware on the samsung galaxy s2 epic
4g touch from sprint if you have any
