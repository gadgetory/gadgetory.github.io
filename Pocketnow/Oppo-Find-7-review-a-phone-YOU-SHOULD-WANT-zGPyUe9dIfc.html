designing production execution and
presentation of it's fine seven flagship
something which is also valid for it's
almost twin the find 7a we have also
reviewed that phone here on pocket now
from the unboxing experience today to
they use opal has tried and managed to
offer a premium experience for customers
who purchase this device depending on
your tastes you'll find the fine 7 to be
either average or good-looking whichever
side you choose you'll have to agree
that it's definitely not an ugly phone
the front of the device is dominated by
the large slab of Gorilla Glass 3 and to
its bottom you'll find the capacitive
buttons as well as one of the standout
features of the fine 7 the skyline
notification LED which is futuristic and
trendy enough to turn heads
we wish Oppo went with multiple color
tones instead you're stuck with the blue
color whether you like it or not
precision machine device that's what the
fine 7 is with quality materials being
used tight tolerances and attention to
detail there are no gaps in this phone
and even the removable that cover has an
eject button should you want to switch
Sims or micro SD cards everything feels
solid but you'll have to get used to the
fairly large footprint and the squared
edges the curved back doesn't seem to
help this phone fit in your palm too
much if you have small hands a hundred
and fifty two point six millimeters tall
75 millimeters wide and nine point two
millimeters thick weighing three grams
more than the find 7a at the hundred and
seventy three grams most probably due to
the larger battery pack at three
thousand milliamp hours those not moved
by the looks of the phone we'll
definitely be surprised about the
specifications which are really high-end
from the quad core Snapdragon 801
processor clocking at 2.5 you got Hertz
to the three gigs of ram and 32 gigs of
storage these are some strong features
other notable specs include the microSD
card expansion for up to 128 gigs of
additional storage 13 megapixel camera
with dual LED flash paired with a
surprisingly good 5 megapixel wide-angle
front phaser a 3
milliamp-hour removable battery USB OTG
bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi b/g/n NFC and GPS to
name the most important ones network
compatibility includes LTE with
frequencies depending on the market as
well as the usual gsm + wcdma the 5.5
inch quad HD display has a resolution of
1440 by 2560 pixels and a PPI rating of
538 the colors are really vibrant with
good contrast and surprisingly good
black levels for an IPS display content
the sharp thanks to the envelope-pushing
resolution and side angle visibility is
also exceptional we have no objections
really when it comes to the display you
know what else we have no complaints
about performance the high-end specs
really Drive this phone fast
whether that's launching applications
listening to music sending emails
multitasking between the browser and
social media everything is snappy and so
are the home screens widgets and
flipping through them you simply cannot
bug it down regardless of how many apps
you run gaming performance is also
exceptional we have to remember that the
internals have to push more pixels with
the quad HD display but we've seen no
hiccups while playing demanding games
like Need for Speed Most Wanted sure the
phone gets warm after some time and
battery life takes a huge hit but that's
the price you have to pay for running
console quality like games on your smart
phone software however it's something
that we don't necessarily need to
complain about and we don't want to but
we have to mention that it will appeal
to some of you while others will prefer
to install CyanogenMod as soon as it
becomes available for the fine 7 the UI
is definitely not ugly and cluttered but
it is different the phone runs OPOs own
color OS based on Android 4.3 and while
the manufacturer is doing a great job at
releasing bug fix updates we have to
call out the fact that it's still
running an older version of Android
namely 4.3 a major complaint that we
have not necessarily in practice but in
theory and on paper is the three
gigabytes gap for installing
applications on the phone
while most of you will not use the
storage available in the partition we
wonder why it is there in the first
place
so we've reached out to Oppo and this is
what they had to share our engineers
have already realized this problem and
came up with a solution but
unfortunately it would involve a
thorough data backup on the user's and
as the fix would wipe all data on the
device for the sake of the safety of
their personal data we decided not to go
with it but our next device won't be
partitioned as the fine 7 we're pretty
sure those who would like this
shortcoming to go away would be totally
fine with backing up their data for the
time being this is what we have and this
is what we have to deal with definitely
a - oboe take note back to the user
interface it is packed with many
features many of which you will probably
never use gestures are a big deal for up
Oh apparently and you can add your own
custom gestures to the list if you want
to launch an app or instruct the phone
to do a specific task some of these are
system-wide some are available while the
screen is off 9 home screens are
available for you and your widgets to
which you can add to so-called spaces
one for pictures and one for music you
can of course disable these as we did on
our own review unit if you don't like
the looks of the device out of the box
you can opt for a standard stock Android
theme that comes pre-installed or you
can download one of the many themes
available online and short you can
change everything about the UI how it
looks and how it feels however you have
to get used to the customize
notification tray with no easy way of
tweaking it as well as the settings menu
which is divided into three categories
but that's something other OEMs also do
like Samsung or LG to name a couple
pulling down from the top left of the
display brings up the gesture panel but
if you don't use any gestures he can
disable them and the standard
notification tray will pop up just like
when swiping down from anywhere to the
right of the carrier name then there are
the hidden quirks like the no easy way
of linking contacts that are not
identically named in the contacts
application which are small annoyances
you need to live with battery life is
good as good or as bad as any other
phone on the market you can go an entire
day with a full charge or you
can deplete the battery quickly by
abusive usage of gaming or the camera it
is really up to your own usage scenario
but we can't help but praise Oppo for
its V double OC rapid charging which
quickly tops up your battery in a matter
of a couple of hours emergency charge
can bring you 75% of battery charge in
30 minutes
that is something would like to see on
other phones as standard the multi media
centric among you will love this phone
we're not saying it's an HTC boomsound
killer but the backfiring stereo
speakers are right there on par with the
ones on the HTC m8 actually if you flip
the m8 to the back or to find seven to
the front the Oppo phone sounds better
but as we have to define while using it
the way the phone was intended to we'll
just say this is the best sounding phone
together with the m8 on the top of our
speaker audio list
the camera doesn't disappoint either the
backlit Sony Exmor sensor does a great
job in both indoors and outdoors
scenarios if only it had Hardware
optical image stabilization it would be
comparable with the exceptional shooter
on the Xperia z2 but you'll have to at
times
keep it real steady or prop it up
against the study surface to keep things
in focus and a super zoom feature of
producing 50 megapixel images with the
13 megapixel shooter is definitely
something you want to opt for and
circumstances in which detail is
important oh and it also outputs RAW
images as well for those of you who want
both shooting units is it the best
camera out there
no is it better than most of the phones
yes
is it on par with other flagships
definitely signal strength is good
stable with the phone hanging on to
every bit of network signal it can and
data connectivity is also solid actually
your internet speeds might be the only
bottleneck for performance Koh quality
is good and those we've talked to you
not only sounded good both on earpiece
and on the powerful speakers but
reported that we sounded good as well
overall the fine 7 is an impressive
phone the display is gorgeous the
performance is fluid and snappy
multimedia is a joy couple that with the
rapid charge feature futuristic LED
notification good camera quality
exceptional building materials and you
have yourself a great and treat on your
top 5 phones to get right now list that
being said the fine 7 and the find 7a
for that matter are the phones which
turn elbow into a real player on the
market now it is up to the company to
not disappoint current and future owners
with timely updates and support we would
definitely consider to find seven as a
viable option for our main phone for
2014 folks if you want to know more

smartphone tablet or wearable on the

well as all the usual social media
