when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappeared
I'm sure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device after a couple of weeks after
release and when it's not shiny and new
anymore I'm high memory matter with
pocketnow.com
this is the iPhone 5 this is episode 8
up after the buzz
I remember my first impression of the
iPhone 5 after Apple announced it
I remember feeling that Apple had made a
big mistake in not following other
smartphone trends yes it had a bigger
screen but a lot of the elements of the
design just didn't seem good enough in
comparison to other devices in the
market now I also remember how much of
an eye-opener it was to actually hold
the device for the first time see videos
and photos really don't do this phone
any justice it's when you hold it and
feel it that you understand the genius
behind the design the aluminum finish
the shiny chamfered edges and it's
lightweight all contribute to making
this device aesthetically beautiful and
also provide a great feel in the hand
for one-handed usability now reviewing
an iPhone 5 after the buzz is difficult
the Mini is full of all types of
complaints ranging from scuffed gate
scratch gate you name it now I've had my
iPhone 5 since launch date I have never
used the case and it has no scratches no
scuffs or any signs of wear I guess that
like with any phone it's designed to be
used and not dropped if dropping phones
is common to you buy a case and if
you're like many of us who simply don't
drop our phones I can confirm that after
a month of normal usage the device holds
up well just take my word for it though
and by the WYD model it retains the
natural color of aluminum's and
therefore your possibilities of
scratching and diminish my only real
complaint with the hardware is that even
though the display has better color
accuracy than previous models is not as
sensitive if this is your first iPhone
you won't notice a problem if you come
from any other device though you'll
notice that it's not as buttery smooth
as its predecessors in terms of screen
sensitivity software is a different
story though there's a mix back of good
and bad on the good side iOS is simply
unbeatable when it comes to apps even
though the screen on the iPhone 5 is
longer than some of the apps still have
black bars developers are porting them
to the iPhone 5 rather quickly now it's
not just the number of apps but their
quality even when comparing them to
certain Android counterparts shows
better quality and design in most cases
of their iOS variants now that said most
application developers have not made
substantial differences when upgrading
their applications to the iPhone 5 all
they did was stretch
though that's not a big deal where the
knife on five is shine when compared to
both its predecessors and even the
hottest of competition is speed the a6
processor is a real screamer it handles
everything that you throw at it with
ease and I have yet to experience lag in
anything that I do with the device the
extra screen real estate is quite useful
when it comes to games but I admit that
the device does heat up a bit when
playing games and also using the device
and cellular data I guess my biggest
complaint with iowa's is that it's still
iOS you know Steve Jobs said that the
original iPhone had software that was at
least five years ahead of its time the
problem is those five years ended with
the old iPhone for us it's not that I'd
prefer a laggy UI full of widgets but
Apple should at least figure out a way
to animate the icons in order to avoid
the need to jump from application to
application every time overall though
after my satisfaction with the hardware
in born with the UI I'll admit that my
experience with the device is quite
positive it's like a blend between
futuristic design match with a UI that
we already know the camera is also still
one of the iPhones features that's hard
to beat great photos during the day but
what strikes me the most with the device
is how well it takes photos during the
night with the flash it now matches my
old Sony cyber-shot in almost every case
at times when competing devices already
playing with optical image stabilization
to match the SLR performance and not
really getting it right the iPhone 5
reaches its goal of being a good point
and shoot substitute the same goes for
video where colors are accurate and if
you were to compare this resulting video
to consumer camcorders the iPhones all
you'll need battery life is a mixed bag
ironically I found the phone to perform
better over lt than on HSPA+ either way
the device will get you through the day
but don't expect the second day on the
same charge speed of data matching LTE
and HSPA+ on this device with the speed
of the a6 processor is a winning combo
whether you're uploading photos or
simply navigating on a website there is
no way to complain here that the vice
handles everything in a speedy manner
another advantage I find than using an
iPhone is the added benefit of being in
the Apple ecosystem iPads are currently
the mainstream and most of the apps that
you buy on the earth
we'll give you an iPad version included
iCloud also makes the experience better
you buy an app a song or a book on the
phone and it syncs everywhere you take a
photo here and you see it they're having
the phone made by Apple and it's havel
it made by Apple provides added benefits
that you won't get if you buy a nexus 4
and the Nexus 7 for example and then
there are some little things the speaker
is one of the loudest on any smartphone
and it doesn't distort even at maximum
volumes FaceTime looks better now with a
better front facing camera and a higher
resolution image and finally the iPhone
feels much more like a phone when you
hold it to your face now the increase in
height makes it feel more like a phone
than ever before
so bottom line what I still recommend
that you buy an iPhone 5 after a full
month of usage the answer is absolutely
the phone surely doesn't cater to the
hacking and tweaking power users there's
Android for that and my top pick there
would be the galaxy s3 but when it comes
to the power users that need a tool with
the best apps that serve their needs
this is the phone for you the overall
package will save you the need to buy a
point and shoot a camcorder and even a
game console add to that the fact that
you'll be carrying one of the most
beautifully designed smartphones of the
year and it's really hard to lose this
