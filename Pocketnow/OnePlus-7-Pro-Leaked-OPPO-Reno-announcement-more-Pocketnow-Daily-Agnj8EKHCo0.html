three one plus seven variants in the
first half of 2019 the Opel Reno is now
official and all we can say is that the
leaks were kind of accurate and we get
the teaser of the Lenovo phone with a
hundred megapixel images I'm Jaime
Rivera and yeah I'm about to leave San
Francisco sadly it's been fantastic
this is parking out daily the official
loose today begin with deals those of
you in the market for an Apple watch
Series three again the composite back is
one of the things that I do not
recommend but still it's currently on
sale at Amazon 229 and you can actually
get an extra band for like five bucks
so again if you're in the market you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about the samsung galaxy a8 II that
was just announced I mean yesterday we
covered the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730
processor this is pretty much the first
phone with it and what makes it really
cool is that you don't just have a
slider you also have a swivel camera
which the last time that I saw that was
with the Oppo and three I believe that
was a long time ago so much so that I
don't remember but specification look
really decent for a premium mid-range
err and the fact that you can just use
the primary camera to serve for
everything else is actually kind of cool
hopefully we get one in the labs for
review now let's move the spotlight over
to Lenovo as the company just teased
something to happen on April 26 we're
assuming that this is some flack show
that the company is bringing and they
are teasing hyper video with all the
high-level specifications we even here
something like the hundred megapixel
photos that could just be the case of
something being stitched together
whatever the case may be stay tuned
obviously we will be covering it now
let's talk about the Oppo Reno which
just became official the leaks and
everything that was shown off was pretty
much confirmed and we have two variants
if I understood this correctly one of
them with the clock upset during a 55
the other with the 710 and obviously of
depending on whichever variant you pick
you have various specifications
including that 10x zoom that the company
is providing with that periscopic
technology that we had seen pretty much
at MWC obviously I can't wait to tell
you more as soon as we get one for
review I'll keep you posted so far it
looks like a really good phone in the
price tag doesn't seem too
crazy you can learn more in the
description and finally the hottest news
today I have to do with the 1 plus 7 and
that's an S at the end because
apparently there are going to be up to
three variants of the phone there are
some leaked images of a device where
it's all display no bezels and
apparently this is the one +7 Pro which
we're assuming to have that I don't know
pop-up camera in addition to the triple
cameras at the back 48 16 and 8
megapixel resolutions but we're already
wondering what the regular 1 plus 7 is
going to be then because this one has
all the Flex of certifications could it
be that the company is working on two
different designs and probably not
providing the T variant later this year
because we hear that there are up to
three where one of these devices is
going to be the 5g variant in today's
question let us know I mean what do you
think one plus seven pro with great
specifications pop-up camera and
everything
do you like what you see or not because
in my case I like what I see I just hope
that the camera is just as great as the
leaks that we've seen that's just me
