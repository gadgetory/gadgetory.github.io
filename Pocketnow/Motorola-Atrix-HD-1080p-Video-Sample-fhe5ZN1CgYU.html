common we're testing the 1080p video
capabilities of the motorola atrix HD
not the best camera in the world sadly
it tends to over saturate colors at
times are at times it becomes a little
blooming and it's a gloomy day here in
some fair though not the best time to
film but for some reason I don't know in
the screen everything looks quite clear
but then when you take them to the
computer doesn't look that good and oh
here are my two crazies and they know
what they want they live their cookies
so the one on the left is diva which is
at stiva and this is Luna they love
their cookies notice the colors for some
reason again it does a good job at times
it doesn't do a good job at times not
really i don't think i can recommend the
camera much but recommends video quite
well you can actually take stills while
filming videos but it doesn't do a good
job at all and i believe it doesn't
really take a full resolution photo
doesn't take advantage of the 8
megapixel camera it just takes it still
of what it's doing with the 1080p video
which is probably not the best result
ever but again this is hien better be
better from pocketnow.com have any
questions leave us a comment down below
and thanks for watching and i think they
lost her cookie we have to get him
another one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
