but on the inside they couldn't be more
different both our first attempts though
the Nexus 7 is Google's first attempt at
a Nexus tablet and guess whose phone pad
is the company's first attempt at a
tablet with an earpiece I'm Anton Dina
this is PocketNow and you're watching
the issues fonepad versus Google Nexus 7
video let's check it out the Nexus 7 is
soon going to turn one year old and the
follow-up is just around the corner or
it should be judging by the usual Google
release cycle and common sense
however the assessment Google tablet is
still a great solution for those looking
for a solid build decent performance and
an excellent price the phone pad is made
by the same company as soos it was
introduced at this year's MWC and has
two main selling points the lexington
platform powering it through an Intel
Atom z24 20 processor and the earpiece
on top which is a great addition for
those who don't want to carry a phone
and a tablet as well as for those that
don't want to talk on their tablets
using the speakerphone or Bluetooth
accessory options now let's compare
these two otherwise almost twins we'll
take a look at hardware performance and
user experience talking about hardware
the Nexus 7 has an 800 by 1280
resolution on a 7 inch form factor
resulting in a pixel density rating of
216 PPI and ernie 'the the hood there's
a quad core NVIDIA Tegra 3 CPU running
at 1.2 gigahertz long ago Fram 16 or 32
gigabytes of internal storage 1.2
megapixel webcam plus all the usual
suspects you would expect the phone pad
has so much in common with the Nexus 7
beyond its appearance we have the same
7-inch screen
with 800 by 1280 resolution and 2 16 ppi
120 megapixel webcam
no rear shooter even though select
markets get a three point one megapixel
piece and the same usual suspects the
difference is that the phone pad is
powered by an Intel Atom z24 20
processor which while still clocked at
1.2 gigahertz
has only a single core however the phone
pad has a physical earpiece up top so
that you can take or make calls just
like you would with a regular smartphone
yes
a 7-inch one while the Nexus 7 also has
cellular versions sharing its radio
almost entirely with the phone pad it
lacks the earpiece the Google tablet
might have higher capacity storage
options but it lacks the ability for an
expansion via microSD something which
the phone pad offers underneath the rear
top detachable cover the battery on the
Nexus 7 also happens to be larger than
the one on the felt bed 4325 milliamp
hours versus 40 to 70 million bars build
quality on both devices is solid still
the phone pad has an aluminium back
versus the plastic cover on the Nexus 7
which makes us believe it is kind of
indestructible you can tell us it and
throw it to your heart's content
well the foam pads aluminum back will
probably make you think twice before
even throwing it on counter tops in
terms of size we can definitely say that
these two are identical give or take a
couple of millimeters where the phone
pad is taller thickness as well as
weight is exactly the same at 10.45
millimeters and 340 grams let's check
out performance first things first
though it takes the Nexus 7 42 seconds
to boot up the phone pad beats that by 5
seconds for a 37 second boot up time for
everything else keep this in mind we're
comparing quad core versus single core
here given that until heavily calls out
the Android optimization on its Atom
processor and they to the usage you'll
find the Nexus 7 to be faster in some
cases while the bad phone will finish
tasks quicker and others still if
milliseconds matter to you yes the Nexus
7 is often times a hair faster when
launching applications like Facebook
Twitter Google Plus 4 squared email
calendar Spotify or Chrome where the
Nexus 7 outshines the film bad is web
browsing using Chrome on both the phone
that lags behind and page load times
with anywhere between 1 and 3 seconds
scrolling is smoother and text rendering
is also fast
the Nexus 7 however if you don't use
Chrome on the phone bed but it's
alternative browser the face off is
pretty pretty level with some pages
loading faster on the phone pad and
others on the Nexus 7 taking a look at
screens these two tablets use the same
display technology and specifications on
paper but real-life usage concludes that
this round goes to the Nexus 7 which is
in itself pretty bad because the Nexus 7
has a poor display beyond the low
resolution on both tablets you will see
less contrast and shallow blacks on the
phone pad than on the Nexus 7 the Google
tablet also generates cooler display
temperatures than the phone pad however
asus has bundled a neat utility called
the soos splendid where you can tweak
color temperature hue/saturation and
turn vivid mode on and off basically
allowing you to have the best experience
tailored to your eyes and liking
brightness wise they're equal and
outdoor visibility is exactly the same
Margaret in terms of software and user
experience the Nexus 7 will appeal to
those who like a stock vanilla Android
experience there's also something else
tipping the scales in the Nexus 7's
favor it runs the latest Android version
namely 4.2.2 the thumb pad is powered by
Android 4.1.2 and the soos has made some
customizations to it some lighter some
heavier like the notification tray
custom keyboard both of which can be
disabled for a more stark experience the
soos has also added additional widgets
to the phone pad some of which are
useful some of which you'll probably
never use more on those in our upcoming
full review of the Asuza phone bed
overall if you need a tablet which is
easy to carry around but you'll only
need it for basic tablet operation the
Nexus 7 is still a great choice however
if you want to leave your phone at home
and you don't mind taking goals on your
7-inch herb holding it up to your ear
the phone pad is a solid option but you
might also want to take a look at a what
the competition has to offer and be how
deep your pockets are and we're not
talking about
they can accommodate a 7-inch phone or
not that's gonna do it for today
make sure to follow PocketNow and our
youtube channel for more coverage of the
zoo's fonepad including the upcoming
full review follow PocketNow on all the
usual social media channels and you can

been on Sandy nod thank you very much
