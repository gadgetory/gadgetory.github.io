with foldable displays very soon
Huawei's latest on our smartphone now
builds on bringing AI to more than just
voice and super mario run is enjoying
your data more than you are it seems I'm
hi Mary vetta and as of tomorrow I will
be a year older and I'm not even sure if
I should celebrate or not this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market for the new Moto z I would
highly suggest you look at amazon right
now the 64 gigabyte variant is available
for 499 and it's hard for us to say that
this is the best smartphone of the year
sadly not but it is a good deal for
those of you looking for modularity
other interesting official news have to
do with huawei and its brand to honor
the company is really making honor its
own thing up to the point where you
don't see huawei anywhere we have the
new honor magic and this phone is
special because artificial intelligence
is focused most on the user interface
and not necessarily on voice meaning it
can detect what you're doing and offer a
flashlight for example if it detects
that you're in the darker stuff like
that there are a couple of features that
it has that are uniquely you can learn
more in the link in the description I'm
just concerned of two things number one
that it's only available in China right
now and number two the fact that these
things were gimmicks for samsung phones
years ago let's be and speaking of
Samsung those of you that are still
rocking the galaxy note 7 the last
carrier in the United States that should
do something about it just confirmed
between january fifth and the eighth the
galaxy note 7 will not be working
anymore on Verizon Sprint AT&amp;amp;T you name
it and I praised what carriers you're
doing this is the smartest way to just
put the phone out of the market those of
you that are keeping it could pretty
much use it as a collectible or go swap
it for a phone that works now let's talk
about everybody's current favorite game
super mario run or at least we assume as
it seems that it does enjoy data a lot
at first i thought it was a local game
but no its internet based and the
problem is that it consumes between 40
to 60 gigabytes of data an hour meaning
if you play two or three hours you could
consume five gigs of data in 15 days or
less that is pretty crazy a lot more
than pokemon go but apparently it's only
going to happen temporarily why because
the game struggles to connect to
Nintendo's
servers so let's see how long that lasts
and finally very interesting news today
have to do with LG foldable displays at
a ton of OEM starting with Apple
Microsoft and Google LG is reportedly
going to be the support for foldable
OLED displays for these companies in
2018 meaning that for those of us that
are still wondering exactly what you
could do the foldable display apparently
2018 is going to be the time when we're
going to see this in mass production so
it leads me to the question of the day
what products do you think should bring
foldable displays in the future in my
case I would probably say tablets and if
they bring that hinge from the Microsoft
Surface book that would be awesome but
in any other way I don't see a use for
it in smartphones for example but leave
us a comment down below I'd love to see
what you could come up with friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the video was
filmed follow us on pocketnow.com and

more videos like this one you can also
follow me on Twitter hi mounters water
