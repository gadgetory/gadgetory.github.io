the flow or are you more of a contrarian
it's more than amateur psychology it
just might play a big role in which of
these smartphones you prefer on today's
comparison it's more than just LG vs.
Samsung its outdoor versus indoor
utility versus beauty function versus
form galaxy s5 versus LG g3 these
smartphones say so much before you even
pick them up not to get all phone
whispery on you but you just need to
look at them to see what they're saying
the Samsung product is familiar
congenial safe even if you don't follow
gadgets you've seen this phone before
because it's everywhere now look at what
LG is doing the arced curved that gives
the body the sense of an airfoil
the volume and power Keys placed beneath
the camera they almost edge-to-edge
display if the galaxy s5 is the sturdy
and reliable family sedan the g3 is your
friend's impish import you take out when
you're looking for trouble but if you
find that trouble you might rather have
the samsung phone with you
the Galaxy s5s stippled matte finish
definitely takes a beating better than
LG's faux metal semi-gloss and the
Samsung product is also rated for
immersion in water in case things get
nautical it manages all this despite
being thinner and lighter than the LG
phone and it also packs a bevy of active
accessories for the healthy eating crowd
the Galaxy s5 is the phone you take with
you on adventures into the wilderness
case or no case the g3 is the phone you
show off at the office water cooler and
when you're doing so be sure to point
out the quad HD display and you'll have
to point it out yes it's a much higher
resolution than the galaxies but it's
almost impossible for a normal person to
tell the difference and Samsung's much
brighter panel is more useful out in the
daylight again function versus form
dive into those screens for a bit and
get to know the ins and outs of the
Android skins here and you'll find more
similarity than you might expect sure
there's a gap in style LG uses a more
subdued palette and it's also further
along in the flat minimalistic thinking
that dominates modern software but these
are both very elaborate skins with a lot
bolted on to the stock Android
experience where Samsung excels is in
multitasking it's task switcher is easy
to read and use compared with LG which
gives you a choice between overcrowded
and space wasting and Samsung's multi
window supports more apps and offers
more interaction between those apps than
LG's similar dual window function if you
need to do more than one thing at once
on your smartphone screen Samsung's been
the go-to choice for a while and it's no
different here where LG pulls ahead is
in the thoughtful utility it's built
into the smartphone experience we've
said it before but a customizable home
Kiro is something everyone should be
doing the ability to drop the
notification shade with a tap or launch
dual window with the single touch it's
just awesome also using a tap to wake up
the screen or to put it to sleep feels
much more modern than mashing a physical
button and even LG's qslide apps come in
handy now and then the Galaxy s5s camera
edges out the g3 s in resolution but LG
makes up for it with optical image
stabilization which lends it a much
smoother viewfinder experience and a
laser for faster focus there's kind of
an inversion of the Greater software
trends when it comes to the cameras here
it's Samsung that offers more options so
many that you're almost overloaded with
them while LG's viewfinder is so Spartan
you're left wanting much more neither
extreme is ideal but on features they're
roughly the same each offers HDR each
offers dual shot and each offers
selective focus after captured
side-by-side photos look awfully similar
in most conditions with a slight edge in
color and clarity on the Samsung device
bright daylight results in really nice
captures but neither of these is any
good really in low-light without the
flash no matter what stabilization
settings are used indoor video results
are comparable and pretty noisy in 1080p
with the Samsung device having a bit
more trouble staying in focus
outdoors there's not much difference
either with the LG product being just
slightly smoother in handheld mode
thanks to its OIS there's a much bigger
difference in audio which in this
comparison sounds muddy on the Samsung
phone compared to the much clearer
capture on the g3 this is my booth and
it's the survival Bluetooth well we are
doing way ponds and tools for survival
in the helter-skelter world of today our
g3 review unit is a South Korean model
being tested in the US so some of our
comparison notes like endurance will
have to wait until we get an American
review unit what's not changing anytime
soon though is the fact that each of
these phones runs the latest processor
powered by a removable battery and
backed up by an expansion slot that can
carry a crazy amount of media the g3
runs hotter than the s5 but each device
performs very well at even the most
demanding gaming and browsing it's not
out of the ordinary to see the
occasional hiccup in software these are
still heavy skins after all and in LG's
case there's an awful lot of pixels
being pushed but typically these are
very fluid devices and throughput on
att's LTE network and Greater Boston is
as usual quite speedy last but not least
acoustics put them to your ear and the
parody continues on AT&amp;amp;T callers sound
the same to us and they say we sound the
same to them that goes for sound quality
over speakerphone - at least on their
side on ours the speaker
is more muffled on the Samsung device
but they're both pretty loud even if
they are rear firing loudspeakers
there's a lot of common ground here
which comes as little surprise in this
age of ever-increasing uniformity across
high-end smartphones the real difference
lies in the hardware not in specs but in
build and in what kind of user you are
if you're an active person apathetic
about style and hard on your possessions
if you think of your smartphone more as
a tool than an accessory the Galaxy s5
was made for you if on the other hand
you're gentle with your gadgets and
you've got an eye for detail and an
appreciation for good design the g3 will
be a better fit for your fancy pocket
there's so much more to know about each
of these phones and fortunately we've
got a full review of each one linked in
the description below also down there a

please avail yourself of both if you
enjoyed this video and most importantly
thanks for joining us I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow we'll see on the next one
Galaxy s5
vs. LG g3 levels
face the right direction where is the
coffee I look like some animal exploded
on my head
