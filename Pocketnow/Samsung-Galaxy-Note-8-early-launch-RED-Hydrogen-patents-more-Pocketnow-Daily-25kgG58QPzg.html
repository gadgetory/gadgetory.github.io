will see an early launch yet again ends
of the red hydrogen show is that a very
ambitious design for modularity we get
the first credible renders of what to
expect for the lgbtq clarity I'm Jaime
believe it and let's just celebrate the
fact that we're pretty much three to
four days away from Friday
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals those of you
in the market to buy anything obviously
today is prime day and it is crazy there
are cases where for example the Amazon
echo is currently 50% off there's also
this bundle for the Samsung Galaxy S a
where you get the gear VR in addition to
the controller and a couple of other
things for around $625 Prime Day is
crazy I am actually staying away from
the website right now but leave us a
comment down below let us know if you
got yourself something now let's talk
about louis vuitton and that is not a
brand that I would ever mention on the
bargain out daily except for the fact
they've just launched the most expensive
and least functional Android wear
SmartWatch in the market why because
you're paying twenty four hundred and
fifty dollars for watch that doesn't
have GPS it doesn't have NFC it pretty
much doesn't even have a heart rate
sensor it's just the luxurious version
of Android wear that cost an insane
amount of money and if you want to add
accessories to it that's actually an
extra four hundred fifty dollars
depending on whatever case you're
looking for it is horribly expensive and
yet to spend your money somewhere else
seriously I'm sure it'll be very famous
in Hollywood now let's talk about the LG
b 30 we're expecting something sometime
within august
obviously the Galaxy Note 8 is another
one of those devices that will be
launched in that time frame but the V 30
is one of those devices that I'm
particularly waiting for I'm a big fan
of LG and what they're doing
particularly after the g6 even though
the phone is not selling well and we
noticed in a couple of linked renders on
video that it's got two dual cameras it
pretty much looks like a g6 in almost
every way except that it's apparently
going to be a more powerful phone and we
know that the b20 was a lot more
powerful in the g5 for example in the
same case with the v10 and the g4 so
let's see exactly what LG brings to the
market particularly if we're going to
lose features like a removable
battery etc now let's talk about the red
hydrogen one that smartphone that cost
an insane amount of money we've seen the
only photograph that red posted about
this phone but that we found patents and
these patents actually show is that this
phone is going to be a lot more than
just the phone it seems that red
envisions this to be a fully modular
platform and we knew about the
modularity because of the pins and
everything but it's crazy I mean if you
look at the patterns you can pretty much
build a full-blown camera with this
thing obviously we can't wait to hear
more about its specifications because it
will be powerful or it needs to be crazy
powerful to be able to provide all the
juice that's needed for all these
modules let's see exactly what we get
over time and finally the very
interesting and controversial news that
I have to do with the Galaxy Note 8
mainly because from trusted sources we
hear that Samsung might be wanting to
rush this film to market just like it
rushed the Galaxy Note 7 at the time
that it wanted to launch early to be
able to already be on sale before the
iPhone 7 plus we know exactly how that
went for Samsung Sampson committed to
that never happening again but it turns
out that apparently we should expect a
possible announcement late August a
possible launch in mid-september up to
the point where we usually hear about
the next iPhones in early September so
it seems that Samsung wants to gear up
for that but it leads me to the question
of the day I mean do you really think
that Samsung needs to do this do you
think that they need to launch the phone
early to compete against Apple because
in my case I feel that Apple already has
its fan base I mean I don't think that
Samsung should worry about Apple biting
into their market share mainly because
the Samsung Galaxy s8 has been a success
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the video was
filmed
