pocketnow.com
and in this video we're gonna continue
our look at the Apple Newton message pad
2100 if you remember the 2100 is the
last Apple Newton that ever came out
that was in this form factor and of
course Apple Newton was the first mobile
device that Apple ever came out with and
it certainly set the pace for the mobile
devices that we use today so it's really
interesting to take a look at this old
device and see how far we've come and
and kind of the technology that this
brought to the table so in this video
I'm gonna take a look at the hardware of
the device and kind of give you a tour
of of the exterior at least and then the
next video we're going to go over the
software here in the front says message
pad 2100 with the old-school Apple logo
with the kind of multicolored rainbow
thing here
I don't know if this is anything here it
could be a microphone but I'll have to
look into that it's probably a
microphone comb over to the side we've
not much on the side here except for a
power button if you flip it one time
it'll turn on the device if you hold it
down it will turn on the backlight and
the backlight on this thing is
horrendous but at least it's still work
so I can show it to you in the in the
next video if we go over to the top we
have some interesting things to talk
about here we have a stylus silo and
because the Apple Newton has such a
large screen it requires a very large
stylus and the stylus that came with
this particular unit definitely isn't
the original it says nabisco on it
probably came in a cereal box or
something and it doesn't really fit very
well inside of the stylus silo it's not
supposed to hang out like that I'm sure
it's supposed to click in and click out
something that's really interesting is
that it has a built-in stylus holder
imagine that it's a really natural way
to interact with your device if you can
just kind of pick up the stylus and
start writing on the pad so that's a
really interesting addition that I
discovered just yesterday and it folds
right back into place here on the center
we have a flap that reveals the
connector for the computer and this is
uses serial connection so I can't
connect this to my computer most people
can't because they don't have a serial
connection here's for the AC power
adapter to charge the batteries if
you're using rechargeable batteries that
is or to run it off of wall power if you
don't have batteries with you here's an
IR D a port here
we have a little bit of wear and tear of
course it's an 11 year old device over
to the side here we have two PCMCIA
slots and the first one is empty it just
has a dummy card in here and I should
mention that you can use a lot of
different PCMCIA ace cards with this
device you can use modems and network
cards and wireless cards there are even
Wi-Fi drivers that have come out through
various user groups that are online
right now for the Apple Newton and over
here we have actually some flash memory
guess how much flash memory here I'll
turn it over how much do you think how
much flash memory you think they fit on
here it sounds like it just turned on
well I'll tell you 4 megabytes yeah 4
megabytes on this massive piece of
plastic and it's incredible because
today we have micro sd right so you can
fit 16 thousand megabytes or around 16
gigabytes on this little fingernail
sized chip whereas it took you know
something this big to carry 4 megabytes
8 megabytes 16 megabytes and it probably
didn't even go up to that high of a
capacity but out of the box the Newton
comes with or the at least this model
the 2100 comes with this this expansion
over here on the side is the battery and
unfortunately the piece broke off this
afternoon when I was playing with it so
in order to get the battery out now I
kind of have to you know shake it a
little bit and once you get when you
take the battery out it's kind of this
this case for batteries so right now
there are rechargeable batteries in here
you probably can't read that but you can
use plain old double-a batteries if you
prefer to do that so let me slide this
back in and continue on the tour on the
bottom there's nothing but I think this
notch is probably for some sort of dock
that's sold with the Apple Newton if we
flip over to the back we have nothing
much except for these tabs and I'll show
you what they're for in a second and we
have some rubber feet so that when you
place it on a table they kind of stay is
solid and it doesn't move around that
much let me show you the top here we
have the Newton Technology logo and we
have a speaker there's a lot of sound
that goes on on this device you'll see
that once I start to use it so let me
show you the screen to open the screen
protector you slide this to the right
and I think the screen protector works
quite well
because this 11-year old screen is in
fantastic shape I don't see many
scratches of course the user may not or
the previous owner may have not use this
device that much but even so this is a
really good protective mechanism for
this large 6.1 inch screen and I'd like
to mention that the resolution of this
is actually the same as the Apple iPhone
but of course this only displays 16
shades of black so it's quite quite
different story so we have 320 across
and 480 down it's a pixel density of
about 100 and we can remove this flap or
this cover just by flicking up this
little lever here and it slides right
off and when you do that it kind of
leaves this uneven look to the device
and I don't think you'd want to carry it
around like this so let's snap it back
in place and I mentioned the grooves in
the back and what that allows you to do
is wrap it around to the back and snap
it in place and it doesn't affect how
the device arrests on a table because it
stalls a little bit of clearance because
of these legs so it still stays kind of
firm and steady and that's pretty much
it for the hardware on the Apple Newton
message pad 2100 in the next video we're
going to take a look at the software on
the device all the included programs how
the operating system actually works it's
taken me a long time to figure out how
to use it I'll be honest but once you
learn it there are so many little things
that makes the Apple Newton just a
brilliant device so intuitive to work
with so more on the Apple Newton coming
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
