pocket now calm and this is part two of
the video review of the samsung SGH I
620 also known as the Black Jack slider
to start I want to talk about the six
heat sensitive buttons on the front of
the phone I found the sensitivity of
them to be pretty good it requires a
light press to activate them but not so
light to where you may accidentally
press a button so i really like them how
about this rotary scroll wheel in the
front I think we're going to see this a
lot on samsung devices in the future
it's going to be on the black check to
that comes out on the 18 teen network it
makes a lot of sense because if you're
right-handed and the scroll wheels on
the left then you're kind of out of luck
let me show you how fast it Scrolls I'm
going to go into contacts I'm going to
come up close here and I'm going to use
my thumb to scroll down it's a pretty
fast scroll and if I go really fast I
get a ipod like letter chooser though I
wish it would come up sooner because if
I'm at the elves and I want to get all
the way to the arse I have to scroll
pretty fast to get that letter chooser
to come up there it is and there are the
arse so it would be nice if you could
adjust the sensitivity of the scroll
wheel or have the letter choose or come
up sooner somehow perhaps immediately or
by pressing a button I'm going to make a
call i want to show you something that
bothers me when you make a call so look
at that neat animation i like that
little touch from samsung so if i make a
call the buttons automatically luck so
if i want to turn on the speaker phone i
have to unlock the keypad and to do that
I flipped the device over to the back I
press the unlock button and now I can
turn on the speaker phone now the
buttons will walk again so after again
go to the back I'm not the keypad and
turn off the speakerphone not to end the
call again I would have to unlock the
keypad or I can open the slider which
unlocks the keypad and then close it
again and then that's call ended I wish
there was a delay and when when the
keypad would lock because it's not very
convenient to have to constantly turn
the phone over and press the unlock
button if you want to you know turn on
speakerphone or look up another contact
or something like that now this phone
is made for Europe specifically Britain
and you can tell because if you look at
the H key here know if you can see that
it's a british pounds symbol not
american dollars or or euros or anything
like that this was made for the vodafone
network i know that because out of the
box the internet settings are set for
vodafone so i had to go in there and
change the settings to AT&amp;amp;T and
unfortunately this is a tri-band phone
which is not a problem if you if you
live in europe but if you live in the
u.s. there are still a lot of networks
that use the 850 band and this phone
doesn't work on the 850 band there are
some places around my house that I've
tested this that has 3g usually like I
can get it on my blackjack but because
this doesn't have the 850 band it
defaults back to GPRS and GPRS is a
paltry 15k so if I want a phone that has
3g unfortunately the blackjack slider
the I 620 isn't the phone that I'm going
to carry on a daily basis but perhaps if
you live in the u.s. depending on your
carrier depending on where you are the
tribe and is not a problem now in the
next review we're going to go over
software see what's included on this
until then it's part two of the video
review of the blackjack slider see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
