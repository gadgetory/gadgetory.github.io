today I've got an unboxing and first
look at the HTC Desire s courtesy of our
good friends over at Negri electronics
let's go ahead and unbox this thing see
what we've got
so first let's do a walk-around of the
box this is of course an HTC device it
is HTC branded and it has the HTC Sense
UI it's very understated with the the
nice HTC sketches that they have on the
side which kind of gives the feeling
that it's all just a little bit more for
the average ordinary guy now there's all
kinds of words and whatnot on the sides
of the box just doing kind of a walk
around for you here on the back it's got
all the specifications and whatnot but
that's really not what you're interested
in so let's go ahead and crack it open
and see what's inside alright so this
box is a slide off the top just like
that now inside we've got the device a
nice little pull tab here we'll look at
the phone in quite a bit more detail in
just a minute
lift up I like that that's a kind of a
molded box instead of just a cutout
holder so that's something I haven't
seen before it looks really nice a
couple HTC Void stickers that they give
you for I don't know why gade gade gade
gade manual information warranty
statement and contact us alright there's
the paperwork put that off to the side
down from there we've got some
headphones that looked like they
probably double as a headset as well
it's got the traditional headphone jack
in there not the the old-fashioned HTC
mini USB connector it's got a nice
lanyard clip so if you've had a pair of
HTC headphones before this is just like
them it works really really well they
look really nice stay in your ear well
yeah what else can you say about
headphones
okay next we
got the HTC wall wart this one is a
European phone so it comes with the
European prongs but of course on the
other end it's USB as you can see right
through there and I really don't see why
you know you can see through these bags
they're clear and transparent whatnot so
rather than showing you my ineptitude at
ripping plastic bags apart I thought I'd
just show you through this way but USB
so if you've got an existing USB wall
wart you can just plug in the power
cable there and you should be just fine
of course if you have a USB hub a
powered USB hub you can get away with
having all these wall warts and charge
up all of your USB powered devices that
way with just one wall work to power the
hub takes a little bit longer to charge
your devices that way but if you're
doing an overnight charge there you go
maybe we'll do an Android quick tip of
about that in the future so moving along
we've got also a nice USB cable and this
is that solidus it's just a USB type-a -
somewhere over there's a micro USB there
it is micro USB connector average length
so that's it there is a little pull up
on the bottom of the box but that just
shows you the wraparound I really like
this it's you know it's got a nice
cardboard feel to it it's paper stock
but it's very simplistic in its design
simple and elegant so that's the box
let's move on to the phone now shall we
okay so here's the phone it's got this
nice protective cover over it and it
says important to prevent damage do not
apply excessive pressure to the screen
or device case all is a good idea and
not just for this phone but others also
says please remove the phone from your
trouser pockets before sitting down also
very good we don't want to crack the
screen and for more details you can look
at one of those guides that we just
breezed past so over here on the back
there's a quick four step process and
how to get stuff into and out of the
phone so we'll refer to that in just a
minute
now this is adhesive so we just pulled
this and it's one piece comes off very
slick very clean and in this video we're
just going to do an initial walkthrough
of the device just the hardware we're
not going to actually boot it up or
not will do that in a future video but
first of all I'm noticing you've got a
very nice curve here to the back of the
device on all sides it fits very nice
its kind of squared off on the edges so
round it a little bit and then a nice
square almost a negative in fact I think
that is a negative relief on it which
gives you a little bit of extra grip to
hold on to it I like it it's really not
really heavy but it feels significant in
your hands so very cool there it looks
like we've got a front-facing camera
here the nice big speaker on the top a
little bit of a curve to the glass to
the it's flat glass as far as I can tell
but a nice little curve so it's not just
a square slab sitting on there HTC logo
featured on the top we then of course
have home menu back and search buttons
that are all capacitive buttons down at
the bottom and then we've got this in
kind of unique little chin that we were
introduced to with the the t-mobile g1
and some of the other devices so they've
kind of brought that back a little bit
that little lip for whatever reason
might help it sit a little bit easier in
a dock but let's go ahead and do it
we'll walk around to the device looking
at the bottom we've got a microphone
hole down there over on the other side
this would be the the right side there's
nothing up at the top we've got the
power button and a traditional
multi-purpose headphone jack over on the
other side we've got a volume rocker and
it feels really responsive to me and
then we've got our microUSB port as well
over on the back of the device we've got
a flash it looks like that's an ambient
noise microphone for some noise
cancellation so what I'd bet that that's
going to do for us we've got this camera
and to cheat a little bit and look at
the back of the box that is a see if I
can read it here really fast that's a
five megapixel autofocus camera with of
course the LED flash over here on the
side and we've got another hole over
there and I don't know why we have two
of them and we'll see if we can find out
what that's all about
now down here we've got the HTC logo
just nice
subtle and then down at the bottom with
HTC Sense if this were a Google device
it would say with Google or something to
that effect the g2 for example just has
with Google down at the bottom and you
can kind of see comparison of size
they're about the same height the desire
s is a little bit shorter and then we'll
just go ahead and do a comparison here
between the two so looking at the two
devices from this angle it looks like
the desire s is quite a bit smaller than
the g2 as far as length goes you look at
width a little with comparison here
there's no physical keyboard on the new
phone as compared to the g2 and then of
course we do a comparison with wise
they're almost identical right there so
very cool looking eye very nice very
sleek I like it quite a bit let's crack
this open and see what's inside and the
instructions say we press with our
thumbs right there and just ease this up
gently and it pops up relatively easily
we'll take that off we do have some
contacts back here which don't have any
pass-through so I'm actually looking
down here to see if there's anything
that I can see if there were any
antennas or if that's just for a carry
through and I can't tell right at this
point but I wouldn't be surprised if
there's some kind of an antenna inside
of that so next we have down here those
contacts where they will they make
contact with that we have a little open
prompt here to open this up so we'll go
ahead and do that and this is a little
hinged device opens it up so then we can
get access to the battery the battery of
course ships without the contacts making
contact so there's a little sleeve there
I'm going to set the phone down for just
a moment and let's look at the battery
typical HTC branded battery very slim
very nice looking if we get into it and
I've got a read here off camera a little
bit 1450 milliamp hours so really not
bad that's a pretty good size
battery of course you've got your
moisture indicator right there as well
but let's take a look inside the
compartment see down in there there's
not all that much here's where your sim
goes let's go ahead and do that now this
is a t-mobile SIM and trying to see the
orientation of the little guy here the
tab goes that way and this is you know
much easier to do off camera than on and
it comes prepackaged with an 8 gigabyte
sandisk micro SD card and it is a if you
can see that it is a class 4 which is
actually pretty darn good micro SDHC now
we're not going to use that that for
this review because I've already got all
of my stuff loaded up over here on my
it's a Kingston 16 gig micro SD and it's
a class 10 but that shouldn't affect
anything that we do with it we'll go
ahead and pop that in there and again a
lot easier to do this when you don't
have a million people watching you on
camera so now that we've got that done
we can have to try and remember how we
got the battery out so I assume I think
it's that way we'll find out here that's
your little battery retainer to hold it
in there snug we've got our back plate
now we put on and you can see a little
bit of a gap right there because I
didn't put it on all that snugly and
that's kind of my complaint with this
style of bottom plate if you will once
you get it on it's nice and snug but you
do have to gain access to it to put your
sim in there and it's kind of a pain to
get it back on and have it looking right
so that in a nutshell is the phone it's
the hardware walkthrough it's very very
nice like I said the HTC Desire s next
video up is going to be a first boot and
initial setup look you've seen that
before so I'm going to keep it kind of
brief after that then we're going to do
some some videos with the camera and
we'll do some some pictures as well so
make sure you subscribe
to our video channel to get all of that
stuff and of course we'll have a full
write-up review on this in the coming
days
so head on over to pocketnow.com and
make sure you've added that to your
bookmarks leave us comments if there are
things you would like answered about the
phone or if I have gotten any
information factually incorrect let us
know that as well very cool device and
we're eager to show you more for pocket
now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
