hurry up and fix the galaxy note 7
iphone 7 pre-orders are so loaded that
phone since appeared in minutes and
reports claimed the Microsoft Lumia is
close to an end I'm hi Mary vera and
about the only thing i can tell you
today is that it's friday life is short
might as well enjoy it this is parking
out daily brought to you by autodesk
graphic the official news today begin
with deals as it seems that motorola
just woke up and said yeah i want to
sell some mo toesies if you're in the
market for a smartphone right now the
whole concept of the moto mod is what
gives the moto z life and well verizon
and motorola have now decided to include
some of these depending on what moto zu
x if you go for the regular mode 0 z
you're getting that incipio battery case
thank you if you're getting the moto
z-force you're getting the JBL speaker I
kind of prefer the thinner moto Z but
pay by choice now for those of you that
are in the market for the Apple watch
best buy has just decided to put the
device on an all-time low 190 dollars
for the first generation unit the
problem is this is the first generation
Apple watch this is one of those
products that i do not recommend unless
you just want to use it for a watch that
has a couple of things honestly the
whole deal of bumping the first
generation Apple watch to a dual-core
processor is a very important move for
Apple and given the fact that's 190-200
69 you know for 70 bucks i might as well
go for the new one if you can find one
because those kind of sold out really
quickly well the second generation Apple
watch and the first one are not the only
products that sold out really quickly i
woke up at 3am for my pre orders and
believe it or not i had to go matte
black because the jet black iphone 7 was
sold out in a minute I'm not know a
minute and I'm talking about the plus
variant by the way the iphone 7 was
available for a few hours after
pre-orders begun but that iphone 7 plus
sold out in minutes in the rest of its
variants as well it seems that people
are really enticed by this whole concept
of the zoom lens even though they're
getting a huge phone but we would love
to know in the comments down below
was enough for you I've got some very
interesting reports coming from trusted
sources claiming that the Microsoft
Lumia might be coming to an end very
soon what we hear is that it's going to
reach end-of-life by December which is
the normal thing that happens with
smartphones the problem is that
apparently there is no replacement for
this smartphone line of 12 apparently
the surface phone is not going to exist
three it seems that there might not even
be another surface book you might want
to read a little more in the link in the
description mainly because that surface
book was a really cool computer or maybe
they'll be launched earlier or later or
whatever and finally the very hot news
today have to do with the FAA and the
samsung galaxy note 7 we already heard
that Australian airline authorities have
banded we heard the same from indian
airline authorities now the FAA has
provided a statement saying that even
though it's not banning the galaxy no
seven it is advising Airlines to do
something about it up to the point where
Samsung already came clear and said you
know what we're expediting replacing
note sevens in the United States because
you know that right now you can't really
just go into a store and replace it with
another note 7 these are still not
available and that's rather interesting
which leads me to the question of the
day have you gone for a full refund have
you gotten for any other galaxies or are
you waiting for another note 7 because
in my case I will admit I am waiting for
another note 7 that's the reason why
it's taken me so long to replace mine
mainly because I do love the things that
this phone can do sherbets going through
rough times but this isn't the only
phone that's gone through problems leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
