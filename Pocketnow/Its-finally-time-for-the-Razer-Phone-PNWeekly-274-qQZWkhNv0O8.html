razor might might reveal a phone borne
from next bit and when your phone ages
our performance slowdowns
all in your head we've got a lot to talk
about so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode 2 7 4 of the pocket
now weekly recorded Friday the 13th in
October at noon pacific time this weekly
podcast is where we dissect and discuss
those gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and by this time in the
month you'd probably already eaten an
entire bag of Halloween candy by
yourself
I'm Juan Carlos bag now senior editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by a
plucky podcast producer mr. Jules Wong
on the East Coast how's it going buddy
boy
I mean Walgreens had it since August
start something so I mean you should
have had plenty of chance to do that
also of all the months to have Friday
the 13th perfect this is yes this is
perfect as soon as we're done with this
podcast I am going to go buy and
download the evil within too and fire
that I might even live streaming I don't
know I haven't done a gaming broadcast
in a while but maybe I'll actually fire
up my very first playthrough on a horror
game there get your scene machine right
and as you might have noticed if you're
watching the live stream we are joined a
third window on this podcast friend of
the podcast my co-host for the online
geek book club keeper of the Star Trek
gifs mr. Andrew Wallace thanks so much
for joining us this week's podcast well
thank you for having me I appreciate it
yeah the Milo or thirst not working but
if you guys want my contact at both
what's wrong with your system this is
the most hilarious hangouts bugs you
know for us uh it shut down our live
broadcasts for three months while we
were trying to figure out audio issues
but whenever we go live your lower third
you know kind of a light deal
well we can remember we can get the PNG
on you sometime and just stick that over
there because why there's been a proper
overlay yeah yeah exactly yeah it's my
art on we can get you something going on
there alright whatever works for you
this time around because you're talking
with us so yeah all right
Before we jump into some actual tech
tomfoolery we do want to take a quick
minute to thank this week's sponsor and
that is Dee brand manufacturer of custom
vinyl cut skins for a variety of
different products different tech pieces
I rock one on my razor laptop obviously
they've been promoting pretty hard for
the release of the new Galaxy Note 8 and
the new iPhones I'm looking to maybe get
one when I finally get my hands on a V
30 again I think I'm gonna switch over
to one because uh you guys recently
caught our iPhone coverage I don't know
if I'll be able to show that well I
don't have autofocus on on my camera my
beautiful camera right now uh so I
managed to nicely Nick and cut into the
front face of my iPhone 8 and it was
totally the I was wearing cargo shorts I
was crouching to get a low shot with
with the Lenovo the Lenovo fab 2 pro
slid right out of my pocket
from a height of about a foot and
chipped right into the front face and
the the aluminum band around the iPhone
8 plus I was super disappointed by that
and as the situation that totally would
have been prevented by having just any
extra little bit of traction on the back
of that phone and that's one of the
things that dbrand excels at these
custom laser cut skins that perfectly
match up with your device different
colors different textures I'm a huge fan
of the dragon skin skins that help you
hold on to your devices better protect
against scratches and I think they look
pretty cool too again it's the thing you
want to customize your device they've
probably got a color a look and
aesthetic just for your device if you
head on over to dbrand comm you can
check out all of the various devices
that they that they support and it's
pretty numerous there
probably not gonna you know travel into
some of the the smaller phones that are
less popular but your major brands your
major products out there MacBooks if you
want to customize your macbook you'll be
able to find a solution at D brand and
of course we will have links down below
in the description of this podcast where
you can jump straight to customizing an
iPhone or a Galaxy Note 8 and yeah
they've been pretty good to us they've
actually supplied us with a couple extra
skins
it's just that disappointment of of like
whenever I have them on the phone and
people complain that I have a skin on
the phone instead of just showing off
the phone in real life because of how
fragile our smartphones have become I
have become the convert where I keep my
phones in cases or I keep skins on them
pretty much all the time and it's a pain
when I have to tear the skin off to
shoot the review because that's not how
I actually use the phone so that's D
Brande Brande comm check out those skins
hit the links down below they'll they'll
know that we sent you sent you over to
them that I'll definitely help us out
here on the podcast and we thank D brand
for supporting the pocket net weekly you
know I hear they're opening up a
position for Dragon Slayer I mean yeah I
suppose it is not cheap man I mean
that's that's a high turnover position
keeping them fresh dragon skins I'm kind
of surprised that they do real dragon
skins so that's great especially these
days that's a liar we're getting through
fall winter's coming
you know it's indeed well if you want to
survive the cold days of fall and winter
with us here on the pocket now weekly
we'd certainly love to have you along
just talk with us on the Twitter's and
the Facebook's and wherever that
hashtags are sold
appraised loved with hashtag P and
weekly and we'll be able to see your
comments as they happen during the
podcast because we love to look through
that feed live also podcast at pocket
now dunk this way you should send your
emails if you can't catch us live that
you want to get to us and we'll build
answer you like that as well so hash tag
being weekly podcast at pocketnow.com
you choose the means and we'll respond
to you however we
can we already have a couple tweets
coming in with the p-n weekly hashtag
some fan mail for jewels from at I fill
world hey one try not to leave out
jewels this knew who was gonna happen
last week we had Joshua Vergara from
Android authority and Tekken T and he
was on the pocket I was almost but I was
almost about to take a week off because
I was like they're the same Josh
actually was in The Gadget Lab and and
he was this when you have that human
interaction
I mean it's things that I love about
like the Joe Rogan podcast it's two
people actually sitting face-to-face and
the conversation just naturally you know
sort of steamrollers over everything
else and so I mean I was really
appreciative because Jules was jumping
in like with important pieces of
information and to try and keep us on
track but we knew rails on it yeah yeah
I had to keep time on you guys and force
segways I had to stop on Joshua said
boys because he loves those in as a you
know engine previous Android Authority
podcast myself I was like yeah yeah this
is gonna be pretty painful so I might as
well just pretty painful or pretty
amazing or amazingly painful amazing
amazing amazing amalia we've heard it
here first folks we're making up new
words some news I don't know about but I
feel like probably talking about some
tech news would be appropriate 2017 this
is all the news that is fit to podcast
the oculus go has been introduced at the
latest connect conference Hugo Barra and
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg say that they
believe this $199 device will be
accessible to the next billion users
getting into VR developer kits are
coming out next month sales begin early
next year
HFD global head of operations Rex Frey
Homer says that the Nokia eight is not
properly banded for the US and is
implicitly trying to
say that the us for now promising future
devices for the country presumably the
Nokia eight will perhaps be shattered by
Nokia nine that we may see soon huawei
mate 10 said to debut next Monday new
Intel shows that it is working with a 20
megapixel sensor as well as a 23
megapixel center at the back the largest
sense units since the Chinese OEM
partnered with Leica to optimize output
Samsung is expected to release version 2
of its BIG's piece aren't assistant next
week and its developments in San
Francisco oneplus has apparently had a
device manager tool time step that has
interacted with the screen on and off
times as well as other little bits and
pieces that have gotten a little a
little core of users pissed off in a way
there's a flashable file that can stop
that behavior but oneplus insists that
it's offering better services have been
after sales support with that info Wells
Fargo has rolled out 5000 ATMs with NFC
readers for Android pay ECM pay and
Apple pay you don't need your card
anymore with that pen you just have to
top and then put in that pin too and
Razer is loading up for an event all the
hints leading up to this point including
spec dump with Snapdragon 835 and eight
gigs of ram so the big question for this
week is are we ready for the gamer phone
is next bit going to pull all in for
this is TX gonna have an element in this
end they also have oh yeah which was
that micro console thing that ran
Android and it was closed off and it was
just this weird thing they took up that
- what do we expect from this are they
good combined kick right off with you
man I mean so you just recently picked
up Agua we made 9 you're not rocking a
traditional North American phone
manufacturer you've been you've been
digging it oh yeah that is a company
like Razer have the cloud in a way that
even Nvidia couldn't with their shield
tablets garner
you know a significant market share do
they have the potential to crack into a
foam market a device that I think a lot
of consumers are very conservative to
switch over to does this look like they
might have the answer on gaming where
Microsoft fell apart where a Nvidia fell
apart and we're even motorola struggles
to showcase gaming as a platform for the
for the Moto Z well that's that's that's
an interesting question because what I'm
thinking is what what can razor bring to
the table that you gaming experience
wise that you can't get from another
snapdragon 835 device you know like I
would feel like it would come to one
pricing is gonna be key just because
it's hard you know as we've seen with
the essential phone and all these others
it's hard to get into the upper upper
tier price range so they'd have to give
a lot of bang for the buck you know
whether or not you're gonna have a
certain level of VR support and I think
a lot of it might be down to just the
handset design itself yeah to try and
bring this particular audience in
because what's gonna brew what's the big
question that they've got to solve is
what's gonna bring people to their phone
rather than to galaxy and especially if
they can't get carrier deals totally cuz
that that's a big problem
you know because most the people
especially around here in the Midwest
where I met most people go through the
carrier's to get their phones well they
have they have to come out of the gate
with some sort of deal that honestly
more than maybe just sprint display
tucked into the back corner of a Best
Buy isn't gonna do it for ya yeah on the
second to bottom shelf next to the
joysticks because you know like my
hypothesis Jules is it takes a brand
about three years before consumers will
start taking them okay taking that
company seriously do you think Razer has
the fortitude to stick out losing a few
fights in the market just to establish a
foothold on consumer mind share
I think it's establishing a foothold
through carrier partnerships because we
have already talked about this about a
few months ago where they set up shop in
Hong Kong this big flagship razor store
and they you know it's sort of prophetic
in the rena they partnered with the
local network three and its parent
company Hutchison and they've you know
they have this special plan
they also say that they're working with
hardware and you know these projects so
I feel like there's a lot of you know
this was obvious this was coming up in
the first place and that carriers should
be aware especially in Asian you know
hardcore gamer markets where this kind
of niche thing from a brand that's well
known for you know if anything gaming
hardware is known for its panache its
optimizations for you know tactile
function and just you know colors LED
lights yeah that's funny um in in uh on
Twitter using the P and weekly hash tag
from a Trina Chang and I'm afraid the
razor phone will just be an RGB
accessories right on the same point as
usuals more than a real mobile gaming
breakthrough just pretty colors and I
should say that this is as always this
was always referred to as a mobile
device its own person just because you
can pick it up and move it around
doesn't mean that it's gonna be a phone
that's that's a very good point exactly
because especially when like the teaser
person in the in like the picture that
they sent out was like holding it
horizontally like a switch or something
maybe it could be a great switch
competitor I don't know because it the
image that I saw made me think that it
could be almost the size of like a small
tablet like what if it's the size of the
fab tube lenovo fab 2 pro like that
would be now it could be interesting
which was you know a you know just it
really depends I'm just thinking I'm
worried about carriers being done shy
off of it because was a pea rate and the
saying and and Twitter the like you look
what happened with the Xperia Play and
Verizon yeah and David Baptista Silva
also brought up that same point too on
Twitter if consumers wanted a gaming
phone then
vices like the engage in the Xperia Play
wouldn't have flopped
I think the n-gage probably had a few
more issues going for it with the remove
the battery to switch the game in the
the Taco Tuesday sticking out the front
of your face look I can manic the rest
of you that's super racist the thing the
thing I I have concerns with and it's
why I feel like Microsoft might have
missed the boat you know you had this
great idea of Italian with windows
phones and Xbox but the the farther we
get out from some of those flops the
more I have to wonder since we rely on
our phones for so much of our daily
lives there's a potentially battery
draining usage like mobile gaming work I
think we're kind of consumers are kind
of ready I think the switch shows us
that it's ok to have a second device on
you for a specialty purpose if that's
something you're really into like if
you're really into high quality audio I
think it's you know there's an argument
to be made for a niche consumer to look
at a branded media player if you're
really into gaming you can leave your
phone battery alone you don't have to go
out and buy the most powerful phone on
the market to play some mobile games you
can also invest some cash in something
like like the switch going to your point
back to your point tools that maybe it
makes more sense for razer to sidestep
the concerns over primary gadget usage
and look at a companion device something
that plays really well in your mobile
lifestyle your mobile ecosystem but is
entirely gaming focused and not
something that you have to worry about
also making phone calls and snap
chatting and you know doing all of your
go I should say that you know we were
talking about Razer we're talking about
PC heart but they're the most expertise
in as opposed to maybe some of the more
as the switch because they have unique
you know Hardware Coronado for them I
the wonder the reason why I wonder if
maybe were were barking up the wrong
tree with phones though his razor has
experimented with gaming tablets
not a few very unsuccessful attempts at
trying to break into Slate mobile gaming
especially around the time of early
Windows 8 this might be the right time
to come back to it though you know I
think a mobile hardware has gotten
powerful enough that you can deliver a
pretty compelling mobile gaming
experience especially with advances in
game portability game streaming where
maybe I am running something off of my
PC that's just dumb lis connected to a
mobile interface again I'm looking at
you know some good horror horror
survival games I want to run them from
my PC because that's the proper
experience but if I don't want to lose
out on continuing to progress through
that game maybe I could for short bursts
migrate it over to a tablet and and
connect remotely just just watch as they
have remember the old a Zeus is n pad
phone or whatever just imagine a Robin
just plugged in the back of this tab oh
the poor little Qualcomm 808 in that
Robin dog yeah melting down to try and
deliver a good game stream yes well
that's and that's the other thing too is
as far as processing power like with
with razor's used to being able to put a
super souped-up graphics card you know
and whatever laptop or their laptop
they're gonna build but they're kind of
stuck with GPU that they've got really
so it's all gonna be about the
peripheral experience really well in
1080 really like the exciting idea could
be something cuz I I think Razer was
ahead of the curve on so like my my
razor blade it has a thunderbolt port
which is great I mean it's it's a it's a
fully open Thunder bowl I can do
anything with it USB C or Thunderbolt 3
but the idea for Razer was to sell that
peripheral of having an external GPU
that you could connect over that that
protocol or that interface I highly
doubt that a mobile device is going to
tap into that but I think Razer has an
idea of some kind of modularity usage
specific scenarios where you can plug
things in
adapt certain experiences to where
you're at so this could go hand in hand
with that ecosystem when you're at home
with your laptop and you can plug it
into that really hot GPU you've got a
killer gaming experience when you're on
the go and you don't want to have your
laptop with you maybe it's just the
screen that interacts with your gaming
hardware at home and that's how you have
your high quality gaming experience I
think that there could be some potential
there sounds like quantum computing to
me because if we're referring to okay
well I was gonna say like a be nice for
them to do some partnerships like say
you know how you know you've got say
maybe have some sort of steam link
functionality or have course I would
never do this but have some sort of
origin or Bethesda you know be kind of
interesting to have to be able to bring
that experience to your mobile device
and then plug in whatever Bluetooth
peripherals peripherals you might have
that joke I mean like why I keep
crashing back hard into PC gaming is I
get super cranky knowing that if I buy
something for a console it stays with
that console where I can I can load up
the original fallout through my Steam
account I mean this is what your wife is
for basically this is you gotta get your
way into yeah you gotta get them toll
well my wife works for Activision let's
not make oh yeah that's nice I'm gonna
be in trouble that anyone said horrible
company we've got one other tweet the
cover from urban tech daily game machine
first phone second functionality over
aesthetics basically a tank with
front-facing speakers and a massive
battery that could be kind of compelling
I think that might have some crossover
if a company went out there and said
it's for gaming but it's gonna do
everything else really well and it's got
a six thousand milliamp hour battery to
last you two straight days of use
because as long as it's got a kickstand
then we're set I love it like I was
digging through old old
drawers and I found an old HTC with a
kickstand denied you know this is
actually kind of nice
yeah they were they were great you know
when I was at when I worked at Best Buy
we had all the cash what was the evo 4G
LTE in that little stand every one every
other one I'd see they'd just be snapped
off phone six came out III I wasn't
working for pocket now yet when the
iPhone six came out I did a video
telling people like if you're going into
Apple stores and purposely bending
iPhone 6s then you're an ass you're a
jerk and people actually fought me on
that consumers need to know that the
phone can Bend like that's the
stretching of property is not the right
way to do that don't be a jerk how about
we just live our lives with this idea of
don't be a jerk I do want to know well
like the success of that channel coming
down to a certain flavor of gadget
destruction porn that he does
phenomenally well in his consistency in
how those comes apart I mean it's so
compelling even though I myself hate
watching phones get messed up we should
we should have we should have them on
especially when I made fun of them in my
April Fool's video I I did the scratch
and Bend test on a sweet potato I do
want to briefly on the Wells Fargo story
because I think this is sort of an
interesting development in how long it
takes a techni stablished technology to
catch on but now we're starting to see
some consumer attraction and NGO is kind
of wondering about your thoughts um
since you're in the Midwest and we've
had some of these funny conversations
since Jules and I are coastal elites and
we have all over the hottest technology
when we go grocery shopping to tap and
pay have you seen any traction on
Android pay or Apple pay in your next
woods I actually have finally started
seeing traction there's a lot of course
chain places will have it a lot of other
chain places won't have it for some
reason why it might have changed
recently but for a long time
know that high V which is big here in
the Midwest and in Illinois also didn't
have it but we're getting a lot of
sources are finally finally getting it
the nicest thing for my situation if as
I had a legacy card on there for a long
time because you know we could use
legacy cards when they first rolled it
out and so I had my card on there knows
great until they stop support of it and
then I couldn't use it until PayPal
became a supportive method and that is
actually a big thing that a lot of
people actually hear that I've talked to
didn't even realize you can use PayPal
with it
I've gone into more than one I've
encountered more than one cashier who's
been a little bit confused wanting to
look at my PayPal app or the Android you
know Android pay app but it's it's
starting to get traction and now that
because there's a lot of small banks out
here that don't support it so having
PayPal is a big thing with it right the
only thing I'm worried about is with the
ATMs you know how gosh you'll see those
scam ATMs where they'll put like the the
whole ATM like over the top of it it's
as they can get your card information
they'll just have to have a little thing
now with a little NFC tag yeah I mean I
mean the skimmers were also kind of it's
it's a flat it's a zero-sum game with
that because I feel like that is just as
easily not detectable if you're in a
rush and whatnot
are having a fake NFC there you would
have you would have to find somewhere to
have some sort proximity to both well
this is something I'm woefully ignorant
on isn't the point of a system like
Apple pay or Android pay you are
interacting with an NFC chip but the
transaction is encrypted not encrypted
is is basically creating a dummy account
number for the solo interaction of that
one purchase so if you were to skim that
data you might be able to intercept one
day but it wouldn't work for future
payments right that's true that's true
yeah yeah you're right on that mmm good
thinking and that's why we have these
protocols in place so that we I don't
know it it's pretty funny I mean like
has we've been seeing a lot of a lot of
larger companies moving over to tap and
pay functionality for a in my neck of
the woods here
in near Encino it's funny that local
businesses the more family-owned and the
mom-and-pop shops are still mostly
focused on chip-and-pin like you still
need to have a card but they're
high-tech has been moving over into
other services like square or iPad based
point-of-sale services so you don't have
the old-school like credit card machines
that you'll see it like a big-box store
instead it's like an iPad on a special
stand with a credit card skimmer or a
chip reader and that seems to be the
more popular solution there so a lot of
them are now starting to support tap and
pay but we've seen the adoption rate
actually it has been kind of slow
because people haven't been wanting to
invest in the traditional more expensive
point-of-sale systems they've been
wanting to use more mobile gear for that
well one thing I'm wondering too is my
experience for myself has mainly been
Android pay specific Apple pay is debt
bike kind of here by default is you had
a much bigger roll out just because they
had they have much finer control on that
like my sister's been using it for
several years but you know so it's just
one of those I figured I'd put that out
there well and the consumer education
because I don't think a lot of people
out here realize that just because
there's like a little sign that says
it's Apple pay compliant that it's most
likely also Android pay compliant they
just didn't want to pay for extra
stickers wallet I see Google Wallet
everywhere still I I like I loved the
name Google Wallet I like that better
than Android pay oh yeah I'm so sad that
it got so is I do have what because of
Isis you got oh well it became soft card
and then it's slowly softly disap I
don't care just like Isis it was
something else we should probably change
topics yeah yeah I was about one thing
if that is I would like to see ATMs just
um completely no interface on the ATM
just tap it to a NFC reader and do
everything on the phone like I think
we're about well in time for that just
have just do the pan on the phone do the
whatever the head that that needs so I
agree I just think the timing on this
will probably take a little while
because we have to get to a point where
we assume that even the the the the most
economically challenged members of our
society have access to a device that can
handle that I mean it's the frustration
when we're still seeing like $200
entry-level phones that omit NFC like
that's some kind of luxury accessory so
where III agree with you Jules like I
think it's something that's right around
$3 part that you could stick into the
back of the phone I mean just imagine if
your phone price then went up to two
hundred and five dollars total by this
phone if it were five dollars for four
ninety five I would buy it in China they
have oh gosh what was I was watching
recently the the video about the the
gentleman who makes his own iPhone as
well as the Lori post on phone yeah yeah
what's the app that they use it's kind
of a mix of Facebook and a lot of others
if they use for a lot of payments and
does that not it didn't look like they
use NFC to me no we chat uses um QR
codes I believe oh yeah cuz I mean that
could that could be I mean gosh if they
had that as well - that could be good
for the for the people who are getting
you know $50 a smartphones to be you
know it would be it's just kind of funny
how reticent North Americans were to
play with things like NFC tags and QR
codes I remember you know like those
those initial like tap stickers that you
would get from Samsung you could program
them to do different things at the same
time everyone was coming out with QR
codes and no one was scanning them and
well I think they would have used it
more if that if the actual app built-in
camera app supported next room because
that's the big thing motor roll is the
only one I know of off the top of my
head that did that and then because I
have to go download carpet or wrap it
and do it no no because because and I
think you're right I think the problem
is one of you like I complain about
Apple the problem is one of conveyance
where I believe modern Samsung phones
should be able to scan
our codes but it might be through bixby
vision I could totally be lying and
someone's gonna correct me on that very
shortly just as a viewer at rena-chan is
confirming that NFC transactions create
a unique key for every transaction so
it's probably more secure than if you
use a credit card swipe I was wondering
what the tokenization process was in the
where the tap was going but whatever you
know I think that's that's right that's
all right yeah yeah I think that's
pretty good so I do want to move on to
speaking of security and security issues
I do want to talk about oneplus because
I think this is another minor black eye
for a company that this year has not
been handling the consumer discussion
very well on their products and features
just because you have a forum doesn't
mean that you can necessarily do all
these things you singlehandedly and not
really address they can see what
concerns in the way that you you know
you would like to yes you serve this is
for your own good don't to do that like
we've seen that before and I think this
is a major misstep for a company because
they're trying to build their fan base
up by appealing to I I think the the
louder contingent of Android fans know
the never settle the flagship killer
this is language meant to emotionally
target the tech-savvy ur Android fans
out there who are also a cost-conscious
this is exactly the wrong group of
people to upset yes what are your
thoughts on on their reply cuz I I feel
like a lot of people will feel
insufficient to address well it's like
with Google I mean if it was Google and
they had that reply I'd be a little more
accepting just because we we have a lot
more user there's a lot more user facing
products that benefit from all the
information they gather right that like
products that they come out with and
that they incorporate into their devices
that that we get
it's from that we can use every day one
plus I don't really it's a lot more
foggy with what they're using that for
they say they need it I mean it's just
if they're I wouldn't have as big a
problem if it was just they were just
transparent about it what they were
gonna use it for specifically and it's
like we're using this to improve X
feature x and y features on our phones
well I mean it comes down to trust level
at that point but yeah you know I
transparency is the big thing especially
for cuz I mean we we like transparency
you know right as you viewers and then
people who know how to use these nuances
of our services devices that we use but
yeah I don't know it's
I wish they'd elaborate a little more
well in joules I mean so there there is
obviously a process that you can engage
in if you go through the developer
settings to disable this kind of and
turn it off you actually have to
uninstall like through it yeah well well
there okay so there is one Advanced
Settings menu which you know I mean
you'll be able to just tap the android
logo seven times in that little area or
whatever and then you can get to it but
like actually really stop it from being
you know all torn down you should
definitely run the ADB code it's it's a
simple but that's like a bad Douglas
Adams joke just waiting to happen in an
unmarked lavatory with a sign that says
beware of the leopard is that you have
to go about finding because ADB can be
really intimidating to someone even as
if this is an enthusiast who who hasn't
liked Fermi exempt for example the last
time I am messing with ADB was on my One
m8 that I soft bricked like three times
messing with it so you know it's like
I'm staying away from that you know oh
yeah I mean I just recently wrapped up
our xperia x z1 compact review and I
went through about two hours of flashing
firmwares to try and enable the
fingerprint sensor and I'm almost
positive I am doing something wrong in
flashing a new firmware but I still
couldn't get it to work and it's not
like I'm not
at least somewhat familiar with these
types of tools and a little more
tech-savvy than your average bear and it
still was something that I couldn't get
working when it comes back getting back
to one plus I think one of the things
that bothers me is when we were tracking
this information that there that they're
collecting on users going back to your
point Andrew we might be more permissive
of Google tracking our data and and
rightfully I think we're getting more
benefit from it but I think we also have
additional trust that Google probably
has a more secure bucket and is doing a
better job of keeping us anonymous with
that data then one plus is because if
I'm reading because one plus right yeah
this it's just like literally your
serial number attached to the usage in a
big bucket where if that were
compromised people would have access to
some some fairly significant privacy you
know attached data on how you're using
your phone and I don't trust a company
as small as one plus under a larger
umbrella of the company that also owns
OPO to guard my data like I would Google
who actually creates the systems that
were utilizing this information and we
had to find this out ourselves to exact
just like that blue Shanghai adopts a
firmware deal where a security firm had
to find this and you know the two
weren't really forthcoming with what
that data was being used for there were
doubts and even though everything has
been sorted out with blue and Shanghai
tips to the point where they had to take
off Amazon you know get off of Amazon
for a few days before coming back that
still has left some doubt in our minds
fears so it's kind of just not a good
situation in order to play down these
things and say yeah you're like we're
not sending this over to the CCP
so yeah I mean one people it's getting
less and less you know my my old
argument was well I'm just boring you
know and what are they gonna want with
my
use that anymore that excuse me more
with how much that they're gathering I
was odd yeah well if you don't have
anything to hide then you'd you're good
criminal I I you know I there's a lot of
stuff well in silly things too like yeah
I'd steal anything it doesn't mean I'm a
criminal or I'm engaging in illegal
activities it's just I don't I don't
want that to be freely accessible
someone has a narrative strong enough
and the intent malicious enough you're
going to be you know dating for bride
well and and I do think it'll be another
sort of cultural and and this is gonna
be sort of a cultural and etiquette
thing that shift between convenience
services products as we start getting
into a more augmented reality world I
mean literally the view from my eyeball
is something that will be trackable
information so we are still going to
keep running into this perpetual debate
over privacy security and convenience
but this I think is a good example of
how to do it wrong hashtag oneplus doing
it wrong um I do want to quickly a
company that I will not accompany a
service that I've only used sparingly on
my note eight are we excited about Bixby
2.0 do you think that this is gonna
bring something fresh to the table in a
world where Google is actually getting
really aggressive with their Google
assistant strategy it's always the
problems of third-party developers and
that rarely ever comes true in devoted
you know dedicated you're focused thing
it doesn't come out like that
he comes in trickles and those trickles
eventually die out if they don't have
enough media coverage or not enough
people use it or whatever X so I mean I
don't know and especially because those
third-party developers there was a very
limited frame in which they could get
involved with the first version of Bixby
so I mean if you weren't on the ground
floor if that's you know where the
elevator Lee but lead up to so yeah are
you using Google assistant Alexa are you
use
anything like that um I've used Alexa
well I've used Google assistant for you
know the basic things Alexa I've used it
to play the Jeopardy game once we like
the Seinfeld trivia game oh yeah I've
already exhausted the entire run of all
of the the different questions that
they've got oh yeah there's a you know I
think a Samsung is is really their
marketing is wrong for bixby but they
need to be honestly I think that because
these since they don't have the access
to all the the sheer amount of data that
that Google has that their disposal they
really should be marketing it and
concentrating towards accessibility for
people with I feel like you know people
who might be blind or happy you know
that's something I feel like that they
could actually that you better think
Google does right now or because they
have functionality for opening up
specific after doing specific things
well that's something that I don't think
they don't they don't necessarily need
to have all the amount of data that
Google has at their disposal to be able
to pull off something like that and have
a good foundation to build on right and
and everyone's thinking while they're
marketing ads basically use this instead
of Google now or Google assistant that
is what people already set in what
they're using but a lot of people there
are a lot of people out there who use
smartphones who and smart devices who
would very much appreciate the better
accessibility features in Android I feel
I mean when you're coming in through
this a clean
sorry-sorry when you're coming into this
clean the whole AI digital assistants
space that XP key is supposed to be
something very convenient for you
OneTouch access and then boom you're
right into it as opposed to if you're
already into Google assistant Cortana or
whoever the house you're dealing with
you it's an annoyance
you can't reprogram that to be a system
but the services you feel are don't hey
don't do the things the way that Google
used to do it that Apple used to do it
it's just not you and you're having a
very very hard time it just
it's it's all about first contact I feel
and if this is the first contact great
for Samsung if it's not they don't have
a means of adjusting those use what do
you what do you mean by first contact
you mean like a users first experience
using it with that with the yes I think
that's also one of the reasons why like
Google has gone through several
permutations of their voice assisted
search you know like from Google now
Google cards Google assistant and
they're really not different services I
think part of this is if we rebrand it
call it something new people will try it
again and see that there's a lot more
functionality especially because Bixby's
rollout was so hamstrung like it took a
lot longer to get to English speakers
than I think Samsung intended there was
a lot of negative sentiment or negative
commentary regarding a useless button on
your phone before we really had a chance
to play with it to your point Andrea I
think one of the things that it's done
phenomenally well are macros mm-hmm
making macros more consumer accessible
so that you can deliver a very short or
small command that triggers a number of
different outcomes to to your point
Peter hatin using the PN weekly hashtag
the idea behind bixby is good and it can
be good at reaching inside apps if this
were assistant we could see a better
product like sort of melding those two
ideas together from Renato Laporte is
Bixby IFTTT enabled that makes things so
much easier to connect with other
services I don't believe Bixby has any
any ability to use IFTTT and that's if
this then that where you can set up
services for different macros for
different services which would be
actually I think a really compelling a
really compelling usage scenario for for
Bixby and then from David David Brown at
David B Linux on Twitter as a blind user
Android already has accessibility
services that work well
Samsung already ported talk back so
maybe this is also sort of a overlapping
things that people who utilize the
current accessibility services might not
necessarily need to have my questions
not had a huge amount of experience with
using them firsthand as far as you know
needing to use them but I'm wondering do
they go kind of step into the apps like
say could I could I say like I'd like to
be able to say take a photo and and
share on Instagram right something like
a two-step sort of thing but are you
concerned about all the blind
photographers out there I'm being
obnoxious ly facetious it's not blind
I'm not allowed to make that joke well
send your hate mail to my cooperate and
thing once you have released yourself
from these barriers the accessibility
settings on a phone camera is that
culture appropriation kind of culture
when it comes to that but I think they
can just equip themselves with lights
real cameras and then take the existing
light fields and just be able to 3d
print those into a you know somewhat
tangible form and and touch those and
then they'll finally realize what what's
like and you know it's kind of it's
great speaking of cameras we don't have
to spend a lot of them in fact we
shouldn't spend a lot of time in this
next story the the may 10 20 and 23
megapixel cameras are what I I don't
think Huawei joins or rejoins the camera
battle this year I don't think anyone's
gonna be impressed by higher resolution
do we think that this is gonna deliver
anything else in addition to more dots
to edit or what would they do to make
their cameras more compelling well this
effect there two times zoom ability
because before it's it was because they
had the the smaller megapixel camera and
then the the the greater one and that
allowed them to kind of do the the photo
you know the pho two times zoom is this
going then being almost equal good
effect that at all that's one that I'm
curious about
well I I don't think more resolutions
gonna be a problem I think more
resolution will actually benefit zoom
because you'll have more room to crop to
then sample the image and then to blow
the image up or or I wonder maybe
could this potentially be something like
a resolution hack like what Sony used
where you would have like a 20 megapixel
sensor but then the preferred output is
closer to an 8 megapixel image which
allows you to better remove noise and
preserve detail right and then ask about
the noise yeah well in Huawei phones we
aren't afraid of noise yeah I mean like
Andrew and I offline like I heard this
photo of Lex sleeping and she's lit by a
hallway light like again like completely
outside the room and I took it from from
my mate 9 so not even the wider aperture
on a pee on a p10 plus and it's just
like it's grainy and it's gritty and
it's dark and it's super high contrast
and you're like this is exactly what I
wanted from this phone yeah yeah she's
about to kill someone in her sleep isn't
she oh no it's great because again I'd
you know toddler sleep in the most
ridiculous positions and she was just
like but the graininess and the
grittiness yeah exactly
that's that's more sinister and you know
you could use that to your advantage
sooner or later we're gonna make my
daughter sinister dude all toddlers are
evil we know that but I think she's one
of the more benign evil toddlers I want
to jump into the class or that we get to
the main to the main topic for the rest
of this podcast but HMD executives
saying that the nokia 8 9 I arrived in
North America 1 are we surprised too can
a company build a smartphone brand
following or build brand loyalty by
continuing to ignore North America does
it make sense for them to try and play
in North America I have no idea except
for a Lolita and analog where Motorola
has launched the Moto G 5 plus and the
Moto G 5s plus whereas the less to keep
wool lesser specs non plus versions of
those devices didn't make it over to the
US I
think blowing on what they can make the
most of the scattershot approach in the
u.s. doesn't necessarily work as well
their most successful phone here in
Nokia that is as so far is the Nokia six
I believe you know and well and it's
just a matter of getting them in front
of people you know like my best buy that
I go to you like they had a quad way
phones up like the honor eight they had
the mate nine had a couple of others up
there for let's say for a six between
four to six months then they took them
down they have so many ones up there now
but it's just a matter of you don't if
you don't see it people aren't gonna
aren't gonna they people are a lot more
hesitant to buy if they can't just feel
one in their hand and that's a huge huge
barrier and I mean I'm not seeing any
Nokia's that aren't Windows phones in
the wild at all yeah I still have a
couple friends to actually to
specifically that I know of that are on
lumia 520 s there's people who do
nothing but cover the absolute bare
minimum basics you know in checking
their email I think one of them like
will occasionally tweet and like I
bought this phone for $80 so if I smash
it I don't care and those phones are
still running like crazy outdated
software apps that haven't been updated
but that's what they want they can text
they can email and that's that's about
it and here's a little odd thing we're
not a little port with the P n weekly
hash tag the Nokia eight is not even
banded correctly for Europe where our
bands 30 and 41 they're cheapskates on
the mode oh and that's disappointing to
have a Nokia name on that and to not
have good radio support that's like the
whole point of a world like that was the
whole excuse for the us thing like that
person that I just mentioned at the top
was like hey it's not properly branded
for the US sorry we would
to give you 110% of our support
well where's 110% support for Europe
hello it's like I would like to see
Nokia now come to the US and basically
try and fill the niche that the 1+1
filled like I mean I think that I think
they could do that build material I get
some of the cost in the build materials
down use the nice Nokia a polycarbonate
design that they had you know like on
the the 1520 and whatnot and because I
think that's really if you're not gonna
go through the carrier's going at that
price point is your safest bet I feel
like as far aside from you know making
money off I think that's another that's
another question but actually just
getting your foot in the door I feel
like that something that would be that's
a lot easier to break into a third gonna
skip the carrier's no I'm glad you
brought up the polycarb it's just a
shame because I I seriously doubt hmd is
ever gonna walk us back to that high
quality plastic cause it was such a
great feel and right now everyone's
super impressed by glass or ceramic or
something slippery and I just I went off
on like another rant I forget where I
was oh I was I was on a set I was gonna
I was on a shoot and someone else was
there and they were just talking about
the the other sound guy I was working
with how he just switched from an iPhone
to a pixel and one of his reasons like I
didn't want the iPhone 8 I didn't want a
glass back phone and then it caused us
to go down this rabbit hole of hey you
remember that Motorola the head Kevlar
hey you know how like moto had leather
hey you know what would be need is
carbon fiber you know any other material
instead of glass that can still have
wireless charging but still connote I
dunno quality product I'm still waiting
for my denim phone hello I told like
literally from the denim update I want a
denim phone I want you by stitching on
the back to show off how that matches my
501s
I've always wanted that --cork skin that
was on the m8 that they would that one
like that was actually the very first
video of yours I've ever saw blonde and
I didn't even really it was yeah like
one of the first videos ever saw of
yours it was some a manufacturer who
were not going to mention in this
podcast cuz they're not sponsoring it
true no it was that was a phenomenal
feel in the hand it was such a great
skin for that phone III I loved it it
was it was phenomenal oh yeah like we
could wrap up the news block because we
we have to talk about VR real quick
oculus rift dropping a 199 dollar all in
one unit VR headset it sounds like this
is they're sort of piggybacking on their
relationship with Samsung driving the
gear VR do we think that this will move
the needle on consumer VR do we think
that this ship is starting to pass
people buy like 3d TVs were I don't know
I really don't it's it's like
smartwatches where we thought like all
these uh market analysts and these
reports keep saying hey this is gonna be
explosive by 2020 we're gonna see five
times volume and whatnot and we're
already half way from those 2015
estimates and yeah it's been kind of
weak and you know we haven't been
feeling it's it's only now that we've
really dug into the cellar part of
things and that's mostly thanks to well
perhaps nearly all thanks to Apple watch
so right yeah I don't think that I'm not
sure if this is that kind of development
if this is the cellular of VR that we
should be looking for yeah it's it's I
would like I think that I really like
the approach what part of the approach
that LG did with their VR viewer with
the g5 it long as the VR viewer didn't
stink like it did you know like having
where you could just plug it into the
the USB C port send it down or whatever
or have it on a little side here and be
able to kind of look around for me the
only things I'd use VR for is if I'm
like laying down and looking up at the
ceiling and watching like you know movie
or something but yeah I mean it just
depends I think it's better that's
getting the price is getting lower
because that's gonna get into more
people's hands and just kind of we're
gonna feel along and see if it sticks
six I hope it does but I think AR is
kind of taking steps ahead right now and
within the last six months in perception
definitely I think AR has the more
exciting potential long term but one of
the things I've been kind of curious
like I've been really trying to Rack my
brains what are some of the usage
scenarios that we can get consumers
excited about virtual reality especially
now that we are hitting lower price
points $200 is still a lot of money but
it's a lot easier to engage with that as
a platform then you know when oculus
first launched you were talking about
multi hundreds of dollars to purchase a
headset and having to run it off of like
a $1500 computer and so I posted an
informal poll on the pocket now Twitter
account have you ever worn a VR headset
on an airplane and to me this this seems
like it would actually be a great usage
scenario we all hate flying it's a
terrible experience so why not escape
reality for a couple hours and watch a
movie that like you were saying I want
to lie on my bed and and be all alone in
my own movie theater that could be a
really interesting way to get to consume
a film and out of 800 votes six percent
of people said that they have actually
flown and worn a VR headset that's
actually a lot higher than what I
thought it would be that's terrible like
that's definitely not an adoption rate
that developers want to hear but I think
we might be getting over the consumer
fear of face computing right like Google
glass had that horrific ly negative
consumer response because it was two
Borg e on your face now we have a few
trêpa depe din dividuals
who are willing to brave the social
reaction of putting a computer on their
face in an environment like an airplane
and I think if that starts to trickle if
that trickles into more of a flow and
that flow becomes more of a river that
might actually help move the needle on
less expensive VR hardware when we can
find a few usage scenarios where it
makes sense to cover your face with
geeky stuff
I think that that could actually show
some potential long-term I mean you see
the pictures it's it's just a extended
little goggles thing and it's not like
Borg yeah as you said total wires coming
off the back like it's a like that's
great because like what I think is
hilarious is that oculus is solution
looks a lot like daydream in in it's
just complete and total simplicity and
instead of putting your phone in the
front of this case I think that's a big
problem with daydream right now is again
you have to put your phone into this
container it's gonna destroy your
battery life it's gonna run super hot
after about ten minutes I'm sweating
buckets and I never want to give someone
else my daydream viewer there's there's
the gunslinger game that I love playing
but I can only play it for about ten
minutes at a stretch and I'm dripping
with sweat by the time I'm done playing
it because my pixel is just roasting
away and on my face the UM the galaxy
actually does a much better job on the
Qualcomm 8:35 but it's still running
really hot by the time like although I
have noticed that your forehead has been
a little bit more fit these days yeah
I'm trying trying to get away from
having my you know double chin in five
head and they're like I'm generally
trying to shrink all dimensions but know
if oculus is solution here I think is a
viable one because it doesn't rely on
your phone it's self-contained it's not
gonna kill battery life by having a
companion device powering it this could
be the compelling next step into
indicating consumer is interested in
this type of usage and I think it's a
much better fit for potentially getting
schools onboard if we're gonna need to
use VR as some kind of educational bar
these things about educational platform
yeah yeah yeah indeed so we're pretty
happy for that and we're pretty happy
that's we're all here to talk about some
hot takes the sound effect would come in
hello anyways we are here to talk now in
an abrupt
transition over to Apple to the iPhone
and two older iPhones in particular
especially as newer and newer software
older and how you can use them they all
get so slow once you install the new
operating system update says everybody
who owns an older iPhone that's what
they say that's what they say
is it true though they're all dirty
liars the makers of three marked the
benchmarking platform that has been
pretty popular although that you know
they've had they have more competition
so there's more data blah blah blah
take these numbers at your own risk they
have run some tests and have run a
plethora I mean we're talking about all
the way back to April 2016 so that's
through iOS 9 on the iPhone 5s 6 6 s and
7 and we don't you can take a look at
pocketnow.com for the bar graphs
ourselves but they are pretty consistent
the GPU performance on the iPhone 6s
actually well the iPhone 6 actually went
up in the latest like by a good decent
Chuck but it's mostly been a pretty
consistent ride yeah the only phone
according to their benchmarking the only
phone that showed any type of
degradation was the iPhone 7s CPU
performance through the various
iterations of iOS 10 iOS 11 and we're
talking by I think a margin of error
degree you know the amount of the amount
of performance degradation that we saw
so the question that I would have of
their testing setup I would be I don't
believe that these were real-world used
phones with personal data accruing
different data bases being backed up
contacts calendar individual
personalized usage throughout the day
apps that need to be updated that don't
always perfectly clear their cache or
their data bases when they're being used
you've got a lot of flotsam and jetsam
going around and daily abuse that have
phone experiences so like a phone that
gets run really hot the battery that
starts to degrade
the chipsets that's starting to get a
little more worn out I mean even just
the tech the hardware concerns we might
see you know maybe it is just like a two
or three percent drop in performance
over the year that you really use your
phone as your daily companion but then
you add that with other apps that are
being updated other software that's
being updated and I think that all don't
have the same live API libraries - that
totally up - absolutely because I think
one of the things that's funny is that
they were saying that it's that one of
the quotes from the article that we
posted on pocketnow.com
conversely apps designed for an earlier
version of iOS might not take full
advantage of optimizations in the latest
version of iOS so an even you know a
newer app might be more graphics
intensive might might actually tax your
phone Hardware more but the older app
might not take advantages of operating
system optimizations and improvements
and tax your hardware here's the thing
that I feel is kind of being missed out
upon is that we open these apps all at
once are we trying to get open one app
and then it's taking too long so we you
know just get out of that right pin
another app it's how we use our phones
in part that kind of exacerbates this
slowness behavior and we're just looking
at it and just it's just so frustrating
and you think that this is all part of
Apple's design we know for for a long
time we have known that this is all in
the design of planned obsolescence
absolutely Apple has a has a concerted
has made a concerted effort to make your
phones run terrible and they even talked
about it during their keynotes where
they they say that this phone is gonna
be so much better than that crappy old
phone that you're using because it's the
best iPhone ever now Andrew you use a
huawei mate nine so you have no idea
what we're talking about because of the
machine learning in the hallway making
you impervious to your phone aging over
time have you had any experience like I
think those of us in Android land are
probably
a bit more sensitive to slowdowns
because the Android ecosystem is so much
more open and that updates come more
sparingly so when there's a bug fix or
an optimization it goes through this
ridiculous process of manufacturer to
carrier to device as opposed to Apple
where it's a bit more you know company
to customer what I mean so how long have
you held on to like the phone that
you're you you used before you picked up
your mate nine and do you feel like it
was running consistently similar to when
you first pick it up or did you feel
like it was starting to show its age
where did we lose Andrew you frozen if
lost oh he's frozen in the arm folding
position I mean he we know he has a
heart out I'm not sure what now he was
he was mentioning before we were gonna
jump on the podcast too that he was
having some issues with his cable car
and now you know he's he's like giving
us a little cheers on that front and I
never took in an Andrew - if you were
watching the live stream that he needs
to get a new profile photo cuz like me
there's less of Andrew than there was
when he took that photo he's looking a
lot better now and so I'm gonna make fun
of them yeah there's there's more
beverage unless Andrew just making my
hair great yeah well and again another
reason why you need to take a better
profile photo than the one it's it's
it's wholly inaccurate to actually
describe what you look like right now
but so I was gonna say so the phone that
you had before your mate 9 did you feel
like it was starting to slow down with
age boy what what were you using before
you pick that up well I have a my my v10
which like software you can't really
tell because that 808 was yes is a dog
yes and it I mean it got hot battery
life was not great but even if after I
bought a new battery I mean I literally
can't I have three batteries tear and
that I would have on me in my pockets
hoping that no I don't sit on any like
some tacks or anything
[Laughter]
and so like it had trouble especially
like I'm like I'll go dig it out and I'm
just kind of looking like oh my gosh you
know there's there's a huge difference
as far as just overall but I can't
separate it out just based off of
software I will say software difference
like I've not had the mate nine for that
long but the build is older you know you
know and I see performance better on the
main nine however there are some UI
inconsistencies that I find but I think
that's just because LG's LGS as
especially with nougat refined it a
little but was hobbled by the processor
on this and this one I mean Huggins
little dumb things like like if I'm
using the camera app and the raw a
toggle disappears yeah you know or
something I'm like what why would that
change yeah all the time
or I'll get some sort of issue with the
lock screen where I'll pull up
I'll have google play music going and
it'll have do like though like the full
magazine sort of lock screen you know
how Kawai way does it I'll turn it off
I'll turn it on again it's just like a
band at the top and it looks like emui
for Andrew and I are pretty big fans of
Huawei devices and I think maybe 2% of
the Android phone ownership community in
North America have any idea what are you
complaining about emui for Jewel's
getting back getting back to apple real
quick isn't part of the problem with
individual use on something like the
perceived slowdown of a phone just so
highly anecdotal that it's kind of
impossible to study I don't know that we
can definitively point to you know the
the manufacturer influence over OS
fragmentation on iOS like you will all
get iOS 11 but that doesn't mean you're
gonna get all of the new features of iOS
11 you know we can we can reasonably
point to just how disposable our phones
are becoming in general
as something that that you you're gonna
be encouraged to upgrade yearly or every
other year see this is the problem with
cocky about iPhones and that need you're
able to keep them from longer as
heirlooms
whereas Android you have more King
consistencies and more of these these
gaps that people can notice and that you
know they can point to it's just like
they're much more frustrated by those
but right I feel like when they when I
phone users come into this and they sort
of have to deal with these slowdowns
every once in a while that pop up it's
just like well I have to get to my my
images my photos I have to get my music
I think I think they have much more of a
tie of a emotional tie of a just just
services to Apple because that's what I
think is a great point is when you do
run into a lag or a hitch on an iPhone
it's more likely to stand out from the
daily usage then it might on an Android
device and I know people are gonna drop
tons of comments like oh I have a galaxy
whatever blah blah blah and it never
lags and that's probably not true we're
just willing to overlook a certain
inconsistency in performance to a degree
that an iPhone user especially a general
consumer might not understand why an app
update causes their iPhone to load a
program longer or a game might struggle
to load a level as fast as it used to
we have a comment a couple comments here
from from at rina-chan on twitter using
the pn weekly hashtag one iphones could
use more ram but they went with just
enough for their optimizations so when
apps get bigger the system is more
inclined to lag and then he also
mentions his s7 edge went downhill after
nougat after his nougat update to the
point where having
YouTube and Twitter open at the same
time was super laggy I can also kind of
voice a similar concern my wife had the
regular s7 not the s Evan edge and it
got so bad so she had filled up her
storage with photos of our daughter then
moved them all to a memory card and the
phone never recovered we wiped it out
and it was still slower than what we
remembered it being when it was brand
new and she actually stole my um my
blackberry key one so that's what she's
using now instead so even though the 625
is not as powerful as the 820 in the s7
she seems to be happier on the key one
than she was with the s7
one and you know I'd be interested with
with the ADA way for example on this I
wonder how much of the of the processing
how much is this the issues that I was
having it's most likely related to
throttling thermal throttling I wonder
how if they had is pipe in there if that
would have negated any of that because
that's I don't let me interested to see
I don't think so I mean because there
were eight tens with heat pipes that
performance improved but the chipset
never ran as consistently as the 805 so
what is more powerful than the 805 but
if I pull out my Galaxy Note 4 and I
compare it even to a clean phone like a
Nexus 6p
I'll take the overall performance of the
note for every single time knowing that
in a burst of processing power eight the
the the 6p will beat it but after you
get over that initial burst it's gonna
tank for any sustained performance
issues it's just not fun oh yeah
compromises battery and all that it's
you know that's why the 625 is just so
is so they're so good for that you know
one one thing as far as tanking
performance come back to Huawei the have
you noticed in your usage I know that
you had you're after the buzz and
talking about how it's still a screamer
I mean I'm not having mine I've only had
mine for about three weeks
but it seems really fast as far as their
prep because I remember la way promised
you know that these were gonna maintain
their speed two months later and I mean
as I said I don't have it but how does
it been for you
oh my mate nine I mean I'm actually
using it right now to grind some Marvel
future fight it's you know it I use it
every day
mostly for gaming these days but I'll
still use it for the camera because I
really do like the stills from Huawei
cameras the only thing that really has
affected performance on mine has been
almost maxing out the memory card so it
was like well you know we do such an
efficient job of garbage collection and
keeping the device running running
smoother and they show like oh if you
have a samsung and you have a hallway
and there you've got a ton of photos and
videos will load way faster in the
gallery app because of this optimization
if you're storing a ton of stuff on a
memory card it slows them 8/9 way down
accessing stuff from the memory card and
that's noticeable because if you store
your photos and videos on the phone it's
still super snappy but that's obviously
outside of Huawei's control even though
I'm using a very quick memory card
that's not on them when it comes to the
general performance of the phone I find
that this is still one of the better
performers for more graphics intense
games it performs better on Marvel
future fight than my si+ does even
though the Qualcomm is the 835 is
supposed to be more powerful than the
karin 960 it's supposed to have a better
GPU it seems to be doing a better job of
the the slowdown the lag triggers there
are a couple characters that have
special moves that totally kill my
galaxy where they run pretty much fine
on on my mate 9 so it's it's been
overall a lot more positive experience
than I thought it was going to be based
on all the marketing speak that's good
yeah I mean and that that being said
with with a less powerful GPU on it it's
still doing that they
Qualcomm so again a lot of this is
optimization because I think a part of
this is the developers on future fight
just have no interest in the various
different permutations of chipsets out
there and for whatever reason the curent
seems to work better other games I think
that would probably flip but that's the
one that I grind the most we have a
couple of tweets here before we wrap
this show up from Peter Hayden I wonder
if part of Apple's problem is that they
support them for so long again we can
talk about Apple as a victim of their
own success and then he goes on to say
as you say Jules that there are other
inconsistencies I I wonder if when
someone complains about an iphone
slowing down it's because they're
loading the newest version of iOS on a
four-year-old phone I think at some
point they gotta call it like you know
you're not gonna get great performance
but I can point to my s7 and say when's
it gonna get Oreo and shrug yeah well my
mom's an iPad through third gen like the
last one with the 30-pin and she's
having a problem - plus it's a 16 gig
that's full so there's two sides of that
coin so you know and it's a lot of it's
just you know you gotta you got a sunset
it and I'm David Brown on on Twitter
using the P and weekly hashtag what I do
to keep my performance up is to wipe my
phone about once a year I'm a custom ROM
guy so upgrading requires that kind of
maintenance I think that's not terrible
advice for most people I think you know
just like you would expect to give your
car a tune up between three and six
months I'm not a tune up but like an oil
change every three to six months we
should probably start having that
conversation about phone maintenance we
already had that conversation it's about
it's about boyfriends and girlfriends
and I want to have sex it's like later
[Laughter]
this conversation delay well it's like I
mean with with my with my v10 I did that
about once a
a couple months basically yeah on there
and and whether it's placebo effect or
not you know you can count for a lot you
know what I mean like even if it's not
necessarily really improving the
situation for performance it just feels
like you're doing something that is
gonna help make your phone ownership a
little less painful yeah well at least
we can ease the pain in terms of ending
this podcast I think because we're able
to we're able to end it in a graceful
and we should and Andrew I want to thank
you for joining this week this was a fun
conversation and we should probably have
you on again sometime I guess maybe have
you one again sometimes okay I'm game
this is a lot of fun thank you for
having me this is this has been
fantastic I mean I've been a listener
slash watcher since probably late 2013
early 2014 so this is exciting is all
heck yeah thank you I enjoy my time in
my conversation with Andrew if you guys
are so inclined you can catch us on our
online book review show the yes and then
here's my third you cannot know who
Andrew is so folks there you have it
another episode of the PocketNow weekly
has come and gone this show is over but
the conversation continues on twitter
where andrew is at fat produce Jules is
at point Jules and I'm humbly at some
gadget guy pocket now is around the web
on Twitter Instagram Facebook Google+
