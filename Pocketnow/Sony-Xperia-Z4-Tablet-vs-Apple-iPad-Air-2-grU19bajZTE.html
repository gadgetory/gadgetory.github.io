were all surprised by how light and thin
the tablet was well Sony just announced
its Android tablet flagship and it's
lighter than Apple's offering also they
have very little to none in common I'm
Anton Dean I and we're comparing the
young compatible and PocketNow Sony
Xperia z4 tablet versus Apple iPad air 2
quick show for comparison we might as
well just say that the only thing these
two tablets have in common is the fact
that they are both well tablets and
thank you for viewing this short video
however we're looking at two flagships
from two different platforms the best or
among the best from their operating
system categories they both carry their
respective manufacturers design language
material choices and finishes the iPad
air 2 has an aluminum back while the
Xperia z4 tablet is this time plastic
one of the reasons we're guessing Sony
managed to keep its cell light they're
both 6.1 millimeters thick or thin which
is insanely thin if you think about it
Apple's cool to the touch choice of
material and finish speaks premium but
that's not to say the Sony Tablet is
less of a good choice when it comes to
this however because of the way these
two tablets are built and their aspect
you're probably not going to care that
much if you throw your Xperia z4 tablet
around or drop it it looks like it can
take it opposed to the iPad air 2 of
course this is just a feeling you're
getting when holding them the rest is
all about the differences Sony's tablet
has a larger screen at 10.1 inches
versus 9.7 bigger resolution at 2560 by
1600 versus 2048 by 1536 more ram at
three gigs versus two gigs and front
firing speakers the Apple iPad air 2
does have a fingerprint scanner but the
Sony Xperia z4 tablet has NFC and is
water and dust resistant cameras are on
par at least on paper both at 8
megapixels and if you don't care that
much about specs at the end of the day
it all comes down to the software
they're running
the iPad air 2 runs Apple's iOS which
means that aside from the folders on
your countless home screens and a
wallpaper there's little to no
customization available opposed to that
Android lollipop enables you to use
widgets which can be pretty handy also
Android by default gives you more
freedom both of these tablets are able
to do the exact same operations there's
little to nothing one of the two can do
that the other one cannot it's about how
they do it we won't go into details
regarding Android versus iOS as that's
the eternal debate the app situation is
fairly similar and today there are
little chances you won't find an Android
application that doesn't exist on iOS
and vice-versa
Google now gives you all the information
you need but Apple Siri isn't a slouch
either at the end of the day as we
mentioned it all comes down to doing
more or less the same things but in
different ways it's really like
comparing apples literally to oranges
and the final decision lies with the
users and their preferences you can't go
wrong with any of these but we'll
definitely make sure to tell you more in
detail about the differences among the
two once we do an in-depth comparison as
part of our Xperia tablet Z for review
