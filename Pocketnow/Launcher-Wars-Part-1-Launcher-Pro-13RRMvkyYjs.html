pocketnow.com and this is launcher wars
part 1 in launcher wars we're going to
help you determine the best launchers
possible for Android so you can figure
out which ones work the best for you
let's get to it so in this video I'm
going to talk about launcher Pro which
is my personal favorite launcher for
Android Joe is going to come on soon in
another video it's going to talk about
ADW launcher now the purpose of the
series again is to help you discover the
best launchers out there one of the best
parts by far of Android is its ability
to change the launcher which is of
course the home screen interfaces all
the widgets and the application tray now
this is the Google Nexus S which comes
with a very vanilla installation of
Android 2.3 so you get the little duck
on the bottom and there's seven home
screens it's very simple it's not you
know very visually intense like HTC
senses which i think is a good thing I
like things light and clean but I wanted
to go even lighter and cleaner and
faster with launcher Pro and I'm gonna
show you how I have my home screen setup
then I'm going to talk about the
different settings that you can choose
in modular Pro because I think it's the
best launcher out there so let's start
you're gonna see a crazy live wallpaper
here I'll tell you what it's called in a
second in case you wanted a little bit
distracting I know but it's pretty cool
and it doesn't really kill battery life
too bad
so it's called SolarWinds live wallpaper
and it is free let's go back to the home
screen and I'm gonna zoom in here so let
me tell you about what I've done here to
my home screens I like a home screen
configuration that is very simple that
gives me quick access to anything that I
want so I've got a quick google search
up here and as you can see it's skinnier
than what you get when you make it and
I'll show you why I've actually got the
launcher pro upgrade for 3 bucks that
allows you to resize widgets I've also
got I believe this is called quick
battery here which shows me the
percentage battery life I have got a
variety of shortcuts I've got my Google
Voice widget also expanded beyond the
stock size with the launcher pro feature
I've got some icons here and here is my
dock on the bottom with the Froyo style
background and so when I swipe two
different screens it stays put
so that I always have those icons down
here now launcher Pro will allow you to
make multiple docks that you can swipe
to the right and to the left but I think
that kind of defeats the purpose of
having a doc and doc should be the same
no matter what home screen you're on now
I've got hope three home screens set up
here not seven like you get in stock
Android or more because I like to just
be able to go to the left go to the
right and call it a day I don't want to
be swiping millions of times to get to
my other home screens now launcher Pro
has the ability to zoom out to the home
screen view you can pinch or you can
press the home button and you can
quickly dial to the home screen that you
want I never ever use this feature
because I'm only using three home
screens anyway so I'm going to go to the
left and show you the other things I've
got going on here I've got this cool
bookmark widget which gives me a little
preview of all the websites that I have
so Engadget Gizmodo google docs pocket
now XDA down here on the bottom there is
a Google Voice widget will allow me to
make a message do other things going
over to the right I've just got this
favorite people thing it's kind of HTC
styled which allows me to have six
people now one of the coolest parts
about launcher Pro if you pay the
upgrade fee so if I tap in a hold on any
widget I can actually resize it which is
really cool and I'll show you a little
preview what what it's going to look
like so if I let go the widget will be
extended it's a lot cooler when you're
using a widget like I'm gonna put this
on the other screen something that's
stuck like the Google widget that you
get out of the box so right now it's
three items wide if I tap and hold on it
and let go I can make it you know the
normal size or if I want to keep it
really small I can make it two columns
wide so really cool ability to be able
to resize the widgets there so I'm gonna
bring that back over there and slide my
battery back to where it was and again
you can resize these other widgets like
the Google Voice widget I can make that
smaller really any widget that you can
get you can resize if you pay that extra
fee to upgrade launcher Pro now
something else that I really really
really wanted to change what's the
application trade and standard Android
you get this fancy animated thing that
takes forever I wanted the application
trade to open up in a snap and watch
what I got here boom there we go and
I've also increased the number of icons
on the screen
time because what I'm digging through
the application tray I don't want to be
going through the alphabet digging
through a long long list I want to get
right to the application I'm looking for
so launcher pro lets me sort this by a
row of five by I think we've got five
here so lots of icons on the screen at
one time and again look how fast that
opens it's absolutely instant compared
to the Android that you get stock
Android or even HTC Sense or motoblur
takes a second to open up so let's talk
about some of the settings I've got here
so I'm gonna go into the menu and
preferences it's a lot of things you can
change about this particular launcher so
if we go to general settings this stuff
I don't really mess around with that
much but home screen settings you can
specify the number of home screens you
want you can go up to 7 but I go with 3
here you can choose the default home
screen so when you press the home button
it knows which to go back to we've got
virtual looping which is just a little
cool feature so that when I get to the
end and if I swipe to the right it
bounces me all the way back to the one
on the left just a cool little feature
to use there we've got enabled trackball
scrolling a lot of the stuff I don't use
transition effect I turn off all
animations all transition effects I want
everything to be instantaneous here home
screen grid number of rows and columns
so in case you wanted to kind of scrunch
up the icons a little bit and fit more
on the screen at one time you can do
that with launcher Pro auto fit items so
it will resize widgets I have that
turned off here's the dock settings
which is cool so we can change the
number of docks you have like I
mentioned you can swipe to the right
swipe to the left and see up the three
docks again I think that defeats the
purpose of having a dock you can enable
loop scrolling this is cool unread SMS
count so you can have a little counter
that shows you exactly how many missed
SMS you have kind of like an iOS you can
also do the same for Gmail and Misco I'm
actually going to turn that on forgot to
do that behavior settings autorotation
so you get the sort of rotation on the
home screen I like everything in
portrait I don't want to have to wait
for things to go into landscape okay
going down appearance settings where
some cool stuff comes in doc background
so we can change this to glass let's go
back and see what that looks like so
I've got a kind of a new little doc
background it kind of sits on a piece of
glass which is
nice let's go back into appearance
settings here home button on app drawer
so you can determine the behavior of the
home button while you're on the home
screen you can hide the notification bar
if you want to get the maximum amount of
screen space possible when you're on the
home screen
disable the disabled wallpapers scroll
into the wallpaper stays what I mean it
goes on and on and on there's just so
much you can do and then if we go into
advanced settings here we have a few
other things we can turn on 5-row and
home screen highly recommend that so you
can see more on the screen at one time
you can turn on high quality scrolling
but again that will slow down your
device we're going for sort of the the
ability to get really fast operation
here here's something that I really like
opening speed of the app drawer I have
it set to ten ten is instant zero if you
went to that you get well let's see
bah-wah who wants that I I can't imagine
who would want to wait that long for the
application tray to open so I'm gonna go
back into advanced settings and go to
opening speed and Jack this up to ten so
I never have to wait again and then a
lot of other things like screen previews
you can change how fast that happens so
a lot of settings a lot of things you
can do here to customize what you've got
going on and let me just show you some
of these widgets I'm going to delete the
people widget real quick I'm gonna tap
and hold and go to launcher pro widgets
so these are the premium widgets that
you have to pay three dollars for and
they're inspired by HTC's Sense widgets
but i think they're better because
they're resizable so we can go into
messaging and we got a variety of
choices here so we've got the kind of
vertical list we've got the simple one
item at a time let's go back and see the
other ones real quick we've got Twitter
Facebook friends people and so let's go
to say friends and you've only got one
style here and of course what not that
one go back of course the one we were on
was people and there's a lot of choices
for that so you get this grid you get
this well actually only two choices so
this is the one that I was using here
and I've got just starred items so that
basically it's pulling from the people
that I starred in the Android dialer and
right now it's loading and it should
come up on the screen perhaps I don't
have that said exactly right I'll have
to look into that so this is launcher
Pro this is my favorite launcher for
Android because it's fast it does what I
want it has resizable widgets beautiful
widgets and it just it works and there's
a lot of options that you can use to
tweak we're curious to hear about your
favorite launcher for Android we're
going to continue the series of launcher
Wars to help you find the best launcher
possible for your Android phone please
