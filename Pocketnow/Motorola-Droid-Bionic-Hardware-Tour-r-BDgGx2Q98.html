today we're going to take a look at the
hardware walk around of the motorola
droid bionic let's go take a look okay
in our last video we unbox the motorola
droid bionic for verizon and really it's
a standard box with what you'd come to
expect inside of it we didn't look at
the hardware of the phone just so we
could keep this video series separate
and clean so without further ado let's
go ahead and take a look so here's the
device just as it came out of the box
now when I say as it came out of the box
there is no battery in place there's no
sim in place and the back cover is
separate still in a zip ered bag so you
can see what that looks like right there
let's take a look at the front first of
all you've got this ginormous screen
with a really really nice front facing
camera front speaker and front buttons
I'm not really impressed with the way
that Motorola does their button layout
I'm used to having home over here on the
side so I think that may come into might
be a little bit problematic for me but
the buttons are there and that's what's
important they are capacitive they're
not actually physical buttons on the you
know that you have tactile feedback when
you push them down which I like gives
you a nice clean feel to it we've got
the menu button the home button back and
search very modest branding for verizon
and motorola and then of course we've
got a microphone input right there let's
go ahead and look at the cover that was
on that put that back here just for a
minute and it doesn't have to be perfect
so we've got this we've got the the
power and lock screen up here on the top
which is right there we've got also the
ambient light sensor over here we've got
a headphone jack right there we've got
volume up and down on the opposite side
from what i'm a custom so we'll see how
that works out it should still be pretty
good because it's right there underneath
the index finger rather than under Neath
the thumb so it should work out pretty
well over on this side we've got a micro
USB and an hdmi out so you can port the
the screens and whatnot
from your your phone here your
smartphone to your big-screen TV if you
want so really kind of cool moving
around over here we've got a microphone
hole and the reason I put this back down
is because it has these little notes
says for best audio quality do not cover
make sense but apparently they've been
having some problems with cases and
whatnot covering the holes so looking at
the bottom it's nice and clean and empty
looking over here on the side and then
into the back compartment in the back
we've got our bar code information we've
got our battery contacts we've got our 8
megapixel autofocus camera that also
does 1080p video you heard that right
1080p we'll get some samples of that in
our next video so you can see what that
1080p looks like and compared to some of
the others that we've shot we also have
a 16 gig class for micro SD card and
then while I'm here let's go ahead and
install our sim now this is a cdma
device but because it is LTE it has a
sim now you can also see my ulterior
reason for putting that screen protector
back in place now this is one of the
most Awkward sim setups I've ever seen
but once you get everything lined up it
slides right in just like that getting
that out is not that easy but hey you
know what's once it's in there it's in
there you're probably never going to be
swapping it so make sure that that SD
card is in really tight take your
battery again if you didn't watch the
first video which if you haven't
subscribed to our channel so you don't
miss this kind of stuff this is a 1735
milliamp hour battery so very large
capacity in a very small form factor go
ahead and put that in it's very snug if
you need to remove the battery there's a
little notch right over here it does say
battery removal here just stick your
finger nail in there and lift up and
with a little bit of prying it comes out
let's go ahead and take the back panel
out here move that aside now this has a
bump out on the top just like a lot of
the droids do and that's to accommodate
the the camera up there on the top we
also have a little Mike hole on the
bottom
and there's your external speaker
overall very nice it feels kind of
rubbery so it should be really easy to
grip and then there we go so let's go
ahead and close this guy up bottom first
making sure we get all the sides pushed
down nice and snug now also on the back
you'll notice there's another hole
warning indicator for best quality don't
cover that and then of course a little
protector for the motorola logo there's
a 4G LTE logo verizon logo and a google
logo and other than that it's a very
clean back side to this the heft this
thing is not how to get this out of the
way because it's crinkling too much this
is not light but it's not as heavy as I
thought it would be for such a large
screen device and something that holds
such a powerhouse now this is a
dual-core processor so you'll want to
stay tuned to our later videos so you
can get the the results of those in our
benchmarking tests but overall this
thing is fabulous and phenomenal go
ahead and do a okay was mentioning
before will do the 1080p video sample in
an upcoming video and we're also going
to do the the software video including
the apps that come with it and the
benchmarks on it as well overall I'm
really impressed with this device it's
very large compared to some of the
others especially compared to that HTC
Wildfire s that we just reviewed but
this is the feature phone this is
fabulous it's great it is the top of the
line that you can get from Motorola
verizon today and we're eager to show
you more about it so make sure you
subscribe and tune back in do you like
the video give it a thumbs up if you
want to see more give it a thumbs up and
if you want to see the full review as
soon as we have that ready for you head

showing off the hardware of the motorola
droid bionic for Verizon 4G LTE I'm Joe
