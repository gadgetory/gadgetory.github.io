Motorola's Moto X is that you're not
stuck with just plastic you can get it
in a variety of finishes including wood
and even real leather that latter option
is the one I chose and after three
months of almost daily use I've learned
a few things about life with a leather
phone I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
and this is your moto X 2014 durability
report leather edition now we've had
some time with the wooden Moto X as well
thanks to our friends at AT&amp;amp;T but
because I haven't used this bamboo
version nearly as often or as long as my
personal leather device we'll have to
wait to get some more impressions on
that this report will focus solely on
the navy blue leather edition like most
high-end smartphones of 2014 the Moto X
uses Gorilla Glass 3 display protection
and while it's tough it's not
unscratched ball this small ding came
from a hip level dropped to the floor
that ended in a facedown slide and while
it could have been much worse it's still
a reminder that screen protectors are
probably a good idea the aluminum side
rails look to be undamaged on my
particular unit but keep in mind it is a
soft metal and won't do well if smashed
into concrete flipping around to the
back we see the real cost of leather as
a phone casing the hore wean material is
soft and therefore quick to show
impressions I'm not even sure of the
origin of many of these scuffs this one
has been there since my first week of
owning the phone while others have shown
up since some look like impressions from
the folded fabric of a pocket others are
probably pock marks from putting the
phone down on sand or even crumbs still
others look to be fingernail impressions
and at least one of these is probably
from pulling the phone from a too tight
pair of jeans they don't look bad you
expect some of this with a leather phone
after all it's just that I thought
they'd fade after a time and so far they
don't look to be doing so
another aspect is tougher to illustrate
but easy to feel the leather gets tacky
after a while I'm a pretty clean guy but
skin oil is a fact of life and when the
phone collects enough of it especially
in humid weather you get a little bit of
stick that sounds gross but maybe this
sounds even grosser it's not always a
bad thing with all the smooth slick very
droppable phones out there a little
tackiness is actually welcome and it
also feels like nothing else on the
market
so it's both practically and palpably
unique which is in keeping with the Moto
X philosophy on the whole so the
occasional cleaning is probably an order
and while I can't verify them personally
we've seen reliable reports of saddle
soap being safe to use on the Moto X
with mink oil also suggested by some as
always use at your own risk
not all leather even whore ween leather
is created equal so your mileage may
vary with different colors of Moto X but
from what we've seen of the models we've
come across the leather trim of
Motorola's 2014 flagship is a good fit
for those who can tolerate and even
enjoy a little visible wear and tear on
their smartphone it certainly beats
scratched up plastic or dented metal
after all and the totally unique feel in
hand goes a long way toward making up
for any scuffs or scrapes folks go ahead
and check out our full review of the
Moto X here on YouTube stay tuned for
the after the buzz re review of the Moto
X this coming January and be sure to let
us know how your experience with the
leather bound flagship is going down in
the comments below
till next time there's been Michael
Fisher with pocket now captain two
phones on Twitter reminding you that
putting a case on a moto X is like
putting a hat over a nice hairdo you
just shouldn't we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
