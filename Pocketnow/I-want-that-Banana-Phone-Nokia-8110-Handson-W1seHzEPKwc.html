phone that everybody's acclaiming but
what I see here opens the door to one of
my favorite movies of all time fun fact
I saw this scene in the matrix and I
immediately went crazy trying to buy
this phone and never could I'm Jaime
metal-y when I was pocketing now here
with some late coverage of MWC 2018 and
let's talk about the reboot to the nokia
8110 brought to you by invisible shield
okay I have to admit that there are a
ton of things that are awesome about the
new Nokia that hmd has been pushing
they've managed record sales last year
and the whole approach to retro phones
has been awesome but don't get 8110 4G
is the new old kid in town now bonus
thing you probably didn't know and which
I didn't either until right now is that
the original 8110 didn't have a sprint
assistant slider like you see in the
movie and nor does this one the old
plastic also seems stronger than what we
get today but that one was also a lot
more expensive than this one if you're
asking yourself why go buy a feature
phone well you can turn this into a 4G
hotspot that lasts for days you can also
carry it in areas where you only want to
get phone calls or feel safer not
exposing your smartphone best of all
it's just 79 euros yeah
just one payment of 79 euros actually we
have a full t9 numeric keypad a
headphone jack that supports FM radio
tuning like most lectures don't these
days and you can remove the battery like
you can on flagships today now there are
things you probably won't care about
like the UI provided by kai OS or the 2
megapixel camera that obviously performs
as low as its resolution and sure you
can play snake on it and actually have
fun in the process but this film wasn't
really designed for anything that
current phones do think about it as
markets in Africa are more than 90
percent feature phone and why not do it
in style
right a Nokia 8110 will be available in
two color options banana yellow and
black and by the way yes the yellow is
pretty much identical to the one we
loved on Nokia windows phones and it'll
be available in May in both Europe and
China let us know what you think about
the Nokia 80 110 in the comments we'd
love to know if you'd be willing to buy
it
and while you're at it here's a word
from our sponsor
friends our coverage of MWC in barcelona
actually continues we've got more videos
who follow us on social medias to
stretch our channel for more videos like
this one learn more about an invisible
shield and link in the description we
thank them for making this coverage
possible you know so follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscored our and it's
the granite hi Natalie better please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
what you saw
I'm how you marry that I think so much
for watching we'll see you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
