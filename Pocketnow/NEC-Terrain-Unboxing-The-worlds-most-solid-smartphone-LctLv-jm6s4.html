specifications that you're gonna start
seeing showing up on your handheld
devices today we're going to unbox and
do a quick Hardware walk-around of the
NEC terrain-following in the trend of
durable devices we have a new entrant by
NEC this is the NEC terrain and
according to the box it's made for real
life let's go ahead and crack it open
after we do a quick look around the box
just it says durable it says rugged to
me we'll go ahead and open this up
here's the device this is an 88 ante
package device so you can see right
there it's got nice cover on it don't if
you want to open and close the back
cover blah blah blah we'll show you a
little bit about that later let's look
inside the box
we'll just lift that out lift the next
layer out and dump stuff all over the
ground apparently they've got stuff
hiding away in these little cubbies here
so there's our product safety and
warranty statement we've got our AT&amp;amp;T
Quick Start Guide we have a terrain made
for hard work kind of brochure that has
some really really nice-looking pictures
of the device close-up kind of sells you
the device after you've already bought
the device so that's kind of interesting
whether or not this is just for us so we
can highlight the details or whether
this is something you'll get in your box
I don't know but we'll cover some of
those as well here we've got our NEC
branded battery this is three point
seven volt 1900 milliamp hour and seven
point zero three watt hour according to
the specs right there we've also got a
wall wart rich charger there set that
aside and we'll find what fell on the
floor here and that is our USB cable
nothing rugged about this it's just your
standard USB to micro USB cable so we'll
set that aside and let's take a look
over here at the phone take this off it
looks like we're just gonna slide it out
rather than open it up
the first thing that I'm noticing this
is a very grippy texture this is if
really feels quite nice in hand it looks
like a regular device with a keyboard on
the bottom that's in a case however
rather than something that's designed
and built all together it's got a nice
closed headphone port up there so you
can keep the dust and grit and whatnot
out of it there is your camera I haven't
read the specs on that right let you
know what they were open that up there's
your micro USB with it's nice intrusion
proof gasket power button on the side
it's got a nice little recessed a little
scalloped here all along this edge in
fact all across the bottom where your
microphone is and up this other side
there's your speaker button another
rugged II feeling button and then a
volume rocker and then we're back up to
the top where I forgot to mention we
have your noise cancelling microphone on
the back we can use this little lever to
either free or lock the battery in place
the back cover so we'll go ahead and
lift that up and not an easy task to do
it's got this gasket to seal all around
it does have little contact points here
for antennas or something that's that's
back here your SIM if I can get to it is
way up in here a little pull handle
there to get it out this one's already
Friedan pretty installed because it is
our review unit we'd like to thank NEC
for sending this out to us and letting
us take a look at it for you you also
have a micro SD card slot right over
here that this unit does not have
anything in but it should be relatively
easy to get to here you've got contacts
for the the back plate and then contacts
for the battery so let's go ahead and
place the battery in the phone make sure
I'm getting this the the right way don't
pet it right first time we'll just set
it down there it fits relatively well
can't help but notice there's a lot of
empty space all around the battery might
be nice if they filled that up with
battery but 1800 milliamp hours seems a
little bit small and go ahead and push
that gasket down will switch that switch
over to lock
and now let's power this up I've got the
AT&amp;amp;T logo here we've got the NAC logo on
first boot I've got a vibration there as
well more AT&amp;amp;T logo information now
while we're waiting for that to boot
these keys feel very very nice and a one
complaint that a lot of people out in
the field have is you know they might
have dirty fingers and touching on that
screen it's just gross you know you've
got dirt and grit and whatever on your
fingers you don't want to get that on
your screen or it's not easy to get
recognition as guys who work computers
all day we have clean fingers but if
you're working out in the field and
construction you know you might not hear
it says we need to tap twice don't know
why that is but let's go ahead and
unlock different kind of an unlocker
right there once we get in there we've
got a relatively small screen but it
looks fairly stock Android like let's go
ahead and take a look over here in our
settings a little bit different in here
and we'll come down to about phone all
the way the bottom the version that this
comes with is Android version 4.0.4
that's Ice Cream Sandwich and we'll go
back very small buttons down here I
would have expected these buttons to be
there a little bit bigger or capacitive
down in this area but you know you got
to make some concessions when you're
talking about making it durable phone so
there's a first look at hardware
walk-around of the NAC terrain now I'm
gonna use this as my daily driver for
the next few days and come back with
another video so I can show you guys a
little bit more about the software how
it looks how it performs and how it
stacks up against some of the other
rugged devices that we showed you just
recently if you missed those make sure
you click one of these links over here
so you can see Michael Fisher's video
talking all about some very rugged very
cool devices as well if you like what
you saw here please give the video a
thumbs up make sure you share this with
your friends on all your social media
we're there you should be too while
you're at it head over to our new forums
at forums not pocketnow.com for
PocketNow I'm Joe Levi thanks for
