and i just got a package from fedex i
think it's the mytouch 4G alright so
let's take a look at what comes inside
the package taking it out now this is
very unusual packaging for an android
phone generally speaking you've got a
box and it either lifts up or lifts off
this case it's just a wrap it's got the
branding on the side some information on
the back top and bottom are open and
then of course it's got your unique
identifying barcode type information on
the side so that's going to vary by box
I won't show you that but we'll go ahead
and slide this out now the first thing
you're going to notice is a very
nice-looking case with a little looks
like a little metal piece down there
that says my which is that the team look
a tmobile logo for the mytouch series of
phones kind of squishy kind of nice
let's go ahead and open this up with the
zipper open that out okay the first
thing we've got is a pretty good
presentation of stuff so let's go two
cables since we're always interested
these are white cables which is kind of
unusual generally speaking the cables
are black in color we've got headset no
magnetic stuff here like zune just
regular headsets with squishies and clip
attached looks like you've got foam
squishies as well as the silica style
squishies if you like those a little bit
better take off the white rubber band
here and we'll go down fairly long
toward for a headset you do have the
controls right there forward back play
pause and your phone buttons of course
this is also your microphone for your
headset and then a rather large
comparatively speaking headphone jack
down there most of the time these are
getting smaller and smaller Apple can I
started that with their their ipod
series of devices this is
a little bit bigger which I kind of like
it's got little raised edges here to
help pull that out so it might be a
little bit easier to use still not big
not bulky like they used to be way back
in the olden days but let's go ahead and
keep looking next thing is we've got
this USB cable and it is a micro USB
nice rounded edges again with that
little lip there to help you pull on
both sides so that's kind of nice move
on we've got our power wall wart it's
got a nice cover over here it's a little
hard to come off this is a US phone so
it's got the u.s. style prongs not
grounded but most of them are not and
then of course your USB port for
charging they're really nice looking I
like this it's not quite as small as
some of the others that I've seen but
still looks very good and with it being
a all white too to match kind of the
other accessories it's kind of cool so
let's move on to the paperwork because I
know you guys watch these videos just so
you can see the paperwork so we'll go
ahead and get that out of the sleeve
we've got a getting started guide the
mytouch 4G collection terms conditions
return policy limited warranty and of
course what's becoming more and more
standard is a prepaid mailing label so
you can send back your old phone for
recycling or repurposing so that's kind
of cool if you guys haven't done that
before I highly recommend that you do
that gives your phone new life and it
keeps it out of the landfill so there's
your be friendly to the environment plug
for the day let's go ahead and move
along and we have the device itself will
go ahead and lift that out and I'm going
to just set that to the side while we
look and see there is not anything extra
but you do have a couple extra pockets
in here and whatnot so that's really
nice we'll go ahead and move the case
out of the way and onto the phone so
here is the phone we'll just do an
initial look around first of all it is
white with black on the front silver
accents which is really nice fitting in
the hand it fits pretty nicely not quite
as nice as say the the HTC Desire HD
does you know they could do a little bit
more beveling on these edges but you do
have a nice glass front with plastic and
actual physical buttons which is unusual
rather than the capacitive buttons you
have a volume button over here on the
side this is a feels like it functions
like a true rocker now here's something
very unique reminiscent of the Nexus and
that's those three gold dots don't know
what they're for but I am suspecting
that this is to allow for some docking
whether that's a desktop dock or more
slightly a car dock for GPS and whatnot
I bet they're going to use those just
like the nexus one did there is your
micro USB port and it kind of stands out
from this rounded back relatively well
we've also on the back of the phone got
your speaker your camera and flash and
just looking really fast the the camera
is 5 megapixel it does have auto focus
and zoom so that's kind of cool and then
we've got them nice back panels which
feels like it is metal we'll get to that
in a minute over here on the side we've
got a camera button up on top power and
headphone jack the front of the device
of course has a your speaker has some
mytouch branding on it and then of
course your front facing camera which is
one of the selling points for this
device so kind of cool down on the
bottom we've got home menu back and the
the Google search or the my search or
the whatever button you want to call
that that is the google genius or that
the t-mobile genius button and then of
course an action button on the bottom
you just have a very simple microphone
and that is it so let's go ahead and
open this puppy up so very easy that is
in fact aluminum and this is the mytouch
4g white to inside we've got a battery
we've got a push the SD card to release
so it pops out rather than lifts up
what's coming standard with most devices
anymore is this Samsung eight gig micro
SD it is class two so that comes with
this it comes with a sim card now this
is a review unit from t-mobile so
they're giving us the unit to try and
they're also including a sim so i'm
going to use their sim with their their
wireless plan so it doesn't come off of
my plan
um and of course their phone number as
well I'll wire that up to google voice
so that my phone calls will still come
through to it and whatnot during the
testing period but they've been gracious
enough to provide us this unit to test
and of course our results or our results
and not theirs so let's look at the
battery now lifts out pretty well
there's your water damage indicator on
the phone and then another one on the
battery standard battery this one is a
1400 milliamp hour so a little bit
smaller than the nexus one but a good
chunk bigger than that of the desire HD
so we'll go ahead and put that back see
how this back plate fits if I don't drop
it don't do that at home now one thing
this kind of stands out so i'll show it
to you right here on the lip is what
looks like damage to the the back plate
i don't know if you can see that well in
the video or not but it looks kind of
like it's been pried up or folded up
that's okay that's that's supposed to be
there that actually blends in with the
surround around the camera so don't
worry about that it's just kind of one
of those weird things when you look at
you think oh no I've bent my phone but
no it's actually okay and it's good so
there you go the unboxing and hardware
