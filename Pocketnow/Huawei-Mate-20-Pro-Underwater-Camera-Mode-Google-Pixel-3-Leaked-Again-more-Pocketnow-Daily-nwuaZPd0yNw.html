huawei mate 20 pro were just revealed
and we even see an underwater mode
samsung has just launched the Galaxy a7
the first triple camera phone from the
company and that doesn't look bad at all
in the Google pixel 3 and pixel 3 XL
were accidentally on sale a little while
ago along with the knotch I'm Jaime
Rivera and this has been a really good
start for the Champions League for those
of you following I'm looking forward to
more this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with all right
let's just call it deals because what it
is is really more of a bundle for those
of you in the market for the Sony Xperia
z3 iPhone that I'm waiting to review
which I know it's only been distributed
in the UK by the way my buddy staff has
a really great video so far yea
currently available on Amazon and it's
full glory
the problem is the price it's 900 bucks
but then you'd get the Xperia a dual
earphones which I actually need to
review as well now let's talk about
Apple for those of you wanting to know
details on the internals of the iPhone
10 s they have just been revealed the
battery is 26:58 milliamp hours it I
don't know how Apple figures out how to
make those batteries as smaller and get
those weird numbers in the milliamp
hours but yes it's smaller than the
iPhone 10 according to sources that are
experts in this the seven nanometer
process will allow more power efficiency
and therefore it allows for a smaller
battery yeah I'm not sure that why not
just get the same sized battery and get
better battery life like seriously now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy a7
which was just announced in Asia price
tags are actually extremely aggressive
you can learn more in the description
most important is the fact that we've
got three cameras in the design actually
doesn't look so bad we've got a primary
regular camera the other one is a
wide-angle if I'm reading this right in
addition to then a depth sensor on the
other I wish the other one would have
been a telephoto and then just figure
out how to make that a def sensor or
whatever but yeah you can learn more
about this phone in the description so
far it means that triple cameras are the
thing coming next year now let's move
the spotlight over to the most leaked
phones in history after the iPhone 4 the
google pixel three pixel 3x
they were pretty much posted on sale at
JT comm temporarily and the press
photographs look legit this actually
looks like something that would come
from Google that shows us that the long
island notch is a thing it's actually
coming and yeah specifications details
everything was there that I was pulled
so stay tuned for more information and
finally the hot news that they have to
do with the huawei mate xx Pro oh my god
like the season is great I've got so
many awesome phones being announced and
well there's an apk tear down that
reveals the camera modes on this phone
and apparently there's a new edition on
underwater mode for you to be able to
use the camera buttons or the other
hardware buttons in order to take photos
underwater so those of you that don't
know you can't really use a capacitive
screen underwater and so taking photos
is kind of a nightmare and then Huawei
has this weird combination for you to be
able to launch the camera whenever the
screen is off which for me is just so
annoying
but anyways let us know in the comments
what do you think about this possible
mode how often do you use your phone to
take photos underwater because I to be
fully honest never have leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us I'm
