public Google's Nexus 5 rumors focus on
the camera and table will makes their
launch of LT now official I'm hi
Marietta enjoying the marvels of a power
outage in our third world country and
this is out daily let's start
this week off talking about the nexus 5
we've got two sets of rumors for this
device on one hand we have a 5.2 inch
display with a 1080p resolution
obviously we have the stamp dragon 800
powering this device 3 gigabytes of
storage along with all the bells and
whistles even front firing speakers but
then on the other side we have a smaller
device 5 inches in the display still
1080p but the snapdragon 600 like we
have on the HTC One two gigabytes of RAM
and still the front firing speakers now
either of these rumors are probably both
are being made by LG no matter what the
case is probably we have two prototypes
or we're probably get to Nexus devices
this time but most interesting is the
fact that they're working on a
revolutionary camera technology for this
device and the question of that will be
hardware or software will keep you
posted and speaking of Google let's
continue talking of more Motorola X
phone rumors remember we had a lineup of
devices being rumoured last week not
just one device and apparently we
already have three code names the
motorola ghosts and also the Yeti and
the Sasquatch and apparently these three
devices are slated to launch on AT&amp;amp;T not
verizon as it's usually the case with
the new motorola devices that always get
launched but the interesting point here
is that sadly these devices are being
slated to launch with jellybean not
android 5.0 so for those of you that
were waiting for something big happening
at Google i/o I don't think it's gonna
be Motorola I now let's talk about
Microsoft the company has pretty much
slated their plans for windows phone 8
and Windows Phone 7.8 in the future and
of course Windows Phone 9 as is expected
Microsoft has confirmed that they will
continue with their plan to support both
operating systems for 18 months and
since we remember that Windows Phone 8
was out first in Windows Phone 7.8 and
both these operating systems will pretty
much died by fall of 2014 obviously we
will have Windows Phone 9 before that
what can be expected well pretty much
those phone 7.8 devices will be end of
life as of then and then windows phone 8
devices since they don't have any of the
hardware restrictions that we had in the
past devices will be slated for Windows
Phone 9 now we all know how that story
plays out so let's just wait and see
what happens it's really cool what
Microsoft is doing obviously the
timelines can come any sooner and let's
move over to t-mobile for those of you
waiting for their real 4G LTE network to
be launched to the United States well
with equipment already being installed
in Kansas City and Las Vegas it is
expected for either of these two cities
to get the network before the end of
this month or probably both of them
which is really cool but for those of
you wondering which devices are going to
support 4G LTE out of the box well we do
know that the galaxy s4 will be one of
the devices late April but for those of
you that want 4G LTE now the device that
has the radio dormant is the samsung
galaxy note 2 so that device just
received an update today make sure you
upgrade your phone to enable the LTE
radio to work for whenever this happens
sadly for those of you expecting that to
happen on the galaxy s3 well there is a
new galaxy s3 out there that will
support the 4g LTE on t-mobile but not
the previous generation galaxy s3 so
sorry for you and obviously there will
be more devices coming up in the future
though we still don't have a specific
timeline stay tuned obviously this is a
work in progress and finally for the hot
news of the day Samsung has just
confirmed their plans for android 5.0
even though Google has pretty much not
laid the plans for their own operating
system themselves but they have
confirmed that obviously this year's
devices will be getting the upgrade the
galaxy s4 the Galaxy Note 8 and they've
also confirmed on last year's devices of
being the Galaxy Note 10.1 the Galaxy
Note 2 and the galaxy s3 now the sad
news is there is a last year's device
being the galaxy s3 mini that will not
receive this upgrade nor will the note 1
or the galaxy s2 be receiving this
update as well even though their
hardware is kind of capable for it
anyways but that leads me to the
question of the day are you upset with
the fact that the previous generation
devices galaxy s2 galaxy note 1 were not
be getting this upgrade sadly this is
the story with Android regardless of the
OEM it's kind of
because you know that the iphone 3gs
which is pretty much almost five years
old still supports iOS 6 or at least
part of it but at least there is
something out there we do know that some
older or current generation android
devices made by samsung will be getting
a feature pack that makes it feel like
android 5.0 Adly we don't have any good
news for you so leave us a comment down
below what do you think I honestly don't
like it of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone it's a
parole make sure you follow us on varga

channel as well let's give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
