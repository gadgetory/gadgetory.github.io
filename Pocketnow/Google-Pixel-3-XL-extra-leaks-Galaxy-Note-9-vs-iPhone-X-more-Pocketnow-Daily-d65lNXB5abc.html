Excel booted up and with new surprises
it looks like the iPhone 10 just beat
the Galaxy Note 9 at least then some
type of benchmarks and TCL is cooking
something up pretty nostalgic and it has
the palm name on it I'm Jaime Rivera and
yesterday was crazy it's about to get
crazier but for now let's get back to
the regular scheduled programming this
is pocket out daily enjoying a Friday
the official news today begin with deals
of for the Galaxy Note 8 because
obviously it's on its way out
now we already discussed yesterday all
the BOGO deals and everything that
carriers are offering but if you just
want to get the phone outright unlock in
the case of the node 8 $686 unlocked on
ebay obviously it doesn't work on CDMA
carriers you can learn more about the
deal in the description now let's talk
about TCL as the company is famous for
what it's done for blackberry but
apparently that's not the only nostalgia
is cooking up it's working on a new
project reportedly called palm papito
for those of you in Latin American
countries please don't laugh yeah
alright 720p display at 3.3 inches
android oreo of 800 million power
battery i'm trying to understand exactly
what this is the leaks are kind of bogus
but if it's true guys come up with
another name trust me now let's talk
about Oppo as the company had been
teasing the Oppo f9 for a bit that whole
water drop design on the display that
was gonna look a lot like what we see in
the essential phone now the product is
pretty much official August 15 seems to
be the launch we're still waiting on
what markets that's going to be
apparently there will also be a pro
variant so stay tuned because that
screen is a scratching 93 percent
screens of body ratio I believe I hope
the numbers are right yeah I can't wait
to see more of that now let's talk about
benchmarks I don't believe in those
numbers and you know that because
everything changes when you use products
in the real world but some new ones from
Geekbench showed that in multi-core
performance the iPhone 10 beats the
Galaxy Note 9 that just got announced
which is rather weird nearly by 2,000
points apparently next is the 1 plus 6
which is also even I don't know I
nothing to say you know that these
benchmarks never really work well
between operating systems particularly
iOS and Android obviously I'm no expert
chime in the comments I would love to
hear more about what you guys think
and finally the hottest and definitely
most bogus news today have to do with
the Google pixel 3 excel as a the same
tipster from the past shows us now a
video where the phone boots up that's
working and guess what we've got a
single camera at the back we already
knew that but apparently that notch in
the front is so large because it has
three cameras why I mean let's just jump
into the comments section and let us
know guys what do you think those three
cameras are for if real cuz in my case
you know those other rumors were all
these leaks were bogus and Google just
fabricated this phone just to keep us on
the out of the loop of what they want us
to see they're starting to hold more
real to me leave us a comment down below
we let us know your opinion
