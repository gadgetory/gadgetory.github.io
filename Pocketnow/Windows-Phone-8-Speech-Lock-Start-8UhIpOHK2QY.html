packing.com I'm going to show you
something new about Windows Phone 8
let's check it out all right in this
video we're gonna take a look at this
speech UI the lockscreen and the new
start screen on Windows Phone 8 so let's
start with the speech UI
this is one of my favorites hold down
the windows key now it's gonna start
listening so I don't want to do that I'm
gonna hit the question mark to show us
what the commands are now some of these
are familiar we've seen these before
however there's new one here called note
so you say note and then blah blah blah
whatever you want the note to be and it
will create a one note note in your
unfiled notes pages with whatever
message you spoke transcribed to text as
well as a voice recording which is
pretty nice so you can still open apps
and text people and respond to instant
messages from Facebook on Windows Live
Messenger all that still works however
does something really cool is on the
apps if you install an app that adds
voice commands to the speech interface
you'll see it here and you can choose an
app to see more about what you can say
with that command and then there's more
you can do things while you're on the
call so let's try one of these
Urbanspoon find pizza
Pizza food that's the type of food that
pizza eats there go and this is all
accessible from a Bluetooth headset so I
could just I could not even meet
touching the phone and just press the
voice dialing button on a Bluetooth
headset or you know a car kit and it
would return this results and you can
see stuff there now you don't even have
to be in the Start screen or whatnot we
can do this from anywhere audible play
sex in the city so from there I was in
some separate app and then I decided to
play an audio book so there you go let's
go for the speech options here's my
settings and from here you can choose
whether you want to always on or just
Bluetooth or all that usual stuff you
can change the voice and you can change
the language and this is pretty cool you
can actually download other languages
for the speech UI okay next up the
lockscreen let me show it off again show
you that so if you can see this this is
a special lock screen from HTC and it
shows the weather up here the degrees
and this is actually this back on image
changes depending on what the weather is
that's a custom one I'm going to show
you in the settings here's our lock
screen so up here you have background
and I can actually choose from some apps
that have extended the lock screen
background image options you got Bain
that'll do like a photo of the day from
Bain
Facebook is interesting now to get the
options for the lock screen for a
specific app
we have another little button there and
from here I can choose which Facebook
photos I want to show and maybe a
different style maybe we want a blue on
the bottom so that it you can still read
everything CNN will do like a headline
news photo so there's there's lots of
options here and obviously any app can
add to this now we also have
customizations for the data on the
lockscreen
so I can choose calendar CNN will show a
headline Facebook will show my current
status you can show emails messaging and
phone status lots of options there and
we also have you can customize the
little icons at the bottom these are the
little icons that show a number of how
many new notifications there are so if
you want to change one you just tap it
and then you can choose a different
email account or games notifications
there's that and Facebook suppose leave
we might see Twitter there but it's not
there yet
it all depends on what the app
developers allow to be shown there so
lastly let's go back to the Start screen
and this is has some new stuff you've
probably seen it before though we have
all sorts of we have three different
sizes for your life tiles so you tap and
hold like usual and you can move them
this way and you can unpin them with
that little button and there's a new
little arrow that makes you resize it
and then touch it again to lock it in
and you can see third-party apps can do
their new larger live tiles as well all
of the existing apps already have a
square and a small square but the big
one is a new option and you can see as
the anime
the motion is a little bit a little bit
different it kind of bounces a little
kind of a subtle but cool addition so
these we can all resize and obviously
you can arrange them any way you want
so you can leave some negative space if
you want some blank areas so much more
customizable for the Start screen that's
a quick look at the speech UI the new
lockscreen customization options and the
Start screen on Windows Phone 8 stay
tuned for more and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
