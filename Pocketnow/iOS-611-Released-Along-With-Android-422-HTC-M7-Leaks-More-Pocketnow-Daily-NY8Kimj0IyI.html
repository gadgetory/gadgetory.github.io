news for jailbreakers Android 4.2.2 also
gets released and we go hands-on and how
many HTC m7 s are there I'm high memory
beta and I'm getting tongue twister with
all these numbers this is PocketNow
daily that's right iOS 6.1 point one
gets released and I love these names and
well to our surprise even though it does
include some bug fixes for the iPhone 4s
when it comes to 3G it's interesting to
see that Apple did not patch the
jailbreak meaning you can use evasion
just remember you will have to pretty
much return to stock well upgrade then
jailbreak again you can't just do it
from one place to the other but hey at
least it's there and then we've got
Android 4.2.2 getting released and we
just love that number even though Google
isn't specific as to which performance
enhancements or bug fixes we are getting
it is available for some excess devices
so make sure you upgrade at butshe watch
your Levi's full video walkthrough of
Android 4.2.2 for all the details and
then we've got some more galaxy s4
rumors we know that it's being coated
project J but apparently there is more
than one device being released probably
at the same time
apparently there is this device codename
settle I know which is a Spanish name
and apparently that would be the Galaxy
s4 mini or just hoping that says they're
probably going to be launched at the
same time but this will be just a
smaller version of the Galaxy s4 and not
really just the crop down beat down old
mid tier device but we'll keep you
posted
now nokia has made rumor mill a lot more
interesting lately as we've been
speculating over a Nokia tablet for over
a year now and now Nokia has this event
in Pakistan for a launch and apparently
we've got some Nokia tablets on the
walls being shown off as part of the
arts you know nothing really big but
could that really be the fact that we
are getting a Nokia tablet very soon
well and WC could be the case and
finally for the interesting news of the
day we've been recently debating whether
the design of the HTC m7 will be the
oldest sign that we saw with the weird
grilles at the top and the bottom or the
newer design that we saw that looks a
lot like the HTC Windows Phone 8x well
we've got some new leaks showing off the
old design with the grilles and some
arts and even though we were thinking
that this could probably be a
apparently there have been new rumors
that confirm that it is for real so
could it be that we're getting more than
one device as well well that leaves me
so the question of the day what would
you consider to be the HTC m7 the newer
8x design or the older two grille design
leave us a comment down below I honestly
like the 8x design a lot more but you'll
tell me which one you prefer and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet well wish you follow us on
 out comment subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw
I'm high memory that up thanks for
watching and stay tuned because our
BlackBerry z10 review should be live
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
