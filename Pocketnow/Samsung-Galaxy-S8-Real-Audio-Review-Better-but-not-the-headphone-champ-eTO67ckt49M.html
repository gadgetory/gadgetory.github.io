brought to you by the brand
Juan Carlos bag mail here for pocket now
and we've got to talk about the audio on
the Galaxy s8 specifically the galaxy si
plus to get part of the verdict out of
the way right now for those of you who
are way too impatient to really watch
this video this is a well improved phone
over any of its North American
predecessors for Qualcomm power galaxy
users at when seeing Samsung is taking
the audio on their devices a bit more
seriously starting off with the speaker
quality this is nicely nuanced and
detailed playback we're really pushing
the limits of what we can do with a
single mono bottom firing speaker but
Samsung is at the top of that list
enhanced water resistance should not
overly degrade speaker playback and to
show you what we mean we've got a couple
seconds of speaker samples that you can
take a listen to I know why you're
really watching this video and that's to
talk about the headphone game Samsung's
acquisition of harman seems to be
bearing fruit in the galaxy s8 is the
first phone to benefit from this renewed
focus on smart phone audio the amp
onboard gets a little louder it's going
to be a little bit better at driving
nicer headphones and all of the quality
numbers take a nice and substantial step
up we benefit from the full frequency
range of not only 24-bit but true 32-bit
playback this phone will produce
frequencies of sound that dogs cannot
hear and all of those important numbers
like your noise floor harmonic
distortion signal-to-noise ratio and
stereo crosstalk are all much improved
over the s7 s7 edge and the note 7 again
we're neck and neck with a phone like
the LG G 6 so both of these devices just
nipping at the heels of iPhones and HTC
10's phones with reputations at the high
end of the audio spectrum as a brief
aside what's hilarious is that this is
humongous news for North America and
galaxy owners whereas the g6 kind of
felt like a little bit of a
disappointment after phones like the V
20 it's all about that perspective and
all right now the clickbait enos of the
title of this video while this phone is
well improved over
Samsungs is obviously not going to
compare against the phone like the LGB
20 or even a phone like the axon 7 and a
lot of that comes down to the amp output
we still want a little bit more juice we
want a little bit more punch especially
when we're plugging in those nicer cans
we're talking about a premium premier
handset this is not a cheap phone but if
one of your primary uses for a smart
phone is to listen to audio this phone
has difficulty competing against devices
like the one plus 3t but ultimately
we've got to praise where praise is due
and it is really exciting to see Samsung
take that step up with a North American
Galaxy release and personally I'm just
stoked that it doesn't feel like some
kind of huge compromise when I plug in
my Sennheiser's hey folks if you're
looking to protect the glass on your
Galaxy s8 give it a little bit more grip
or prevent all of those gnarly
fingerprint smudges you should just wash
your hands head on over to D brand or
they've got a whole collection of really
awesome skins for you to customize the
look and feel of your Galaxy smartphone
and for those of you who were curious
about how the new AKG earbuds perform
we're going to have a separate short
video on this channel talking just about
these and how they might compare with
other solutions from other smartphone
manufacturers as always folks thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for our full Galaxy s8
and s 8 plus coverage we're going to
reviews in comparisons and all that fun
stuff you know we're going to dig deep
into this phone
we're PocketNow I'm Juan Carlos bag now
so I'm gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
