revealed at CES just arrived what do you
say let's get this thing out of the box
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is the pebble steel unboxing today
we're looking at pebble steel this is
the upgrade to the original pebble which
launched in spring of last year and this
was announced at CES just last month a
lot of people were upset with the actual
upgrades in this because they're very
far and few between internally there's
only double the storage the rest is
purely external so it has all the same
specifications the same display and
everything as the original and a lot of
people were upset about that but let's
get inside the box and see what it comes
with and what everything looks like of
course it's still in the cellophane
wrapping we're gonna need to rip that
off and move that to the side it looks
like the the Box took a little beating
in the transit but let's hope
everything's intact inside yeah it's
been jostled around a little bit so the
box opens up very easily and inside
we've got this nice white felt like
material with all the stuff inside so
get started at go to Volcom and it's
really nice it's actually like a jewelry
box more than me more than anything else
so we have a quick start guide here some
important product information
just your standard pamphlets and inside
this is the steel band so this is the
brushed steel there's also a PVD which
is black and it's not unlike the PVD
watch tab that I have on my old pebble
so we'll get to take a look at that in a
minute
and if we open this bottom flap down
here the bottom you have the new
charging cable and we'll get to that in
a minute as well leave that out of the
box and of course the pebble steel and
that's everything inside the box we'll
move that out of the way if you can pop
this off
and this is pebble steel as you can see
immediately it looks a lot more high-end
and classy than the original which was
made entirely of plastic and came with a
silicone watch strap so for 150 dollars
a lot of people had problems with that
this one no matter which color you buy
comes with two watched straps leather
one and a either steel or PVD watch
strap PVD coated they're both steel keep
saying that but yes they're both steel
one is black like a matte black and this
one is a brushed steel so no matter
which color you buy which face color you
buy it comes with to watch straps so
that's nice and we can take a look at
this one we'll take it out of the
wrapper really quickly take a look at it
and look at the clasp because I really
like the class I was looking at this at
CES it's just a button which is really
really nice a button that you push on
the side and it just comes open so
that's the the steel watch strap and
we'll we'll take it closer to look at
that in the review in the comparisons
also let's put this thing on a risk why
not right if it'll fit I have I've
generally can what it would are
considered to be large wrists so yeah it
fits with we've actually ruled a spare
that's nice
the ad fits I won't leave it on there
because it's hard to get the angle but
that's what it looks like on your wrist
and actually like this what this leather
strap I didn't think I would if I chose
one I would have chosen the PVD because
that's just my style I'm not big on silk
let's get it off here and actually take
a look at the boot process we'll take
this off it's not gonna make any noise
hello pebble and it says press and hold
it actually had instructions on their
present hold any button so it's like the
original well that boots up we're
actually going to do a little quick size
comparison with the original so you can
see that the actual length of the
faceplate is much much smaller and and
that's a that's a very good thing for
people with small wrists really doesn't
matter much for me because I do have
giant wrists you'll also notice we'll
bring it in close here that they've
changed the charging port so the
original one was longer and this one is
different so if you had the original
it's not gonna work with the new pebble
it is still magnetic but it's a
different connection so this one will
not work on the old pebble unfortunate
we don't want to get too deep into the
weeds with that this is the original
pebble we're gonna compare these two
later on this week so stay tuned for
that
for now we'll talk a little bit more
about this one before we go this one
like I said it has a little middle
pillar here between the two outside of
the pin and the downside of that is that
you can't use just any 22 centimeter
watch strap but the design is actually
open sourced so we might see some
third-party manufacturers making watch
straps for pebble steel which would be
very nice but one of the major updates
here is Gorilla Glass so it's no longer
plastic this is actually Gorilla Glass
so it hopefully hopefully it'll keep
from shattering but hopefully it'll help
stave some of those nasty nasty
scratches mine get just destroyed after
just a couple weeks but uh that's gonna
do it for now this is the unboxing of
pebble steel stay tuned for the full
review which should be live sometime
next week and as well as a comparison
with the original pebble steel I'm
Taylor Martin and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
