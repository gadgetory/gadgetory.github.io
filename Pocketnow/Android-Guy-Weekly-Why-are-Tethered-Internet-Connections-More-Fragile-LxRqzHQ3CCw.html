pocketnow.com recently michael fisher
asked a question why is his tethered
internet connection so much more fragile
than well just on his cell phone alone
it's an interesting question but a
little bit of an interesting answer
let's go take a look so here's our
scenario you're riding a train got your
cell phone in your pocket and you're
tethering turned on you've got your
tablet sitting on your lap and you're
reading the news or surfing your
favorite website which we all know is
pocketnow.com so you notice that
something happens and your articles
aren't coming up and it's a pain in the
neck because you just dropped connection
and it says that it can't load the page
well that's not our fault that's not
your phone's fault but it kind of is so
first let's talk about cellular phones
and how they work and I know this is
going to be like remedial cellular
telephony for most of us but hang out
with me because it applies so the way a
cell phone works is imagine circles
drawn on a map those circles are
essentially the radius or the diameter
or the area man I need to go back to
geometry where a cell phone signal can
reach with the point in the middle being
the cell phone tower itself fair enough
right well you start putting more cells
on the map and you start getting more
circles on the map and hopefully those
circles overlap because if they don't
you have holes you have gaps in your
coverage where you honestly you drop
calls to pain in the neck we've we've
been there we've done that we don't have
that much of a problem anymore we've got
pretty much blanketed coverage except
for weird areas you know where
topography kind of dictates that the
signals skip over the top of it or maybe
they don't reach the top of it or it's a
building and they bounce all around it
who knows but that notwithstanding
that's what cells are that's in fact why
we call themselves or just little round
circles on a map now what happens is
when you turn on your phone you connect
to the
sell that you're closest to not
necessarily you connect to the cell that
has the strongest signal which may not
be the one that you're closest to
ironically enough so that's a myth we
just dispelled right there one of the
nice things about cell phones is their
mobile I know you guys all know that but
did you ever wonder how that works
because if you're connected to your
closest cell tower at home and then you
hop in your car to go to work hop on
your bike get on a bus right a train
whatever you're still not connected to
that cell at your house you just can't
go that far it's not going to happen so
what happens how does it work well
ironically it's not like you think so as
you start leaving your cellular area
moving around in it that one cell that
you're connected to the signal gets
weaker and weaker and weaker the further
you get away from it well as you're
doing that the signals from other cells
become stronger and stronger now you
might be getting closer to two or three
cells that are stronger than the one
that you connected to originally and you
think that as soon as one signal becomes
stronger than the one that you're
connected to now you're going to hand
off most of the times that's not the
case instead what happens is your cell
phone will stay connected to the tower
that you were originally connected to as
long as it can until that signal drops
so poor that it can't maintain a
connection anymore it's going to stay
connected there even if there are two or
three or even four or five cells that
have a stronger signal now why does it
do that there are lots of reasons but
simply put it doesn't know if you're
going to move back to that original cell
that's one reason because if it if it
just hand it off willy-nilly like that
you'd be bounced back and forth between
cells very very quickly then then you've
got load balancing and whatnot of the
cells that are impacted you also have
that negotiation there's overhead
they're essentially the the cells which
have computers in them have to calculate
how to hand off your information to that
next one and there's a process involved
there the more times that happens the
more processing power it takes the more
electricity
it takes the slower it is for everybody
else yada yada yada so essentially those
two reasons you're going to stay
connected to that weak signal until it's
so weak that it can't handle you anymore
here's a downside to that first of all
your signal strength drops so your data
speeds drop really wasn't a big deal
with you know voice phones because
voices voice as long as your voice
quality is okay you're okay because a
voice conversation is a voice
conversation and no big deal data on the
other hand data varies significantly
your speed is going to fluctuate and
it's going to go down the further you
are away from that cell so we might want
to update our cell phone towers carriers
to handle that we'll come back to that
in a minute the second reason is battery
life you've got a battery inside there
okay and just nestled right inside your
phone there's a cell phone antenna too
well the further away you are from that
tower the stronger the signal is that
you have to send out which takes more
power so that you can maintain that
connection not of course eat your
battery faster so every once in a while
if you find yourself in that situation
turn your phone off or go into airplane
mode and come back up that will help
quite a bit so now we know how cell
signals handoff from one cell to another
and in normal activity that's you know
not a problem when we start getting on
to faster and faster modes of transit
whether that's a vehicle and of course
you're a passenger when you're using
your phone in your car right you're not
driving and using your phone sure hope
not there's your PSA for the day PSAs
public safety announcement so what about
when you're on a train or a bus or you
know some other form of mass transit
that goes kind of fast well here's
something interesting as you're moving
away from one cell and approaching
another cell again that handoff doesn't
happen until the original cell is so
weak that it just doesn't work anymore
by that point you may already be past
the the next greatest powerful cell that
doesn't make much sense because you're
already past it you should be looking
to the next one and kind of you know
leapfrog from one skip one to the next
one and possibly well you can't do that
right now so you're constantly being
shuffled from one cell to another cell
that's already behind you in a lot of
cases now here's the funny thing we have
the technology now that we could tell
the cell phone tower here's who I am and
here's where I'm going and here's my
speed and that cell tower has the
intelligence potentially to know he's on
the train therefore I want to make sure
that I'm passing him off to these cells
in this sequence as this goes on and it
would help boost the signal for
everybody now we're not doing that right
now why because it's going to require
new protocols both in the cellular
radios and new bits new new processes
inside the cells themselves it's not
being done it really should be but you
know what are you going to do so in the
meantime that's what we have that's okay
though because cell phones have this
tolerance built into them they know
they're a cell phone and they know that
they should expect this kind of behavior
so they minimize that impact on us so
it's more transparent we don't see it
that's where the fragility comes in okay
so back to our cell phone everything
works great here but as soon as you come
over here even though it's the same
internet connection things break so why
is that first reason you're adding
another layer of complexity you've got
Wi-Fi to deal with now you can have lots
of other people on the train or on the
bus or you know in the carpool lane next
to you then I'll have their Wi-Fi
bubbles on that are interfering with you
so now you've got Wi-Fi interference to
consider we're just going to skip past
that because there's really nothing you
can do about that changing channels and
whatnot but phones really don't have
that power that capability included in
them so what are you going to do the
next thing that we have of course is
this doesn't know you're on cellular it
does
have those tolerances it doesn't make
that experience transparent to you like
the cellular phone does kind of make
sense right this doesn't know if I'm
connected to my cell phone by tethering
or if I'm connected to my Wi-Fi point
here in my house or if we're connected
to say a mesh network at the college
campus or at my at my work compound it
doesn't know they're very different
types of networks but this treats them
all the same and there's a relatively
low level of Tolerance there so when a
problem happens you're more apps to see
it here than you are when you're on your
native device lastly and this might be a
little bit too obvious once I say it if
you're using this as your device that
you're tethered to where do you keep it
when you're using this when you're
surfing the web it's out here like this
guess what that antenna it's got free
rein you've got a stronger signal right
here when you're surfing the web on your
phone now I've got it in my holster or
in my pocket or in my bag or in my
briefcase and you know what I just lost
a whole bunch of signal strength by
putting it way down there I don't see
that though because I'm surfing the web
up here on my tablet so if I were to
take my phone have it in my hand and
just kind of keep it out here like this
and surf like this I'd look really silly
but I'd probably have a better
experience keep that in mind if you've
got fragile tethering experiences pull
out your cell phone set it down on the
tray next to you or the seat next you
just don't go off and leave it please
that's sad then we have to do a video on
what to do if your wife's phone gets
stolen you know all kinds of fun stuff
like that which we did by the way fun
story if you haven't seen it make sure
you go and do android get weekly but
three reasons why your tablet connection
or your laptop connection is more
fragile when you're tethering then your
cellphone connection in the same
location I hope you found it educational
I hope you learned something from it and
I hope it makes your tethering
experiences a little bit better of
course those are just a few of my
observations and a few of the tips that
I was able to put
other I want to hear some of your tips
so please if you've got any ideas any
extra technical information you'd like
to add some some stories that you have
of where tethering was problematic and
what you did to fix it head over to
pocketnow.com leave an article or leave
a comment on this article so that we can
all participate there in one place so
we've got a little bit of a problem
where a lot of us talk on the YouTube
comments and a lot of us talked on the
pocket now comments and they're separate
so I'm going to put a link right down
there if you're on the YouTube page
you'll know where I'm talking about if
you're on pocket now you're already
there don't worry about it but right
down there I'll have a link to this
article so you can put all of your
comments there and please do that's it
do you like it if so I want to know
again leave me a comment for pocket now
and the android guy weekly I'm Joe Levi
