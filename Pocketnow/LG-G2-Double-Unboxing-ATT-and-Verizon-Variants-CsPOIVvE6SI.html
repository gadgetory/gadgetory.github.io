global version of the company's latest
Android flagship and today we just
received carrier variants of that same
device one from Verizon Wireless and the
other from AT&amp;amp;T we're gonna do a little
double unboxing here taking both phones
out of their boxes and seeing what
changes the carriers have made to the
presentation of this device I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow this is your
double unboxing of the LG g2 for Verizon
Wireless in AT&amp;amp;T okay now just to
provide some context we have brought
back our box from yesterday this is the
where is it this is the original box
that we unboxed yesterday with this kind
of interesting little angular cut it's
almost an overbite but nothing else on
this this basically unbranded box saved
for the LG logo and the g2 branding you
can see that unboxing yesterday that
leaves us with the two carrier versions
here AT&amp;amp;T Verizon Wireless will go by
size Verizon Wireless is still the
largest carrier in the United States put
the 80 NPT box aside for now just to
show you though there is a significant
size difference it looks like Verizon's
shelf space in the retail stores is at a
premium maybe we don't know but we slide
this out of its sleeve here this is
definitely a premium presentation I'm
not sure how y'all are feeling about
this splatter paint job I kind of dig it
but we always like to see this sleeve on
the outside it just adds another layer
to the experience and let's have a look
and see what's included in the box if
verizon will tell us and if we can get
focused there that is doesn't look like
we're gonna see any headphones in here
unless I'm really missing something
let's see let's stop reading things and
let's just check it out nothing else on
the outside of the box except barcodes
which you do not need to see friends
there we go
here's the LG g2 for Verizon Wireless
different screen protector than we saw
yesterday and they get here we have a 4G
LTE SIM pre-installed over there the
little call-out for that will call out
for the headphone jack and the USB port
the Verizon branding is very very very
plain on this unit not quite as
ostentatious as we've seen on other
phones this is the same color let's see
if we can
oh yeah then we have some oh oh
customized volume keys let's check that
out let's put these side-by-side
see ya normally we do packaging first
but this volume key difference is so is
so striking and has gotten me so maybe
unreasonably excited that I wanted to
check that out so on the global Edition
here you can see the keys are big they
are the keys we remember seeing in the
New York City event I mean they're big
they're plenty of room for a finger
there with a little raised power standby
in the center with a ring light around
it now these and they're plastic
these would appear to be maybe they're
still plastic they don't quite feel like
metal but they look like they're they're
detailed you know they're detail
suggests that they're metal maybe also
you'll notice the ring around the camera
has that kind of radial pattern they're
similar to the one we saw in the earbuds
from from yesterday they're almost more
a finish that's in blue interesting to
see from Verizon which normally focuses
on red but maybe they don't want to
confuse this with the droid line and
finally just a wide look at the
detailing on the bodies of this unit
this is more like a denim finish kind of
a very very subtle stripe striped
pattern whereas Verizon has gone with a
finish that has more honeycomb it looks
stippled it looks textured but it is not
and then of course there's a Verizon 4G
LTE logos and since we are big fans of
removing plastic let's go ahead and do
that here we are and quiet please not
much stickiness on that one but a
beautiful unblemished display and around
back we have a handy pull tab for this
taking that plastic off there we can
really see that honeycomb texture on
this black variant of the Verizon LG g2
let's see what the splash screen from
the carrier has in store for us
very very fast food as we saw yesterday
same wallpaper let's take a quick look
at the software here we'll bring the
angle back huh go ahead and unlock and
we'll move our microphone back so maybe
you can hear me a bit better immediately
we see the custom Verizon visual
voicemail icon they're up into
applications let's see if we can spot
some bloatware there's the VZW
accessories shopping cart there's some
Amazon stuff pre-installed what else we
got oh wow there's a lot of Amazon stuff
pre-installed the whole Amazon suite
maybe this is usual I don't review a lot
of verizon wireless devices so forgive
me if this is news to me mobile hotspot
my verizon mobile slacker NFL mobile boy
no shortage of bloat on this device
there's your VZ Navigator VZ security
Verizon tones Wow just a whole lot of
stuff going on on here let's see if
anything is preloaded on the screens
you know this layout is not all that
different with the exceptions big Amazon
widget this layout is not all that
different than the one we saw on our
global unlocked unit yesterday so at
least there's some some kudos to be
given for that let's see if Verizon has
done their usual action no they haven't
oh very excellent so the Wi-Fi networks
available notification is actually
standard I expected Verizon to have
taken out their their Wi-Fi toggle from
the notification thing which they
usually do but that's back so that's
nice and does it work it doesn't need
work that's wonderful other differences
are sure to come out during our
comparison we'll be comparing this
device with the galaxy s4 next week also
on Verizon but before we send it away
let's see what's in the box and see if
we were right or see if the box was
right about that lack of headphones with
the Verizon huh yeah so there's a get to
know your phone and then all we have
it's a power adapter and a USB cable
those awesome headphones from yesterday
which are awesome spoiler alert they're
really cool are not included so maybe
that explains the smaller box I don't
think it was worth the trade-off it's
always nice to have extra accessories in
the box and it's so irritating when
when they are eliminated particularly
when they're on one version on the other
let's see how the AT&amp;amp;T version holds up
now we've had to use a much wider angle
on the AT&amp;amp;T box because it is
significantly larger and just like any
other modern AT&amp;amp;T box this this well
this is just no getting around it these
are these are pretty ugly boxes I really
want AT&amp;amp;T to work on their presentation
but you know what I say that every time
and nothing ever changes so that's okay
we can move on from this and and move on
with our lives and check out the device
all right well this is okay this
protects the phone probably better than
just sitting naked in the box so I'm not
gonna come down on AT&amp;amp;T too hard for
this let's pop the phone out and just
keep the order the same just took it out
of frame for a second to take off the
IMEI and SIM label and here is the
device this is a much much closer
approximation of the global unlock unit
in terms of fit and finish the buttons
appear to be the same the camera
decoration at least it still appears to
be the same when put the old unit aside
it looks like they've changed up the
branding a bit actually so down here you
can see these there's the LG logo on the
global unlock one on my right hand the
AT&amp;amp;T one has removed that and just put
g2 down below so interesting it's
interesting to check out these little
minor things I know we're splitting
hairs here folks but this is the kind of
stuff that carriers do carriers decide
they want to you know change the look
and feel of a device in the most minut
way and you know they can do that LG did
say that there were gonna be variations
on these so shouldn't come as any
surprise to us I think we've gotten
enough on the on the close sound effect
on there and I'll forget to put the mic
back so let's just peel this right off
off that comes that's very nice it can
wait by the way texting and driving is
not a fun time because you could get
dead okay so once again on the back
we've got the global unit on the right
hand side the AT&amp;amp;T unit on the left
almost no discernible changes except for
that branding we mentioned before and
the AT&amp;amp;T Death Star logo on the AT&amp;amp;T you
know flip around to the front there is
no such carrier branding on the front
these are completely identical
aesthetically speaking let's go ahead
and power on the AT&amp;amp;T unit here
put the global one off to the side she
can a nice little buzz there there's our
LG splash screen and let's see if we get
the typical AT&amp;amp;T spinning globe
animation which we should there's a
notification LED during its cycle test
there's a TN t--'s spinning globe and we
are immediately prompted to set up the
device with 18's he's ready to go
service which they are pushing and I'm
gonna go ahead and remind later on that
yes I would like to exit ready to go
thank you thank you yes I would like to
do that so it's interesting that the
Verizon device didn't prompt us to do
any of that and here's our landing
screen no bloatware on the front page it
looks like now except for what is this
voice mate I'm not familiar with this
this must be an LG created app I'm not
sure if this was on the global one but
it certainly wasn't called out front and
center we'll check that out later
nothing on the left featured apps from
AT&amp;amp;T right there there's drive mode
there big automotive push and here's a
whole folder so 18t has taken pains to
organize all their bloatware into one
area for us stop at driving mode only is
your arena there it is
there's all the stuff that you will
either find useful or find gross and hop
into the app launcher see what we got
here again the Amazon suite is preloaded
or not the suite looks like just Amazon
Kindle app is pre-loaded and here's all
of our AT&amp;amp;T stuff the entire first two
rows almost as AT&amp;amp;T bloat if that's what
you want to call it and we have a link
to what looks like a little spammy games
icon here what's the deal here and we
got a prompt to you slide aside that
didn't happen on the global version we
did not immediately get prompted to
start using slide aside so that's
interesting
yes I'm fine with games using a wild
tangent games so this is a game catalog
that it's do you're just dumped into it
looks like a teen that he has some
exclusives here jeez that's a problem
your install a lot of this bloat and the
minute the phone comes out of the fine
the minute the phone comes out of the
box it's got a check all these blow tabs
have to check and see if they're the
latest version and stuff that happens
with the google apps of course that
happens with all apps are native but the
more apps you preload
the more it just the more of a hassle
the initial setup becomes but anyway and
we're being a little tough on AT&amp;amp;T here
I understand that that this happens with
all carriers but interesting to see that
the experience is Thank You LG
interesting to see that the experience
is is roughly comparable and there we
are folks showing the notification
shades this time around these shouldn't
be identical because these have all been
customized somewhat differently but AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon Wireless and the global device
this is the one that I've had for about
a day so I've really customized that but
we can see Verizon has taken it upon
itself to customize this notification
shade a bit maybe it too was tired of a
lot of the clutter I have a bit more
clutter on the global one here AT&amp;amp;T one
looks a little bit standard but they all
three have working Wi-Fi toggles should
not be something that we need to
necessarily celebrate but we are because
that's unusual especially when Verizon
is in the mix so kudos to Verizon and
just so that you can see all three in
the same frame one more time before we
close it out there they are once again
18t Verizon Wireless global unlocked
variant but wait as they say there's
more specifically one more thing beyond
the QuickStart guide will we find a USB
adapter probably a USB cable most
definitely headphones let's see there's
our USB there's our power adapter well
we got a sim key so at least there's
that and as I mentioned folks we are
still in our review period on the lg g2
the carrier variants will be helping us
in comparisons we may not do a full
review on each device but we will
definitely have a full review of the g2
