and I'm pleased to bring to you how to
install opera mini for on the tmobile
shadow so go ahead and go to Internet
Explorer hit the menu button and go to
the address bar we're going to type in
ww opera mini com Opera Mini is an
alternative browser which is really
useful for using viewing large web pages
now go ahead scroll all the way down to
where it says try the new opera mini for
select that so we're going to install
the newest version go ahead and download
the high memory version what's great
about this is not every web page
translates in pocket internet explorer
well so it's kind of hard to view a
large web page go ahead and hit continue
here but uh opera mini go ahead and hit
yes actually makes that possible by
doing server-side interpreting go ahead
and hit ok here and it sends JPEGs and
very little amounts of data go ahead and
hit yes here so the rendering of a web
page is actually faster for the full
size I hit yes for this and ok for this
the thing about opera mini is its Java
so on some phones it's actually a quick
loading scheme but unfortunately it
actually have to push a couple yeses and
okays to get this to load now here's
some tips and tricks on how to use it a
little bit better so take your time read
through that and then if you really feel
like it you could read the end-user
license agreement or you can press the
left soft key to accept it so we're just
going to read it real quick here
okay hello speed reading all right and
we'll click okay here's their front page
some quick links there we're going to
ahead and click here to edit on the
address bar and we're going to put in
all shadow com show you something all
shadow com is actually set to recognize
pretty much every mobile device and so
go ahead hit the right softkey from menu
and then okay and then it'll load so
opera mini well it's actually still
going to load it as the mobile version
that you see an Internet Explorer
however at the top you have the RSS feed
which is cool because you can subscribe
to operate mini to RSS feeds so let's go
check out pocketnow.com a little typo
there hold on pocketnow will render full
screen size through opera mini ok hit
menu and okay wait a second it will load
it actually deals with flash pretty well
interpreting it you can't really view
flash but it'll take a picture of it and
show that too now you notice there's a
mouse on the screen that's actually
controlled by the d-pad and it moves
that little box around and put the box
over whatever it is you want to look at
and hit the center of your scroll wheel
and it'll zoom that in you hit the back
key and I'll scripts zoom out go over
here and look at this so it pretty much
looks like it would on the desktop you
hit the back button twice and it'll go
to the page before so that's a quick
preview of what it looks like and how to
actually install opera mini on the
shadow and if you have any questions go
ahead and post it in the comments and
thanks for checking it down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
