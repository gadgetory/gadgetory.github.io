terrible unless you had a Nokia from
epic experiments to mainstay Symbian
phones through the run of Windows Phone
Nokia was way ahead of the curve thanks
mostly to one fantastic partnership
Zeiss easily the crown jewel feature for
Nokia faithful Zeiss brought mobile
camera tech to the modern era
co-developing software and hardware
which rivaled small consumer
point-and-shoot cameras there's many a
mobile photog holding on to choice
devices like the Lumia 1020 we've
previously reported on pocket now that
Zeiss would be returning to the Nokia
label on phones produced by H MD but
another tasty bit of news h md has
acquired some 500 patents held by
Microsoft many relating to camera
technology Microsoft currently retains
the trademark labels like clear black
and pure view but hmd was able to grab
the patent for the camera interface the
Lumia camera app is still showcased as
one of the most elegant ways to organize
advanced photography settings the first
Nokia flagship under H MD is right
around the corner with a dual camera
system in tow
armed with the Zeiss badge top-tier
image processing and a familiar camera
app would this be the killer feature to
help Nokia rebuild its image or is the
Android Market too crowded for a once
great brand to make a dent in the
current sales leaderboard drop us a
comment down below as always thanks so
much for watching give this video a
share if you want a modern Nokia camera
phone and for more tech news and reviews

gadget guy on twitter and instagram and
