against one of the best Android phones
or she do we have already reviewed the
Samsung Galaxy s4 so make sure to head
over to pocket now and check that out
this galaxy s4 the I 9500 is the
International octa-core flavor the Lumia
925 is also not the upcoming t-mobile US
version however it's one of the top
Android phones of the moment compared to
the best Windows Phone and Nokia have to
offer in this comparison we'll take a
look at hardware software and user
experience as well as camera even though
you can instantly recognize the Lumia
925 as a nokia phone the company gave it
a fresh look compared to the Lumia 920
and previous models it is also made out
of aluminum for better antenna
performance while keeping the
polycarbonate back which in this case is
very smooth and soft to the touch at 139
grams it is just 9 grams lighter than
the Galaxy s4 which is made completely
out of plastic with Samsung's own
controversial buy now hyper glazing
technology there are pros and cons to
both when it comes to the in hand feel
the galaxy s4 and its hyper glazed
polycarbonate is slippery and collects
fingerprints easily but its rounded
corners make it feel somewhat better in
the hand and the Lumia 925
which is cool to the touch on the edges
where the aluminium is but it's squared
shape might need some getting used to
before we look under the hood and see
the huge differences we need to
understand the relationship between
perception platforms and the horsepower
needed the Lumia 925 is powered by a
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz helped by one
gigabyte of RAM it has 16 gigabytes of
internal storage with no expansion
options Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC and the non
removable 2000 milliamp hour battery the
entire front part is Gorilla Glass 2
under which Nakia bacne 4.5 inch pure
motion HD plus ClearBlack AMOLED display
a real tongue twister with 768 by 1280
resolution for a PPI rating of 332 the
camera is PureView version 2 the optical
image stabilization version has 8.7
megapixels with carl zeiss lens and it's
coupled with a 1.3 megapixel front
fascia the GTI 9500 samsung galaxy s4 is
powered by the octa-core actually dual
quad core Exynos 5 chip with a quad-core
1.6 D Hertz cortex a15 chip combined
with a quad core 1.2 gigahertz cortex a7
component there are two gigabytes of RAM
and this unit is the 16 gigabyte flavor
expandable of course via microSD card
bluetooth Wi-Fi NFC and usual suspects
are all in alongside a user removable
2600 milliamp hour battery the front is
where the 5 inch Super AMOLED HD screen
lives with a PPI rating of 441 the
camera is a 13 megapixel unit paired
with a 2 megapixel webcam on the front
the s4 also has an IR blaster and a
cornucopia of other sensors both screens
deliver great results if you are into
saturated colors and deep blacks however
they don't really shine an outdoor
visibility the Lumia 925 is the clear
winner among the two and the information
on its screen can be seen in direct
sunlight compared to the s4 where you
often need your second hand to cast some
shadows still interview enables you to
hover over the screen to see more
relevant information and that is just
one of the countless features Samsung is
offering with its TouchWiz user
interface gestures tilting hovering
head-nodding
tapping flipping everything is there and
while using all or some of them is
arguably up for the user there
definitely but for an in-depth look at
all the features of the s4 make sure to
watch and read our full review on the
other hand the Lumia 925 doesn't feature
any of those Windows Phone looks as
minimalistic and modern as fresh as it
looked in the first day with towels
flipping on your homescreen to keep you
up to date with what's important and
where Microsoft's operating system is
lacking Nokia is doing a good job at
filling in the gaps whether we're
talking about the here shoot or the
camera application there's always the
ecosystem question which is a debate
will not go into now before purchasing
any of these phones make sure to
research the ecosystem and what each has
to offer both in terms of software
titles and services the camera on the
Lumia 925 is a pure view camera with 8.7
megapixel sensor optical image
stabilization and carl zeiss lens the
addition of a six lens versus the five
lens construction of its predecessors
tries to make pictures look even
better the viewfinder on the windows
phone is rather simple and can be
misleading or annoying at times without
displaying icons or information about
what special mode you are in
luckily it reverts to the fault upon
launching it again so you don't miss a
shot because of previous settings or
modes and there is always the dedicated
shutter release button which is a must
and Windows Phone unfortunately a rare
option on other devices the galaxy s4 on
the other hand with its 13 megapixel
camera has if you find out where you can
tweak everything select from a
cornucopia of shooting modes and see a
graphic representation of every tweak
you've ever made
we will compare camera quality between
these two phones and of course others in
an upcoming dedicated camera oriented
shootout so make sure to subscribe to
our social media channels so you don't
miss it
nonetheless we don't want to leave you
hanging so we bundled a couple of
photographs snapped by these two phones
and bright sunny outdoors they both
deliver exceptional results with the
galaxy s4 offering better overall detail
take the phones indoors or in a poorly
lit situation and the Lumia 925 starts
to shine actually the darker the
environment the more the Lumia 925 and
it's low-light performance coupled with
Elias shines to wrap it up the question
is not whether you should get the Lumia
925 or the Samsung Galaxy s4
they're both arguably the best phones on
their respective platforms the real
question is whether you should go with
Windows Phone or Android and only you
can research an answer that once you
know which operating system suits your
needs the choice between these two
phones is easy folks that's gonna do it
for today for the Nokia Lumia 925 vs
samsung galaxy s4 comparison stay tuned
to pocket now we have a lot more coming
on the Nokia Lumia 925 I've been an
attendee node you can follow me on
Facebook and Twitter if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up thank
you very much for watching until next
time
microphone hope it's fixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
