its new series of all cattell
smartphones and we're ready to show them
to you all of them
with jewels war on camera I'm Jaime
Ravenna this is MWC 2018 coverage from
pocket now brought to you by invisible
shield can you believe that
Alcatel brought five phones for us to
look at well if you've watched our
Alcatel coverage from CES you've already
got a head start here as that video
previewed some of what the company is
trying to do is really innovate on the
mid to low end just like we've seen with
its Idol lineup there are a ton of
things that we actually love of what the
idol started and it's the fact that you
get more bang from your buck and all
these phones fall on that same line
they feature fingerprint sensors 2x1
displays facial recognition
authentication and some software tricks
on top of Android nougat like the social
square feature you see here starting off
the list at around 100 euros the Alcatel
one leads off the company's Android go
line up
overall it percents wasn't extras though
obviously this is the least good-looking
of the bunch
considering down the batch and starting
closer to hundred and fifty euros we get
the Alcatel 3 it bumps things up to a
5.5 inch display at 720p plus and has
some decent specifications that you can
read at the post the Alcatel 3x takes
the screen even further in size at least
to 5.7 inches diagonal though the same
resolution and specifications don't
really take things up much really it's
the 3v that takes the cake out of all
the five phones CC elf it's one of its
six inch full HD displays here and
really that's the secret behind the
price tags the fact that TCL is
providing the panels now finally at 230
euros the crown is taken by the Alcatel
5 this phone reminds us of the old HTC
Windows Phone 8x it does return to 720p
territory and the single rear camera but
aims for being the best overall
performer with the super wide selfie
shooter it also brings the most unique
design out of all the bunch with this
bezel-less bottom Alcatel 5 and 3 VR out
select markets the 3x and three will
head out in March while the one begins
shipping in April and now let's have a
quick word from our sponsor
