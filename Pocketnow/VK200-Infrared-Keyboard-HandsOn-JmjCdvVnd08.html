pocketnow.com here at CES 2013 and we're
going to show you an infrared virtual
keyboard that you're gonna be able to
buy real soon
hook up to your iPhone your Android your
Windows Phone and a whole lot more it's
really cool let's take a look
exclusively at Brookstone does this
Bluetooth device that can connect to as
I said any any platform and what we have
over here is just a known application so
I am actually typing on the keeper I'm
going to try to get a frame and be
typing on the virtual keyboard and with
the text going up on the screen it takes
practice but we hear that once you get
the practice in it can actually work
pretty good so what you have to do is
break the plain of where the light is
showing so I'm going to write this is a
test I mean very careful and I almost
got it right again I've been just using
this for about two minutes and it is
pretty interesting so making a makeshift
keyboard is really what it's all about
anywhere that you want on any surface it
basically doesn't is it getting to
people
and just something that's really cool
but there has much utility is up to you
maybe it's just a cool cool gift to get
some money but it's really cool stuff to
see this kind of technology finally
making it to the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
