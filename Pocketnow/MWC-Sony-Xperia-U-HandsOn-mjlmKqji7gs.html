from pocketnow.com we've got Michael
Hiro from Sony who's going to give us a
demo of the Xperia U yeah we're ready
also a psychotic identity half-life
this is actually not only the society
element but we have also applied in the
news actually is a transparent offenders
before disappearing we have added
so let me show that to you
he illuminates
but not only illuminates it knows your
confidence
so let's say I'm browsing through my
photos
to change this color can you see
brother
here
making your browsing really really fun
it's not only for photos
if you also start playing music
anything
it is the you visit you
he knows the content clearly and adjust
for you to make it a freemium
but this experience not only about this
excitement and the small mountains we
have a but it has also very powerful
assets that we have gained by this tight
collaboration mount our Saudi family can
you show the color again the Rihanna
so if you have here and if you really
care about audio quality you can adjust
your audio called it really to detail to
make it the sounds just right it's a
Sony technology or is it additional
technology or celebration we have gained
from our audience only sounds good and
we also have this superior audio effect
where you can choose what kind of room
environments you alter the seller
sounded so right here I don't have a
headphone for you but we we have a lot
of headphones I really would like you to
try it out because trying is believing
so not only for the sake of quality if
you rinse this side we have this great
camera that allows you to capture an HD
also just like the rest of it Korea
there's families we have really worked
on performance allowing you to capture
some sleep boat to the actual chapter
both justice by ones like very very
quickly so again this is seeing is
believing
sounds good he told me about the
processor it's also got a dual-core
processor just like the rest of the
Xperia line it's all does it have the
same white technology of the Xperia P or
is it different ok but what makes this
phone unique obviously it's it's smaller
for people that are looking for smaller
phones
ok ok
can I hold it for a second indeed it's
very light this this fixture at the
bottom is is plastic or visit
polycarbonate or metal or aluminum
yet it feels soft but it's at the same
time it's sort of rubbery very nice yes
indeed and the the screen has a very
good aspect ratio from the sides
probably not so from the bottom but
indeed from the top definitely the
technology on the Xperia P is is a
little superior there but it's a very
let me try to pull this up let me see
just try to run pull some apps let me
see browser very quick and launching
applications so even though it seems to
be a mid tier device well it doesn't
seem to be cheap in design it's probably
just the small phone for people that are
out for small phones so this high
metalhead over pocketnow.com from the
Xperia Sony event here with the Sony
Xperia U</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
