pocket now calm if you've got a Windows
Phone like the HTC hd2 here one of the
best interface replacements that you can
get for your device is spb mobile shell
it gives you an Android like feel where
you can have multiple panels with a
variety of widgets and active widgets
and shortcuts to do a variety of things
you can really customize it to make it
your own so we can add widgets here
we've shown this a lot in the past
there's a lot you can do with it and
with a newer device like the hd2 the 3d
animations are really incredible you can
just have a lot of fun spinning
carousels and lots of other things but
there are a lot of widgets that you can
get to add onto spb mobile shell so in
this video we're going to take you
through some of those add-ons you can
get it xda-developers for free let's
take a look okay and so what I've done
here is installed a program or a set of
widgets i should say called MH widgets
and i'll post a link on pocket now that
come on how'd I get it it's comprised of
a few different things for example the
clock the clock now shows me how much
battery I have it turns from green to
yellow to red as it gets from right to
left it also shows you your percentage
of battery very precisely here in the
upper right corner and I just tapped on
the clock there below that we have a
special calendar widget that shows you
your next appointment that comes in MH
widget and below that we have a birthday
widget that makes it convenient to see
who's birthday you have to watch out for
in the near future it also comes with a
task widget and I don't use task so no
sense in showing you that and all this
other stuff I've just customize its
standard to spb mobile shell program
shortcuts links to people at UConn a
regular basis and twitter status right
from your home's home screen so again
quick and easy install to get these
extra widgets and if you're using spb
mobile shell or you want to use spb
mobile shell it's a good thing to have
