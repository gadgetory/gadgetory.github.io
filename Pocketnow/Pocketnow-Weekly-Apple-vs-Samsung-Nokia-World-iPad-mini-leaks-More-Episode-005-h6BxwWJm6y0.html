weekly hello and welcome to episode 005
of the pocket now weekly the once a week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss news and opinion from the world
of mobile technology smartphones tablets
phablets and everything in between I'm
your host Michael Fisher contributing
editor at pocket now Brandon minuman is
off today so I'm joined by our managing
editor Anton Dean Naja how are you sir
I'm great excellent good afternoon to
you guys I'm back to my normal schedule
coffee at 11pm coffee at eleven at night
I'm gonna print out on a t-shirt for you
and this week we have a very special
guest for today's podcast Joe Levi the
Android guy Joe welcome to the show I'm
glad to finally be here and not just be
the sacrificial live tweeter you are the
best live Twitter of any podcast I mean
it's just so great at every time if for
listeners who do not follow us on
Twitter every time we do a podcast yo
Levi is always there to listen to it the
day it comes out and we get about what
what is it about 50 or 60 tweets Joe
within the span of about an hour and a
half of Joe just picking out the most
ridiculous out of context quotes from
our show we'll see that's the best thing
in context everything makes sense but
out of context it's just whole layer out
of context we're talking about honey on
piles of excrement as I recall yeah best
line ever before we get started and
getting get into stuff here I just have
a little state of the podcast update
while we're talking about the show
itself listeners we're still working on
expanding the podcast to as many
different distro channels as possible
we've heard you on your requests for
support for stitcher and tune in I've
got requests submitted to both of those
apps or companies or whatever you want
to call them we're working on that but
in the meantime we're still on the site
and thanks to Joe actually we have a
handy html5 player embedded in every
post we are on YouTube as well on I
tunes and zune and we announce new shows
via twitter via facebook for you google
plus so there's plenty of ways to grab
the show while we continue to work out
distribution yeah you have officially no
reason not to listen exactly exactly so
um there is google is no longer
supporting their listen app I guess so
that's weird but we're still on what's
the story on that Tony we're still on
there we still had the RSS feed iya it's
live and if you have another podcast
application a third party podcast
application you can just subscribe to
our RSS feed and you can listen just as
with google play so it's not no biggie
good all right well that's that's good
because I saw that news story go up and
it was like well crap we just we just
got on there and we are finally there
was a request by one or two users that
we do time stamps which would be really
really handy basically if you're not
familiar we just you just click on a
time stamp and you jump to a particular
portion of the show so that I think in
the Quinn the words of one commenter iOS
fans don't have to listen to an hour's
worth of Android news or something like
that and it was like well come on it's
uh we have fun doing Android news yeah
that's why Joe's here today exactly it's
not the easiest job we kind of have to
work that out but we'll work out a way
to make that happen that's a pretty
simple thing to get done before we
happen to the show proper any listeners
who are not familiar with Joe himself he
is there aren't many by the way we was
specifically requested he is so far I
think from the comments I've read the
most requested presence on the podcast
so I it's good to finally have him here
he's our Android guy on the site in fact
he hosts a recurring program on pocket
now called the android guy weekly which
is full of a ton of useful content I was
just watching was today's episode Joe
was it was it today or yesterday's
episode the the early adopter curse oh
they all run together I think that was
today I don't think we said I can't tell
the days apart anymore what day of the
week is it today I don't know that was
it that was today it's garbage day so it
must be Tuesday well it's full it's a
great show if you guys have not have not
watched it you should definitely tune in
to the android guy weekly i use it as a
starting point I've used it a couple
times for the NFC articles and
I enjoyed the early adopter curse today
because it spoke to a matter close to my
heart but we're honored to have you Joe
as far as our first guest on the podcast
briefly if you wouldn't mind just tell
us how you became not Pocket now as an
android guy but maybe that too but how
did you become an android guy how did
you become a fanboy for lack of a better
term of the platform well a long story
made very very short I was a Newton guy
in the beginning and went from there
when Steve Jobs cut them off over to
windows mobile more because the company
was supporting that and I was windows
mobile for many many iterations I even
had the president of capacity o
corporation send flowers to my wife he
went well she was pregnant and went
downtown Salt Lake to pick up a
cassiopeia when they screwed up an order
really fun story there we'll cover that
a different time but after that I could
see the writing on the wall when iOS
came out in the iphone was ridiculously
popular and really more intuitive than
anything anyone had ever seen before and
i was still a little bit upset with
steve jobs so i decided to jump over to
android started out with the t-mobile g1
and had it for about 10 minutes and
flashed Jesus Freak on it that was back
for cyanogenmod and I've just been there
ever since wow wow what at what point in
the in its development was the g1 when
you picked it up like how late to the
game did you come in I was about six to
eight months in after the initial
release of the the g1 which might sound
like a lot in the the whole scheme of
things you know technology moves really
fast but remember that the g1 was not
released into markets where t-mobile
didn't have 3g established so it was
very very difficult to come by
eventually they changed that policy so I
was able to pick one up at my local
Walmart cost me a hundred dollars on a
conf way way back in the day yeah I
actually went from a non contract to a
contract
just so I could put it into the budget
nice since have gone back to
non-contract I understand I did that
with the with the with the priests oh I
get it I'm with the what did you have
edge only in your in your market at that
time edge when I was lucky uh GPRS oh
GPRS was my standby Wow well well there
you have it listeners Joe Levi's Android
roots go all the way back to the g one
that's awesome I my first android device
was an EVO the original evo so he was
years into it before I before I finally
succumbed to the Android impulse it's
great to talk to somebody who's been
there from the start from the very
beginning yes speaking of software Tony
I understand you got a rather
significant firmware upgrade recently
okay the automotive variety you want to
talk about that a little yeah i just
want to mention it most probably many of
our audience guys listening and girls to
know about this money have a car and
especially a car which is made two or
three years ago a recent car they are
operated by a computer and that computer
behaves based on a software which is on
a chip and lo and behold there are
software updates and there are new
firmwares so the interesting thing is
that we only about this but i never
thought of it in in the context in which
i'm flashing my phones but i can flash
my car so I was at the service today and
I I was told that there is a new
software update for my Chevy and I said
okay what does it do any change lock bug
bug fixes improvements performance and
they said yeah we might give it a try
and they flashed my computer and I have
some nice performance improvement so I'm
yet to find bugs but I'm gonna report
them surely to Chevrolet that's really
really amazing do you know what um I
mean I know this is probably standard
but it's just so strange to think about
you know I got it I got an update for my
for my car like i got a software update
for my wheels what are you what is it
running tony is it running like qnx or
is I have absolutely no idea but it's
most probably running some proprietary
software which is
belonging to either the chip maker or
the car maker here in Europe and I'm
sure in the u.s. you there are lots of
tuning shops which offer custom firmware
some chips can be flashed some chips
need to be replaced by a new chip with a
new software so I think these are most
probably proprietary software I'll be
interesting to hear i mean i remember
rim making such a big deal about how
Kennex was and was in everything it was
in you know nuclear power plants and in
in automobiles and so that if only my
chevy had clockworkmod and of the dodge
for ryan of course well now I've had a
firmware upgrade on my car too um not to
steal Tony's thunder but mine mine's a
Toyota Prius it's fun oh you have the
prius so so my my firmware update was to
keep me from accelerating uncontrollably
and smashing into things and so far it's
worked it has ever had that problem so
good yeah listen is right about 20
minutes before we started recording Joe
asked us to to send him our our positive
thoughts so that he did not run crash
into anything on the drive to his
recording site and I was not aware Joe
that that was a because your your car
may be running out of date software no
I'm updated i'm good to go good you know
Michael if I were you I'd be afraid you
know I'm driving to Berlin and I'm
picking you up at the airport so you're
gonna experience firsthand this new
software I am mildly terrified and also
um i would like to and now i feel like
after that berlin trip if i survive it I
should go page 0 visit and see what it's
like to ride in his prius and maybe like
you know compare and contrast the
experiences and then make a special
edition podcast right ya know i think
that's that's guaranteed brandon want to
do a video we should do that um alright
boys let's jump into this here we got a
we got the android guy here let's not
it's not waste as time let's let's jump
right in android action here with the
one of the more interesting stories or
one of the more boring stories of one of
the more boring overall tales i think
that is happening right now now i am in
minority I said this on Twitter before
and maybe it was a stupid thing to say
but I'm kind of bored to death by Apple
v Samsung largely because of stories
like the one that came out earlier today
where it's like apples accusing Samsung
of copying icon designs or this was
yesterday rather and I mean it's just
you know the story is great it's stephen
chang credit but it's it's just you know
the the testimony or the core talk you
mr. just page after page of of
screenshots of icons and comparing and
deciding which ones are more or less
similar to their Apple counterparts and
is this really copying and you know I
know this trial is really really
important but it's stuff like this that
really just kind of shuts me down and I
wonder if I wonder how much of an impact
the patent systems of various countries
have on innovation guys what are you
what's your thoughts on this I mean
house are you are you fascinated are you
bored are you somewhere in between
interesting i'm gonna jump in because
i'm gonna finish quickly i'm gonna only
refer to the legal side of things what I
don't understand is really the following
thing how on earth can you represent a
phone if not with a phone or email if
not put an envelope or contact if not
with a person or a silhouette so i think
i'm not entirely at home with the US
patent system but i think that some
parents are granted very easily that
aside apple is capitalizing on this and
we all know that apple has declared war
on samsung just like the thermonuclear
war on android and they're gonna do
everything in their power to lay down
speed bumps in samsung's way now samsung
on the other hand is no longer defending
themselves samsung is attacking back and
they've taken it to the second level i
think this thing will not stop at least
not in the near future but i think this
is bad for apple not that bad for
samsung because Samsung is always the is
regarded as the underdog as far as these
lawsuits are concerned Apple has more to
lose but if they win they have more to
win on the short term so it's a pretty
tricky situation Joe what about you I
have to agree uh when you're looking at
a notepad whether that's a legal pad
sitting on your desk or whether that's
an icon sitting on your phone or your
tablet it looks pretty much the same
it's representative of something that
does the same thing so i really wonder
why Apple didn't pull in the the legal
pad manufacturers for violating their
trademark because I've got that and it's
on my death right now and I'm scribbling
notes on it and it's ridiculous I bees
are coming soon yeah what's up there ah
this is going on the internet isn't it
yeah whatever but there comes a point
where you just have to say we've we've
gone to every extent that we can to make
these little pictures of things as
self-explanatory as international as
possible and really the icon speaks to
what it is in the real world and the
real world was around long before the
icon the judge should look at this and
just throw it out one other side note
Tony you mentioned how can you represent
a phone without a picture of a phone
yeah stop for just a minute let's think
how old are most people who use cell
phones these days mmm have they even
seen a hat and set like that do they
even know what that is or are they used
to these little bricks that we carry
around in our pockets good point that is
a really good point i read a story or a
red an editorial maybe it was from us
and about that very thing somewhat
recently and it's like yeah that that
telephone receiver that's on every
dialer button almost ever is it's got to
be just this abstract construct just to
a lot of kids these days right I mean it
exactly yeah I mean they've never held
this like bakelite you know for pound
receiver with a coiled cord in their
hands as a matter of fact I would like
to hear i would just like to say it
right now because we get some listener
mail but i want to get some more if you
are you know if you're a young listener
please write in and let us know if
you've like never encountered an analog
phone receiver and at
some point your life wondered what that
was on the phone button and somebody had
to tell you let us know I pulls dialing
before cause I'm like oh yes the rotary
Dyke rotary dials that's what the day
isn't there an apt wasn't there an app
on some platform that let you do that
like it was a real dial yes what it was
iOS of course it was iOS quick question
guys you know a few words it had one of
those Stone Age phones in front of you
and it was ringing what hand would you
use to pick it up left or right right so
then what and why is every icon
represented as I was to pick it up with
my left hand iOS Android and Windows
Phone why just can't they invert it the
mirror it you see I'm picking the phone
up with my left hand family I have my
right hand free to take notes ah very
crafty Levi nice I I don't know yeah
well you just make sure you take your
notes on a on a pad that doesn't look
anything like the 12 that are on my
screen right now what let's yeah let's
let's move on there's more samsung stuff
to talk about this um we have a
quad-core galaxy note 10.1 tablet coming
out from Samsung this is a pretty new
story we're kind of prepping for maybe
what might be the launch event later
this month not really sure maybe on
August fifteenth way Joe please take it
away I'm so yeah I'm so nexus 7 um I'm
still kind of in the honeymoon phase
with that tablet that i'm just so bored
by this now don't get me wrong please i
think this could be a really cool device
it's just that i can't find a way to
phrase it right now that'll be anything
but a spec list so tell it what do you
think about this gym well first and
foremost it's getting headlines because
its quad-core and what we learned from
the the galaxy s3 is quad core really
doesn't matter in practical use and the
main game is sure exactly what really
really helps is more RAM now this tablet
is reportedly going to have two gig of
ram so that should be good it'll be
interesting to see if we get any kind of
a performance increase by having quad
core with the extra ram or if it's just
essentially the same thing
do we know what kind of processor is
going to be in that is it probably an
excellent access right yeah oh yeah
Samsung combined that's the galaxy s3 it
doesn't it's not called out in the in
the story but yeah I would agree with
Tony that's probably gonna be an X notes
in there you know guys what's lame and
I'm gonna be the black sheep again it's
lame regardless if Samsung is the wicked
or somebody else but in this current
case we're looking at Samsung it is lame
to announce and to show off the samsung
galaxy note 10.1 in February at the mwc
and in August to still not have it on
the shelves but you have announcements
regarding specifications which are
changing now that is lame that is lame I
agree what do you think is the source of
that delay do you think it was a
tactical maneuver or no I think they
jumped in they were quick because there
were absolutely no tablets from Samsung
at mwc we had the galaxy tab 10.1 last
year but of course there was the 7.7
which is lame too and I think they kind
of jumped the gun a little bit they
wanted to be out there together with the
Acer and the sous and the the the
PadFone and they wanted to show
something off that Samsung is continuing
to do tablets and they bring this S Pen
to the tablet because it's a bigger
screen it's normal for you to use it on
a bigger screen than on your phablet but
I think they realize that by the time
this will get out it will become stale
specs wise so they said let's just
cancel this or postpone it put in some
more specifications raw horsepower and
the late little bit which is good but
come on guys six months that's too much
yeah and actually you bring up an
interesting point from a from a branding
perspective that's kind of one of the
only things I I find interesting about
this device so far because I don't know
a lot about it because none of us do but
I find it I head of hands-on with it you
did I had a hands-on in February in
horses around barcelona that's right
yeah but it was with the initial
specification right yes that's what I
mean i canna new device we don't have
yeah then you won no no but i think the
branding is the most interesting part
about it because here's what Samsung has
come out
been like here's the Galaxy Note boom
this is a phablet that's a whole new
category blah and then the note like for
better or worse picks up a whole lot of
press and people know what the galaxy
note is because Samsung has been just
pushing it down people's throats with
advertising and so that Galaxy Note
brand is pretty strong and then they
just kind of append it to a tablet they
were probably going to build anyway
they're like here's the galaxy note 10.1
and so yes their brand message sort of
goes out the window where's like is it a
phone is it a tablet its galaxy note
whereas this one is like no it's a
tablet and it's also can't like see note
but I find that interesting like I and
and you know what it works on me too
because I sit here and I kind of soul
search for a second and I'm like yeah
I'm more likely to buy this device
because it has the galaxy note branding
not because I like stylus is not because
I really care about the initial note too
much but because the galaxy note
branding I find superior to the Galaxy
Tab branding just in my head it's just
it you know because the Galaxy Tabs have
never been terribly impressive so I
don't know does that am I alone in that
am i weird mm-hmm Thanks you're
absolutely weird thank you you know I'm
reminded I'm reminded of the early days
of Apple and going back to my Newton
roots again Apple came out with their
their laptop computer and they called it
a notebook because it was analogous to a
notebook that you towed around with you
when when Newton came out it was a
message pad it was essentially a flip
notepad so they had some very strong
branding around the sizes of screens
Saturday Night Live picked up on and
they did a chris farley skit with the
Apple post it which was Newton powered
and you wrote on it and converted your
handwriting to text and when you were
done with that note you just threw it
away but I think that I you know you're
right with the the concept that you need
to brand something based on the size if
you're gonna go that route and then
stick with it and come up with another
brand for something in a different size
some of us out here are confused it is
10.1 the size of the screen or is that
the version of the device yes man that
means they're like seven ahead of the
the ipad right
well then it must be better 7.1 ahead
well it'll be interesting to see I think
that that if if August fifteenth is
indeed the the launch or the excuse me
the announcement date on that or the
official unveiling or whatever you want
to call it well there's some kind of
event happening in New York City on that
date and as it looks right now it looks
like we're going to be there to cover it
and it might be me I don't know by the
way yeah samsung if everything goes
according to plan and according to our
speculation we'll have two notes on
display in Berlin the note 2 and the
note 10.1 how about that well that'll be
a nice little duo will have will have
samsung TouchWiz nature UX on maybe
question sized screens question will
these be the only two new devices at
Samsung or will they be something else
maybe a windows phone maybe a windows
phone 8 and early announcement something
a sneak peek that would be awesome I
would love that because we heard we
talked about that last week writer with
a the rumored Samsung windows phone
devices mmm yeah that would be I don't
know selfishly I'm hoping for that
because I would be much more interested
not that I'm not interested in the note
2 i'm interested in the note 2 as well
but i'd like to see some more from
samsung but um we uh I want to keep
moving here because Android is uh still
has a little bit of news here i have
this sad thing HTC hmm not doing well
financially um I don't know much about
finances we've established this on
previous podcasts but HTC has really
taken a beating in the in the in the
marketplace as a result of some lower
than projected earnings i think is the
core of that and we had our own Jaime
Rivera posted a really interesting
editorial called HTC is sinking they
need more than just innovation any kind
of drew some parallels there be two
between HTC and nokia and palm to a
degree so I'm interested to see like I
read this editorial about a half hour
ago and I'm fascinated by it because I
don't perceive HTC as being in in quite
as hot water as
some of the other beleaguered companies
in the landscape but what do you guys
think do you think HTC is is in serious
trouble or is this just something that
will blow over once as the one and it's
follow-on products take get traction
it's a stage I think it's a stage and it
will pass and yeah we don't know about
numbers but I can tell you this much
stocks usually when it comes to huge
companies like these tend to react to
even the smallest rumor the smallest
number which is officially published by
the company and they are very sensitive
now if you look at HTC's lineup for this
year the one line up the S the V and the
other one slip in my mind yeah I can
never remember the other one either yeah
it's it's a good lineup the phones are
good the problem HTC has is called
Samsung and this is their main problem
because Samsung has managed not only to
become the number one Android OEM but
it's doing it with the great success the
number one handset vendor in the world
let alone Android yeah I agree with that
I what I can go into a discussion about
Samsung vs apple because Apple only has
like three or four devices at any time
on the market and Samsung has a
truckload so let's not get into that but
comparing Samsung to HTC they have
managed to turn the situation in their
favor and while the HTC One X was their
flagship in Barcelona but in the
backstage people were were just talking
why Samsung missing mwc where is the
galaxy s3 I mean they built up that
anticipation and yeah hardcore fans
bought the HTC One X which is a good
phone except for its camera and I'm
gonna say this until I dry i like that
camera but i think that HTC is now in a
lowest position and they will start
climbing real fast because i'm expecting
some follow-ups to the 1x at IFA with
faster processor still Tegra free
software updates jellybean if possible
and they will get back on track i was
hoping to see some more rumors on HTC's
presents coming up at IFA but i only saw
because kind of this one iteration
the V in the news feed notice like well
that that's really boring I hope we see
we still have two weeks I know yeah
that's true I just want more leaks but
Joe what do you what do you think do you
think the problem is also Samsung HTC
has a really really firm foundation but
they didn't come from the same the same
fold that Samsung came from if you look
back in in HTC's history even back
before Android you had HTC making
devices for for various OEMs which was
kind of unusual you had stuff that was
coming out from compaq and from HP that
were designed and built by HTC true they
had their own brand yeah exactly at XDA
from XDA developers the the XDA is an
HTC device the g one made by HTC the
nexus one made by HTC the trio 8800
right as well yeah they make fabulous
fabulous hardware where I think they're
going through some growing pains right
now is they've got to be innovative and
keep that quality hardware and it's the
innovation that is new to them we've
seen some some huge leaps but Samsung
was able to ramp up and come out with
stuff a little bit faster than them
that's because Samsung has been in
everything they've been in consumer
electronics across the board and can
apply that that experience to their
smartphones that are tablets to their
in-betweens all along so don't dump
count HTC out just yet they're not doing
as well as I personally would like them
to be I used to be an HTC guy
exclusively I skipped the Nexus S
because it wasn't HTC but you just wait
give them some time there they're gonna
come back and they're gonna they're
gonna wow you and an important factor we
have here and I'm gonna let now Brandon
speak through my voice he's always about
marketing and he's right Samsung burned
a truckload of cash in marketing
campaigns we let it be the note the s3
or any other product worldwide I think
if HTC would be more attentive and
paying attention to marketing when is
the last time you guys saw an HTC One X
ad and compare that to the last time
you've seen on the galaxy s3 yet
I've ever seen an HTC One 1x add except
for on TV I've seen no print stuff yeah
so I think marketing is also required
for for your products to get a bush to
get a recognition on the market and it's
that competitive advantage which samsung
currently has over HTC yeah just look at
their tag line it says quietly
innovative and they're right out there
angel in it finally brilliant yeah I I
agree no it's it is founded in marketing
and I really hope it's interesting that
it's interesting that HTC's big problem
is Samsung because Samsung really did
come in and just suck all the air out of
the room after the 1x is after the
1-series landed but most notably the 1x
and I'm with you Joe I mean emotionally
speaking I want to make it clear that
I've give all hardware of a fair shake
and i'm pretty pretty good at being fair
but emotionally I had a lot invested in
HTC after my time with the 1x i did not
i love that device a lot more than i
thought i was going to and so when
samsung dropped the galaxy has 3 News
and I kind of saw the hardware wasn't as
wasn't to my tastes quite as much I was
like well this this isn't going to be
too too big a deal and then I really got
to thinking about I'm like no you're an
idiot assassin it's gonna come a carpet
bomb this place and they did and so I I
agree with I agree with you guys it'll
be really nice to see where HTC goes
from here and I hope it is I hope they
continue the trend of innovation they
started we at the beginning of this year
with the 1 series and I know they've
learned their lesson and from 2011
making just 12 different iterations of
the same boring concept over and over
again I know they've said as much that
they're not believe it or not believe it
or not aside from the users needing HTC
to succeed Samsung is also needing HTC
to succeed because they are driving
competition and nobody wants samsung or
HTC for that matter to become sloppy so
I think they need to be one step ahead
with each other depending on what time
of the year you look at the market yeah
they'll leap frog absolutely yeah um
moving ahead i I just published a piece
yesterday called a week without a
keyboard oh those emails
yeah Tony and Joe and everybody on the
team actually got to see the emails that
resulted from this experiment of mine Oh
for anybody who didn't read the the
editorial you should do so i would i
would appreciate it it's a longer one
than usual but there's there's some
funny screenshots of me cursing at the
phone in there and basically what
happened was I Brandon posed this idea
which was a really cool idea it was like
we was just very simple like what if all
you had for input was voice input was
speech dictation it was voice to text
and you couldn't use your keyboard at
all and I kind of instantly latched onto
this idea and I was like I'll do it can
I do it and so I did it I did it for
about six days I wanted to do it for a
full week and I frankly just could not
last I had learned everything I thought
I might learn by day six and I was like
no you know what forget it I'm ending
this early because I'm so frustrated
this has made me hate text messaging and
I love text messaging and it's made me
hate composing emails on the fly and I
and I love doing that too it made me
hate everything about the phone which
was a profound surprise to me because I
have had before then I had nothing but
great things to say about Michael did
you limit yourself to Android only or
yes I did platforms yeah only android
does yeah I was just getting into that
like I was only android as a matter of
fact we have that on the on the headline
here because I wanted to say I wanted to
try all the platforms and then it was
like no you know what I don't I don't
use an iphone as my daily driver so if i
wanted to try this i would have to carry
or my iPad around everywhere and i
didn't want to do that so there will be
there may be future instalments of this
experiment with different platforms i
would like that so i guess my question
in order to kind of translate this to
you guys like what is your experience
been with voice dictation on your daily
drivers because before this experiment
mine was so great when i used google
google not to quit i can't want to call
a google voice Google's speech-to-text
engine as because it doesn't have a name
right Joe it's it has no name the
google's voice street is
speech speech that's yeah they need to
they need to name that thing major are
you with me on that Joe specifically I I
I have to agree with with homage to the
the late Roddenberry's yes the first
lady of Star Trek yes absolutely would
be wonderful but I may be the rod Mary
estate made a stink I don't know at any
rate i loved google's voice tools before
this experiment i am when i used them in
a manner not intended i did not like
them anymore and that shouldn't be a
surprise but it was Joe what's your how
do you feel about it what were you using
an Ice Cream Sandwich you're using jelly
bean i was using both i was using my
Nexus 7 and my galaxy s3 so i was i was
using both of them intermittently and i
didn't notice too big a difference
between them to be honest with you now
the biggest difference that I've noticed
accuracy is about the same which really
is impressive the way things used to
work on Ice Cream Sandwich essentially
your Android would record your voice and
it would stream it up to Google servers
and then you would have the entire
weight of the Google cloud behind you to
recognize your voice and send back the
the translation now on jellybean they've
been able to compress that and do that
on the device which is just a
tremendously impressive the the main
thing that that I noticed in using ice
cream sandwich versus jellybean was
there were times when I would speak
whatever I wanted and all that was gone
when oh sorry we couldn't get a reliable
network connection try again oh oh no it
has to talk him all over again so now
with it being offline and jelly bean it
works great now I don't use it for all
my input but especially for voice
commands to use the term from windows
mobile use it all the time send a quick
text message absolutely I will tell my
android I want to send a text message to
Michael Fisher I'm going to be home as
soon as I can so you can start the
podcast on time and great and one key
press later and it sends it and it's
almost perfect but that's me yeah no I
these voice is different well it that's
you know that's me too when I'm when I'm
using it when I'm not using it 24 hours
a day all right you know what I'm not
using it for all my input every day I
should say to what about you Tony I'm
not a native speaker and everybody who
has ears and who listens to this podcast
immediately recognizes that I have a
European accent some might say it's
Russian radar is what are you talk I I
don't have I don't have the
pronunciation is not correct sometimes
and the accents i'm using are not
correct and still I managed to send
emails using my voice at a fairly 95-97
success rate but of course i'm not using
android as my daily driver i'm using iOS
now this might be this might come down
to Siri or it might come down to that
stupid saying we have around here that
you are speaking a to pure English for
them to understand for the services to
understand maybe who knows you think
you're like you're being over overly
your diction is overly good you
sometimes i I'm I'm striving I'm
striving to pronounce every word right
even though it they don't come out right
but somehow the system seems to
understand yeah it may be because
English is your main language you're
speaking faster than I do at a faster
pace and you sometimes tend to eat
vowels and shorten words and maybe
that's a problem well you know it's I I
think I think it's the other way I think
I've the same problem as you Tony to be
honest with you because I speak when I
speak to my phone I do change it up a
little bit yeah I find that when I am
this conversational when I'm speaking
like I'm speaking to you right now it's
better like it somehow they have they've
tweaked it so that conversationally at
least for me it picks up a lot better at
this and just be keep it natural yeah
and you it's it's hard to do I don't
know I was there for six days I kind of
fried my brain doing it I'm not going to
do it anymore i'm done but i'm speaking
to a computer is a very unnatural thing
you don't know what to say you don't
know how to say it because it's a
computer for all these years we've just
used either punch cards in the early
days or keyboards and mice but now to
use your voice
how do I talk to this thing that I've
used for so long right but carrying that
over to mobile phones it's the same
thing it's just awkward it is and it you
know it's funny because these as i said
in the editorial these things
consistently fool us like a lot of
people go through life thinking that
that computers and mobile phones and and
technology itself is it much more
intelligent than it actually is because
that's the impression they get right i
mean this stuff looks tremendously
advanced and it is but at its core it's
just a decision machine right it's just
making a hundred thousand decisions a
second between yes and no and until
actual artificial intelligence surfaces
you know there are going to be real hard
limits to things like voice interface
and that's why in 10 years the voice
interface while it has evolved a whole
lot it would be my argument that if you
ask me back in 2002 i would probably
think that we would be further along by
now is that's creepy I don't want a
phone which would look like the PureView
with a huge bump that it's back and
inside there a small piece of brain
inside of a fishbowl that driving my
phone is just super super spooky haha
that I just I didn't I've never
envisioned a situation like that and
that how you do and now i have nightmare
fuel thank you exactly as long as we
have as moms three rules of robotics
built into our just fine a good point
good point all right let's move on I'm
really creeped out by that image Tony
Thank You the brain tissue fueled
PureView we are finally the last kind of
Android topic Joe wrote an editorial
with a wonderful header image that I
liked a lot of two roads diverging in a
wood about actually it's a symmetry what
what they thank you Tony somebody saw it
oh crap did i miss the point am I am I
an idiot what I yeah it's regardless
which way you go you die oh wow I've
dead it that's not what I meant Tony
okay that is Iran it looked at so many
pictures what
well on one side was the cemetery on the
other side was kind of this nice little
wooded area that you could walk down and
have a nice day okay so we have
officially a creepy podcast we do where
we've moved it oh now is Halloween
edition yeah well no they're both
cemetery roads there's just one of them
is in son and one is sort of not in son
this is the way I envisioned it I mean
regardless of which you choose you still
gonna sink let that's to say guy again
very very morbid there's listeners if
you want to follow along with us follow
the link in the podcast words should rim
have gone with Android is the name of
the editorial probably a lot less creepy
than it has just become on the path but
I choked you can fill us in here give us
you know give us your stance and you
know this is tell us what this is based
on all right so spoiler alert yes rim
should have gone with Android uh so now
I guess you don't have to read the
article but there's a lot of reasons
behind that and the article was more
open-ended than that it was where were
they what were they doing and how did
they get to where they are now and then
we left the question open for for
readers to decide you know should rim
really have gone with Android and the
reason being is just looking at making
an operating system alone let alone
hardware and an interface those are all
very very large tasks and rim was not a
really big company but they took the
world by storm with push email primarily
something that I kind of shook my head
at because I had that with windows
mobile but anyway push email with
Windows Mobile eventually yes okay okay
there's that qualifier we were looking
for you below but you know I could get
email every five minutes every ten
minutes whenever it went to check but
rim had to work on not only their
operating system but they had their
their communication layer which started
out kind of just as email but then got
into to some instant messaging with
blackberry messenger or whatnot they had
their OS that or the UI to the OS that
they had to work on and they had the
hardware as well and they did pretty
good at all of that I think they did
better at the hardware than anything
else
they got stuck in the mire with again
trying to keep up trying to be relevant
and their operating system was holding
them back so should they have dumped
their core OS and gone with Android and
my argument is yes absolutely we look at
everything right now that's running on
Android and I'm not just talking
smartphones it everybody has their
vendor overlay their their skin HTC's
got their Samsung's got theirs LG's got
theirs I hate them but everybody's got
them and they can customize as much as
they want so you now we've got all this
we also have eBook readers that are
running on Android but you can't tell
their Android the nook and the the
kindle fire they don't look like
androids but they are rim could have
done that and made their own nice
Hardware their own nice UI and just
relied on Android as the underlying OS
to power at all so that like you think
rims should have gone with a custom fork
of Android in it much earlier in the in
the process at the very least they could
also have just done what everybody else
is doing and become essentially just a
hardware manufacturer like Samsung like
HTC the model works and we could have
had an awful lot of cool things brought
to the Android environment we're learned
from from rim and rim could have learned
from everyone else as well and because
it's all based on the same platform it's
very easy to make those things work in
some other architecture some other
infrastructure it would have been very
nice to see rim hardware paired with
paired with an OS that turned out to
have a lot more future than the OS that
shipped on a lot of that RIM hardware I
agree and actually that's something I
want to come back to it to tour the end
of the podcast here so I want to kind of
kind of leave that there for now rim
doesn't get a lot of exposure on pocket
now and I think once it becomes well I
mean in the news it does but I think
once it becomes a lot more relevant or a
lot less relevant suddenly it'll you
know I would really like to to kind of
delve into the story of RAM a little bit
more and I really hope they last
I don't think they're going to but let's
let's let's kind of move on before we
leap out of Android here Joe you're our
you're our guest you're a special guest
you have is there anything we missed
before you hop over to windows phone the
only thing that I have to bring up is a
really neat patent application and yes I
know patent is a four-letter word how
about a good story about a bridge google
google presented this patent application
into to use what looks like they're
glass platform to track I movements and
let you do things with emotions and in
the patent that was specifically called
out to unlock it imagine slide to unlock
with your eyeballs there you go Tony
live tweet that was gotta be yeah but we
saw that in the patent application I
don't know if it's a good thing or a bad
thing but that's was something that's
right in front of your eyeball you've
got this little teeny screen looking at
your eye all day long I can only imagine
Samsung's looking at that and salivating
because hey they've got that much stay
awake feature smart yeah that would be
that would be like smart stay on
steroids I mean that would be amazing
and you could solve here's the crap out
of me you don't want you imagine
unlocking your phone with an eye pattern
so you don't have to touch the screen
you don't have to worry about somebody
fooling that you know the face
recognition by putting a picture of you
in front of it you can just do some
funky dance with your eyeballs and then
everyone who's next to you thinks you're
having a seizure but your phone is
unlocked just like that if we continue
at this rate the phone's gonna unlock us
ooh profundity yeah um well it did that
patent get granted where was that just
an application from what i read it was
just an application okay well that's uh
I'm a wrong you know in it's not
surprising considering all the
developments with google glasses or
whatever the hell that what do they call
that glass the the other stuff okay yep
yeah I'm completely not not tuned in
with that I really would like to see
more about that but that's awesome i did
not know about that i will have to look
that up
let's uh what's happened to windows
phone real quick here the we have to
news and articles out of Nokia which
always makes me happy because we kind of
always talk about nokia hardware on the
podcast and we don't need to do it for
too long this time around but nokia is
set to announce is rumored to be set to
announce their first windows phone 8
devices at nokia world this year Tony
you wrote this story do you uh it's a
short one but this is from Bloomberg
yeah yeah indeed and i'm not sure if it
will happen probably we will see
something like here's an early prototype
and from what I think Adam had a news
post according to which Microsoft was
going to allegedly show off some of
Windows Phone aids consumer-oriented the
features at that certain nakia developer
event in September 35 if I'm recalling
this right so I think we will not see a
new Nokia consumer-oriented phone but
we'll see some nakia prototype which is
used to show off some windows phone aids
however if I will be wrong and Nokia
will indeed announce the Lumia call it
whatever you want hopefully a peer
review one then it will still I will
still say it's lame when we will record
a podcast in December that Stephen Elop
will show off the device at the
beginning of September on stage and it
will only available in time for the
holiday season mm-hmm so I really don't
want there to be any misunderstanding
Stephen Elop said it himself that they
want to reduce the period of time
between an official announcement and the
official availability of hardware
because it's good for the business right
by the time you you release something to
the market 6 4 3 months away it's no
longer buzz-worthy so it makes thoughts
here I don't know what to say yet and
we've also got this this other rumor
which goes hand in hand with this one
about Nokia's first Windows Phone 8
phone this is a photo that that comes to
us from BGR and who got it from WP dang
I guess
what's the story here I mean this looks
like a Lumia 900 to me lumia 800 all day
long yeah oh it's an eight how did you
think yeah i think it's an 800 it's an
800 yeah it looks a little wide to be an
eight an eight hundred to me but i guess
you know it could be like it has the old
i commented on the piece when it went up
it has the old windows phone logo as a
home screen yes cindy button and it's
like well that's that's kind of a dead
giveaway right there isn't it but i
really hope it's not gonna be the
official nokia windows phone 8 because
people do love don't get me wrong do
love the nokia n9 the lumia 800 and
lumia 900 design but it's getting old
and nobody wants now gets a bull an
iphone 4s oh god no and nokia can't
afford i think the only know that can
afford to do that or apple and to a
smaller extent Samsung I mean yeah you
know what nobody wants to pull an iphone
4s but yeah I got excited when I first
saw the story I hopped onto the post I
saw the photos and I was like well
that's exactly what we have now so I
feel like that's probably a device
running running seven eight but at any
rate it'll be fun to see what Nokia
brings I would like to see also by the
time this becomes relevant maybe we'll
have some more nokia sales numbers I
maybe jump the gun on that a little bit
but it's it'll be interesting to see
what the Lumia sales have done this past
quarter I hope I'm not right Italy new
remember to podcasts away I said that
they will somehow just a quick note I
think you're right this is the Lumia 900
800 I'm looking at the picture right now
yeah it just looks a little wide but
anyway well we'll see there'll be plenty
of time to discuss that it's just wanted
to cover these because it's always
exciting to hear windows phone 8 and
Nokia in the same sentence or Windows
Phone 8 and any hardware manufacturing
the same sentence because it would be
really nice to see that when it finally
comes to pass so at any rate and and
finally in another slow weekend Windows
Phone news to the last piece is the
Microsoft backing away from the metro
name guys the only piece that I found is
is a little bit older stated by a couple
days what if we've gotten to the bottom
of this is it who let me let me let me
let me
let me yeah i live in Europe I live in
Europe you guys live in the States and
you don't know this because that super
popular chain is not in the States so
here in Europe we have company which is
called Metro AG agate it's from Germany
and it's a discounter it has thousands
of shops across Europe and they are
using the Metro name as their shops you
will see plenty of those in Berlin so I
think they filed against the Metro UI
because the Metro moniker is trademarked
to them and I know this because I worked
in the field six years ago in Poland for
instance Metro goes by the name of macro
exactly because of some intellectual
property rights so to answer your
question there's a retailer discounter
chain here in Europe who is using the
metro name not only to describe the
shops but only also for the company and
they filed against the Metro UI Wow but
vigil did you hear the new name or the
rumored new name windows 8 style you I
yes that's ridiculous Microsoft looks
like they're spinning this as as like
well we use metros a code name during
development and now we're switching to
the brand name I don't buy that for a
second really metro is first of all a
cool brand name for a UI second of all
is probably what they should have called
Windows Phone 7 I didn't think Oh with
metropolitan interface or something like
that well because my show stands for
that yeah because Metro is like shorter
and it's cleaner and it's hipper like I
like Metro I really think they should
have named their their mobile platform
Metro instead of windows because Windows
carries a lot of baggage with it but wow
wow I like a compass that Joe yeah so I
was just thinking um I've heard the same
thing about metro AG and as I understand
it like Tony said they're they're kind
of a discounter so I wonder if it's not
so much that Metro was upset with
Microsoft using part of their name which
I do think was was just the codename
that got carried over into the real
world I'm wondering
Microsoft wasn't thinking crap these are
a discounter that means what we're
running windows with a discounted cheap
user interface and they wanted to
distance themselves from from that type
of thing I think it has more to do with
where Tony was going especially because
Microsoft is seeing what the the legal
landscape is in Germany particularly
they can get shut down over there in a
heartbeat and probably would but I don't
know if Microsoft might just have done
that I still wonder why they did just
didn't call it tiles or live tiles
because that's what they are yeah I mean
that's kind of on the nose for like a
branding perspective right but i don't
know i mean we could talk about that i
find it if if that is the case if this
discount chain as big as it is has
actually kind of instituted this and and
is that the core of this i find that
incredibly infuriating because i don't
know Tony you can stop me on this
because you have more legal background
than I do but I feel like the only basis
for a copyright claim on this is like
likelihood of confusion and I'm never
likely to confuse a UI layer that's not
ever been advertised with a you know a
stop and shop well you are partially
right but when you trademark something
whether it's in I'm sorry whether it's
in the international trade how should I
say this administration something like
that in in Paris or in Switzerland
because we have two here in Europe or it
is in the states you are trademarking a
name which speaks for a brand but that
name that mm arrangement of letters is
what is trademark not the product which
is behind that so it's the word metro
which is trademarked well that's there
you go over here in the States we have
two different laws that apply one we
have trademark infringement where you
are using somebody elses trademarked
name and usually that doesn't have to be
a registered trademark but it carries
more bearing if you have that's a little
circle
are that you see after names otherwise
it's just a little TM that you see
that's definitely a no-no but it's only
when the mark that you're using is in
the same industry and has a potential to
cause confusion because of that some
companies got together and said we don't
like that we don't think it's strong
enough and not long ago we passed what's
called a trademark delusion law where
your trademark might be diluted so far
there's only been one case that that's
ever been tried against it and it failed
and I bring that up because it's close
to home the local circus Ringling
Brothers and Barnum &amp;amp; Bailey has the the
slogan of the greatest the greatest show
on earth that's their their tagline well
Utah where I am right now has a slogan
the greatest snow on earth because we're
in the desert and we have great nice
powder and everyone comes from around
the world to ski the slopes out here
well they sued the state to try and get
rid of it under the trademark delusion
because that could cause confusion
because it's show vs. snow and the judge
looked at that and said no this isn't
gonna cost confusion at all so it's the
only case that's ever been tried against
that law to the best of my knowledge and
they didn't win it anyway Wow so in the
state's metro vs. metro AG wouldn't have
any ground I think I Microsoft is just
being nice to their friends in Germany
yeah I think I think my favorite part of
all this is that I before I came to
pocket now I spent four years doing
books on tape for law students as a
voiceover guy and you guys have
completely schooled me thank you you're
bringing back memories though all this
trademark dilution stuff and you know
likely have confusion and yeah yeah I'm
asleep okay iOS I know I'm but thank you
seriously for your insight that's that
is interesting stuff next time I want to
talk about the transformer the hasbro
transformers stuff that's all ya thank
ya anyway iOS
we-we'd it's basically all but confirmed
that this new iphone is going to have
this taller display that we've been
seeing right so we've got this new story
that's at an iOS simulator I guess it's
the emulator is it revealing UI changes
for a new taller iphone 5 display is
anybody surprised by this I mean like
we're all kind of sold on this new new
design leak right unless we're all
getting the wool pulled over our eyes
well I still think that what we seen the
leaks the pictures the so-called devices
captured on camera are far from the real
deal I will eat my words live here on
the podcast the five that it turned out
if I turn out to be wrong but the wide
screen is slowly but surely becoming a
reality and there's really no other way
of pulling this out for Apple but to
increase only the height resolution so
going from 962 11 how much is it 1136
because all iOS has the most
applications in the app store so the
iTunes wins hands down even though
android is closed now imagine all of the
developers having a need or being
required to recode their applications in
order to support a new resolution just a
couple of months after the retina
display came out and that was also a big
speed bump because initially some of the
applications were just blowing and
inflating up graphics and text and they
were blurry I think that this is the
best solution Apple could come up with
because all of those application will
work the horizontal resolution remains
the same and I touched on this on the
last podcast even if there will be some
black strips at the top or the bottom or
both for the first week or two I think
it will serve as a stable basis from
which they could start building and
adding to the code I agree I'm not
rebuilding yeah no I think you're right
and I may have mentioned this on the
last podcast I don't remember but the
droid incredible 4G LTE which i reviewed
recently has a
sort of a similar display shape as this
kind of hypothesized one and that device
felt great in my hand a tall narrow
device I think will will probably
resonate with it with a fair amount of
people so it'll be sort of interesting
to see how this takes takes hold if it
does but I agree we're not going to see
too much slow down on development there
but I'm you know what I'm doing right
now what I'm holding my iphone 4s in my
right hand and I'm reaching with my
thumb all the way to the top left corner
and I can easily easily tap that it's so
growl if it becomes taller and we'll
have not a 3.5 inch diagonal screen but
a 4.0 4.1 I will not be able to do that
and Apple will kill one-handed usability
but you know I mean I don't think they I
don't think they have a choice right now
I just finished a piece today about
whether the new iphone mini is is going
to be here and it's already here like
the iPhone beautiful piece by the way
thank you thank you everything the
iphone 4 is the iphone mini I don't
Apple can no longer stick around at this
3.5 inch display resolution that excuse
me display size and they need to grow
and they're going to grow and and I
agree that and of course but they're
gonna kill one-handed usability I hate
that they don't have a choice there
needs to be another revolution in form
factor design that makes that brings
that back and it's so I don't they just
kill the home bottom but kill the home
but oh yeah yeah agree i wrote a piece
on that like months ago I I feel that oh
man should go when the galaxy has three
launch with it I was livid yeah it's not
a home button that's an action button
that looks like that's what it should do
oh and can you define action button
really quickly drew sure look at your
old original androids you had a d-pad
you know and up down left right and in
the middle as an action button it let
you essentially press enter or select ok
look back to Windows Mobile you had the
same thing you push down on that d-pad
and that was okay that's what that
button is that's what that button should
do it shouldn't take you back home
on samsung we're on Apple that should be
whatever the default action of this page
is that's the button that executes sit
that's an interesting perspective have
you written a piece on that yet I
covered it somewhat in depth with my
galaxy s3 verizon edition through you
yeah I think that justifies having a
nice little rant overall pocket now that
button should just do with a page is
supposed to do make it slow make it so
well it's there are no buttons on the on
the ipad mini from what we can see and
with that incredibly smooth segue i will
ask you guys briefly very briefly
because this is not a new thing at all
what do you think about about this that
the there's there's always a new every
week there's a new ipad 7 rumor and
there's going to be one until it's
either confirmed or completely shot down
officially by Apple so we're kind of
used to these rumors but the interesting
part about the most recent rumor is that
the ipad 7 back case if it is a real one
Tony this was the one that this is the
leak that's not that's not a fake right
that we don't think we don't think but
you cannot confirm it we can't confirm
it but it doesn't have a camera hole
from what we can see so there may not be
a camera on the ipad mini if an ipad
mini exists we have all sorts of opinion
on our site about whether that is a good
or a bad thing we've talked about it a
lot on the podcast that's not the
interesting part the interesting part is
this information what is it an email
Tony take it away what happened here
with uh with Steve Jobs mm-hmm well
there was a case the Samsung vs apple
case and if I recall well mr. Eddy Cue
was was showed an email and long story
short the email chain which was
presented in the trial made references
to steve jobs in the end not being that
much against of a 7-inch form factor
which
which really rattled my world because
everything I've heard about Steve Jobs
and I've read and I've seen him talk and
think just implied the opposite he was
determined and he was convinced that the
only real form factor for a tablet is
the 9.7 inch or let's round it up to 10
inch form factor four by three aspect
ratio and there were also legends built
on this that Steve Jobs will never allow
Apple to go with an ipad mini and this
was also one of my reasons on previous
podcasts of thinking that this might not
be true now hearing this in an official
court presented as evidence that let me
just try to see the quote here if I've
got that if you okay please cue said
having used a samsung galaxy tab I tend
to agree with many of the comments below
I believe there will be a 7-inch market
and we do one i express this to Steve
several times since Thanksgiving and he
seemed very receptive the last time
there you go yeah so that's it I'm
shocked I'm still shocked i mean i i'm
also happy because this way we will
finally see somebody putting up some
real competition for the nexus 7 aside
from all the other android tablets which
will come out with jelly bean in a
7-inch form factor and it's strange that
we're putting it this way because we
still don't have a real real iPad killer
as in super buttery smooth super high
resolution with the ecosystem to compete
with the ipad but now we're seeing and
hearing rumors that there might be an
iPad competing with 7-inch Androids yeah
I think that will be the most
interesting development in the tablet
space what do you think would be the
price that seven what on our 7 inch iPad
yeah what would it need to be in order
for it to be a real competition on the
market on the and the 7-inch market well
apples 350 bucks freemium on it yeah so
I would would you say 350 yeah 100 over
here over the other one 350 yeah I'd be
with you on that I wouldn't disagree at
all I think that's exactly what Apple
would do they put a hundred-dollar
premium on it they say they justified by
saying
yeah well it's an apple product it's
gonna do the job better and look how
many more apps we have and look it's
aluminum and we or whatever it is in
blah blah blah I what if it's plastic
what if it's plastic no rear camera
super cheap components 250 just like the
Nexus 7 I think another company would do
that I don't think Apple would I and if
they did people would buy it but I don't
think people would be happy with it well
the initial iphone had a blasting
backing know the initial iphone had an
aluminum one it was the three joel two
seconds long yeah the 3g right exactly
yeah and you're right they took it down
and but that was also in line with their
design lineage of the time right where
they had to the macbook and you did a
lot of plastic products on there so true
i think they've gone to metal I think
metal they really identify with metal
whatever it is it's brushed whatever
magnesium we need to get Jaime on so you
can talk about iOS another advantage to
metal is it acts as a very very good
heat sink to help dissipate the heat
which makes things run cooler arguably
run faster so I don't see him going away
from from metal backing a tall glass
isn't quite as good I think they learned
their lesson there and I think we'll
start seeing more metal stuff yeah is it
isn't metal killing the strength of
antenna power like we're sitting yeah
the reception as in Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS
yeah that's def gsm not good for it i
mean like manufacturers combat that by
putting you know what little rubber
windows in there and little plastic
cutouts and stuff and being creative
with that yeah it's it's a good point i
would like to see apple do something
with the Holy harbin harbin absolutely
like a polycarbonate super fan over here
but I yeah I think that gonna handle
anything I not gonna happen to you say
not gonna happen no how about Kevlar
yeah maybe so anything ceramic even if
it speaks premium apples all about
premium so I wouldn't be surprised to
see ceramic backings but what you don't
think but polycarbonate you don't think
now polycarbonate is still and this is
my night voice it's past midnight here
so I'm sorry I toned it down a little
bit holy carpet is still plastic and
plastic still screams cheap do you guys
remember how we bash samsung for the
cheap aspect go ahead i'll still bash
them night and day yes plastic is cheap
and making silver colored plastic is
Jackie completely agree no completely
agree but look at you can't equate
samsung's galaxy s3 with the HTC One X
and Andrew Lumias Yeah right right
because like the One X in the Lumias are
beautiful beautiful hardware to hold in
the hand and they feel different they
look different they sound different when
you drop them in their unique and
exciting off your wounds Michael don't
problem drop test is part of the review
man he's not the drop that is the sound
of the drop test yeah no but I mean like
so I think polycarbonate has you know
the potential to be a very premium
material and I think it's treated as
such and I think people receive it as
such so I don't know it's unless Samsung
is there to coat it in a coating of
hyper glaze in which case well canister
and let's say that it's just slimy and
greasy and it just and he slips away
entirely right entirely correct
absolutely right all right Jen we're
running low on time so let's hop into
our two-minute debate corner here I
change this up listeners on the guys
about halfway through the podcast
because we got Joe talking a little bit
about rim initially I wanted to ask it
should rim have gone with Android but
and Joe you can talk a little bit about
Android in your response if you want but
I'm interested in hearing about this not
often discussed possibility should rim
mmm or should they still go with Windows
Phone go with a strategic Microsoft
partnership or angle for another angle
again for a buyout should rim try to get
windows phone support this is a very
unlikely scenario but it's one I'm
interested in and what kind of success
do you think they admit with who wants
to go first I can go first because i
have actually prepared my answer for
your initial question whether rim should
have gone android and my answer
basically answers your actual current
question so good to know I don't think
rim should have gone into it I think
they should have gone Windows Phone and
I'm going to force a comparison here
between research in motion and Nokia
they are both excellent hardware
manufacturers and they both had
platforms which are dead symbian and
blackberry OS well BlackBerry's not
that data symbian but it's dying slowly
so the reason nakia didn't go android is
because they wanted to differentiate
themselves rather than be just one OEM
in the sea of other OEMs running android
platforms and i think this would have
happened with rim if they went with the
android they would be probably how
should I say the humiliated sales wise
by Samsung and HTC and they will
probably start competing with device
manufacturers like LG huawei ZTE and the
research in motion is much more than
that so if there would be a decision if
I would make the decision I would go
windows phone because as with Nokia it
would allow me to show off my hardware
with my services on the platform which
allows me to be recognized for what I am
very nice uh thank you Tony Joe Jim Tony
I like everything that you say but I am
one ID from you I disagree entirely
nokia isn't owned for hardware they've
always always made good hardware i've
owned nokia stuff and I loved it and I
really didn't know or even care about
the OS because it was nokia when they
went windows mobile they were kind of co
branding the nokia hardware name with
the the Microsoft Windows Phone I'm
sorry I said windows mobile and I'm
still in that era not with the windows
phone interface with that look and feel
rim is not that RIM makes great hardware
but rim also had a look and feel that
was distinctive and that i think was
even more important than the neural
hardware experience that you had with
the phone it did what it did and it did
it well and that wasn't just hardware
that was software so by by picking up
android and even just using that as the
background OS with with their own custom
whatever on top of it where you couldn't
even get to android you didn't have the
same marketplace you didn't have the
same anything it was just the guts of it
i think they could have then not only
kept the same
look and feel that they'd already
established their users were used to but
they also could have appealed to the
enterprise customer that's who I think
really really is the core customer for
rim is people who really don't have a
choice because your company says here's
your phone have a nice day because it
talks so well to the enterprise to the
security to administration to just
deploying and having it work so rim I
don't think they could have done windows
mobile or Windows Phone rather it would
have just been it would have been giving
up 10 seconds trip that's it it would
have been given up wow I'm a question
for you Michael yeah I'm gonna hit me
whatever great timing there Joe you man
you know how to do that two men I think
you guys a timer yeah I believe it or
not I did that was just Joe the android
guy at his finest Wow top notch it if
what's your question Tony hit me so um
I'm sure many will will agree with me
when I'll say that some of blackberry
devices resemble very much with the the
palm HP devices Michael what would you
think if rim would go open webOS oh wow
wow that's that's a great question and
it's it's one that I think was relevant
a little while ago when when we HP put
webos up for sale and I think rim was
rumored is one of the potential suitors
even back then it was probably a
baseless but rim hardware is absolutely
beautiful as has been mentioned or it
was some of it was in its in its time
its keyboards are unparalleled and palm
has always been a huge keyboard of
fanatic I think I think if you took only
the best part of each of rim and what
palm had with webos something compelling
might have emerged but I just don't
trust rim that much in its current state
or in its past eight to handle it
anything of course would have been
better than HP but what I'd like to have
seen devices like that yes I don't think
rim would have built them I think they
would have stripped web West for parts
and
and made it you know fail even harder
than it did but if REM adopted open
webOS I would I would I would love to
see that and I would buy five such
devices of course that answer is based
on the fact that currently there's no
guarantee that any hardware official
hardware will be released running open
webOS but no really I that's a very good
question Tony and I maybe maybe we'll
see that I hope who knows i think i
think that'll make a viable third option
for us mmm God think it would be
beautiful yeah all that just feel worth
option before let's just hope they won't
go I don't know bada or something like
that yeah let's just hope they start out
um cool well I there was a miscellaneous
peach which we're gonna skip this week
we have one piece of listener mail
before we wrap it up and i really love
listener mail so listeners if you
actually we all do please stick around
till the end of the podcast so you can
listen to how to send that in this comes
from us it comes to us from McKinley AKA
ubi 2447 if i recall well is a ghost not
only a reader but also an avid commenter
on our website i believe so as well it
was i'm gonna refer to you as mckinley
you will be because it's just easier in
the in the podcast but it's really great
hear from him he's got a great question
so i just watched he says so i just
watched number 004 noticed i headed the
zeros and I want her to offer a question
to you in regard to the motorola razr HD
in the biscuit phone yeah the biscuit
postage stamp phone my question is do
you think that even with the formidable
release of the s3 the galaxy s3 moto has
done a disservice to the device by
giving it a release date of even a month
from now i asked this because i feel
that it's been somewhat of a standard to
see their top tier devices with 720p
displays specifically dual-core as for
processors 1 gig of ram etc with not
much variation on that model so i think
the question here is is dewey that's the
question do we do we think that motorola
is is doing the device a disservice by
holding it like
should they push it out the door right
now is how I'm reading this to you guys
read it the same way well yeah from what
I understood and I think this has been
answered in this podcast and my previous
ranch that it's lame regardless of who's
doing it to announce something today and
to push it on the market three or four
months away or even two months away so
um I don't I think whenever you are
ready to show something off to the world
better be ready to have it in less than
30 days on the shelves I'm not talking
carriers here because even though it's
it could be possible discussing it with
carriers beforehand is possible but as
far as global versions are concerned
there are no carrier tie up so just have
it ready to be on the market one month
from the announcement and that should be
a decent amount of time what do you
think Joey you think what role should
hold this for release it unfinished I'll
take a little bit of a different stance
and we just went through the whole Nexus
Q I don't want to call that a debacle
but it was interesting wasn't it we
heard about a device and they released
it a month from now from when they
released it and people got it and you
know it's not what they wanted it's it
looked cool we we had a lot of buzz
about it but it wasn't what they wanted
so by motorola announcing this and kind
of getting it out there I think they're
gauging they're essentially their their
market share their interest they're
seeing if it's really a viable product
if they really should do it before they
go and and push it out on everybody
because nobody wants something that's
pushed out in half baked or know or
won't compete so I think they're doing a
service to everybody in the end users
who really want it or gonna get a better
device because of it but this begs a
question if I may yo let's say you are
an excellent cook chef would you put in
front of me on the table a half-baked
meal I mean and and you put it in the
specific context why show something off
if it's not finished if it's not ready
for prime time other than just to gauge
interest and see if it's what your your
customers want on that's the only viable
reason why I see your point I agree with
it entirely
but I still think that the analogy with
with food may not be entirely true
because yeah you know people people can
change on a dime and release hardware
with different specs right away it's
getting the right specs that's that's
what's more important not to mention i
think the analogy is that like if
there's food being advertised to you
like your your promised food at one
table in your dining room and you know
whoever's cooking is like yeah just just
few more minutes look here's a picture
of what i'm making you you know that's
fine but what if right out the window
there's a fast-food restaurant whose
chimney is just like blowin smoke right
right through your kitchen is like god
that smells amazing because that's what
the market is you know it's not just
stand alone manufacturers it's everyone
else is being like hey I mean yeah you
could buy you could buy what they've got
right now but look what we've got coming
in four months maybe you hold off for a
second you know I think its consumer
psychology I I want to keep this short
because I know we're short on time but I
personally as far as I'm concerned it
always backfires on me I love the Nokia
808 PureView I held it in my hands in
Barcelona in February can you believe it
that only now it gets on the shelves
here in Europe I mean come on and no
longer interested in that phone because
meanwhile we have the galaxy s3 we have
some new products which will come up and
you know what whatever you show me for
months ago I'm no longer interested even
if you put a quad-core processor yeah
hypothetical fictitious Tony that me
that may be true for but I mean you're
in love with that peer review even
though you had to wait six months for so
you know I feel like I feel like Nokia
it worked like they seduced you and they
were like look what's gonna be ready
look what's coming down the pipe and
you're like whatever I'm tired of
waiting and then it comes to your door
and you're like yeah this is the phone i
want not everybody had the opportunity
to to hold it in their hands in
barcelona so if i was to only judge it
by by the ads and by the specs I would
have probably said yeah you know what
keep it true that's a good so can we
agree that there's a there's a line
there yeah between companies wanting to
get out their information say here it is
this is what's coming and being able to
get that in our hands
versus having just too much time pass
and then it becomes more frustrating or
irrelevant I can only say this and this
is one of the reasons I respect Apple
apples keywords at every keynote are
quote available today yeah and and I've
said everything yeah no it's very true
we've actually stumbled into the second
half of McKinley question you know do
you feel like this is a he's just not
sure that cool looks a large 2500
milliamp hour battery about and a high
megapixel camera are enough to keep me
from waiting the few more months for
Google's new NEX I or one of those new
super devices I like the word next I by
the way we keep getting whispers about
yeah you know there's always going to be
something hot right around the corner
you know there's always going to be
something new coming down the pipe
especially in mobile technology and
honestly I think you have to jump on
what looks compelling to you Nexus
products are awesome in the Android
world but honestly I haven't been
recommending a nexus phone to people who
ask me what Android they should get by
and large because when I ask them
questions it turns out that their needs
are met by phone that's not a nexus
phone like the galaxy s3 or like the 1x
or whatever skin be damned so I think
that you need to wait personally this is
me McKinley Michael you need to wait
until the device drops you need to hold
it in your hand read a couple reviews
get a feel for the software and then
make the decision then because if you're
constantly looking into the future and
seeing what's coming next you're never
going to be able to buy anything and if
possible just go the European weight and
don't buy on contract right if if you
can afford it yeah no absolutely
absolutely and honestly end of the day
that's what pocket now is here for we're
gonna tell you what's new and what's
coming down the pike but we're all gonna
tell you this is what is available now
we're gonna let you know after the buzz
if it's still worth it after it's not
shiny and new anymore so that you know
if this is something that you should put
your money into her if you should wait
for the next round to come around dad we
agreed that is a solid button right
there Joe thank you make a tshirt out of
my way
well with that guys I'm sure that it has
been an excellent podcast I want kind of
want to wrap it up here it it has been
awesome having you on the show Joe thank
you for joining us I'm glad I could make
it thank you me too I'm glad we could
fulfill the desires of some have some
commenters and readers and probably a
lot more than actually commented so
we're looking forward to having you back
again very soon since you have all me
drake and you sound great it's brand new
shiny today you should do an after the
buzz yeah when it's not shiny on you and
for exactly ah detection face Mike um
now it pocket now Puckett this that
would be a cool name for thing all right
we got here Tony anything before we wrap
up here I think we're already too long
too many words today so I'm gonna skip
this one and hand it over to Joe because
he's a special guest sounds sounds good
what are you what are you handing it
over to Joe for whatever i'm closing
thoughts Oh closing thoughts yes yes Joe
do you haven't it is it is the wrap-up
session uh you know I just wanted to say
thanks for having me on I want to do
this more often obviously it gets great
especially meeting with you guys to our
to our listeners and to our readers it
you're gonna read something from us on
pocket now and I want everybody to know
that just because one editor says
something doesn't mean that that's the
only opinion that we have here and I
think that's one of the great things
about the podcast as we get so many
different opinions in different
perspectives I mean can you imagine
you're hearing opinions about about
blackberry from an Android guy or from
you know I OS the cross over is what's
there and that's what makes it great and
that's where you know I like having
everybody follow us on twitter and on on
google+ so that you can get some of that
participation because once the articles
posted we don't leave it alone Tony's
commented lots of times on my articles
you have to Michael so we try and add
that on the articles the podcast just
makes it a lot easier yeah they're great
what's that that is Sal
and that that rat us out of the wrap up
yep that's right that's that's it
