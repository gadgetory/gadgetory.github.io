hinting to water resistance in
photography hmd wants to spark more
nostalgia bringing back the Nokia X and
you're just as shocked as I am and the
new LG g7 renders trying to divert your
attention from the infamous knotch
I'm Jaime Rivera and the jokes aside my
sister's actually flattered about your
comments yesterday on Instagram this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for the Apple watch Series three
the Nike variant which just brings some
different bands and stuff it's currently
on sale you can get the 38 millimeter
for 296 and then in the cellular variant
is a 327 and then you can get even the
LTE variants for 350 and 380
respectively not significant deals but
they're there now let's talk about the
LG G 7 we are not really liking the
whole concept of LG bringing the knotch
but the company is apparently still
going to do that and they are trying to
divert your attention from that there's
a reason teaser that emerged courtesy of
Evan Blass and we don't see the notch in
the photo but if you notice the signal
bars and everything they're separate so
yeah LG G 7 with a notch that's the way
to go now let's talk about hmd and their
recent sort of teaser to nostalgia
apparently the company is working on
bringing a throwback to the Nokia X for
those of you that don't remember we
actually cover this phone many years ago
2014 I know that's not many years but
yeah that was the whole Android variant
that was under the Microsoft
Administration that ended up being
pulled months later and you know that
user interface was kind of cool we
actually have videos of that if I could
find them in the library think about it
is nokia X apparently it's coming back I
wonder if they're bringing back the UI
as well and speaking of nostalgia
blackberry CEO John Chen was in a recent
interview and you know the interview
just spun off in an interesting
direction where
they just started talking about the
BlackBerry Bold 9900 which was my
favorite blackberry of all time
and according to Chenin would be a nice
idea if somebody would pull it off and
price said between 150 to 200 dollars
and it's not the confirmation that we're
getting something like that but TCL I
mean listen to the buzz that's not a bad
idea at all and finally the very
interesting news today had to do with
the 1 plus 6
we've got teasers from the company
hinting to the fact that we're getting
water resistance finally for those of
you who didn't know in the past one plus
units did have water resistance to a
certain degree they just didn't have an
IP rating and apparently now they're
getting this in addition to that we
already have teasers from Peter Lau on
photography the company has been pushing
photography's to 1+5 haven't necessarily
succeeded but in today's question let us
know what other things would you
consider that oneplus should focus on
when it comes to the 1 plus 6 in order
to make it compelling aside from the
price tag in my case I think the price
tag alone is important enough but if the
company would just not just follow ship
when it comes to photography but
actually bring something different I'd
be really compelled to see but that's
just me leave us a comment down below
