even some shortages due to probable
demand the LG optimus g pro is now
unofficially leaked for AT&amp;amp;T and nokia
schedule is a new press event and we're
trying to figure that one out I'm hai
meri beta and if phablets are still not
your thing then you're probably in the
wrong decade this is out daily
let's start today talking about the
galaxy s4 we've got some more coverage
for you hit the links in the description
for more details and even though we had
some reports a probable shortages on the
galaxy s4 it is now seeing pre-orders on
verizon so of course stay tuned we've
got a lot more coverage coming up and
yes you can out pre-order the device on
pretty much every carrier in the United
States now let's talk about LG the
company executives are now teasing that
the company is working on bringing
flexible displays into smartphones this
year not this decade this year and this
is not new Samsung has been teasing
about flexible displays forever but we
still haven't figured out how the
company plans to also make the chassis
flexible a lot of the battery so while
they figure that one out we'd love to
see to believe and hopefully these are
not just prototypes or concepts and
speaking of LG even though we're a
couple of days from their May first
events we've already got some teasers
and some leaked photos of the optimus g
pro coming to AT&amp;amp;T and as expected from
our previous review of the international
version this device is pretty much the
same only it brings the AT&amp;amp;T logo and
we've got the Snapdragon 600 included on
the specs as well this is pretty much
the first phablet out there that
includes a 1080p display but it's no
galaxy note to make sure you hit the
links in the description for the full
review and it could probably help you
decide this is the phone for you now
let's talk about sprint of HTC we've got
some leaked rumors that both companies
are working on bringing their windows
phone to the market which is kind of
interesting since apparently this will
be the HTC tiara and from leaked rumors
from verizon apparently this device will
sadly be a mid-tier phone so it does
make you wonder is it really worth it to
wait for windows phone on sprint no and
finally for the interesting news of the
day nokia has you sent out press
invitations for an event to happen in
london on May fourteenth and since we
already have the verizon of it happening
at ctia we
assuming that the Nokia Lumia 928 will
be left for this CTIA event and then
we'll be finally getting that Nokia
Lumia catwalk aluminum EOS camera and
design that's already been leaked so
much that I'm tired now interesting
enough even though this device or both
these devices are kind of interesting
it's kind of hard to know if both
devices will be the same device or if we
won't be getting that catwalk innovation
finally and not until the fall so that
leads me to the question of the day you
know first of all are you any of you
waiting for a nokia lumia product right
now is that really what you want to buy
you know at times with the HTC One and
the galaxy s4 it's kind of hard to see
people waiting on a nokia lumia with all
these hot android phones i mean of it
ran android it will probably hold more
water than it currently does but leave
us a comment down below in my particular
case i want the HTC One and of course if
you want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone it's
helping old make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com and subscribe to our
youtube channel as well you can also
follow me on twitter diamond underscore
of ivetta please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
hey Madalena thank you very much for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
