into some production constraints it
seems that the rumors of the ipad pro
continue and this time we talk about
case renders and microsoft seems to be
focused on being predominant on android
phones I'm hi Mary vetta enjoying Monday
just as much as you would enjoy a
hangover today this is pocket out daily
brought to you by lynda.com the official
nurse today have to do with Microsoft
and that's been the case for the last
couple of days the company's event in
China continues to happen and in some
interesting slides we get to hear that
even though the company has already
partnered with Samsung for the launch of
certain Microsoft Office applications
within the galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge
it seems that that's just the tip of the
iceberg the company has already landed
other signatures from Dell pegatron
position to other companies that are
coming very soon as it seems that the
company doesn't just want to make money
with Android as it already does with
patents but also with services the other
official news today have to do with
Google as the company's Eric Schmidt
with recently in an interview with The
Wall Street Journal talking about google
glass if you thought the thing was dead
after they killed off the Explorer
program in January actually that's not
what the company is planning according
to Schmidt just because he's not driving
a self-driving car or being driven by
one doesn't mean that it's not going to
happen it's just the work in progress
just like Google glass it seems that the
company understands that users didn't
really like being called glass holes in
addition to other claims from the $1,500
price tag let's see when that will
happen as we hear Tony Fadell as being
part of the leadership and other changes
as the company wants to find the way to
consumer eyes the product hopefully they
figure it out i'll talk about HTC we get
some other interesting renders of the
one m9 plus if it will ever happen and
well the home button at the bottom just
looks a tad fake for my taste but it
could be that the thing is real we're
not sure these are other decoys from HTC
that ended up being real but reports
claim that this device will only have a
5.2 inch quad HD display so if you were
expecting this major phablet to be the
one m9 plus it seems that it will just
be a better one
nine which I'm sure other people are
looking for our full review is already
live make sure you watch it and what is
that typical thing that happens whenever
a new Apple product is about to launch
supply constraints that is the rumor
that always happens and we wonder if
that's deliberate reports claim that
Apple is struggling with displays and
assemblies for the Apple watch up to the
point where the company is cutting its
targeted production in half could that
be the company's strategy and how to
make itself look good at the launch and
oh wow we just ran out of Apple watches
it could be the company's been doing it
for years but let's see hopefully they
meet the man then have crazy pandemonium
lines outside Apple stores just wonder
if it will and finally for the very hot
news of the day if you thought that the
ipad pro died with the new macbook it
seems that it didn't apparently the
company is still working on an ipad pro
for a proper launch at WWDC and we've
got some case renders and we know case
makers rarely get this wrong where it
seems that this new tablet has four
speakers tool or should i say two pairs
on each sides which is a great mainly
because speakers on the ipad are you
know commonly not the best because of
their position and the fact you have to
put your hand behind them and so many
other things but it's either this
product is coming and it does lead me to
the question of the day um when was the
last time that you bought a tablet are
you looking out for a bigger tablet do
you think that this is the solution to
make you want to buy another tablet
because in my case it's actually the
other way around the last time I bought
it was in the last generation ipad air
and i don't feel a need to upgrade but
leave us a comment down below what's
your experience and folks if you've ever
