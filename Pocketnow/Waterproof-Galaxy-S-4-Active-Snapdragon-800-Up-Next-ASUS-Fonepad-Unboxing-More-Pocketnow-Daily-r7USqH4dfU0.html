galaxy s4 the call comes snapdragon 800
to reach smartphones very soon we go
hands-on the asuste phone pad and tell
you all about it oh hi melody better and
you know how we roll thank God it's
Friday this is fuckin ell daily let's
talk today off talking about the asuste
phone pad you know that nexus 7 clone
that can actually make phone calls after
spending some time with it at mwc it's
now in the hands of our own and Tom Dean
are you who has no problems and using a
tablet to make phone calls so make sure
you hit the links in the description for
is unboxing in full coverage then let's
continue with Windows Phone and a recent
poll made by Forbes twenty-three percent
of the public so that they're
considering a Windows Phone along with
other options obviously but it's kind of
interesting because even though that 23%
is kind of high considering that iOS
pretty much owns forty percent of the
market Windows Phone currently only owns
four percent of the market so it makes
you wonder why do you have twenty three
percent of the people considering
Windows Phone only four percent actually
buying it how about if you leave us a
comment down below why have you not
chosen a windows phone for example now
let's move over to Google Play you know
we found it kind of odd that we noticed
about a couple of weeks ago that both
Facebook comen the Facebook native
application for Android actually updated
themselves without your consensus or the
Google Play consensus which is kind of
interesting if you consider what
Facebook is doing to try to move and joy
it away from the ecosystem just like
Amazon is doing with their own products
but well as expect that Google already
made their move and they've recently
updated the policies to Google Play
where applications are not allowed to do
this without the consensus of the google
play store in the typical way you get
the update notification and you update
your application so it bitch to wonder
what is facebook's next move now let's
talk about the qualcomm snapdragon
processor after spending some time with
the snapdragon 800 and 600 at CES we've
now been able to see just how powerful
the Snapdragon 600 is I mean the HTC one
in the galaxy s4 in the US variants have
very powerful processors and they're
also very power efficient but doesn't
stop there Quokka ms just confirmed that
they're now deploying or working on
deploying their new Snapdragon 800 for
future products that come in the
fall so if you thought your HTC One and
Galaxy s4 were top-notch well they won't
be in the next couple of weeks and
finally for the interesting news of the
day the Wall Street Journal has just
discovered that Samsung is working on
bringing a galaxy s4 that's both rugged
waterproof and dust proven they're
apparently going to call this the galaxy
s4 active and you know it's kind of
interesting because apparently the
company is not working on bringing you
an ugly galaxy s4 apparently they'll do
the same thing that Sony did with the
Xperia Z they'll figure out a way to
make the phone look exactly the same but
also be rugged waterproof and dustproof
it's kind of interesting I mean we still
don't know if this device will retail
for a much more expensive price but that
leads you to the question of the day
would you like a ruggedized phone
meaning would you even pay more money if
you had the option of getting an HTC One
for example in a ruggedized version in
my particular case to be honest with you
I thought that in 2013 all phones were
going to be waterproof I mean think
about it watches are waterproof a lot of
products are already waterproof we
really don't understand why phones have
it figure that out as it mainstream so
leave us a comment down below what would
you want of course it's always for an
early or scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
mode make sure you follow us on target
