for Android supremacy once again an
aluminium obelisk from Taiwan faces off
against a polycarbonate contraption from
South Korea as HTC and Samsung once
again prepare to slug it out we're here
to see just what their respective
flagships tell us about the way they'll
do battle this year I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is HTC versus
Samsung in 2014 the just released
all-new HTC One competes directly with
the Samsung Galaxy s5 we've already
reviewed the all-new HTC One see the
link in the description for that and
we've also gone hands-on with the galaxy
s5 on two continents our time with each
gives us a pretty good idea of where
these companies will be pinning their
hopes and making their stands in the
year ahead in some ways 2014 looks a lot
like 2013 with the all-new one
HTC builds on its legacy of outstanding
craftsmanship boosting the aluminum to
plastic ratio from 70 to 90% in the new
model and giving the gun metal versions
backplate a brushed hairline finish that
wouldn't look out of place in a gourmet
kitchen the wraparound metal and zero
gap construction gives the new m8 an
unmistakably luxurious feel in the hand
that has yet to be exceeded by any other
Android manufacturer that includes
Samsung while the glass weave
construction of the s5 offers a welcome
reprieve from the hyper glazed days of
old
the stippled texturing only reinforces
its roots in plastic and the device is
familiar face and lightweight may put
longtime Galaxy fans at ease but they
also recall the worst of that lines
cheap feeling which began with the
galaxy s3 and continued in slightly
improved form with the s4
but Samsung didn't become the world's
largest smartphone maker by accident it
did so by bringing a lot of compelling
features to the table and one of those
on the galaxy s5 looks to be its camera
the new shooter comes with an advanced
flash rapid and selective focus advanced
HDR and Samsung's usual bevy of shooting
modes all of it wrapped in Samsung's
traditional easy-to-use viewfinder now
HTC matches most of that point for point
on the new one and it frozen the added
bonus of a dedicated depth sensor for
focus adjustment without multiple
exposures plus it's got a keen new
viewfinder of its own improved zoe's and
the best gallery experience around so
why does Samsung have the edge in this
case resolution even if you're not a
member of the spec obsessed the
disparity in the Galaxy s5s 16 megapixel
camera and the HTC One S 4 megapixel
shooter is tough to ignore even if you
consider HTC's far superior front facing
camera but HTC comes back swinging with
boom sound the company might have
ditched Beats Audio but that doesn't
mean it's given up on delivering a
superb audio experience with the m8 on
the contrary the new one features new
speakers new amplifiers and larger
chamber size than its predecessor
resulting in a claimed 20% increase in
volume over the original HTC One and the
best audio experience we've ever heard
on a smart phone meanwhile samsung's
single speaker continues to loiter
around back on the galaxy s5 no matter
how loud it may be it's obvious that
samsung's focus is not on audio instead
it's on expanding into his own the
company is relatively new to the active
person's lifestyle in addition to the
bevy of wearables the company announced
a few weeks back Samsung also revealed
that it had ported a capability from
last year's Galaxy s4 active to its new
halo device life proofing actually ip67
water and dust resistance something
Sony's been doing for quite a while
apparently Samsung wanted in on the
praise from the press
and what praise has come is well-earned
again we have yet to review the galaxy
s5 but we've been saying durable phones
shouldn't have to be crappy phones for
years and it's nice to see a company as
large as Samsung agree sadly it doesn't
seem as though HTC will jump on that
bandwagon anytime soon the Joule like
precision construction of the all-new
one doesn't exactly lend itself to
durability
fortunately HTC is taking steps to
address that in another way at least
here in the United States not only has
the company made a promise to offer
timely Android and cents updates to its
premium smartphones within 90 days of a
major release it's also begun offering
free or inexpensive cracked screen
replacements to those whose phones have
an unpleasant run-in with the ground all
this is covered under a support program
called HTC advantage and while Samsung
has similar programs in some parts of
the world it has nothing comparable here
in the US as of yet there's one thing
both companies will focus intently on in
2014
specs sure HTC opted not to supercharge
its ultra pixel camera this time around
but the m8 is still a powerhouse not
only does it boast the new Snapdragon
801 processor it also brings a feature
its predecessor took some heat for
leaving out microSD expansion of course
samsung has offered that on most of its
smartphones for years and the Galaxy s5
is no exception
also the s5 does take the additional
step of incorporating a larger removable
battery when coupled with its
fingerprint scanner heart rate sensor
and it's slightly faster Snapdragon 805
processor the s5 still edges out the HTC
One but the gap is narrower now than it
has been in the past few years
whether the gap in sales numbers between
these two fierce rivals will narrow as
well is still anyone's guess it comes
down to how well HTC is able to market
the m8 and how successful Samsung will
be at convincing people that the Galaxy
S five brings enough new to the table
whatever happens it's interesting to see
these two massive companies tweaking
their formulas to stay competitive
Samsung by toning down the gimmicks
somewhat HTC by sticking to its familiar
formula and if rumors are to be believed
boosting its marketing effort ultimately
of course it all comes down to who buys
more of what so help us predict the
future leave a comment below telling us
which of these products or companies
you're throwing your money behind and
which one you think will emerge
