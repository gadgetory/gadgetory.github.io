you what life was like on the very first
pebble the product that smashed
crowdfunding records and almost
single-handedly launched the modern
SmartWatch era pebble would go on to
sell over a million units in both
standard and steel trims and when the
sequel pebble time hit Kickstarter this
past March it broke another record by
being the first Kickstarter project in
history to raise a million dollars in 49
minutes but where the original pebble
launched in a relative vacuum pebble
time has some stiff competition from
some pretty big players now that its
shipping to eager early adopters it's
time to see how it stacks up I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is our
pebble time review
pebble has always had kind of a unique
look to it and pebble time is no
exception
instead of continuing in the vein of the
aggressively angular pebble steel it
takes a different tack with a slimmer
smoother casing defined by matte
plastics and a huge metal bezel this is
probably the most polarizing element to
the design
it's made of PVD coated marine grade
stainless steel and it's round corners
give pebble time a very friendly very
inviting look but the bezel scratches
very easily and the low screen to body
ratio also makes it seem quite
antiquated like an old television set
factor in the red color of our review
unit and the pebble time seems almost
juvenile fortunately you do have a
choice in color and it's also easy to
swap wrist bands we choose a standard 22
millimeter attachment so you can find
one you like at a price that works for
you
future bands from pebble hardware
developers will be able to plug into the
watch's expansion port to add more
features and even if you just stick with
the stock band its soft stretchy
material is very comfortable on the
wrist pebble time is also shower and
swimming friendly with 30 meter water
resistance the gorilla glass display
protection is pretty tough and the watch
is so lightweight you might forget
you're wearing it until you get a
message anyway you'll read those
messages and you know the time on a 1.25
inch ePaper display that finally brings
pebble into the world of color screens
but it's not the color you're used to
it's far more muted than a more common
LCD or AMOLED panel and it's lit by a
very dim blueish backlight that only
comes on for a few seconds on a button
press or with a firm shake of the rest
sadly depending on watch face it doesn't
always have enough contrast to read it
clearly on the upside it is always on
you don't need to push a button just to
see the time as on some other watches
and its energy sipping technology is
mighty kind - battery life more on that
in a second where pebble time shines is
in software version 3.0 brings an
entirely new interface based around
something called the timeline a very
smart feature that makes the pebble less
notification drone more
personal assistant from the watch face
you just click the down button to show
what's happening right now on your
calendar you can keep clicking down to
see further and further into the future
or click up to go back in time and see
what you might have missed and it's not
just the calendar appointments either
depending on what apps you have
installed you can see sports scores news
headlines missed calls and more and the
more devs build timeline compatible apps
the more useful the timeline is likely
to get speaking of developers there are
lots of them as a press time pebble
claimed over 8,000 apps in its app store
roughly double what Android wear and the
Apple watch offered as of a couple
months ago these range from stop watches
and weather trackers to tide clocks for
certain harbors around the world all of
which you can download and install
through the pebble time companion app
there are thousands of watch faces as
well in almost every style you can think
of and you can even make your own pretty
easily apps and watch faces alike are
accessed by pressing the center button
on the right side to open the vertically
scrolling menu you can go back to the
watch face by pressing the left side
button and if you want you can assign
specific apps to a long press of the up
or down buttons for quick access
most interface actions are accompanied
by animations - yeah they're a little on
the cutesy side but there's zippy enough
that they don't slow down the
interactions much at all and they really
do a good job of completing pebbles
unique charm no other SmartWatch has
this fun bubbly personality it's really
kind of nice pebble started out two
years ago as a very simple notification
device and it still performs that core
function quite well texts calls event
reminders emails anything you've
selected as important will buzz your
wrist when it comes in if it doesn't
require a reply you can read the whole
thing right on your watch and move on
with your day or you can reply with a
canned response or by dictating into
pebbles microphone which works fairly
well while the debate continues to rage
about the utility of the SmartWatch in
general I made up my mind after a week
on the first pebble two years ago it's
awesome you really can't understand how
useful it is until you've tried it
yourself it will completely change the
way you use your smartphone by giving
you a thousand fewer reasons to reach
for your smartphone to
the course of the week and a week is
exactly how long pebble time lasts on a
single charge the company promised
seven-day endurance and even with my
very heavy notification traffic that's
just what I got better yet even when the
battery ticked down to 0% on the seventh
day and all the smart features shut down
it still continued telling the time four
hours after it should have died when I
finally plugged it in it only took the
pebble time an hour to charge back up to
a hundred percent after which I was set
for another whole week
that's battery life the Apple watch and
Android wear can only dream up so it's
easy to forgive the pebbles finicky to
sensitive magnetic charging cable
because you just won't use it that often
if you're a first-time pebble user it'll
probably take you most of that week to
get used to the way this watch does
things for voice recognition and rich
notifications to work you need to
install the Android wear app on Android
so pebble can leverage its architecture
and many actions like controlling media
take more steps on pebble and work with
a narrower range of apps than Android
wear but in other respects pebble is a
very powerful instrument because of its
motivated developer base which includes
big names like if this then that GoPro
Yelp Evernote and that's not even
counting the fitness and health titles
that tie into the pebbles motion sensors
and what limitations do exist pebble
cleverly embraces weaving them into its
messaging as a kind of geek cred the
interface and branding are littered with
retro style 8-bit design that gleefully
calls out the offbeat display and
software graphics and reminds us that
pebble is more indie accessory than
fashionista bling so far that sense of
identity and an early start have kept
the company healthy even in the face of
the massive competition that's arisen
since 2012
pebbles fanbase plus with the
contrarians who always prefer the
underdog alternative will all but ensure
the economic success of pebble time and
its forthcoming follow-up pebble time
steel also for iPhone owners it's a much
cheaper and much simpler alternative to
the pricy Apple watch but pebble really
can't afford to rest on its laurels for
all its innovation and personality
pebble time is still less i grabbing
than much of the competition in terms of
fit and finish and display technology
and the result is a product that doesn't
really feel like it earns it's nearly
$200 price tag in the world of wearables
fashion counts and for the same money
you can get a much nicer looking device
from Google to whose ecosystem is
growing at a much faster rate
by the way the upshot the pebble time is
a solid simple SmartWatch with some
great ideas driving it and if you do buy
one you'll probably grow to love it just
as much as I loved its predecessor I was
just hoping for something a little
grander from the parents of the modern
SmartWatch for more on pebble time check

available June 26th and see our feature
article on using it with an iPhone for a
less Android centric take of this device
