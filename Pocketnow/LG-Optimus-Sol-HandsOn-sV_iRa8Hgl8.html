pocketnow.com and we're taking a look at
the LG optimus sol this one was leaked a
couple of weeks ago as part of LG's this
year's lineup it's basically a
medium-range phone with video
specifications has got me one gears
processor and it's strange that we
consider wireless processors as medium
but the phone is pretty slick it's all
black kinda resembles the nexus s but
the screen is great and we have a
speaker piece a front facing camera and
we have not four but I'm very
competitive bubbles 14 menu one for home
and one for back first this one has a 50
degree so camera at the back which is
some flash but this is a budget film and
that will go
or very cheap or free carriers it's
running android 2.3 Gingerbread which is
always the great addition and dimensions
of the screen are integrated pixels
across and w VG
let's see in the menu as you can see
it's running LG's only user interface on
top of Android it's just going to
settings and
see what we have here
we have Android 2.3 2.4 suits let the
latest it's not two point three point
five it's gingerbread nonetheless let's
see if we have an internet connection on
it
let's go to say
it should be on wireless is
so did the
full of yours you know this is
just as much she lands
it really doesn't feel like it's lagging
it's 1 gigahertz processor after all so
everything should be buttery smooth
a LG remove care service application
I notify LG there's any application
crashing and here we have the eve of age
almost loaded up really let's give it a
few seconds
still loading with a little a little bit
choppy but that's understandable so this
was a popular film taking a look at the
brand new LG optimus thank you very much
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
