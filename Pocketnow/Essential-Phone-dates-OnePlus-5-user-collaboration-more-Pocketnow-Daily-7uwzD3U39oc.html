essential phone in addition to details
on its new digital assistant one post
wants to involve customers even with the
packaging of the 1+5 we have a few OEMs
committed to the cemetery I'm 8:35
cellular PCs I'm hi Natalie that I and
the you know what the space means it
means two hours of sleep
pretty much this is parking out daily
let's begin today with product launches
I know some of you are interested in the
BlackBerry key one of the United States
a today it is available on Amazon and
best buy there are a ton of reasons why
you should want its phone sure it
doesn't have the best specs nor do
people go crazy over the keyboard
anymore but still an absolutely
everything else this smartphone does an
amazing job particularly in battery life
if you learn more in the description as
well the spotlight over two changes LG
is investing in crazy three point five
seven billion dollars in its OLED
technology
why because customers are gecko wanted
and surely its IPS division is going to
find the crazy drop right now that Apple
might move to OLED and hey we have LG
displays on the Apple watch and P OLED
has brought a lot of innovation over
time so yeah it makes a lot of sense for
LG to make this move ASAP and for those
of you that are in the market for the
one plus five obviously we don't have
anything official yet we know the phone
is very close to getting announced and
oneplus really wants to involve its
customers in everything up to the
packaging there is only two away but
website obviously you need a Weibo
account but you can participate enough
to seven different design options for
the unboxing experience which I'm
obviously going to enjoy so stay tuned
for that and let us know what you think
of these options as we're the slow life
over to Qualcomm and Microsoft both
companies have just announced they are
working together with OEM like HP seuss
and even Lenovo in building snapdragon
835 pcs they're calling them cellular
pcs obviously this provides a ton of
extra functionality we love the fact
that Windows 10 is now capable of
running on the snapdragon and we've seen
how powerful the step dairy and
processor can be with devices like the
Galaxy s8 and deck
so yeah you can learn more about when
these products will be available in the
link in the description as well and
finally the very hot in Shazam do again
with the essential phone one because we
now know that this phone will be ready
for shipping in a month that's really
close great timing number two the fact
that we learned that there is this very
interesting proactive assistant to be
included in the essential phone the only
interesting part is we still don't know
exactly how this is going to be
different to the Google assistant Siri
Bixby you name it at a time when AI is
trying to grow obviously fragmentation
only makes things more complicated but
anyways it leads into the question of
the day are you ordering the essential
phone is this a product that you want in
my case I can't wait to review it what I
buy it yes I would
I trust auntie Reubens taste a lot but

way it goes if you want to get the news
