now this apparently is no dummy samsung
announces the galaxy s5 lte-a its first
quad HD smartphone and amazon wants to
make competition hot with its new fire
phone I'm hi Mary bit I and if this
Amazon fire phone doesn't succeed you at
least say that it literally crashed and
burned this is parking out date let's
begin today with the official news as
Samsung has just announced this galaxy
s5 lte-a this is pretty much a galaxy s5
in every way the only difference is that
you support a quad HD display and you
have a Snapdragon 805 processor now
they're in mind the smartphone is
apparently an exclusive to the Korean
market there's no confirmation that it
will come to the United States at some
point it's really hard to know if this
is the galaxy that's been rumored or the
galaxy s5 Prime that's also been rumored
so let's see how that goes as this is
probably the phone and if you've been
asking yourself the question if you
should buy a SmartWatch or an activity
tracker like a Fitbit well this is kind
of revealing if you thought that one
would sell more than the other the
difference is kind of staggering there
are currently two point 35 million
activity trackers in the markets sold
compared to 600,000 smartwatches yeah
just 600,000 smartwatches that's how bad
the market is and it could either be the
fact that smart watches are too pricey
we're actually it's odd because i find
the Tiffany trackers to be too pricey
for what they are but interesting what
have you gotten leave us a comment down
below now let's talk about the Google
Nexus 6 as yeah there have been rumors
that there is no smartphone coming that
Android silver will be the deal but you
know the executive was recently
interviewed and when asked about the
nexus 6 his response was that uh either
he doesn't know because they aren't
producing any or he doesn't know because
they're just not getting the nexus 6
contract so it's really hard to know if
there won't be a nexus 6 as LG has been
doing the phone for two years straight
they've been doing a decent job so far
uh hopefully there will be a nexus 6
obviously there is more to come google
i/o specially now we've got some more
iphone 6 leaks but this time it's not
about dummies as I'm
bored of those but jimmy lin is a famous
actor from taiwan who was famous because
he leaked the iphone five weeks before
it was launched and it was a real phone
not just a dummy unit and as it turns
out he's currently repairing his iphone
5s from smash display and beside it we
have the 5.5 inch iphone 6 and the
reason why we know it's the 5.5 inch
model is because a couple of days ago he
leaked the 4.7 inch model which also did
not look like a dummy obviously it's
hard to know these are working products
because that Apple has a tight grip on
the way iOS activates but so far these
look like the real deal and it looks
kind of cool links to this repair for
full photos and finally for the
literally hot news of the day not
necessarily very hot amazon has just
launched its Amazon fire phone and yes
it is happening the whole leaks
everything amazon has a smartphone runs
a you know its own version of its amazon
OS for android at sport version and
obviously it works on its App Store it's
got this really cool 3d why for the lock
screen and the browser internap
locations it's really cool has a
13-megapixel camera other great
specifications it's actually a very very
decent phone but its biggest problem is
that it costs twenty dollars on contract
this is that a free prime phone as many
of us were thinking and that's for the
32 gig mall if you want the 64 gig model
will cost you an extra hundred dollars
which is not necessarily about price but
still you know it competes with devices
like the galaxy s5 where you can load
Amazon applications on it and you can
load the amazon appstore and you have an
Amazon phone there without the 3d though
there are other ways to do the parallax
and stuff but that leads you to the
question of the day looks in the
description with fat full details on the
Amazon fire phone and tell us what you
think would you buy this phone in my
case honestly for 3d um I'm gonna pass
but what do you think leave us a comment
