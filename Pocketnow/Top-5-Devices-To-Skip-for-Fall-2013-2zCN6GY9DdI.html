year for you to spend a lot of money on
gadgets and trust me it's our
responsibility to make sure that you
don't spend your money on stuff that's
really not worth it so I'm high never
leave it out this is pocket now and
these are the top five gadgets that we
would recommend you skip for the fall of
2013 number five is the HTC One max and
we wish this phone was in here but it
sadly is more because it's pretty much a
big HTC one with some of the HTC one
mini specifications meaning it's not
really better than the HTC One it's just
a big phone and judging by the fact that
the HTC One was probably one of the best
phones of the spring of 2013 we really
don't understand why HTC launch such a
big phone I mean for the amount of money
that they want for this phone there's
really no reason to not buy a galaxy
note 3 seriously number four is the
iphone 5c and trust me on this don't buy
this phone it's really not worth it for
an extra hundred dollars you can go for
the iphone 5s and get an aluminum design
aside from a better camera you get touch
ID you get pretty much the flagship
phone for an extra hundred dollars
seriously the problem of the iphone 5c
is that is just so overpriced that it
doesn't make sense so please just skip
this phone number three is the surface 2
and i'm sure there will be one day when
we won't have a surface tablet on this
video list but sadly Windows RT is still
not where we want it to be it still
hasn't grown up there are still no
applications there and sadly i wish that
Windows RT could run windows phone
applications that will probably make the
ecosystem more compelling but so far
sadly if you want to get a real windows
experience the best things for you to
buy other tablets there are some really
good Dell Venue tablets out there that
will run full Windows applications and
make it completely worthless free to buy
this surface to number two is the
Samsung Galaxy gear and i'm still trying
to answer this question why would you
buy a galaxy gear for an extra couple
hundred dollars when compared to a
pebble for example sadly it's not any
better than the pebble and as it turns
out for the extra price tank it's really
not worth it when you consider the fact
that it's really limited right now you
can only make it work on
galaxynote3 and even though it will
support other galaxy phones in the
future it's really not worth it i mean
it doesn't bring anything compelling to
the market just yet it could be a great
prototype and i'm sure that it'll be
great in its version too but so far
nobody has really figured out the
SmartWatch yet and for 300 something
dollars forget it and the top number one
device or devices that we will recommend
you skip for the fall of 2013 our
blackberries any blackberry it doesn't
really matter the company is on a dead
spin I don't think even the company
knows where they're headed even though
they're taking bits from Apple and
Microsoft to split the company in part
we really don't know what the feature is
for BlackBerry's so right now buying a
z10 or a cute enter of Z 30 whatever you
want to call these phones is just really
dumb there is really no future in this
platform there's really no feature in
the ecosystem a lot of products are
already falling there were only
blackberry based so really don't spend
your money on BlackBerry's right now at
least until they figure out their future
if they really have any but anyways that
leaves using the question of this top
five what device would you recommend to
skip for the fall of 2013 what device
have you bought and you seriously regret
leave us a comment down below in my
particular case I really don't have one
right now because that was my iPad Mini
purchased last year but anyways leave us
a comment down below thats it for our
top 5 thank you very much for watching
remember these are just the products
that were launched after the spring of
2013 so obviously there are a lot more
products out there that you should skip
but anyways make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to a new channel
as well you'll also follow me on twitter
hein underscore nevada please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am Hein very meta thank you very
much for watching we'll see you on the
next top five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
