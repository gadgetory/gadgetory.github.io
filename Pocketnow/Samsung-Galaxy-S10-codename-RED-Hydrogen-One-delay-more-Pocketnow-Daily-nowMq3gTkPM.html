Galaxy S 10 along with its key feature
Apple is trying to get rid of the dongle
and our hopes for the headphone jack are
disappearing and set your calendars for
something new from HTC as we finally get
a teaser I'm Jaime Rivera and my
experience with the LG G 7 thank you has
been actually more positive than I
thought stay tuned for coverage
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with Nokia I'm not the
first one to be completely shocked with
what hmd has been able to do with the
brand and their products are selling
like hotcakes they are announcing that
they are launching the Nokia six in the
United States a snapdragon 630 16
megapixel camera a 3000 milliamp hour
battery sure it's not a great SPECT
phone but it's 270 bucks and their build
quality is amazing there's more
information in the description now for
those of you that have been waiting for
the red hydrogen one smartphone me
included the company hasn't really
launched the phone yet because it's
still working on a couple of things bear
in mind we hear that it's going to
launch somewhere around August or later
mainly because the company wants to
figure out all the sensors that it's
needs to be able to provide this
holographic experience and if you ask me
when I think I feel that the company
wants to do something so bold and so
unique that I'm willing to wait it out
now all of us set our calendars for May
23rd as HTC has just teased that there
will be an event for a new product to be
announced they're not being specific as
to what product we're getting or
assuming it's the HTC you 12-plus think
about it is the company says that this
product is bigger than the sum of its
specs and that's that means a lot there
are products like that like for example
the Google pixel to excel which doesn't
have the latest specifications and yet
makes a ton of the latest phones look
bad so we can't wait to see what we get
as HTC is one of those primary partners
that allows the first pixel to exist and
the pixel 2 as well now and some
interesting news that I don't know if I
should worry about or not we hear that
the supplier for dongles for iPhones is
apparently not getting any orders from
Apple
it seems that
company doesn't want to give you the
option to connect your 3.5 millimeter
audio to the phone that is extremely
polarizing either Apple is sitting on a
ton of dongles and they just want to get
rid of them or it could be that we're
getting the headphone jack back because
Apple finally learned that people
actually care about this or worse the
company wants to make it a bluetooth
only product which I feel would be a
huge mistake a huge mistake
but hey let's see what we get and
finally the most interesting news today
I have to do with the Samsung Galaxy S
10 we have a codename believe it or not
it is going to be project beyond and
we're already scratching our heads
exactly what does samsung mean with
beyond look at this product bring that
will not be an iteration to the current
design that we've seen pretty much ever
since the galaxy s6 I'm not complaining
about the design or what the product
brings or anything we're just very
curious so in today's question let us
know what do you think exactly Samsung
is bringing here that's beyond what we
know the rumors mostly point to the on
display fingerprint scanner apparently
they're not figuring face ID just yet
leave us a comment down below I feel
that it has to be more than that

news earlier follow what's I'm talking
