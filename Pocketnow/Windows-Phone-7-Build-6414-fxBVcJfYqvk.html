pocketnow.com Windows Phone 7 built 64
1/4 was just 2 released for the emulator
for developers
according to Microsoft this is very very
close to what we're going to see when
devices start shipping in just a couple
of months we're to walk through build 64
1 4 with you now and tell you what's
different let's get to it ok so a lot of
what's new is to help the user
experience be better so it's faster it's
easier to understand what the icons mean
you'll see what I mean in a second so
I'm going to click around to a variety
of these applications Here I am on the
home screen there are all my tiles they
move around a little bit more smoothly
than the last time we took a look at the
emulator build so let's jump into some
screens here so here we are in the phone
application and things seem to whip up
faster you're going to take notice of
that soon so if we dial number all the
screens are a lot more refined as you
can see here is the calling screen we
can open up the keyboard do all sorts of
things and let's go back to the start
spinning because there's nothing
interesting here except I do want to
show you one thing you see these buttons
here at the bottom in previous builds of
Windows Phone 7 we didn't know what they
meant but now if you tap on these three
dots and you get the expanded menu you
will always get a little caption
underneath each button very very helpful
really will help you to understand the
icons while keeping the operating system
clean let's jump back we go to the
people tab we can't do that much in here
I have one contact and we can swipe to
the right says set up Facebook but when
you go to add an account you can't add
any account Twitter or Facebook exchange
Gmail it just it doesn't work in the
emulator so it's really difficult to
show you that but of course this is the
people hub which is where all the
different feeds come through all of your
pictures all of your contacts what's
going on with the various people that
you keep in touch with so nothing really
different there the calendar is mostly
unchanged except that of course as I
mentioned if you click on these three
buttons you get little captions
underneath of the icons if we click on
calendars you can have variety of
calendars synchronizing to the same
place so you can have one for Gmail one
for exchange and so on and so forth I
added something there to remind myself
to film the video as a demonstration we
can flip to another view we can go to
the month view and go up and down very
smooth very fast fluid interface here we
can go into messaging which has been
spruced up as well I have one
conversation with Bob and look how nice
it is it's just a simple speech bubble
that lets you know what you said last
you can add an attachment which would of
course be a message let's jump back to
the Start screen
email setup can't do anything with this
it says add an account and you can't you
can't add an account so let's go back to
this screen Xbox Live hasn't been
changed much and I hope you're seeing
how fast this has become before it was a
little bit slow it seemed that the
animations were taking too long
but now everything is just so fluid
which is great to see Internet Explorer
is working very well so we can actually
go to a website let's go to pocket now
calm the keyboard actually makes a
different sound now than it did before
a little bit more subdued which is good
so this does have Internet connectivity
so it's loading pocketnow.com pretty
cool as if you were to use the device in
in front of you very fast internet
rendering speeds of course this is on an
emulator so it's hard to tell how fast
it would be scrolling is super smooth
and DoubleTap the zoom in of course and
it resizes the column beautifully it's
tough to say how it will respond to
multi-touch because I'm not using an
auto multi-touch computer of course you
can do the pinch to zoom but things are
loading almost as fast as a desktop
browser and I hope this is a sign of
things to come for the Windows Phone 7
browser and we have some options we can
go to settings we can add as a favorite
right here and click OK and this is now
in our favorites menu we can go to the
favorites list here by going to the star
and you can see your history let's go
back with the back button you can open
up multiple windows which is nice let's
see how it handles that so we're going
to go up here to engadget.com
and here it comes through
okay seems to have stopped of course
this is an emulator so it may be a
little bit buggy but we can easily
switch between pages you get this nice
little animation a great and simple way
to move around between multiple pages we
dive into settings we have a few things
we can change we can allow cookies let
Bing suggest sites as I type of course
Microsoft's going to use Bing you can
set your preference to have mobile
version or desktop versions show up when
you use the web browser so let's get out
of this back to the Start screen the
pictures hub is generally unchanged
although it's a little bit more smooth
so here we have what's new so you can
see if people updated pictures on
Facebook and so on we can go to all
pictures and there are some pictures
included on the device so we can tap we
can swipe look how smooth the animations
are and it's right now it's actually
being slow but a minute ago it was very
smooth we can double tap to zoom in it
does it almost instantly we can we
should be able to tap on the tap and
holding on the picture and we get a
pop-up menu so we can use this as the
wallpaper and an ugly wallpaper we can
move this around to get it just right
click the check and let's see if it
actually said it
go back to the homescreen I think the
wallpaper would be the lockscreen and
we'll try the lockscreen in a few
minutes so let's continue down here we
have music and video this is the Zune
application and it's again much smoother
than it was in previous build so we can
swipe to the right swipe to the left
there's not much you can do with it
right now because it's not connected to
the marketplace but you can just see the
transitions and going in and out of
these various items it's just super
fluid it kind of whips into place if
that sort of makes sense back to the
home screen we go and then we have maps
the the Bing Maps application which is
actually quite functional in this build
we get the weighting dots up at the top
it says Bing is not available so maybe
it won't work for us in this
demonstration let's see perhaps we can
try coming back to it but it does work
and it works quite nicely kind of as you
would expect on another smartphone
device now of course we can move around
these tiles like we did before that
hasn't changed so we tap and hold can
slide things around and you get this
little unpin button and it will remove
something from your Start screen but of
course you would have to do that one at
a time because of the when you tap in
hold it only lets you action on one item
if you want to take it off the screen
now let's talk about the other stuff
that's on here if we swipe to the right
we get all of the applications and now
Microsoft hasn't changed this yet it is
really surprising because it's kind of
ugly to be honest it's just a long list
of applications and when you start
loading on third-party apps this list is
going to get long and there's not going
to be an easy way to navigate this menu
unless you're adding the programs to
your Start screen so we've talked about
some of these things alarms very basic
functionality here you can add a new
alarm from click the back button
calculator these are standard built in
applications they've been slightly
modified in this latest build of Windows
Phone 7 scrolling down we have
marketplace won't let us connect to
marketplace we have the People Hub what
I haven't shown you yet is office 2010
in this build and settings let me go
into office 2010 now and this has been
further refined again so we can explore
word we'll go into the word application
you get this tutorial this is a whole
more it's a lot more involved than what
we saw previously which is nice so we
can scroll down and that's great let's
open up a new document it looks like
it's making me edit this so I'm going to
try to find a way to open up a new
document and here we can add comments to
the document and really great
collaboration features within office
2010 Mobile that's really one of the
hallmarks of Windows Phone 7 so so this
is great you could type and you get the
idea from there you can should be able
to press ENTER and well let's go back to
the office of don't Save Changes so very
simple pop-up Metro like interface of
course we're used to that SharePoint
integration we can open a document or
list on Microsoft SharePoint Server or
open in the URL and let's jump into
Excel real quick before we dive into
settings so this is just a look at Excel
Mobile and it's a lot more powerful than
what it was in previous versions of
Windows Mobile and that's great because
Microsoft Office is really one of
Microsoft's key products and it's great
to see if they're really spending a lot
of time on it here in Windows Phone 7
so it has saving functionality and you
get the idea so let's go back and dive
in the settings for a minute before we
conclude this video settings have been
updated a little bit something new is
that you can change the theme to a
variety of different colors now before
was only three colors but now they've
extended this I hope they extend this
further because I mean these colors
aren't the the most fantastic colors on
the planet I'd like to have a little bit
more choice and so of course we can
change this to lime you can change the
background to light the black
backgrounds more suited for AMOLED
displays well this is good for LCD so if
we go back to the home screen everything
is green spruce it up a little bit let's
jump back in to settings here very very
fluid interface I
really excited about how smooth this has
become we can change the ringtone and
sound the Bluetooth the lock wallpaper
we can change that to a variety of
wallpapers and these are really nice
pre-loaded wallpapers by the way so we
can set that and you can set the today
screen timeout jump back and keyboard
settings ease of access none of this
stuff is is terribly new let me go to
the about phone so you can see the build
number and everything that's built
obviously sixty four one four this is
apparently pretty much the final builder
very very close to the final build so
what you see here is what you're going
to get more or less when you get a
Windows Phone 7 device in the fall so
also you can drill into application
specific settings which is kind of a
play of what the iPhone does so you can
access these same settings within these
applications or you come to the settings
menu and do it individually so we can go
back to Internet Explorer and you're
gonna say this to see the same exact
settings that I showed you a minute ago
and we can dive in to specific
application settings from here so a lot
of improvement from what we saw in a
previous build of Windows Phone 7 this
is almost ready for primetime this is
pretty much how it's going to look it's
faster it's easier to use we can't wait
till we can actually get a device in our
hands and use it for this operating
system is very very interesting and it's
shaping up to look really nice so please
thumbs up the video if you liked it and

Windows Phone 7 videos and videos on
