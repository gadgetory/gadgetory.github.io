9 emerge and we prepare for a launch
date apparently the LGG lineup is no
more and we get something called Judy
and Sony wants to bring back curves for
its smartphone lineup at MWC I'm Jaime
Rivera and speaking of nwc I'm back in
the New York studio at least for a few
days before Barcelona this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals I can't stress enough how much of
a fan I am of project Phi if you're in
the market right now for carrier service
I would highly suggest you look into
some deals right now where you can get
either a pixel 2 or pixel to excel or in
addition the Moto X 4 and you're getting
$80 off project fire which would pretty
much be a bad month of data usage you
can learn more about it in the
description now let's talk about Sony as
well the company hasn't been much when
it comes to smartphones lately but
they're teasing something big from wcm
which is a contrast usually see us as
their show they showed us mid rangers
this time we've got teasers that show us
curves
that's not common from Sony phones they
are the most boxy that can be except for
the razor phone but the T's are pretty
much hinged to a snapdragon 845 in
addition to a two by one aspect ratio in
the display razor sharp bezels sony has
been really good about that portion at
the end let's see what we get now let's
talk about LG and its future smart phone
line of apparently the G is going to end
and according to Evan blasphemous
tipster we are going to get something
codenamed Judy by sometime in June and
it seems that this phone will have a
couple of differences like obviously
snapdragon 845 in addition to a 6.1 inch
display but apparently this is going to
be an LCD what changes are we to expect
from LG going forward that's gonna be
rather interesting I wonder why the
change of the name which one would you
recommend I wouldn't call it Judy but we
know that's just the codename now let's
talk about the Huawei p20 lineup we're
not expecting to see this at MWC but we
would love to and the rumors are rather
interesting as apparently the phones
have just passed by the FCC we got spec
information like obviously the care 970
processor and
this until they always are capabilities
of the may 10 Pro yes the main 10
profile of that you just have to dig
into the security settings to find that
why Huawei but anyways we've also got
battery information p20 light is going
to bring a 2900 milliamp hour battery
the p20 is a 33 20 milliamp hour and
then a four thousand milliamp hour
battery on the larger variant that's
great we can't wait to hear about those
cameras and finally the very hot Nicias
they have to do with the samsung galaxy
s 9 and s9 less specification
information continues to jump in five
point eight inches in 6.2 inches on the
display six gigs of ram and four
actually the other way around but you
get that in addition we've got dual 12
megapixel cameras in the s9 plus
variable aperture between f 1.5 crazy
and f 2.4 and a single shooter that's
going to have those same capabilities in
the case of the galaxy s 9 specification
seem great but if i asked you today in
the question out of everything that
you've seen from design specifications
the approach what exactly do you feel
will lure you to buy a galaxy s 9 more
in my case you know with all those
variable apertures those things might be
cool that's great the design looks
gorgeous but really Samsung could
somebody please figure out the battery
if you figure out battery life on this
phone I will not stop using a galaxy I
