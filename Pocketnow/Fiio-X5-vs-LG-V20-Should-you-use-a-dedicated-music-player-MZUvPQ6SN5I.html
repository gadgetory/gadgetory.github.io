shop for all of our mobile computing
needs but there's a growing concern that
certain aspects of the smartphone are
starting to plateau now we get this
question a lot if you're really into
your music doesn't it make more sense to
invest in a standalone music player
won't the quality be better than trying
to do everything through our phones we
really wanted to answer that question
for the music fans in our audience but
as we were producing this video news
came down about a certain manufacturer
who was walking away from the dedicated
music player market and in the past
we've used Pheo they're a manufacturer
of high quality audio hardware this is a
little USB DAC that we've used in
previous reviews to talk about
smartphone audio because they do make
other products we are able to shift
gears and talk about this beauty in red
this is the third-generation Co x5 -
sexy little brick of a gadget chock full
of decks and amps and ports and dials
and buttons everything that you might
need to pump your high quality audio
files while on the go if the hypothesis
is music players do a better job than
phones shouldn't we test this little
player against the strongest phone
competitor we have yes one yes we should
and of course that means the LGV 20 I
praised this phone in a bunch of videos
on podcasts this is the highest quality
headphone experience you can get in a
phone today so this is the showdown a
test those claims see if I actually know
what I'm talking about when I'm
recommending audio gear jumping right in
with the hardware there's definitely
something I missed from that classic age
of iPods and zooms I love the design in
red but again just like with phones I
can't say I'm a huge fan of the glass
back again for shooting this video I've
got to wipe it down every single time I
touch it this is recalling that Golden
Age of mobile digital audio and I kind
of dig it and I really like the controls
the buttons the clicky tactile feel the
jog dial to control the volume again
it's a nice charming throwback to how we
used to control audio you never have to
really look at the screen play pause
skip next track a lot of these things
have been moved over to the headphone
the little microphone
own unit usually has some buttons on
there you can answer calls do all that
fun stuff too but especially when you're
dealing with nicer headphones they won't
always come with that remote control is
super important but looking at the
software side of that that's where a
modern smartphone is absolutely going to
excel the v20 is plenty powerful and I
do like the way that the LG music app is
laid out I think it's a nice pretty app
for music the Pheo is an Android media
player but it's running an older version
of the Android OS it's running Android 5
it can do pretty much anything another
Android device can do but there's not as
much point getting cranky about like web
browser scrolling performance the main
focus is audio and they're also assuming
you're not really going to be looking at
the screen as much as you are listening
to your music bill it would be nice if
it were a little prettier the video
starts you off with 32 gigabytes of
storage which is really more like 24 to
26 after formatting and partitioning but
it does come with dual memory card slots
if you really want to max out your
storage powering nicer audio hardware
with higher quality audio files drains
more battery than you might think
both of these should be good for around
10 hours of audio only playback but of
course you're probably using your phone
for more than just listening to music
happily though this is a standalone
media player it does have Wi-Fi onboard
you can connect to Spotify Pandora
google play music and especially for
those services that support offline
listening and the Bluetooth on board
supports appx so if you have headphones
that support that codec then you will
have also a higher quality wireless
experience when listening that's all
well and good we got all the gadgety
stuff out of the way but what really
matters is the audio quality bumping the
biggest audio files I've got lots less
files FLAC files these two are fairly
evenly matched anecdotally to my gear I
think the V 20 is a little more even
throughout the EQ spectrum and I do
think this phone bumps the bass just a
little more aggressively but I really
like what the feel is doing in the mids
the bass isn't is aggressive you've got
a little bit more room for instruments
and for the human voice to shine through
and I think you get a fuller and wider
stereo soundscape when listening on the
Pheo looking at the charts both of these
gadgets are closing in on the limits of
my home recording equipment so quality
of output you'll be
well served by either now quality is one
thing but what we also care about is the
amp output
it's that headphone volume that's the
area where the v20 absolutely shine
decimates all the rest of the flagship
phone competition pulling up another
chart I mean this is the V 20 up against
the galaxy si plus just no competition
there the V 20 is just stomping all over
what the galaxy can do I think we'd be
hard-pressed to find a portable player
that can really well well damn
this vo gets big it gets fat and it gets
loud a comfortable listening volume for
me is somewhere between 50 and 60
percent of the players total output
don't worry like you're not getting what
you pay for actually not driving this
thing to its maximum all the time also
helps reduce the amount of noise that
the player will add to your music and
this is a big deal even if you're only
bumping mp3 you might not have the ear
for all the AV geekery and the higher
quality audio files not know what you're
listening for but you can literally feel
when your headphones are not being
properly driven but I rambled on enough
let's wrap this out v20 versus feel x5
should you be using a dedicated music
player for your audio if you're using a
phone like the v10 the V 20 the LG G 6
with the quad DAC or the axon 7 this
probably isn't going to be a huge jump
for you but any other phone currently
available at the time this video was
shot the x5 absolutely crushes it's not
even close so $400 this is right up my
alley this is exactly the kind of
companion device I love taken with me
and it does it's got that old-school
charm for being that lump that brick in
my pocket that I know I can count on I
really did what feel is done here but
this is just another data point to
reinforce how consistently impressed
I've been by the LGB 20 comparisons like
these show us how much further we can go
with audio and how a lot of our other
phones out there really just good enough
