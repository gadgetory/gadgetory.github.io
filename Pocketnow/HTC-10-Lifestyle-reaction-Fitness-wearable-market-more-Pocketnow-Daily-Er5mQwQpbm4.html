company may bring some major changes
wearables continues to soar but it is an
Android wear that's taking charge and
Mother's Day deals might land you a good
gadget even if you don't apply I'm high
metal Iveta I have been waiting for
hours for the construction on the road
outside to finish but I'm done let's
just use noise cancellation this is
PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with deals
I don't assume that many of you actually
celebrate Mother's Day for yourselves
but pay if you're in the market for an
Apple product this is probably the best
time to buy Best Buy is currently
offering up to $100 off depending on
certain products there was a full list
of the lick of the description and yeah
we do know that mothers prefer iPad so
that's probably the reason why if you're
a t-mobile customer it's probably a good
idea for you to set your calendars for
June 6 according to Evan Blass it seems
that the company might be launching this
new application called team o Tuesday's
and the whole concept with this
application is actually to offer
freebies every Tuesday for your
subscriber here this I'm not talking
about freebies like a case for your
phone or anything like that I'm
targeting pizza for example which is
weird but hey it's free pizza and for
those of you that are wondering which
company is currently reigning supreme
when it comes to wearables oddly it is
not the Apple watch or at least it
depends on which market you're talking
about in the United States alone it
seems that Fitbit owns the market at 61%
and true the price of the Fitbit flexes
crazy difference compared to the Apple
watch for example but the size of the
market share for Apple is really small
there is more information in the liquid
description and then the odd part of the
news is the fact that actually
SmartWatch is our reigning supreme in
Europe but then again that's just the
percentage factor it doesn't necessarily
mean that the amounts are crazy
speaking of wearables we continue to
find more leaks of the Samsung gear 4 -
and it's ion X headphones we don't
necessarily talk about headphones here
the only cool part about these is that
apparently you won't need to use any
sort of cord to connect them apparently
there will be standalone headphones
which is OK for fitness actually it
makes a lot of sense in the case of the
gear fit - we do see a new design some
people are actually complaining that it
looks a lot like the Microsoft band -
which is not necessarily a good thing I
really did not like that design but then
again Samsung really needs to revamp its
fitness game they did a good job with
the gear s2 so I cannot wait to see what
they come up with and finally the
concerning news today I have the with
HTC as well the company is HTC 10 is
probably one of our favorite
bones of the year so far but the company
decided to launch the lifestyle Baron in
China and it seems the market doesn't
really like it up to the point where
only 251 units were pre-ordered no not
two hundred fifty one thousand two
hundred fifty one units that is crazy we
cannot wait to confirm the news but in
other interesting developments it seems
that the company might be considering
branching out its VR department and yeah
our review of the HTC vive is very close
to being published I love the product
but it's not perfect
I wonder exactly how much of a market
there is for a product like this and it
leads me to the question of today I mean
you've seen our coverage of the HTC vive
do you think that it would be a smart
move for the company to branch it out
because I don't think it would be a
smart idea I feel that VR is a good idea
it will be there someday but even in the
case of the vibe there is still things
that could be polished so I would assume
that it's better to just keep it in the
smartphone business but leave us a
comment down below what's your opinion
