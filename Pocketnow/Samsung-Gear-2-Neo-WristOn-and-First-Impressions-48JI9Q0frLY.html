pocket now here at the Samsung unpacked
5 event in New York City
checking out the Samsung Galaxy gears
successor the gear 2 neo so folks have
you've seen our video on the gear 2 the
neo will be very familiar and so will
this video where I hope you enjoy it all
the same the neo is very very similar to
the year - right down to the fact that
the Galaxy has been dropped and has
dropped the galaxy branding for this
device because it is running a special
build of Tizen not that you would be
able to tell because judging from just
from a UX standpoint it responds very
similarly to the Android powered Galaxy
gear you will notice if the gear will
wake up that you can have a custom
graphic on the neo whereas the gear can
finds you - this kind of stark wireframe
on black nice to have that added bit of
customization you'll also notice the Neo
is made of polycarbonate where there's a
lot more metal on the original gear and
the removal of the screws which I rather
liked and the addition of a horn button
which I rather don't like but the home
button is probably going to appeal to
some people more than
the addition of the home button is going
to appeal to more people then then
having to swipe down to go back all the
time though you can still do that but
hitting the button maybe more into it
for some I'm not a big fan but maybe
there's our settings when you have very
very similar responsiveness actually a
little more stuttery than we're used to
on the gear even though the hardware is
very comparable the display is the same
this may look like a camera up here it
is not since this is the neo version of
the SmartWatch that is an IR transmitter
you can control your television with it
just like on the gear 2 or any other
device that receives IR input it is not
a camera but it is mounted not on the
wristband but on the device itself
means that that in addition to the
moving of the speaker and microphone
combo to the body itself means you can
change these bands out which is grating
the customizability now you don't have
the big old board on the bottom here not
the word could they go module from the
initial gear and finally turning around
the back will see a little window on the
back there that looks into your soul or
your skin rather that is the heart rate
monitor it makes up a big part of
Samsung's pitch as a fitness device I'm
going to take a longer look at the gear
2 neo once we get one in the review lens
is just a quick look but very very light
much much lighter than the first gear at
least it feels that way
and a minimum of sacrifice to get that
to give that reduction in weight and
slight reduction in the size cycle
picture with pocket now with Adam Lane
doing the camera work and stay tuned for
more from the Fox
unpackaged unpacked wherever we are the
Samsung event in New York City I'm
getting tired
