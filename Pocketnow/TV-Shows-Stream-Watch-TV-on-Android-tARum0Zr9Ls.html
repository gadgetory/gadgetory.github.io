pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna talk about a really cool way to
watch TV shows on your Android phone
let's get to it
okay so what we're talking about here is
an app called TV shows stream it's about
a $6 app in the Android Marketplace and
it's pretty remarkable how complete the
selection of TV shows us in the
application so let's see we've got some
notes here and we're gonna search
manually now if you grew up in the 90s
like I did you undoubtedly watch Saved
by the Bell growing up so let's see if
there are any episodes of Saved by the
Bell
so saved Saved by the Bell search let's
see what we get okay there we go
Saved by the Bell the college years that
was kind of funny but let's do the the
retro style here and let's see we'll
scroll down and we've got a listing of
seasons this is remarkably comprehensive
I have no idea how they're able to do
this there they're obviously streaming
from a variety of sources around the
internet we got to say that if you're
using this app you should probably not
watch the episodes unless you own the
content if you bought it on DVD if you
bought it on VHS or whatnot so let's
just pop an episode and see how the
quality is and as you can see they are
streaming the the movies from torrents
so again we got to say you should own
this stuff before you watch it through
this application and let's let's take a
look at what it's like to watch through
this through this application so for
Wi-Fi right now I hit play and play
again switching to standard Bobby let's
go into landscape
there is a buzz in hell it's kind of
awesome so here we have an episode it's
a little bit shocking let's go back and
search for something else that might be
of better quality or these not as choppy
so we're gonna go to the previous page
here and let's search this time for The
Wonder Years another great show from the
80s and 90s which you probably watched
if you grew up in that era and let's see
what we get we'll click search the
Wonder Years here we go it's gonna bring
it in and we've got the seasons down
here let's go to season 4 and let's pick
the first episode okay pull that up and
let's see if this is better quality here
or at least a little bit more smooth in
terms of the playback so let's press
play so again the application is called
TV shows stream it's about six dollars
in the Android Marketplace and it does
what it advertises to do it works very
well so give it a try if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
