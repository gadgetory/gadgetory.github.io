geun-hye calm and this is another
episode of the windows phone 7 app
roundup in which review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get to it I translator is a free
application vil in the windows
marketplace that allows you to translate
practically any language into any other
language using the google translating
service so let me go from english and i
believe i have spanish already selected
down here so i'm just going to type in
something really quick let's just type
in hello how are you and then I'm going
to add a question mark and we'll just
hit and we'll hit the check mark here it
will begin translating it says hola como
estas so now I'm able to translate any
language using this service if you like
being and you also like Google then Bing
goal is a great app to have for anyone
that needs any navigation services so
what this app allows you to do is to
choose between either using google maps
or using the Bing Maps so what I have to
do lectra just go to layers and now I
can just go to you down here to settings
and I can select which mapsource I would
like to use so here I can select Bing or
it can select google maps and now we can
just go back to the map itself and it
will begin loading I can also go up here
and view various straight views go to
unhear get direction and search for
other things pictures lab is a paid for
application that cost one dollar 99
cents on that windows marketplace so
what this app allows you to do is to
practically change virtually everything
about your photos so let me just select
a book here not like to do is go down
here I can crop it if I like and I can
just select a crop there we go pretty
simple and just check mark that and now
i can either rotate it or add your
printer so now you can just pan to the
right to get some effects let's let on
to sharpen this oh let's try this one
edge detection that looks pretty cool so
i like that if i want to say but i can
and i can share with my friends vapor is
a free application developer windows
marketplace the lies should tie directly
into the sound cloud service so let's
say that i wanted to listen to this song
that i uploaded what to do is click on
here i'll begin downloading and i can
play it directly from here it ties into
my facebook account so it's pretty easy
to set up so we can just go back and
look so they don't want to search for
something else let me try to search for
oh I don't know the Beatles or something
so I have to do a search for Ace a group
or song or whoever ok so let's try this
one here and now I can begin listening
the song will automatically download and
begin playing this at Rapids and beaks
is a pretty simple xbox live game that
costs two hours and ninety-nine cents on
the windows marketplace actually the
games to collect various gems while
defeating birds in order to collect the
most gems and try to beat the levis so
here I have three little gnome guys I
guess you could call them so let me
catch some of these gems here before the
birds try to get them so now I want to
jump over here catch some birds and rich
this one first here and now that I just
want to throw them into the empty stump

birds before they defeat you and take
your gems so this has been another
