an announcement this is actually a full
new approach to smartphone design
reporting from the Lincoln Center in New
York City I am hime I believe out of
pocket now and this is the Samsung
Galaxy s8 plus brought to you by D brand
the Samsung Galaxy s8 plus is pretty
much the larger variant of two new
devices announced today as opposed to
what other competitors are doing it
doesn't really imply that you're
actually getting more features if you go
large but really just the fact that
you're getting more screen real estate
in addition to a larger battery this is
not just any screen though Samsung
Galaxy S 8 plus includes an insane 6.2
inch quad HD plus AMOLED display at 29
60 by 1440 we did the math that's 529
pixels per inch and we're talking more
than 80 percent screen to body ratio
sometimes pretty much eliminated the
bezels on the sides and has reduced the
top in the bottom significantly so even
if you're holding a display that's
larger than your standard phablet it's
pretty much size this one surrounding
the display is a gorgeous glass on glass
finish that's available in five color
options this is actually the orchid gray
and I'm shocked at how well it handles
fingerprints internally there are the
options for a snapdragon 835 processor
or the Exynos series 9 88 95 processor
both of 10 nanometer architecture
you also get four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of
storage Texas panda bowl and a 3,500
milliamp hour battery its ip68 water and
dust resistance and it includes the
usual tricks like wireless charging and
the new kick of being the first
smartphone with Bluetooth compatibility
some things got moved around with a
design though the navigation buttons are
gone now with the pressure-sensitive
home button that's software based the
fingerprint scanner is at the back in
the most Awkward of places but we know
the benefit of the iris scanner which is
also here in addition to facial
recognition now bear in mind it's got
the craziest list of disclaimers when it
comes to its accuracy so I would
probably just stick to the IR scanner
which
we proved was great with a galaxy note 7
you will notice a new button at the left
which is for Samsung's Bigsby service is
the company's new artificial
intelligence that's context-aware the
worst service sadly doesn't work here
yet because this is pre-production
software but the visual user interface
adjust things depending on your average
day or what's on your screen and more
slide to the left and you activate the
cards which are pretty much like what
you remember with Google now oh and
speaking of Google if fixed-fee is not
your thing the Google assistant is here
with a long press of the home button
software wise we have Android 7.0 nougat
under the company's experienced UX
sounds like has tried to make it more
cohesive with a design and we like that
it keeps the minimalistic trend that
began last year I was also very
impressed to see samsung's new Dex hub
which now allows you to turn your
smartphone into a computer of some sort
with an interface that's actually
designed to provide a full desktop
experience now if you were expecting
better cameras or dual cameras that's
not here that's where the plus doesn't
really take that step in my opinion the
camera is actually more a lateral move
to what Samsung had last year the
company claims to have improved image
processing but under the same hardware
as last year at least from what we see
in paper the selfie camera did get a
bump to 8 megapixels and now it does
have improvements to autofocus overall
the Samsung Galaxy s8 is a very
impressive phone and this plus variant
is - both phones are gorgeous and I'm
just really not happy with the fact this
plus variant doesn't include plus
features but then again it does offer
the option if you're just looking for a
larger Galaxy s8 we cannot wait to have
both of these phones in the pocket now
Labs for a review closer to its launch
on April 21st did you know that humans
are born with only two innate fears if
you are falling and the fear of loud
sounds every other fear is developed
over time we'd like to thank our sponsor
addy brand for reminding us that if
you're afraid of thick bezels you
definitely were not born with it this
bizarre ad and our Samsung unpacked
event coverage is brought to you by P
