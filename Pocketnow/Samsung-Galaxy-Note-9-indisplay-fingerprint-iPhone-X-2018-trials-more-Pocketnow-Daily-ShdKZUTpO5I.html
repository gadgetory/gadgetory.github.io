display fingerprint scanner with the
Galaxy Note 9 after all people has just
launched the phone with a crazy selfie
capability at least in paper and Apple
is planning a new approach to
manufacturing to avoid all the issues
with the iPhone 10 I'm Jaime Rivera and
can you smell Friday because I can this
is PocketNow daily the official news
today I begin with deals if you're in
the market for the essential phone this
is probably the best time to buy a
specify currently has it for 449 bucks
that's a crazy price tag that catches
it's only available for the black and
the white models still those are my
favorite ones anyway others have to do
with vivo the company continues making
headlines after the hole in display
fingerprint scanner thingy that it
showed us and now we have the vivo v9
being announced that's got the knotch
that we heard of but we hear that there
is a purpose for the notch as apparently
the selfie camera is of 24 megapixels
that is insane but then specifications
are pretty much what you would expect
from a premium mid-range err Snapdragon
626 from Qualcomm and Edition 6 gigs of
ram and everything else you can learn
more about another description now let's
move the spotlight over to Instagram
believe it or not it is my favorite
social network pretty much the only one
I use photo was on pocket now in case
you want to see our stories but I was
really upset with the whole change with
the algorithmic way of seeing stories
and you know new posts but the company
got so much feedback that it's changing
it now there's gonna be a new post
button and that will pretty much bring
everything in the order that we had
before which I love
so yeah it seems that the company is you
know we have been smelling the coffee
now it's what the spotlight over to
Apple as a I think the company is aware
that it has not had a good time with the
iPhone Zen but a lot of the issues that
hindered sales for the iPhone 10 had
mainly to do with manufacturing problems
the whole issue that happened with face
ID and so as it turns out apparently
Cupertino is going to have a trial and
manufacturing process happening over the
next couple of months in order to ensure
that it is capable
of delivering as many iPhones as
consumers want whenever these get
launched that's all fine and dandy let's
just see if that also means a cheaper
iPhones and finally the most interesting
news today I have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 as well
we had trusted sources claiming there
was no in display fingerprint scanner
now we've got other sources that are
unnamed that claim that it is going to
happen apparently this is an industry
source the claims that we will be
getting the technology on the Galaxy
Note 9 which is great I feel that the
note should be that Vanguard phone that
brings all the innovation but that
hasn't really been the case for the last
couple of years so yeah apparently
Samsung is working on this we should
expect the Galaxy Note 9 as soon as late
August so in today's question let us
know would you be okay with the Galaxy
Note 9 being just another s9 with a pen
or would you like new features like this
in display fingerprint scanner and
everything obviously I kind of know the
answer it's just I know a lot of people
that really don't want it to change from
the s9 design so leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion I
want that on display fingerprint scan
