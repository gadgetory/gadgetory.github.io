a bag that looks like this the box is
probably gonna look like this but that's
okay as long as the smartphone you
ordered looks like this I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is our
unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy s5 active
do you remember that stick from last
year like that that happened with the
Galaxy s4 active and now it's the five
active our shipping provider just loves
to mess up the boxes of rugged phones
but it's I mean they're fine it's not a
marketing thing it's just it's an
interesting coincidence and we thought
you would like to see that let's unbox
the phone so we've put the packaging
back together
somewhat to unbox it this is the phone
that was leaked by I believe it was
first leaked by TK tech news we reported
on that and then the phone was announced
quite by surprise at midnight several
nights thereafter this might be the camo
green version gonna have a little closer
look at the color in a second let's just
see what's in the box first of course
the exciting bit with this device is
that it offers less compromise compared
to last year's active model talk a
little bit more about that in a second
just some literature including Smart
Switch the easy way to transfer content
to your new samsung galaxy always nice
to have a solution for those switching
from another smartphone hey earbuds in
the box
wonderful no cost-cutting in evidence
there here's our battery which is not
pre-installed ok USB cable mini USB and
the wall charger and they're probably
the same 2 amp one there let's just
confirm that in yes indeed the same 2
amp output we've come to know and love
from the white Samsung charger so we're
gonna install the battery here and as I
went to remove this screen protector or
this back panel protector I realized
that yes indeed this can be none other
than the camo green this phone looks
like it is ready to do battle in a
jungle circa I don't know 1971 or
something that's an older camo pattern
very interesting whether you like it or
not
well depending on your own personal
preference at the very least it's
interesting we've taken the battery out
of its protective packaging we're just
going to flip it around to the back see
if we can find
if it is indeed a yes 10.7 8 watt hours
2800 milliamp hours the same rating as I
believe the same rating as on the the
standard Galaxy s5
my fingernail does not my fingernail is
protesting there but I think this phone
will be able to handle a little bit of
that old timer action if I don't break
it yeah there we go
panel pops off and the sticker on the
back did warn us that we wanted to make
sure that everything is secured so I
want to make sure all of these are
anchored eight or ten of them there as
there a center one that was the Achilles
heel of last year's Galaxy s4 active
there was a pressure point right in the
center that if you missed it would
render it not at all waterproof flipped
around to the front let's see if we can
take the screen protector off here
microphone is in position for the big
peel quiet please oh yeah it's been a
while since we've done that and that
feels good texting and driving it can
wait really good advice not joking
around don't text while you're driving
18t does not pay us to say that it's
just common sense folks that boot didn't
take quite as long as I thought sorry it
took me by surprise but as you can see
folks side by side these displays are
both AMOLED you can see they're
essentially sorry I wake up they're
essentially the same panel they may even
be the same component we kind of have to
look that up but in the hand this one a
little bit beefier flipping around back
it's a little bit more obvious there due
to these guards at top and bottom but
those cameras are the same another
difference from last year's active we
didn't take a downgrade in the camera
there's the heart rate monitor
nothing shaved from this in fact
something added to the s5 active where
as they're both water-resistant this one
also brings a military spec 810 F or G I
can't remember it'll be down in the
description for impact resistance and a
bunch of other stuff we will cover in
the full review
speaking of the full review that'll be
coming soon at pocket now be sure and
drop us a comment down below letting us
know what you want to see in that review
and while you're at it let us know what
color you'd choose if you decided to
invest in a Galaxy s5 active this camo
paint job I can't really get over it
I've never really seen anything like it
and you know that's not the worst thing
you can say at an unboxing I mean that's
that's pretty exciting it's not gonna be
for everyone I will tell you that and
you don't need me to tell you that but
quite something and just to complete
this Hardware tour along the side I'll
show you the mechanical volume rocker
they're not much different in terms of
what we're used to but could travel and
feedback we have this governor bowl blue
button we talked a little bit about on
the pocket net weekly podcast you press
and hold that sucker actually don't even
need to hold it you just press it you
get a bunch of terms and conditions
about the activity zone which is I guess
what it's okay alright so it's
pre-programmed to launch the Samsung
activity zone which is you know kind of
an outdoorsy thing I would be surprised
if you were not able to reprogram this
but this is gonna be an awful lot of fun
to play with we'll see if we can get
into some trouble
in the woods power standby on the
right-hand side once again nothing up
top sorry about the focus there nothing
up top but the headphone jack IR port
noise cancelling mic and down below the
covered USB port yes that cover is
required but pretty easy to pop off it's
gonna annoy the people who get annoyed
by covers but it's gonna also protect
the phone from immersion I will take the
latter every time Samsung Galaxy s5
active your unboxing and first look from
pocket now stay tuned for more in-depth
coverage coming very soon get a
refresher on the roots of the Galaxy s5
active check out last year's Galaxy S 4

more fun ones we recorded and follow us
