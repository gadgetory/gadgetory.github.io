their lumia windows phone line up Samson
goes right behind them with the release
of the Samsung Focus as in focus flash
and developers get all the fun with a
free nokia lumia 800 phone all to send
more coming up right now hello everyone
I'm hi metairie better with parking out
on calm and welcome to Windows Phone
view the show we wrap up all this week's
good and bad inside the world of
Microsoft's Windows Phone platform let's
rock this week off what's good that's
right I said it nokia world happened
this weekend in the opinion of many of
us nokia finally nailed a hit after
years of dropping the expectations of
many of us we must say it they finally
bring our hopes up with their new Nokia
Lumia lineup we get the Lumia 800 which
was previously codenamed scenery and
looks just like the stunning n9 the
device was designed to be a winner and
they finally bring the iconic nokia
design that they are capable of the
Milky Lumia 710 is just a school though
it's more of a mid-range designed device
though the specs are just as good you
may pick them up in Europe beginning
November and in the US as early as next
year new leaks also have a nokia 900
coming up soon though the device does
seem to be big though not really sure
what to expect with the device being
released sometime next year no specs
recently sadly only images with no fancy
events Samsung has just finally made
their focus s and focus flash official
the list of specs is really good on both
phones so make sure you hit our website
for full details interesting enough
though the samsung focus s will cost you
to dr. two hundred bucks after two year
contract but the focus flash will only
cost you fifty bucks after two year
contract then while the specs are really
close to each other so it seems that
Samsung really wants to drive some
windows phone love and sales but the
flash device coming up as an entry-level
device though the specs are really
interesting both devices aren't great
and are expected to be on sale as of
november six so take your wallets and
make your pick out of this week's
coverage make sure you catch adam lines
recent video on the orbital xbox live
game which looks really fun and i'm also
take some time to give us a full video
review
navigon windows phone system which looks
to be quite interesting and quite useful
also it also catches recent article on
what else you'd like to see on your
Start screen and even leave us a comment
down below to tell us what you'd like to
see on your own now let's talk about
Windows Phone codename Apollo when will
we get it rossum nokia X X were recently
caught talking about it and they're
talking about a release somewhere around
mid-2012 now the changes are interesting
because most likely we're not really
sure if it will be supported by current
hardware it seems that microsoft plans
to finally support NFC 720p HD
resolution displays dual-core processors
a better camera 1080p video recording
and a lot of the things that current
hardware can really support so if you're
holding it to get a windows phone right
now or you probably want to get the vice
role probably you will not see Apollo
coming to your device soon but the
increases and upgrades are really
compelling so well Microsoft get your
act together and probably just bring it
to us as soon as you can now on an
interesting move Microsoft and Nokia are
providing 25,000 nokia lumia 800 devices
to developers it's clear that Microsoft
is not finished driving more power to
their applications echo system and the
results are there so be honest with you
I always laugh every time I see
Microsoft x.x praising the results of
Windows Sloan by comparing it to Android
on the same time lines and well that's
not really a good way to compare it
seems that Microsoft really needs to get
their act together and doing even more
for developers and getting apps to their
market and well finally there are doing
something that's really good so I praise
them for what they're doing let's just
hope that the Lumia devices get
developers support some really cool
things coming up
that does it for what's good let's
continue on with what's bad and well
it's not really that bad I mean we've
already complained about it last week
and we're going to do it again LG has
just pushed their mango update to their
optimus 7 and well guess what you are
getting internet sharing on this device
now the question is why is it that LG
can do it with their Optimus 7 and
nobody else can do it with their devices
it's sad to see that well manufacturers
are not really open to do what Microsoft
wants to do with their devices so let's
just hope that Microsoft gets their act
together works around with developers
and with manufacturers and bringing
something to the table because hey I
mean it's Windows Phone and Microsoft
promised that we'd have an echo system
that was the same no matter what the
vice we picked I picked the dell venue
pro and i want to get some internet
sharing guys come on that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching i'm high memory better remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
