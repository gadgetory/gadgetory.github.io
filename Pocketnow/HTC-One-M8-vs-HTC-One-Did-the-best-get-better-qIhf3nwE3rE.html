progression and change for changes sake
HTC thinks so and it thinks the 2014
edition of its premium HTC One flagship
is it but does the new one live up to
the legacy of its award-winning forbear
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is HTC One versus
all-new HTC One it was touted as the
Android device for iPhone users last
year's HTC One redefined the concept of
a premium Android phone fusing
polycarbonate and metallic components
into a beveled precision milled block of
straight-up smartphones sexyness 70% of
its casing was made of aluminum and it
backed up the handsome face with razor
sharp wits a Snapdragon 600 processor
with 2 gigs of RAM a 4.7 inch SL cd3
display and speakers so good that HTC
audaciously called them boom sound and
got away with it because their
performance lived up to their bombastic
name with the next generation 1 HTC
builds on almost all of those most of
the plastic is gone the new casing 90%
aluminium with a brushed hairline finish
on our gunmetal grey unit here the
increased metal ratio and the units
larger size make it a few grams heavier
and it's a little more awkward and
one-handed use but the wider radius
corners and wraparound construction
gives it a smoother feel against the
palm the display is still SLCD three and
still 1080p but it's seen a boost to
five inches that results in a small hit
and pixel density but it's not
noticeable the boomsound grilles at top
and bottom are similar but behind them
sit new speakers with new amplifiers and
larger chamber size HTC claims they're
20% louder and that plus the richer bass
ear sound makes the m8 the new king of
smartphone audio
beneath all that the processor has been
boosted to a top-of-the-line Snapdragon
801 and while it's still backed up by
two gigs of ram a crucial functionality
gap has been filled in addition to the
16 or 32 gigs of on-board storage
there's now a micro SD card slot capable
of accommodating cards up to a hundred
and twenty eight gigs in size
last year's one brought us an entirely
new HTC Sense experience and while the
m8 doesn't need or try to be nearly as
revolutionary it does introduce some
changes with sense version 6 most
visible are the alterations to blinkfeed
which is now much more customizable and
much richer in terms of content there's
also more color throughout sense with
accents bolder and more prevalent than
on sense 5 some of that is welcome it
does brighten things up but we're not
necessarily sold on some of the hues HTC
has chosen fortunately there's the
option for a monochrome theme if you
want to recover some of that hip
minimalism of 2013 and no matter what
color you choose sense zips along under
a finger just as quickly it's probably
the most fluid Android skin we've ever
seen a notable annoyance of the m7 has
been eliminated by the new motion
sensing package of the m8 while the
standby key is still pretty far out of
reach on the top of the device it's less
annoying here because the phone can be
unlocked using a variety of on-screen
gestures some of which offer direct
shortcuts in to preset apps and the
polarizing capacitive keys of the m7
have been replaced by more conventional
on-screen buttons in the newer device
much of the Sense 6 feature set will
eventually come to the m7 and we've
covered the other software improvements
more extensively in our full review of
the new HTC one available right now and
linked in the description below go check
it out after you finish this comparison
not all improvements have been so
sweeping almost unbelievably HTC chose
to stick with the same resolution for
its primary camera this year 4
megapixels that's actually a lower
resolution than
mas front-facing camera and if you're a
speck head it gets worse
there's no longer optical image
stabilization HTC's official stance is
that OS is no longer compatible with its
new stereoscopic camera arrangement and
that the combination of new features in
the m8 makes OAS unnecessary
whether you agree will depend on what
kind of lighting condition you're
shooting in and how sharp your eye is in
brightly lit situations the output here
can be quite similar between the m7 and
m8 as with many smartphone view finders
exposure and focus are linked and they
swing pretty extremely with only minor
adjustments which is still annoying the
m8 looks to be a bit better at
processing the images with its HDR mode
usually avoiding the sometimes washed
out look of the m7 low-light photos from
each camera are impressive in terms of
how much detail they can pull from the
darkness but they're still noisy in the
m8 with areas of blow out where the
camera tries too hard or over exposes
the m8 has definitely improved on the
white balance in low-light situations
though and its new smart flash
definitely helps with grabbing focus in
pitch-black situations where the real
improvements come is in the software HTC
has completely rethought the camera
viewfinder on the MA with a
straightforward mode select screen than
a bunch of new features from longer Zoe
films to preset manual shooting modes to
a new array of fun effects to a totally
rethought gallery the software brings
enough to keep any recreational
photographer busy that said we did miss
the persistent camcorder trigger okay so
about that second eyeball that gives the
duo camera its name it makes the m8
substantially weirder looking than its
predecessor so is it worth it well
that's going to depend entirely on how
much you care about shooting with
boquete effect the second eye is a depth
sensor allowing for variable focus after
a shot is taken and it also reduces the
time necessary for the camera to get
focus HTC plans to open this hardware to
developers for future improvement so
maybe we'll see something a bit more
compelling come further down the line
for the moment it's a somewhat neat
trick for creating dramatic depth of
field then there's video well on the
plus side the new m8 delivers better
sound and richer colors than the m7 and
it has less trouble maintaining focus on
the minus side the software
stabilization doesn't provide quite as
smooth a ride as the old OS rig finally
the front-facing camera has seen a boost
from 2 megapixels to 5 while preserving
the 88 degree wide angle lens the added
resolution is nice and we see some white
balance correction here too with a
Snapdragon 801 going up against the
Snapdragon 600 it's no surprise that the
m8 beats the m7 on benchmarks that don't
matter more to you if you frequently
play graphically demanding games or
visit very elaborate websites but just
having that degree of power available is
nice for everyone and it helps
future-proof the device call quality
seems substantially improved on the m8
though to be fair that may be due to
some deficiency in our Google Play
edition m7 in any case the new phone's
noise cancellation is excellent and the
quick shortcut of just bringing the
phone to the ear to take a call
is very nice we didn't notice a
difference in signal strength using
diagnostic mode but it should be noted
that our HTC One m8 is a UK edition will
retest with a US model when we receive
one what about the removal of Beats
Audio to be honest we didn't notice HTC
has included us stand-in to fill its
place which you can toggle on and off in
the settings menu when you plug in
earphones to our ears the sound produced
by the new EQ is almost identical to
Beats those looking for that added bit
of oomph won't be missing much
we go into battery life in more detail
in our full review so for now we'll just
say that the combination of new
processor larger power pack and extreme
power saving mode in the m8 makes the
newer device the clear winner in the
endurance Department so in relation to
its forerunner the 2014 edition HTC One
is a substantial step up in some areas
and a more modest upgrade in others
aesthetically it lacks some of the
pizzazz of its trailblazing predecessor
but from where we're sitting it's still
probably the most attractive Android
smartphone on the market it may not be
enough to sway
em7 owners into upgrading but the HTC
One m8 does an admirable job of living
up to its storied brand name I know I
said it a few times in the video folks
but one final reminder this is not our
HTC One review our all-new HTC One
review is available right now on our
youtube channel page here on YouTube and
