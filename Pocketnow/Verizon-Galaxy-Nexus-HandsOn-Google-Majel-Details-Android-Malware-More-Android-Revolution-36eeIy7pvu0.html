and tell you all about it have you ever
heard of Google Majel and malware seems
to be the top news for Android this week
all this and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hime every letter
with talking out I've common welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's or this week off with what's hot
since the hottest news of the week have
to do with the verizon galaxy nexus
let's go through all week's coverage
first of all make sure you catch Adam
lanes recent video unboxing of the
verizon galaxy nexus which proves to be
a very compelling device aside from that
Jeff later talks us through the LG nitro
HD from AT&amp;amp;T which seems to be quite
compelling not in design wise but it
does have really good specs like for
example in HD display an LTE 480 the
site from that Joe Levi later walks us
through how to get the APK file to get
google wallet on your Verizon Galaxy
Nexus which you most likely already
purchased and if you're not really a fan
of circles in the folders designed for
ice cream sandwich make sure you catch
the link in the description where
details on how to get it changed into a
box or a folder or whatever you want so
also takes the time to show us the nova
launcher for android and hey if you're
wondering of those other launchers like
for example atw and launcherpro work on
Ice Cream Sandwich make sure you watch
the video from Joe Levi which brings us
all the details on what works and what
doesn't software updates have been the
hottest news this weekend well the
hottest one of them all is the fact that
Google has just released their update
for ice cream sandwich for the nexus s
if they're currently carrying a nexus s
the difference between it and the Galaxy
Nexus is a bit compelling but hey you
could probably save yourself a couple of
bucks just update it's currently free so
test it out and see what it looked like
Facebook has just updated their Timeline
feature to work on their website and
interesting enough Android is going to
be the first operating system to be able
to rock it so all you have to do is
update for timelines to work as your new
wall in facebook and you'll see the new
updates on the facebook application as
long as you update it if you're also
worried about getting adobe flash and
Ice Cream Sandwich don't be anymore
because adobe has just released the
update for flash player to work on Ice
Cream Sandwich
out of the rumors for the week Sony and
wait notice that I didn't mention sony
ericsson i mentioned sony has just
launched images of an xperia LT 22
device showing while the typical art
design but sadly no Erik sent from here
on not sure what to expect there and
while Sony's walkman Z also came through
the FCC getting that Android love on a
music player it's not going to become a
phone kind of interesting for those of
you that are interested and most Sony
now spells even more images of the
Xperia Mazzoni which plans to be the ark
HD though sadly it seems to be like a
catch up to kind devices out there like
for example the Galaxy Nexus if you had
any doubts about all the buzz about this
LG spectrum we also had images of the
device for retail and while the verizon
galaxy nexus also popped up on images
and even a video showing an extended
battery and a chubby air battery cover
wonder what that will be like and well
what is this about Google Majel what's
this project then well it seems that
google is planning to strike back at
Apple Siri with a new service which are
you more natural voice control not
saying you don't have voice control on
Android devices just series a bit more
natural so it seems that google is
working on this project with Google X to
launch a more natural software and if
you wonder what Majel is look at Star
Trek and while it seems that the
project's quite compelling though sadly
was plan to be out by these this holiday
season so seems that Google needs to be
doing a little catch up on timing and
let's see what happens in the end on the
dark side for the week have a look at
Joe Levi's recent article on the top
modification she can give the Galaxy
Nexus because it's so easy to root it
and unlock it later make sure you catch
this article from Joe which raised you
different details and things you can do
with the Ice Cream Sandwich launcher
which looks quite compelling after your
routing treatment and while the motorola
droid razr also came up on video with
ice cream sandwich running on it though
sadly it's not official so not sure when
that's coming but it has been announced
so let's hope it's soon and before we go
through what's not hot well let's talk
about the smartphone releases for the
week we only got one and that was the LG
product phone that finally came out it's
not going to be called the k2 but sadly
it's going to be called the prada phone
by LG
three-point oh kind of a weird name the
specs are quite compelling if you
compare it to anything that's out there
from last year savvy it's going to bring
up wvga resolution display in this
decade sad news for the device because
so far if it wasn't for the display the
device would be really good that doesn't
for what's hot let's continue on with
what's not in well recent studies show
that malware on Android isn't getting
any better so far studies even show the
fact that malware applications have
doubled in the past six months now and
interesting note here is that it seems
that all these malware attempts are not
coming from the android market they're
either coming from other applications
sources like for example some of their
app stores out there and even the fact
that you siloed applications after you
either do it legally or root it now
interesting enough is the fact that
Google seems to be crossing their arms
there and just saying well it's not our
fault when Google doesn't really have a
clear picture of how much this is
actually hindering the platform I think
that Google should actually consider the
fact that no matter where malware comes
from it should be treated by Google
itself and probably deal with it somehow
because any other way people are going
to stop consuming Android smartphones
just because they aren't safe imagine an
enterprise without Android smartphones
in the future seems kind of grim to me
that's it for today show thank you very
much for watching I'm high Meadow iveta
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
