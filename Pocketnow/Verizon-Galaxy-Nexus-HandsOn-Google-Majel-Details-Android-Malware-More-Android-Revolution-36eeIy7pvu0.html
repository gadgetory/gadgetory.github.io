and tell you all about it have you ever
heard of Google in the gel and malware
seems to be the top news for Android
this week all this and more coming up
right now
hello everyone I'm high memory that I
was talking out I've common welcome to
Android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's start this week off with what's
hot
since the hottest news of the week you
have to do with the Verizon Galaxy Nexus
let's go through all week's coverage
first of all make sure you catch Adam
lanes recent video unboxing of the
Verizon Galaxy Nexus which proves to be
a very compelling device aside from that
Jeff later talks us through the LG Nitro
HD from AT&amp;amp;T which seems to be quite
compelling not in design wise but it
does have really good specs like for
example in a HD display and LTE for AT&amp;amp;T
aside from that Jolie by later walks us
through how to get the apk file to get
Google Wallet on your verizon Galaxy
Nexus which you most likely already
purchased and if you're not really a fan
of circles in the folders designed for
Ice Cream Sandwich make sure you catch
the link in the description or details
on how to get it changed into a box or a
folder or whatever you want
so also take some time to show us the
Nova Launcher for Android and hey if
you're wondering of those other
launchers like for example a TW &amp;amp;
launcher pro worker on Ice Cream
Sandwich make sure you watch the video
from Joe Levi which brings us all the
details on what works and what doesn't
software updates have been the hottest
news this week and well the hottest one
of them all is the fact that Google has
just released their update for Ice Cream
Sandwich for the Nexus S if you're
currently carrying a Nexus S the
difference between it and the Galaxy
Nexus is a bit compelling but hey you
could probably save yourself a couple of
bucks just update it's currently free so
test it out and see what it's looked
like Facebook has just updated their
Timeline feature to work on their
website and interesting enough Android
is gonna be the first operating system
to be able to rock it so all you have to
do is update four timelines to work as
your new wall in facebook and you'll see
the new updates on the Facebook
application as long as you update it if
you're also worried about getting Adobe
Flash and Ice Cream Sandwich don't be
anymore because Adobe has just released
the update for Flash Player to work on
Ice Cream Sandwich out of the rumors for
the week Sony and wait notice that I
didn't mention Sony Ericsson I mentioned
Sony has just launched images of an
Xperia L T 22 device showing while the
typical art design but sadly no Eric
sent from here on
sure what to expect there and while
Sony's Walkman Z also came through the
FCC getting that Android love on a music
player it's not going to become a phone
kind of interesting for those of you
that are interested and when Sony now
spells even more images of the Xperia
Mazzoni which plans to be the Ark HD
though sadly it seems to be like a
catch-up to kind of Isis out there like
for example the Galaxy Nexus if you had
any doubts about all the buzz about this
LG spectrum we also had images of the
device for retail and while the Verizon
Galaxy Nexus also popped up on images
and even a video showing an extended
battery and a chubbier battery cover
wonder what that'll be like and well
what is this about Google Majel what's
this project then well it seems that
Google is planning to strike back at
Apple Siri with a new service which will
bring you more natural voice control not
saying you don't have voice control on
Android devices just series a bit more
natural so it seems that Google is
working on this project with Google X to
launch a more natural software and if
you wonder what the gel is look at Star
Trek and while it seems that the
project's quite compelling though sadly
was planned to be out by these this
holiday season so seems that Google
needs to be doing a little catch-up on
timing and let's see what happens in the
end on the dark side for the week have a
look at Joe Levi's recent article all
the top modifications she can give the
Galaxy Nexus because it's so easy to
root it and unlock it later make sure
you catch this article from Joe which
brings you different details and things
you could do with the Ice Cream Sandwich
launcher which looks quite compelling
after you're rooting treatment and while
the Motorola Droid Razr also came up on
video with Ice Cream Sandwich running on
it though sadly it's not official so not
sure when that's coming but it has been
announced so let's hope it's soon and
before we go through what's not hot well
let's talk about the smartphone releases
for the week we only got one and that
was the LG product phone that finally
came out it's not gonna be called the k2
but sadly it's gonna be called the Prada
phone by LG 3.0 kind of a weird name the
specs are quite compelling if you
compare it to anything that's out there
from last year Savi it's going to bring
up WVGA resolution display in this
decade sad news for the device because
so far if it wasn't for the
display the device would be really good
that doesn't for what's hot let's
continue on with what's not in well
recent studies show that now on Android
isn't getting any better so far studies
even show the fact that malware
applications have doubled in the past
six months now an interesting note here
is that it seems that all these malware
attempts are not coming from the Android
Market they're either coming from other
applications sources like for example
some other app stores out there and even
the fact that you siloed applications
after you either do it legally or route
it now interesting enough is the fact
that Google seems to be crossing their
arms there and just saying well it's not
our fault when Google doesn't really
have a clear picture of how much this is
actually hindering the platform I think
that Google should actually consider the
fact that no matter where malware comes
from it shouldn't be treated by Google
itself and probably deal with it somehow
because any other way people are gonna
stop consuming Android smartphones just
because they aren't safe imagine an
enterprise without Android smartphones
in the future seems kind of grim to me
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm hi metal you
better remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
