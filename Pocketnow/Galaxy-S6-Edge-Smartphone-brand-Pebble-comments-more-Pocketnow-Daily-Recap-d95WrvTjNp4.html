I would love to see more Lumia device
reviews from pocketnow and true we would
love to see more Lumia devices period
take the day off congratulations and yes
your wish is my command that's right
it's that time of the week and I am hi
Mary banner this is pocket now and this
is the parking out daily recap for last
week so on Monday asked you which is
your favorite smartphone brand the news
were that Samsung's market share was
down but not because the market was down
it was just am saying we have 2077
comments guys thanks a lot that's crazy
number at which Carlotta says i'll pick
samsung when reason their displays
samsung Super AMOLED display is by far
the best display I have ever seen on any
device and you know we argue with this
constantly in pocket now but I'm the
type of guy that would actually agree
with you i love Super AMOLED displays
others are like oh they're over
saturator stuff I don't care i love for
colors to pop and Samsung does a good
job at that you Sigmund ear says HTC
built pauling and smoother you I Apple
simplified UI and great build quality
and some useful features for those who
prefer iOS Motorola for people who
prefer faster updates an ear stock
Android and sperience thank you for that
summary that pretty much sums up the way
most of us at pocket now see the market
right now and flame says to be honest my
favorite smartphone company right now is
LG they seem to know what the consumer
wants and they have the design and
technological expertise to provide
functional products to be demand that's
all I need from a smart phone company
right now and you know LG has done an
amazing comeback after years of making
terrible phones I feel that they still
have a little more to go probably in
software but this LG g3 is great so far
and I love the fact that the company
doesn't worry about daring the market
they try new things like the g flex and
stuff like that and that's the way it
should be on tuesday asked you how is
the pebble smartwatch in your top of
mind right now as yes the SmartWatch has
been in the market for two years in its
original a year in the pebble steel and
at the moment they've been trying new
things like for example adopting Android
wear notifications for the future we
have 551 comments out of which denna
says even a pebble supports android wear
notifications how will they solve number
one being black and white some graphics
might be hard to distinguish it number
two limited interactions only previous
and next notifications and dismiss it up
yes they do have some challenges when it
comes to supporting Android wear but
that doesn't mean that pebble does a
worse job when it comes to notifications
period I feel that pebble actually does
it better than Android wear the fact
that these notifications are persistent
but then again you have your opinion and
hunter says the pebble smartwatch would
be more valuable to me if it had a ink
display or improve the design to have a
circular face like the 360 a pebble
circle SmartWatch I'd buy that and they
do have any ink display but you know
honestly a circular pebble with that you
I I would love it too that's a great
idea and randy says I think the pebble
is the only real smart watch everyone
else rushed the product that wasn't
ready and therefore was mediocre couple
is less fancy but it's better where it
really matters you can make a pebble
look really fancy there are some really
good watch bands in the market that you
can use and I like mine on my original
pebble up to the point that I never
really bought the pebble steel but I do
understand your point and I do feel that
the pebble is the best SmartWatch right
now forget about the display color
doesn't really matter if your battery
life sucks at color doesn't really
matter if the user interface doesn't
really allow you to go back to the
notifications that you had I feel that
there is more to do with Android wear in
my opinion and then Wednesday I was off
it was my birthday so let's skip the
Thursday I asked you if you feel that
bind the galaxy s6 edge would be worth
it assuming that there was only a galaxy
s6 edge as the rumors are that this
there are the stronger rumors right now
I know that sounded weird but anyways we
have 182 comments out of which one of
them says I would rather buy a G flex
second-generation than the 6th edge a
interesting point the self-healing
technology on the LG G flex and the fact
that you could sit on it and not break
it makes that actually useful whereas on
the Galaxy Note edge these features are
cool some people like them like Michael
Fisher some people find them gimmicky
like me but again your mileage may vary
Roshan says I don't think it's a gimmick
at all and lots of other reviewers
shared the same view including your own
Fisher you're just the Samsung hater why
do we all have to be either Apple
fanboys or shams and haters or whatever
because we have an opinion you have your
opinion that doesn't make you a samsung
lover and in that same vein yeah
everybody has a right to an opinion and
then Shane says I like to be able to
hold my devices comfortably so naturally
i find the edge design laughable and
would never buy it even if it were the
last smartphone on earth I'm sure you'd
buy it if it were the last smartphone on
earth dude but you have a good point the
edge does make your use uncomfortable
especially if you're either left hand or
right hand it depends on your usage you
can't really pick which side of the edge
is slanted and that really makes
certificate then finally on Friday I
asked you what would be the no-brainer
price tag that you want for a smartphone
as a the news were that Sampson was
already shipping some review units of
the galaxy s6 and they were declaring
$300 as a price tag that obviously we
know that's for shipping purposes we
have pardoned 14 comments out of which
shadman says I don't care what the price
tag Samsung is going to sell the galaxy
s6 you could give me a galaxy device for
free and I still wouldn't take it yes
they are that bad except perhaps the
note lineup they're not that bad it
depends on taste again your point is
what you feel other people like galaxy
phones I actually do like the Galaxy
Note lineup but again it depends on what
people feel and that's your opinion and
veteran says maybe throw in a dollars
for a flagship makes me want to deal
with TouchWiz oh good point right there
if a smartphone is so affordable people
won't really care what user interfaces
there because they feel they won't have
to argue with the company I mean hey for
that price tag they're not really going
to care and that's really a good point
and the biggest problem with TouchWiz
they charge you so much money probably
for R&amp;amp;D or whatever they want and
problem is that people feel ripped off
in some cases because the user
experience is not better compared to
anything that other people use and
things that matter and finally John Mays
says three hundred fifty dollars for the
galaxy s6 I don't really understand
what's next but you also say that it's
truly sounds desperate to me you have a
very interesting point user per section
is so odd in the market some people find
that for example some Nexus products in
the past were so of
portable that they thought the products
were cheap and as Joe leave I would tell
us there's a very big difference between
cheap and affordable in this case yes
whenever a smartphone is Christ so
aggressively peopled out and people
aspire more expensive products because
they think they're better so yeah
playing with the price tag is a
difficult thing and hence the reason why
some flagship smartphones are priced as
swell are the same as other flagships
even if the company has more margin to
give you a better price tag again just
to avoid the perception issues but great
comment that's a far pocket now daily
recap thank you very much for watching a
couple of tips have you won your
comments to be featured number one keep
them short number to stick to the point
