design of the iPhone 6 we get details on
what to expect from Samsung's next
wearable and Apple explains why I
message didn't jump on Android I'm Jaime
Rivera and the benefits of Friday can
definitely be discussed not here but in
the bar in the corner this is PocketNow
daily you know sometimes it seems it the
only problem with Fridays is that there
aren't any real deals to go crazy over
and such as the case with today so let's
begin talking about Bluetooth 5 and it's
not a boring topic because number one it
doubles the speed number four it
quadruples the range and then the whole
race for the Internet of Things and the
fact that Bluetooth is more efficient
than Wi-Fi and power consumption and
just about everything else we cannot
wait to see the first product comes from
this how do you pronounce that let echo
Li echo the company is making a big deal
about its US launch as we hear that let
echo us is going to become official in
the United States as of October and the
reason why you should care is because
this company is a big deal in China one
two there are some substantial rumors
that claim this company is going to
launch the first smartphone with a gigs
of RAM it wouldn't be the first time
that the company is the first at
something the problem is it was the
first that everything in China not here
so I cannot wait to see what their first
product in the United States is gonna be
and speaking of interesting rumors we
also hear that Samsung's unpacked event
that's rumored for August 2nd is not
only going to be about the Galaxy Note 7
apparently there is a SmartWatch in the
works and it seems that will run tyson's
codename is soulless and we hear that it
might be the successor to the gear s2
which is long overdue I'll say that the
gear s2 is a bad watch but it wasn't a
great one either too bad that it doesn't
run Android wear as well so have any of
you heard of the Shenzhen Bailey 100 C
smartphone I know you haven't and either
have us but the thing is that the
Beijing intellectual property Bureau
just filed for Apple to stop selling the
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus in China
because it infringes with the patents of
the design that came from that gen gen
smartphone apparently earlier this is
gonna be a very interesting drama mainly
because Apple is the company that
usually files the patent lawsuits we
cannot wait to see how the damn
and finally the very interesting news
today have to do with a recent interview
that Walt Mossberg had with some
executive from Apple that he doesn't
name and according to him the reason why
I message did not make the jump to
Android is because of very logical
reasons number one Apple claims to have
1 billion users and iMessage already
that are active so there's no need to
look for more users elsewhere there's
enough to provide whatever case studies
and whatever they need and the second
reason is because obviously they want
this to be apples differentiating factor
which is it makes sense this is the way
Apple has always done things with the
exception of iTunes but it leads me to
the question of the day do you think
that it's fine that Apple just keeps its
iMessage or would you want to see
iMessage come to Android in my case I
would like iMessage to do so mainly
because the only reason why I don't use
it is because it's not cross-platform
but leave us a comment down below we
would love to know your opinion friends
