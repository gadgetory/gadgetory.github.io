Kakinada calm and this is the hardware
review of the HTC Rezound for Verizon
with the Beats Audio headset so let's
get to it
the HTC Rezound is a pretty fast device
it's powered by a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon processor along
with 1 gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes
of internal ROM so let's start with some
of the physical features of the HTC
Rezound so on the top we have our
earphone here we also have a proximity
sensor a light sensor we have our
Verizon logo our 2 megapixel
front-facing camera the screen is a 4.3
inch 720p HD display and this is a Super
LCD behind a glass capacitive
multi-touch digitizer on the bottom we
have these four capacitive buttons a
search of back a menu and a home we
don't really see the search button too
often I personally have never really
used it very much we also have another
HTC emblem on the bottom on this side of
the device we have a secondary
microphone for noise cancellation up
here we also have our micro USB 2.0 port
and it looks as though it's a combo port
that uses the HTC proprietary Jack so
you can probably use this for HDMI out
on the bottom we have a primary
microphone here and a little tab to
remove the back battery cover
on this side of the device we have the
volume rocker so up and down that's
about it and on the top we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack along with our
power standby button on the back of the
HTC Rezound we have this textured
battery cover
we also have our speakerphone here so
you can view these speaker and various
Beats Audio logos and our 4G LTE this
device does have LTE in the 700
megahertz band and it also has CDMA and
800 and 1900 up here we have a 8
megapixel HD recordable camera with a
dual LED flash so what the battery cover
removed we have this clear red plastic
which allows you to see the internal
workings of the HTC Rezound the battery
is a sixteen hundred and twenty milliamp
hour lithium-ion and we'll have to look
and see exactly how long this battery is
going to last here we
the 4G LTE SIM card that you would put
into the HTC Rezound and it does come
with a 16 gigabyte micro SD card which
is expandable up to 32 gigabytes the
dimensions of the Rezound are 130
millimeters in height 66 millimeters in
width and 13.7 millimeters in debt so if
we compare that to an iPhone 4 iPhone 4s
it's much thicker than the iPhone 4 and
iPhone 4s of course you do have the LTE
modem inside of this device which gives
us that thicker profile which we've come
accustomed to with the 4G phones from
Verizon so wait for this to finish
powering up and then we'll get to some
of the benchmark tests so 1/4 standard
we were able to achieve a score of 2404
so that looks as though it's about twice
as fast as the Nexus One running Android
2.2
so now we'll run smart bench 2011 so on
smart bench 2011 we were able to get
3245 on the productivity index and 2283
on the games index so now we'll run link
pad pro so earning a seal of thread
we're able to get fifty three point four
ninety-nine in flops in 1.5 seven
seconds let's run multi thread so that's
a pretty interesting result that we're
getting for seven point six eight six in
flops in three point five four seconds
running multi thread so this should be a
lot faster on other androids that use a
dual-core processor we usually get much
faster speeds running a multi thread so
the radio is keeping the HTC Rezound
connected our Wi-Fi a B G and N and one
surprising feature about the resound is
it's able to access the five gigahertz
bands which most wireless devices are
only able to access the 2.4 and bands
for the Wi-Fi connection we also have
bluetooth 3.0 assisted GPS and some
other radios such as an FM with RDS so
if we check out the eye beats headphones
that come bundled with the HTC Rezound
these are some pretty hefty headphones I
to feel them they're pretty heavy and
they are in ear headphones and they work
very well opposed to some other ones
that come bundled with other smart
phones they are created by monster one
of the leading authorities in the high
speed HDMI cables and also other
audio/video accessory
for your home's theater system and there
are very good headphones on the cord
here on the wire we do have some
controls we have a call button and a
play and pause button we also have a
forward and reverse and they work very
well on the HTC Rezound so this has been
the hardware review of the HTC Rezound
running on Verizon's 4G LTE network so
this device is running Android 2.3
Gingerbread and we hope to see an Ice
Cream Sandwich update in the near future
the i' beats headphones work very well
and if you'd like to pick up one of
these for yourself you can visit verizon
comm and the purchase price is $299 with
a subsidized two year contract if you
like our videos make sure you give us a
thumbs up and also leave some comments
down below
stay tuned for these software review
coming up next and also the final review
in the near future
