strong metal frame Samsung paganism
seemed to be compatible with all US
carriers and believe it or not fossil is
also getting into the SmartWatch game
I'm Hyneman iveta battling with a
monster cold but here to deliver the
news this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with fossil a
non smart watch manufacturer that's been
building watches for the longest time
the company has just announced the few
watches including a SmartWatch running
Android wear just like in the case of
the tech foyer it uses an intel atom
chip which is interesting though we
don't know exactly neither the name of
this watch or when it will be launched
or the reason why it also uses the same
moto 360 flat tire even with its bezels
but we should learn more later this year
now same thing has gained a lot of thing
with its Sam sink paid offerings given
the fact that its whole lupe acquisition
allows the service to use pretty much
almost every credit card POS system and
doesn't require a contact NFC chip
payment system which is great the
problem is that if you're in the United
States it doesn't seem to be compatible
with every US carrier as the largest one
being Verizon is apparently not on the
list Samsung has already apologized
about this and apparently they will
report more about this later sad news
and if you're in the market to get
yourself Android auto for your current
vehicle or the one you're buying you
better stay away from the Moto G at
least for now the new Moto G is a giving
users issues with Android auto
apparently it is not compatible with the
head system which is crazy given the
fact that it's a one of the few devices
that's currently updated to the latest
and greatest version of Android
according to google they are working
with Motorola to fix this problem and we
should learn more with a software update
later now let's move the spotlight over
to hcc we know the company is desperate
for major changes particularly with the
recent round of layoffs of the company
has just conducted because of the whole
problems with their profitability and
the fact that the one m9 was not as hot
as they expected now we hear that the
company is working on it
feature flagship that will not be depth
the one in 10 apparently HTC is doing
away with that lineup but this one's
going to be called the HTC 02 02 being
one version 2 or the continuation to
whatever purpose they had right now
apparently this device we have some
monster specifications including a
Snapdragon 820 processor but if you want
it you will have to wait until q1 2016
which is what we were expecting for this
phone to launch and finally for the very
hot news of the day if you're wondering
if the iphone success will Bend Lou from
unbox therapy asked himself the same
question he got himself a leaked chassis
of the iphone success and compared it to
the iphone 6 with a certified tester and
then the results of the iphone 6 he was
able to bend it with 30 pounds of force
which is well something he had already
proven with his own hands but in the
case of the iphone 6s it took 80 pounds
of force almost triple the amount of the
original iphone 6 so yeah 7000 grade
aluminum and it's sink component does
make it a lot stronger we've proven that
with the Apple watch but hey it leads me
to the question of the day with a more
durable iphone 6 or iPhone 6s plus make
you want to buy this product because in
my case hey of course why not but leave
