Note 9 and the impact event can't come
any sooner
iPads seem to have faced ID software
even though we don't know about the
hardware and if you want to get that
silk white one plus six you're gonna
have to wait for it I'm hi Mary vera and
wednesdays they're not Fridays
necessarily but they're getting close
and I can't wait for tomorrow's event by
the way this is PocketNow daily if I
show this today begin with deals if you
are in the market for the samsung galaxy
s 9 this is the best time to buy as
there are buy-one-get-one-free deals now
available you learn more details in the
description if you're lucky you might
even get a gear 360 camera even though
mine's in the drawer because I've never
really used it but you probably would
it's free you can learn more again in
the description other official news have
to do with the silk white one plus six
as well I already have my unit it is
gorgeous and it is sold out it is so
sold out that well it was a limited
edition we expected that but it happened
in just a few minutes and if you want to
get your hands on that unit you're gonna
have to wait for restocking until June
12 is it worth it
yeah it is now let's talk about Samsung
and the company's whole plan with what
pertains to virtual reality I mean the
gear VR is something nice to have but
again one of those things that I rarely
use apparently the company is going to
rebrand the hardware now it's going to
be called galaxy VR we're not exactly
sure if this has to do with that whole
the yard display that they came up with
and the possibility of a better gear VR
sorry galaxy VR but whatever the case
might be we're not sure if it's gonna be
announced with the galaxy note 9 or the
Galaxy S ten I would say galaxy s 10
given how close we are to the possible
mode I am now let's move the spotlight
over to Apple as for those of you that
are wondering when we're getting faced
ID on the iPad it's getting closer than
ever mainly because if you go into the
beta of iOS 12 on iPads there are
options for face ID on that hardware so
there is no more official leak than that
one Apple is working on it maybe that's
the reason why we didn't get in the
iPads or any other hardware WWDC stay
tuned and finally the hot news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
see note 9 we're expecting the unpacked
event to happen somewhere around August
9th but we have some CAD renders on
video what's most important is that the
cameras apparently are going to continue
to be horizontal it seems that the
fingerprint scanner is going to be at
the bottom Thank You Samsung and
apparently even though we're getting a
38 50 milliamp hour battery which is a
slight bump to the current 3501 that we
have weight 3300 if I remember correctly
well it turns out that this phone is
actually going to be slimmer so let us
know in the comments what you think
about the galaxy note 9
do you like design which looks a little
box here pretty much like the node 8 in
my case I like it a lot I like the
Galaxy Note lineup you know this but
