pocketnow.com and today we're doing the
unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
from verizon with 4g the LTE service so
sit back relax and enjoy the show now
the samsung galaxy tab 10.1 is a pretty
well-known device in the world already
and this is just the verizon iteration
with 4g service built into the device
let's go ahead and open up the box and
take a look what's inside in here we
have the 4g LTE sim card which will put
it in a minute the actual device itself
with the little overlay instructions on
how to put that card in then under here
we have the user manuals the Samsung
proprietary cable it's got a dock
connector looks like I got 10 pin
connector almost like the Apple is so
the power charging sync cable is not a
standard USB and then you've got the
wall wart and the adapter for the wall
work for us plugs so that's all there is
in the box let's go ahead and strip the
plastic off get that sim card in and
will boot it up for the first time had
to make a quick backdrop change because
couldn't actually see the device against
the black background except for this the
silver coated rim around the outside
here we've got the main device we've got
a 2-megapixel front-facing camera right
here up at the top on this top end is
the headphone jack and the sim card slot
which I've already placed in there on
this side over here we've got the one of
these speaker holes on the bottom we
have the microphone hole
the dock connector / charging / sinking
ports here moving around to this side we
have the other speaker whole power
button volume rocker and then moving
into the back we have the 3 megapixel
camera with flash and then the back of
the device is covered in a gunmetal gray
sort of brushed look it's a little
difficult to see here so I can get a
little more light on it and give you a
little more as you can see it there here
across this effect the brushed gunmetal
feel and look
slip the dice over and power it up
now it is powered by a dual-core Tegra
one gigahertz processor it's got a 7000
milliamp hour battery and it is supposed
to be able to do 720p recording it's got
4g LTE with 3g evdo rev a radio as well
I can do Wi-Fi with all the standard
specs and Bluetooth is 2.1 pretty
typical there the screen itself is 10.1
inches it's a 1280 x 800 wxga screen
that's a TFT display see here we are
please waiting while your tablet is
being prepared zoom in here a little bit
can see this the soft buttons appearing
down here in this corner the clock over
here just taking a good amount of time
to actually activate right now we'll
come back in just a second after it's
activated and we'll talk about look at
the software a little bit so after a
reboot with the sim card finally
activated itself and we ended up here at
the welcome screen and it'll allow us to
sign in with all the settings and we can
see the soft keyboard here which we'll
come back to in the the more in-depth
review later on in hand the device feels
a little the back feels a little plastic
even though it's got kind of that
brushed gunmetal feel it doesn't feel
bad in the hands in fact it doesn't feel
like it's going to slide out of your
hands at all because of that brushed
texture on the back the screen itself
and the there's a little bit of or at
least not right this moment but there is
a some haptic feedback that happens with
the keyboard when I was trying to
activate it the previous setting and I
was inside of the settings there was a
map haptic feedback and so far the
screen seems to be very responsive
colors Y and viewing angles are pretty
good thus far but we'll do a little more
in-depth coverage on that later so now
we're looking at the main home screen
I've added a couple of apps here to the
the desktop already and we can swipe
back and forth between the different
pages can drop in apps like expect up
here as your apps button and brings up
all the apps that are on the system and
the my apps the ones that are installed
tap the clock to get access to settings
tap the + to add widgets and then down
here is your back button your home
button and this is kind of a quick my
app switcher we're going to more that
more depth later on and then when you're
in an app that can actually handle
looking at other menu items then another
button will appear down here below for
actual menu button if you have any
questions leave them below and we'll try
to cover them in the next review thanks
