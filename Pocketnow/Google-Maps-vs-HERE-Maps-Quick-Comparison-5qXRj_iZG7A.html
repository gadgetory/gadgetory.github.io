I'm Jules along with pocket now strap
yourselves in it's Google Maps versus
here Maps Google's mapping and listings
have historically been stronger in North
America well here has had much more of a
grip in Europe and the same remains true
in 2015
both here and Google Maps are on iOS and
Android which we're using to test both
apps on today here's the only strong
Maps client on Windows Phone by the way
around Metro Boston Google Maps
definitely has more covered than here
does whoa whoa whoa hold on hold on
let's actually take a look at here and
see where it needs to improve after all
you the viewer demanded this sent we
wouldn't want to let you down let's take
a look at design Google Maps offers a
less cluttered sparsely-populated but
more meaningful view than here does at
least in America it prioritizes bad
roads and points of interest well here
is still getting used to things it
labels roads some of them at least by
their long names and gives more weight
to parks neighborhoods and transit areas
text alignment search results and Road
tracing are a little more janky on here
as well let's focus on transits for the
moment in see where Google has advantage
again it has a layout that makes sense
schedules are grouped by the lines of
transit rather than by pure chronology
what's more worrying for here is that my
station it gave next departures only in
the southbound direction
in fact the routes get quite inaccurate
with a quick survey of other stops in
the downtown area misappropriated subway
lines or bus lines two stations are
pretty rapid it doesn't get much better
at points of interest there are fewer
and less accurate operating hours on
here than on Google Maps there's also
not much more information beyond reviews
from TripAdvisor to give you I wanted to
believe that at least it could give me
good direction so I tried giving a
couple test runs for both devices and
here we finally see a bright spot for
here one of the neat things about
getting direct
Sahn here is that you can exclude
certain modes of transportation in fact
you could get neil piggy with the
driving parameters unfortunately here
maps doesn't include biking directions
unlike Google which is actually quite
useful for me the first destination was
from my home area to Cambridge City Hall
now I live about a five-minute walk from
the subway station so I was kind of
surprised when here told me to wait for
a bus to take me to the station you see
it comes down to how map clients
estimate walking pace here estimates
walking pace at about 30 minutes mile
whereas Google places it at 20 that
discrepancy really makes a difference
when it comes to planning things down to
the minute allowing for transfers and
for faults to happen sometimes but both
get me there in short order at least
there's that
I decide to get trickier and move my
destination to a southern suburban mall
the mall is located in a region where a
smaller transit agency provides coverage
this time around both provide some
interesting routes but they are
technically possible I switched the
departure time to later in the day here
Maps makes that process one-tenth more
the hassle but at least it can plan
routes around custom time both apps
allow for you to download maps for
offline use in the case of Google the
features more obscured and it's limited
to approximately a 25 mile diameter on
here
downloading maps is permanently
spotlighted as a crucial feature along
with using the app in offline mode if
you have the capacity you can store as
many maps of as many states or countries
as you would like
I go forth and turn off data connections
for each device Google Maps and here
maps don't store satellite imaging data
just roads and basic Pio I plotting you
can also search for landmarks on here
maps while offline Google Maps requires
the internet to be any smart here
delivered directions while Google balked
at my request so we know that here maps
is plenty strong enough to compete with
Google if it has good data it's just
that the data backbone here has
collapses in front of Google
and given the shaky ground Nokia's in
right now we suggest that you really
should wait if you're being underserved
by here right now just consider giving
it another chance I'm thanks to you for
suggesting this piece to us if you have
any other conclusions about here maps or
Google Maps let us know in the comments
below or on our Twitter Facebook and
Google+ accounts just keep in mind that
this is one testers experienced in one
area of the earth be sure to follow us

being here more next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
