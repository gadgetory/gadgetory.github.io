pocketnow.com and this is the lg optimus
3d it's coming to AT&amp;amp;T at the LG thrill
4G and in this video we're gonna take a
look at the software LG bundles with it
so without any further ado let's get to
the software tour
this is the lockscreen
on the lg optimus 3d and it's the same
as it's on the lg optimus black the lg
optimus 2x aka the t-mobile g2 X it's
your typical slide-out to unlock
lockscreen Allah Windows Phone 7 once
you unlock your phone this is what you
get the lg UI and it's a little bit
disappointing at first because one would
expect a 3d user interface but number
one because of the permanent 3d user
interface and the usage of 3d in a
permanence mode will deplete your
battery dramatically one and two because
the 3d effect is only available in
landscape mode we are only greeted with
a 2d user interface and this is the same
also and on the HTC EVO 3d that aside
it's your basic typical classic LG user
interface and we will not emphasize that
much on it because it's not the main
selling points of the phone we will
mention though that there are five home
screens and you can have a total number
of seven which you can swipe through
left and right as you would on any
Android phone and you can customize with
widgets icons wallpapers and so on and
so forth and we'll take a look at how
it's done you have two long tap on a
home screen and select whether you want
to add a widget a shortcut a folder or a
wallpaper
now in terms of widgets don't expect you
have a cornucopia of widgets as you
would have on HTC Android smartphone but
you have some typical analog clock
Facebook finance so on and so forth your
basic widgets in terms of shortcuts you
have shortcuts to applications or
frequently accessed settings you have
the ability of adding a certain folder
or creating a folder on one of your home
screens and change the wallpaper either
to a wallpaper which comes pre-loaded on
the Optimus 3d or a stock Android live
wallpaper which are the same as you'd
expect on any Android phone so let's get
back to the homes
and take a look at what's really
important the 3d aspect of the phone you
can jump into 3d and one of the two
following ways number one you can either
tap the 3d space icon or you can press
and hold the 3d button on the side of
the phone and will do just that as the
phone enters its 3d user interface or a
3d launcher let's just zoom in on the
screen and whatever you see here is in
three dimensions needless to say that
the little fella playing golf right here
is popping out of the screen but this
effect cannot be captured and played
back with our camera but please believe
me it's somewhere floating about the
screen you can almost grab him so the 3d
effect is rather good that aside we have
five shortcuts on this launcher we have
3d games we have the 3d guide these
icons are also animated and they're
popping out of the screen we have
YouTube 3d we have 3d Gallery and we
have 3d camera now the 3d games holds
your pre-loaded games and these are of
course
Nova asphalt 6 let's golf Gulliver's
Travels Wikitude and Archer crafts were
downloaded by us really guide is
something interesting if you want to
know more about creating viewing sharing
or connecting and let's say you want to
create 3d content and it will tell you
what's the optimum distance to your
subject what's the optimum holding angle
and focus and so on and so forth and
it's the same with the viewing it will
tell you what distance to keep between
your eyes and the screen and what angle
let's get back one more and we'll see
this was 3d guide you to 3d now
everybody thought that LG will bundle a
dedicated 3d YouTube client but it's not
that it's just your typical YouTube
application which will launch let's go
to landscape which
launched as a shortcut to the 3d channel
on YouTube now this 3d channel collects
ads as favourites and thus playlist most
of the 3d videos that are in YouTube so
you have everything in one place and you
can easily tap on one video to take a
look at it and this is of course also in
3d it doesn't come you cannot see it but
believe us it's 3d and you can saved by
the two images overlaid so it's kind of
blurry on our camera and on your display
let's get right back so this was you to
3d we've got a 3d gallery which is a 3d
place gallery of course excuse the
expression which holds up all your
captured videos or images on the phone
and it's it has a carousel like display
and you can switch between this place to
a more rounded spatial carousel tapping
on either one will playback the video or
display the image of course this is 3d
now if we are in the playback mode you
can easily switch between 3d and 2d by
tapping this button or pressing the
dedicated 3d button at the top and you
can adjust the depth of the display by
tapping the 3d button on the left
sliding the slider to the left we'll
bring you more immersed in the image and
how should I explain this better so you
can visualize it grabbing the slider and
dragging it all the way to the left
will make the image look deeper into the
space dragging it to the far right will
bring the image closer to your eyes so
this is something really really cool
let's just get just back from from the
gallery to the main launcher and I think
this was the last category in this
launcher know we got 3d camera now the
3d camera is a shortcut which will
launch the camera application and 3d
mode the camera application has two
modes one for capturing normal to them
images and videos and one for capturing
3d kept capturing 3d videos and pictures
tapping this icon will automatically
start the camera in 3d mode and this is
just too much just about it when it
comes to LG's custom 3d user interface
or launcher there is no other 3d content
on the phone except for the 3d printable
games YouTube and the content you
captured yourself let's jump right back
and let's take a look at some more
aspects of the software on the lg
optimus 3d like for instance the email
application now tapping this little
fella here will bring you to the email
application itself which has a nice
ability to be collapsed and expanded in
terms of emails which are on your phone
this is neat if you want to have a clean
aspect of your inbox which is by the way
a combined inbox ooh here you will have
a list of all your of your accounts
which are currently set up on your phone
and going to either one of them or to
your combined inbox is just one tap away
so you can collapse and expand your
messages either all of them or you can
expand them one by one according to the
date which you would like to read and
creating a new message is very easy this
is the LG soft input panel or keyboard
which we found to be pretty good it's
comparable to the s IP on the iPhone 4
it's accurate it's got a vibration
haptic feedback as well as a sound
feedback it works pretty pretty well
let's get back and let's take a look at
the calendar application because email
calendar and multimedia is what you do
most with this phone let's just find
here it is the calendar it's basically
your typical Android calendar it's got a
display for months for week for day and
an agenda view and it's pretty much
nothing special just your Android
calendar now the lg optimus 3
is shipping with Android 2.2 Froyo it's
it's gonna get 2.3 Gingerbread summer in
October if the rumors are true and as
such it will come with the 2.2 Froyo
browser installed with of course a
little bit of LG touch you have a button
for back for forward tapping this button
will bring you to your tabs you can
navigate through them or you can
manually close either one of them and
let's see how fast it loads the page as
we can see meanwhile it's already loaded
we have flash animations enabled so this
is why you'll find the scrolling to be a
little bit choppy but else it's working
pretty well
zooming in and zooming out is done with
no lag it's fluid and this is because
the lg optimus 3d is built upon a tri
dual technology architecture we have
three times dual which is three times
one dual-core processor two dual channel
memory and dual memories so this is the
tribal architecture on the lg optimus 3d
and the browser as well as multimedia
content is taking advantage of that
we'll post some scores which we have
from our benchmarks downloaded and it's
pretty good it's in line or even above
the HTC Sensation but you have to read
the full review to find out the exact
numbers let's get back and let's see the
camera application tapping this button
here brings you to camera application
which is basically your typical Android
camera and once it fires up you will see
that you have a 2d 3d button camera
multiple yeah that's right let's go into
landscape HUD 3d button by default it
launches in 2d and the only camera which
is capturing images is this one right
here let's see if we cover that we cover
the image if we cover the other one
nothing happens now the second camera is
activated once you switch to 3d mode and
then both cameras will capture your
image
the site Rhonda's not much more is
customized it's your pretty basic camera
application let's go through the 3d
settings here and we have the ability to
adjust our depth just as with the with
the gallery and the picture video player
itself you can either bring the image
closer to your eyes or have a boxed
vision inside your screen then we have
settings for adjusting exposure we have
settings for the dimensions for the
image we have 3 megapixels 2 megapixels
and 1 megapixels and the basic settings
3d focus mode which board which from
which you can choose this border and
Center excuse me let's get back
we found Center to be better but it's up
to you
white balance timer Auto review shutter
sound so on and so forth let's get back
to the home screen and let's take a look
at what else we have here
the music layer is nothing new if you
have an LG phone or you have seen an LG
phone it will bring you all of your
albums loaded on the phone and you can
choose from display types of songs
albums artists and playlists and going
to albums and flipping to landscape mode
will bring you to this wall of album
arts with the their respective initials
Cillian key can easily jump to a certain
letter or you can see what the album
name is according to the letter it is
after tapping on it will bring you to
the album view and you can play it and
once the music is playing you can of
course control it from your notification
area which sports also shortcuts for
muting for disabling Wireless for
enabling or disabling Bluetooth GPS and
your data connection
let's jump back to the home what else we
have here we have widgets for favorite
contacts which you can of course
customize and we have a social Plus
widget which is LG's widget for social
networking and it's got integration with
Twitter and Facebook it will
automatically bring you the news
according to the interval of your choice
when it will pull for what's new and
bring it to the palm of your hand so
this was a very short look at the
software on the lg optimus 3d we're sure
it will be more or less the same on the
AT&amp;amp;T 3 or 4 g2 don't expect 3d content
unless you are in the dedicated 3d
launcher you are playing 3d YouTube
videos you are playing one of the
pre-installed games in 3d or you are
capturing their own content anything
else
is 2-dimensional but I'm sure as time
will go by and 3d will become more of a
habit instead of a gimmick we will have
3d permanent displays in the palm of our
hands this was Anton denied from
pocketnow.com taking a look at the
software on the lg optimus 3d if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and thank you very much for watching
