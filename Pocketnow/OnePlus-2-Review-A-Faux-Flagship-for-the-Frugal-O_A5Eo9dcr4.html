smartphone the answer used to come easy
if you want high-end specs at a crazy
low price then yes it's your only
compelling option but the oneplus 2
comes 15 months after its trailblazing
predecessor the smartphone world has
changed and oneplus had a big hand in
changing it can the so-called flagship
killer keep up in a world where solid
smartphones keep getting less expensive
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
find out in our video review of the
oneplus 2
if there's one thing oneplus excels at
here its presentation opening the box
reveals a handheld with a fancy fit and
finish and a heft usually reserved for
more expensive hardware the flash
doesn't stop at the phone you get a soft
linguini style charging cable done up in
striking red with a slim non shielded
USB insert on one end a reversible
type-c connector on the other and a
flexible strap to keep it nicely coiled
why are we spending so much time on the
cable because little conveniences like
that make customers feel taken care of
and oneplus continues the practice on
the phone itself with a complementary
screen protector don't take it off like
I did it's meant to be on there it makes
the glass a little stickier a little
more prone to oily build-up but it's
still a nice and free concession to
protection beneath that protection sits
a sheet of Gorilla Glass and beneath
that sits the 5.5 inch full HD LCD the
screen while nice enough is unremarkable
it's reasonably sharp and it gets bright
enough to be seen in most lighting
conditions but its colors are pretty
washed out and its viewing angles could
definitely be better the ability to
change the color temperature wasn't
baked into the software to begin with
but one plus is including that option in
a new software release more on that in a
second
on the flip side is the sandstone
backing that oneplus made famous with
its first flagship killer a sharkskin
coating that makes the phone easy to
hold and fun to feel up if you don't
like it other style swap backs are
available ranging from Kevlar to
Rosewood its bordered on all sides by an
aluminum magnesium mid plate featuring
ports for powerful speakers at the
bottom a clever three-stage switch on
the side that lets you control the
notification mode without tapping the
touchscreen and volume and power buttons
that we wish were textured differently
so that we could better tell them apart
by feel open up the hood and you get a
look at the oneplus 2 s other hardware
standout a dual SIM tray included as
standard that means you can use the
phone on two cellular networks
simultaneously what you can't see here
are the 3300 milliamp hour battery and
the Snapdragon 810 processor
or the accompanying RAM and storage our
review device is the more expensive 64
gig variant with four gigs of RAM on the
software appearances aside
this ain't your father's Google phone
one-plus is using its own oxygen OS to
power the oneplus 2 which is a custom
interface based on android 5.1 while it
looks a lot like the stock version of
lollipop it's a bit more customizable
you can trigger the notification shade
with a swipe anywhere on the screen a
godsend on a phone as tall as this you
can also control which toggles you want
displayed on that notification drawer
decide what accent and LED colors you
want and individually control app
permissions it's kind of like getting a
preview of Android marshmallow and in
some ways it's better remember that
scrubbed plan to allow users to select
dark or light themes in Android M it's
here on the oneplus 2 and it looks
fantastic the custom options don't stop
at interface colors the fingerprint
scanner which is excellent by the way
doubles as a home button in both it and
the capacitive keys flanking it are
programmable and tapping them once gets
you the usual home back or multitasking
functions while long pressing or double
clicking them performs other actions
like launching the camera or opening
Google now and if you don't want to deal
with any of that you can disable all the
capacitive keys and switch to software
controls in which themselves can be
customized according to your whims some
of the custom options are more
convoluted than they're worth it's nice
to be able to launch the camera or
flashlight without unlocking the phone
first but we'd prefer a less cumbersome
way to do it than doodling on the
display also the Shelf has some good
ideas working for it but ultimately it's
just a vertically scrolling list of
widgets
the oneplus two's camera software is
slow to launch and often unstable but at
press time oneplus was preparing a big
update to the viewfinder that included
raw support and manual controls as part
of oxygen OS 2.1 it was too late for us
to hold this review any more than we
already had but we'll follow up with a
dedicated post at pocketnow.com - the
photos themselves this phone already
kicks out some really cool shots update
or no we've taken this camera everywhere
and the streets of Boston to the shores
of Long Island to the mountains of North
Carolina to the ferns of terms of Berlin
and in each of those locations the
oneplus 2 produced photos we were proud
of the camera uses an optically
stabilized 13 megapixel sensor with
oversized pixels and F 2.0 aperture a
6th element lens and laser assisted
autofocus and it's mirrored on the front
side by a 5-megapixel selfie camera the
result of all that optical technobabble
is really nice shots more often than not
for mobile geeks it's proof that you
don't need a Sony sensor to get photos
worth keeping from a smartphone for
normal people it's proof you don't need
to spend a fortune to get the same thing
even some of the time at least in
low-light situations as always though
the less light there is the more digital
noise creeps in and that holds true both
for primary camera shots and for selfies
also the HDR mode doesn't do the best
job of preserving authentic colors the
optical stabilization could be
substantially better at smoothing the
shot during walk-and-talk videos and
focus wanders constantly in video mode
it's hugely distracting if you're moving
the camera even a small amount again as
a press time we're expecting an update
on this device so we'll see what that
does for it
we've used the oneplus 2 for 42 days
across four states and two continents
that's much longer than our usual review
period and the reason is that we
initially tested a pre-release media
version like everyone else it's the one
you saw in our galaxy s6 comparison but
we saw some weird behavior in that one
and wanted to know what a retail unit
was like so we switched about a week ago
probably the most fun part of the
oneplus 2 experience on the whole has
been the dual SIM slots at the extreme
edges of network coverage we had to swap
between t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T frequently to
maintain a connection and that was
easily done in the settings menu with no
rebooting or
APN reprogramming necessary
unfortunately the oneplus 2 S reception
fell a little short the much cheaper
Moto G often did a better job holding on
to a signal at least in the mountains of
North Carolina if you live in the
boonies take this phone on a test drive
through your fringe areas before the
return period expires the news is better
when it comes to battery life despite
the general belief that dual Sims do a
number on endurance we routinely got
over four hours of screen on time per
charge with moderate use it's not great
but it's not bad either annoyingly
there's no quick charge support here so
topping it up takes a while we're
talking almost two hours tethered to a
wall and if you're out and about you
better hope you didn't leave your
charging cable at home because not many
of your friends are likely to have
type-c USB cables lying around while
we're tabulating hassles there's no
wireless charging either and no NFC that
means among other things no support for
Android pay which is just starting to
roll out here in the States
bad timing to wrap things up on a
positive note the snapdragon 810
processor will not fry your fingers off
just as we've foretold in the sacred
texts yes the phone gets hot when you're
playing an intense round of whatever and
yes it'll blast through your battery in
no time under that condition but every
other phone does that too
and from day-to-day use to heavy loads
the oneplus 2 is a lot like every other
phone
when you consider how much cheaper the
1+2 is than every other phone the
typical performance starts to look a lot
like great performance now the price
doesn't serve as an excuse for all the
phones shortcomings and this thing was
marketed as not just a killer of
flagships but a killer of next year's
flagships you should not expect anything
close to that
from the oneplus 2 and to be honest you
should expect a few bugs for all its
makers bluster about being a mainstream
table flipper or whatever the oneplus 2
still has the soul of a tinkerer
smartphone bought by people with the
patience to wait for an invitation and
the patience to tweak their way around
shortcomings if that's the kind of
patience you possess or if saving
literally hundreds of dollars on a
smartphone will allow you to find that
patients within you the oneplus 2 should
definitely place on your list of
contenders it's not the game changer its
predecessor was and it's not the hero
its creators seem to think it is but it
is a smartphone with an uncommon ly good
feature set for under $400 unlocked that
makes it if not a must by then at least
a worthy temptation the landscape is
littered with competitors of the oneplus
2 and we reviewed many of them check out
our other video reviews here on YouTube
and head on over to pocketnow.com
for the full reviews of those devices
and the full review of the oneplus 2
available very soon till next time this
has been michael fisher hey follow me on
twitter captain to phones it's captain
the number two phones follow pocket now
on social media as well where it is just
pocket now and most importantly thanks
for watching we'll see you next time
