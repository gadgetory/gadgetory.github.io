the LGB 30 in the next hot tradeshow
code within HTC's latest flagship has
already begun to reference the next
Google pixel and Samsung's standalone
plans for VR seem bolder than expected
I'm hi meadow Iveta and yeah it seems
that microphone a is fully dead bear
with me as we continue with microphone B
as I get a replacement this is talking
out daily the official news today begin
with one of the craziest deals I've ever
seen if you're not a current virgin
mobile subscriber notice you have to be
new and you buy an iPhone within their
services their services ends up just
being $1 for a full year we're talking
about the fact that all you have to do
is pay for the iPhone and port your
current existing mobile number and yeah
you'll just be paying one dollar for
unlimited everything it is crazy but
there has to be a catch we've been
looking for it for hours I don't seem to
find that you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about Samsung
as a Google made it a big deal over
standalone VR and where daydream is
going in the future
obviously the only companies that are
offering something right now are HTC
among others but same thing is going to
join the crowd and notice this we hear
that this VR headset from Samsung is
going to have two thousand pixels per
inch mm that is crazy we can't wait to
see when we get that now it's not the
spotlight over to Apple as it seems that
the company is already gearing up for
its next generation iPhone in a big way
whether it's called the iPhone 8 or
iPhone next doesn't really matter what
matters is that apparently companies
like wha we're having trouble securing
NAND flash of the big storage kind 128
gigabytes for example and even memory D
Ram because apparently Apple has secured
so much of it for this next generation
iPhone that things are getting a little
crazy so stay tuned apparently good
storage will be one of the major
features on this next iPhone that's
great so sad for those of you waiting
for a big storage content for example I
was from the spotlight over to the next
generation Google pixel mainly because
even though
there are rumors that LG might
manufacture one of them apparently there
is some leaked code of the HTC u 11 that
hints to that next generation pixel
meaning that at least one of these
devices will definitely be made by HTC
and also meaning that apparently they'll
share some sort of a design language
that's not necessarily that we actually
like the U Elevens design but let's see
what we get
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with the LG v 30 the
company's next generation flagship last
year we kind of received the showcase
that we can really talk about of the
LGBT 28 Eva and Berlin apparently the
company will be announcing this phone at
the tradeshow and this is great she
hasn't really announced anything major
at Aoife and years and one of the things
that we did not like the most about the
b20 was the fact that the company
silently announced that that wasn't the
way to launch your Ferrari had to be
with this major of engine apparently Eva
will be the show floor we might be
getting the same 5.7 inch display but we
might be finally getting ip68 water and
does resistance we just wonder if the
stone will have a removable battery or
not going forward but it leads me to the
question of the day what is your wish
list for the LGBT going forward in my
case I would really love a removable
battery but it was a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
you know the way goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the videos
filmed follow us on hang out calm and
hit that subscribe button down below for
more videos like this one we also follow
me on Twitter hi managers quarterly that
aren't into the ground at high metadata
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am I'm le bit I
think so much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
