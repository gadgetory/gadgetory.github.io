pocket now and this is the HTC one x
this isn't the international variant we
reviewed a few weeks back though this is
the carrier specific version for AT&amp;amp;T in
the united states that doesn't just mean
a different logo so let's dive in and
see what's different what's new and
exciting and maybe what's not exciting
about the AT&amp;amp;T HTC One X ok so starting
off with the box itself I have to say
this is a very very average presentation
for an AT&amp;amp;T device pop in the box open
we're immediately greeted by the device
itself I'm going to put that aside for a
second though and we see the sim removal
tool under this piece of cardboard a
quick start guide your standard wall
plug and USB charger both done up in
white that's very nice all in all a
pretty standard pretty unimpressive
presentation 18t really could have done
better here now the reason I'm giving
AT&amp;amp;T such a hard time about this kind of
mediocre packaging is because the device
the box contains isn't just one of your
standard run-of-the-mill
middle-of-the-road Android handsets it's
one of the most beautiful pieces of tech
hardware I've ever handled seriously now
it is so great to see manufacturers
focusing on hardware design again this
is a beautiful beautiful device the
screen is 4.7 inches across which is
beastly but it doesn't feel like it's
that large because of how well
engineered the phone is the white
polycarbonate really showcases this
airfoil like design and the feel in the
hand is just incredible so up front
we've got that big super LCD panel down
bottom three capacitive buttons for ICS
and up top some nice patterned machined
holes for the earpiece behind which is
also the status LED and next to that
we've got the front-facing 1.3 megapixel
camera up top a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack and noise
cancelling microphone next door along
with a sim tray and the power standby
button on the right side all we have is
a volume rocker and
nothing else and on the other side of
the phone we have just the micro USB
port and finally on the back that huge
very pronounced lens for the 8 megapixel
camera with the offset flash looking
like an orbiting moon or something cool
like that Pogo connectors on the side
and finally the Beats Audio branding and
the speakerphone grill at the bottom the
tape here is covering up this devices
imei and serial numbers sorry cloners
now while the AT&amp;amp;T version of the 1x
might look effectively identical to the
global version there are some very
important differences inside because of
its LTE support the AT&amp;amp;T version of the
1x ships with a dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon instead of the quad-core
Tegra 3 on the international version
this has led some people to say that
this version of the 1x is more like a 1s
in One X's body does that ring true
let's check it out now since 4 is
definitely the lightest version I've
seen in a long time 18 he told me that
HTC's focus with this version of sense
was to add features it thought were
missing rather than to mess with
features already present but at the end
of the day it's still a skin and it
still got some shortcomings on the plus
side sense really does add a lot of
customizability to android which is
already the most customizable OS out
there things like personalized lock
screens and adaptive skins and themes
like this weather theme will be a real
value add for some people and the
ability to jump right into a dock
application from the lock screen is very
useful this makes up somewhat for the
lack of a dedicated camera key for
example also the multitasking button
exhibits no delay when pressed and HTC's
cards view which borrows heavily from
webOS is more intuitive than the stock
ICS switcher is also the usual
complement of widgets and added features
on the downside even in its lighter form
sense is still heavy enough to slow the
phone's boot time and responsiveness
noticeably and it's uglier elements are
all present
apps nowhere is sense less satisfying
than in the keyboard which is oversized
and the layout just isn't very good it's
autocorrect dictionary is not as good as
the stock ICS version it's not as quick
and the faux swipe mode might be useful
to some but to me this keyboard is one
of the weakest parts of sense now as far
as overall performance of this device
versus the quad core version I found
exactly what I expected to find which is
to say not much difference in day-to-day
use in his review of the quad core
version our editor-in-chief Brandon
minimun pointed too laggy performance I
can see the same kind of occasional
slowdowns and stutters on my device and
yeah you know considering the powerful
Hardware under the hood it's a little
annoying the occasional stop and stutter
weather problems like this are a deal
breaker for you well depends on how much
you value a truly fluid UI and frankly
though it's come a long way Android
still has a way to go in that department
I found battery life to be fairly
standard the non removable 1,800
milliamp hour battery gave me better
performance than the 2100 milliamp hour
battery and my Galaxy Nexus but you're
definitely going to want to carry a
charger around if you're engaging in any
kind of heavy use especially making use
of that LTE connectivity speaking of LTE
performance over 18 T's network in New
York City and Boston here in the United
States was spectacular now while my
speeds did vary according to speed tests
the perceived speed my experience as a
user was that I was almost never waiting
for the phone to catch up phone calls
were just fine callers reported that I
sounded very clear but even the noise
cancelling mic couldn't deal with a
sustained stiff breeze outside as far as
the value adds that HTC is pushing with
their authentic sound amazing camera
brand statement I found the experience
to be just fine it's obvious that the
saturation on the camera is a bit on the
high side
and the device doesn't hold on to focus
terribly well but still if you're
viewing the photos on this beautiful s
LCD panel they really really do look
incredible it's not until you get them
onto a computer that they're somewhat
mediocre nature becomes evident and this
kind of performance would be atrocious
from a dedicated point-and-shoot camera
but this is a phone camera I think it's
really really okay it's no iphone 4s but
it's also no Galaxy Nexus so it could be
worse the real advancements are in the
camera UI which doesn't force you to
decide between a video recording button
and a camera shutter key this is the
same viewfinder for both modes which is
really awesome it's a huge time-saver
the ability to shoot still shots when
you're in a video is a nice add-on as is
the burst shot mode you just hold down
the capture key and capture many images
in sequence then the software saves all
of the photos at once and allows you to
decide the best one then it'll discard
all the rest once you decide that that
is the best shot the filters on the
camera are a lot of fun to play with as
well at least until the novelty wears
off and some of them are even cooler
than what you could find an admittedly
basic Instagram as far as sound goes
I'll only say this real audio files
aren't going to be depending on their
phone to deliver a professional-grade
experience and that's good because beats
won't do it to my admittedly untrained
the ears beats really does very little
besides boosting the base and upping the
volume some what does that mean I think
it shouldn't be included absolutely not
I actually found it more enjoyable when
beats was enabled it helped out in noisy
environments like the subway but I also
don't think it's nearly as special as
HTC wants it to be and it certainly
doesn't warrant a special logo on the
back from a design standpoint this is
without a doubt one of my favorite
devices ever from the materials chosen
to the design lines everything about it
is just beautiful really from a software
perspective I commend HTC for listening
feedback and lightening up on their skin
this is definitely the best version of
sense I've used and some of its add-ons
are really very pretty and very useful
but even the best of skins demand a
trade-off and for my money I'd rather
have stock ICS which still offers a
better user experience in my opinion at
least the option to run stock would have
been very nice although this hardware is
beautiful the phone is truly massive it
doesn't feel huge in the hand due to its
slimness but trying to use it one-handed
is an exercise in futility I have to
shift it in my hand to get my thumb up
to get up to the notification drawer and
if I want to go down here I have to
shift it again to get down to these
buttons here creating a very real risk
of dropping the phone if I'm using it
one-handed because of this slippery
polycarbonate shell which feels great
but which could easily result in you
dropping it to the floor I wouldn't call
it a deal breaker but you're definitely
going to want to handle this phone
yourself before you consider picking one
up it's that big even though it has some
shortcomings though if I were in the
market for an android phone on AT&amp;amp;T this
device would definitely be on my short
list it's the best version of sense yet
on the most beautiful hardware design
i've seen in a long time and the 720p
display is out of this world our score
on the AT&amp;amp;T HTC One X is 4 out of 5 this
has been Michael Fisher with pocket now
