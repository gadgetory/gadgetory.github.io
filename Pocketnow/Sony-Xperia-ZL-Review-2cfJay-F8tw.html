the company's new struggle to make a
dent in the smartphone market with their
announcement at CES it was clear that
Sony is doing everything they can to win
with these phones but the question is
are they really enough so after our full
review of the Sony Xperia Z now two
weeks with the Sony Xperia ZL it's time
to find out I'm Jaime Rivera this is
PocketNow
if this is our full review of the Sony
Xperia Z L if I had to describe the
Xperia Z oh with one word I call it
elegant even when Sony decided to go for
a plastic design and not the glass on
glass and waterproof design of the
Xperia Z the CL is just as polished and
simply a beautiful design on its own
probably what's most striking about this
device is the almost invisible bezel on
the 5-inch 1080p display which leads to
great one-handed use and a pixel density
of 441 pixels per inch match that with
the glass edges and the textured plastic
design on the back with a perfect curve
for your hand and I'm sure that most of
you will agree this is one of the most
iconic designs of the year when it comes
to specs the ZL is very similar to the Z
it packs the same Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
pro processor clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
two gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes of
storage expandable up to 32 gigabytes
via microSD a 13.1 megapixel camera at
the back and a 2 megapixel camera at the
front that are both capable of 1080p
video and it also has an IR blaster at
the side and all the usual bells and
whistles of a flagship smartphone and
then there are the things that make this
phone stand apart from the Xperia Z you
like the fact that it's got a dedicated
camera button and you won't have to
fumble with software which is really
awesome but then you also have an LED
light and notice I said light not
indicator at the bottom which changes
every time you swap a photograph or swap
a video in the same color to mimic
what's on the display but it's not
really an indicator aside from
indicating when the phone is charging or
when it's full of charge sadly just this
with the Xperia Z this device is
conflicted it brings an amazing design
with last year's processor at times when
the snapdragon 600 is already out it's
also conflicted in the fact that
is one of the most beautiful displays
we've ever seen which is perfectly
designed to bring 5 inches and 1080p to
one-handed usability but as long as you
see it from the front as viewing angles
are terrible in comparison to even old
Sony phones like the Xperia S at first
we thought this was a problem with the
screen protector that's placed on pretty
much every Experion
what's removing it the results are the
same and yes this is what the Bravia
Engine 2 activated overall the hardware
is definitely something you'll like the
design is beautiful
you get expandable storage and IR
blaster and if you're picking about
pixel density and one-handed usability
this device is definitely for you but
things get complicated if you're picky
about color on viewing angles or rocking
last year specifications in 2013
software at a simple glance should be
great since it looks a lot like stock
Android right well there's more to it
than meets the eye the device runs
Android 4.1.2 jelly bean which is great
and Sony has retained the stock soft key
design since their late 2012 lineup
allowing you to launch Google now in the
same way you can do on pretty much any
Nexus device but sadly the stock
experience ends there and that's for
both good and bad on the positive side
the device's blazes through absolutely
everything you throw at it and pretty
much with no stutters at all the sony UI
is very refined very polished in it
makes the device look very elegant it
doesn't matter if you're running
applications opening folders flipping
through screens playing a game the
device is definitely a trooper and
everything you throw at it
sony has also enhanced it in places like
their themes and elegant widgets and
even their multitasking menu where
you'll find floating widgets they call
small apps which bring you a calculator
a voice recorder and other services
anywhere you are even within
applications this even includes a small
app for the IR blaster which later
expands to their full IRB ester
application which is not limited to Sony
products you can add devices from almost
every brand or make the app learn
controls if the device is not found
which is really neat but on the negative
side there are some conflicting parts
like being able to move widgets around
like on stock jellybeans or the keyboard
which looks a lot like the iPhones
keyboard but don't get confused this is
a
haribol keyboard when it comes to text
prediction so just get rid of it when
you pull the device out of the box again
software is something we'd call bold it
was a very beautiful and elegant move
from Sony but some things that weren't
broken shouldn't have been fixed now
even with the conflicting aspects of
this phone using the Xperia Z L in real
life as a pleasure for the most part
because of this shorter design to the
Xperia Z it fits perfectly in your
pocket regardless and call quality is
amazing probably one of the best I've
personally experienced on a phone clear
sound on the earpiece and clear sound on
the speakerphone as well beta speeds a
tad switch between Wi-Fi and data were
also great but bear in mind there are
three models of the Xperia Z L in the
market so just make sure you buy the
device with the right bands for your
network our review was based on the C
6502 HSPA+ model which worked great for
the most part the battery life is
another area where I'm honestly amazed
since the device pretty much took a good
beating during the day and it did the
same during half the night and it had
enough juice to go through the next day
without a charge which I'd call
above-average and when it comes to its
overall performance and device handles
games well I mean so far I haven't run
into moments where I feel that it's
lacking but obviously stay tuned for
after the buzz coverage on this devices
things might change after a couple of
months now when it comes to camera
performance asked what last year's
Xperia S photos are amazing as long as
you keep them within the display it
makes them look good but once you pull
them into a computer you do see some
imperfections there is some great color
balance in the photos but you do notice
some Machinist here and there and it
just seems like if the photos aren't any
better than any of the current other
flagship smartphones in the market even
at thirteen point one megapixels and
taking front-facing photos with this
device is an exercise in frustration
since you hold the device at the bottom
right if you're right-handed and this is
not where you expect the front-facing
camera to be when it came to 1080p video
recording HDR video did prove to be
better
I couldn't consider it to be the best
but I did notice some better detail
coming from the sensor than even on the
iPhone 5
even though well I did notice that it
still can't
to focus just like you can on pretty
much every other flagship smartphone in
the market but just pretty much my
complaint with every experience
smartphone bottom line sony scored a hit
with the Xperia Z oh when it comes to
the design I mean this device is a
head-turner no matter where you go but
I'm just not sure they hit it out of the
park since it's hard for me to recommend
that when compared to other flagship
smartphones like the HTC One or galaxy
s4 that are both coming even if you are
in the Sony ecosystem of products the
integration between Xperia smartphones
and Sony products is still in diapers so
I could recommend that the Sony fans in
general but not to make their experience
with any Sony product any better with an
experience if you were to judge this
phone on its own and not compare it
against anything
I'll admit that I've had a very
delightful experience with the Xperia Z
L there is just something about this
phone that is great and I'm honestly
gonna make this my daily driver going
forward so our final ring for this
device is 8 out of 10 that's it for our
