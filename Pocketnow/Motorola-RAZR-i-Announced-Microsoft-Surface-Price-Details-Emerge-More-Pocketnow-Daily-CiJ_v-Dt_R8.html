LG gets official with the optimus G and
Steve Ballmer talks about Microsoft
Surface pricing I'm high metal iveta
waiting for that Microsoft service like
there's no tomorrow and this is
out daily
Motorola's event has just ended in
London a couple of hours ago and as
expected we got a droid razr m like
smartphone being dubbed the razor i
which is powered by Intel's new medfield
processor which is clock the tuba gerdes
now even though Intel's boasting that
this processor is focused on gaming and
web browsing and it's the new two
gigahertz thing in the world it's just
interesting to see that they're
launching it on such a mid-tier device
so we'll see how good it is LG has just
announced their Optimus G a full day
ahead of their US announcement over in
Korea as expected we are getting
Qualcomm's new quad-core snapdragon
processor along with LG's new screen
technology that plans to blow everybody
out of the water we're still not sure if
this device will be enough to remove
LG's cheap device reputation but we'll
be in New York tomorrow to get you some
real hands on the device and tell you if
it's worth your money or not Amazon's
Kindle Fire 7 HD just begun knocking on
doors and ours arrived yesterday for
review so far the device is much faster
and better than the original kindle fire
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
the device is any better than any other
android tablet in the market sadly the
bootloader is locked and it's going to
take some time for it to be routed so
stay tuned for more coverage from
brandon as he continues on with his
review now HTC's verizon phablet keeps
making the headlines and this time we've
got press renders and what the device
might look like so far the device looks
really good but the press renders also
included the name of the device and this
where things get funny apparently it'll
be called the HTC One X 5 and like where
do they get that name but anyways will
be tomorrow at HTC's event over in New
York City and even though it'll most
probably be about Windows Phone 8 in its
entirety hopefully we'll be getting this
verizon phablet also with the weird name
and finally for the can't wait news of
the day we've got Microsoft Steve
Ballmer coming on record about the
microsoft surface tablet this time he's
finally talking about pricing even
though he says he's not trying to
compete against anybody apparently the
Windows RT version of the tablet is
going to retail for 300 bucks or over
and the pro version of the tablet is
going to retail for a little less than
800 bucks hopefully now that leads you
to the question of the day
are you after a microsoft surface tablet
or which tablet are you getting leave us
a comment down below I really want that
surface now if you want an earlier
scruple of everything that's happening
in the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow was on Parker now calm
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
