used to is the galaxy s6 good enough to
go in your pocket the answer in pocket
now is 60 second smartphone review
starting right now so here's what's hot
the plastic of yesteryear has given way
to a glass and aluminum frame that feels
even better than it looks the cameras
are some of the best you can find on
Android whether you're shooting at high
noon or at midnight the processor is
powerful the display is pixel packed and
the software projected on it is more
customizable than ever before here's
what's not so hot that software still
bears the lag of Android lollipop plus
Samsung's overlay and past experience
says it won't get better over time plus
wireless charging is less cool when you
have to charge it so often because of
poor battery life in a break from
Samsung tradition you can't swap that
battery or expand the storage and the
last time we saw an all-glass smartphone
it didn't go too well for those who went
without a case the upshot despite those
drawbacks this is the best galaxy s ever
if you're shopping for an android
flagship there's never been a better
time to consider a samsung for 11 more

video review here on YouTube and our
