winter but that doesn't mean there's
nothing left to say about mobile
technology in fact we're gearing up for
a very busy season and it's time to talk
about it welcome to the pocket now
weekly the once-a-week podcast from
pocketnow.com where we discuss
smartphones and tablets convertibles and
phablets and all those pocket
communicators stuck in between i'm
michael fisher and i'm joined today for
the first time in a while by joe levi
the android guy welcome back to the show
Joe thank you we've had a lot going on
between this episode and the last time I
was on yes we have I'm glad you're back
it's been too long actually we are also
joined but for the first time on the
weekly first time ever by one of our
newest team members straight from from
one of the carolinas Taylor Martin
welcome to the show sir thank you thank
you one of the carolinas it's nothing
not specifically no does it bother you
when people get the carolinas messed up
when people say you're from East
Carolina and you're really not I've
never heard anyone ever get it wrong so
no there's first is from result like six
Carolina's out there so super Carolina
so i'm down at laura you think are you
if we do that we have to also
consolidate oh carolina by shaggy wait a
minute wait a minute is that it is that
an actual song by shaggy yes yes it is I
wish we could lead in with that song on
the podcast um Taylor you're not a new
guy what I love is Taylor's been posting
a lot of YouTube videos for us recently
but we've had a lot of cool like
positive feedback but occasionally
you'll get to like a commenter who's a
jerk and then someone will rush right to
Taylor's aid and and they'll say
something like usually myself no I like
you because you exacerbate the problem
you're let you just go that the trolls
and that's nice but no it's something
like some random people will come in and
come to your aid and be like come on
guys he's new and I read these comments
and I'm like Taylor why don't you just
tell the listeners how long have you
been been
doing this has it been like three years
doing what part doing like mobile
technology in general yes written
content I've been doing for a little
over three years all right yeah a video
maybe like a coke collectively maybe a
month sorry well it's uh it does not
show you where loving the work that
you're doing and it's so nice to have
both you and Joe here as guys whose
youtube talents I respect oh thank you
i'm glad i could join the team he's uh
you can't have you yeah thanks we're
also glad that your studio is all spiffy
we were talking before went on the air
about our respective studios and
Taylor's got his Android army of how
many figurines do you have like 20 in
your studio a 14-14 all right and then
Joe's got a bunch of starships behind
him only one of which is the
enterprise's I've been recently
corrected and we said to school Michael
because of all of us he should know Trek
better than I all my Trek
paraphernalia is in the other room i
should bring it in here but that's the
problem like behind me I've got its grey
wall of acoustic foam and I want to hang
some stuff on it but I can't hang
anything on it so what I've got right
now is just out of frame on every video
I shoot I'm looking at it right now I've
got a notice sign which I took from the
roof of a theater I did some acting at a
couple months ago and it's there's a
cell site on the roof and like during
intermission or pre show or something
like that I was up on the roof I found
this sign from the cell site that's like
notice beyond this point you're entering
an area where RF emissions may exceed
general exposure limits and was like I'm
taking this sign I'm really excited
about but I can't hang it on the foam
but I want to hang it but I can't so
it's annoying three but we'll have since
died and that route I made sure there
were other signs i made sure wasn't
taking the place i think i'm the only
one with dual wielding rubber band
shotguns so i need to incorporate those
somehow into my set absolutely can you
feel like a can you build a water
balloon slingshot in here and is your
show at some point yes that would be
great I do an intro and then just boom
water balloon in the face or something
good Michael can give you tips on that
he knows how to how to handle water in
the tech industry really well I do
that's right yeah it does tend to go all
over demo tables to let you know
ironically enough in your picture on
skype you're holding a glass of water oh
I am are night no that's uh that's like
a cocktail okay just kidding oh yeah I
mean it water let's jump into
announcements shall we we have a couple
and then we're going to actually we only
have one because we already welcome to
Taylor Martin to the podcast that's very
nice but we have an introduction for a
new series called the pocket now TL DR
which shares its name with another
series from another from a very popular
youtube series does anybody know off the
top of his head with the title of that
series is from the other guys yeah no i
don't i had to search that article to
find out what on earth TL DR meant
reason you haven't hang out enough
message boards yeah well maybe I have
and I just didn't know what it was ah
it's just one of my mini ash and cheese
that's one of my many acquired nicknames
when I started getting very very post
and all of my articles oh really tldr
yeah yes see I figured the term was
general enough that it would be okay by
the way it's chris pirillo who has a
really cool channel on youtube and the
Lockergnome yeah it's the Lockergnome
daily report so I think that's funny
that they used it as a different you
know they used as a double abbreviation
but we're not you know ours doesn't
stand for anything it just stands for
yeah there are articles that are that
are too long and mostly Taylor I feel
you because I'm usually the one writing
1,500 or 2,000 word articles and I'm
people are like to log I can't believe
our shot through all that and like I
can't believe you commented and that's
it's a this is the TLDR as for us it's
like a sub 500 word format for us to
just dump small ideas that don't
necessarily deserve or warrant a full
editorial so that's blasphemy by the way
what is 500 word ordered it's not know
come on did you see did you see
Brandon's that I referenced in it no no
I didn't look at the megapixel article
now is the nexus 7 1 so in the listeners
in the initial article I kind of
discussed what what led me to come up
with this idea
and it was another editorial from
Brandon on the day of the nexus 7 launch
where the headline was the Nexus 7 has
no rear facing camera period good period
and then I click on the headline and
Brandon's editorials maybe a hundred
words like it doesn't even clear the ad
block on the left side of the page and
I'm like this is amazing this is to the
point in it I don't know if it's gonna
resound with readers and then we are
comments were full it was crazy so
anyway that's the source of that and
watch out for more of those and we are
all going to going to write them at some
point I think unless no but there's
something to be said coming remedy you
know if you can get to the point why
fluff it up why do whatever there's only
so much more information that you can
dig in from other sources and well I
think this but this guy says this and 37
other guys say that you know just here's
the scoop there you go let us know what
you think in the comments because this
article is not about what other people
say it's what you guys the readers say
right yeah it's about that here's what I
think now what do you think that's kind
of the core of the of the new series so
i'm gonna have to break a mental complex
to get through that at my previous I
don't know what to call it the
publication I worked for before I
acquired the nickname their fluff dog so
he did why we get so in between TL DR
and fluff dog you had a bevy of
nicknames indicating that you wrote a
lot yes my favorite though is the haters
later yes I acquired that one on youtube
last week really hailer Martin the hail
hater Slayer it's probably my favorite I
remember you mentioning that and I think
I was that at mwc so I couldn't like you
know focus I said it on a hangout with
wrong but it's okay you ignore me sorry
what were you saying yeah somebody
talking by the way my life is that you
is that you scratching your beard
periodically Joe like it periodically I
get this really the sound of like a
thoughtful a thoughtful bit of sandpaper
rubbing what's going on no no that's not
coming for my hand I don't know what's
no III had to shave well I didn't shave
I trimmed my goatee down real short cuz
i had to speak at a funeral
and my wife mrs. the lengths you used to
grab onto it and haul me around by its
oh gosh so no it's not me scratching my
I go to yet it's not long enough for
that all right I'm to peep for my mic so
I don't think so well somebody's
somebody's just listening in on the
podcast and rubbing his chin
thoughtfully let's jump into the jump
into the thought thread here we
typically start to show with a thought
thread from Brandon who's really good at
kind of leaping us into topic or the
mood but we don't have branded today and
none of us have anything unless I'm
mistaken jump in if i'm wrong but none
of us have anything that we're kind of
chomping at the bit to talk about that's
not already in the topic list so i was
hoping we could role play real quick
haha i was hoping you could get off the
air uh so i thought we might start off
the show with a piece of listener mail
just to kind of change the you know
change everything up and i we have we
have more listener mail at the end of
the show but this one is kind of
stretches across platforms and I think
it's suitable to start the show with so
let's kick off the show with a piece of
mail from Bob Newman who apparently
tried multiple times to get this email
through and I'm glad that it finally got
through but bob says he's in the throes
of deciding between Blackberry Android
and Windows Phone and his dubious about
Android because he wants as much privacy
and security as can be had in a
smartphone he's dubious about blackberry
because of its teething problems and his
dubious about Windows Phone because he
doesn't like live tiles and the UI
basically but he says I really like what
I've seen of you bum to ubuntu agony I'm
never gonna be able to say that and
Johan to ubuntu and yola I'd be grateful
if you were one of the other guys would
answer the following will who but will
boom 22 or yola installed on an android
phone enable better privacy and security
than android gives will they be
handicapped in any way compared to
installations of them on hardware built
for them and is it possible to turn the
animation of page turning in the
flipping tiles and windows off thanks in
advance Bob Newman I can take the
windows thing no it is not possible to
turn live tile animations off in this
version of Windows Phone
so unfortunately Bob if you really hate
those flipping live tiles you're going
to be stuck with them if you go the
Windows Phone root as far as the ubuntu
and yola question is concerned I think
that's a fascinating one and I
specifically wanted to lead off with
this because I thought between Joe and
Taylor you guys might have a general
idea of an answer to one of these
questions will you bun to or Yolo
installed on an android phone enable
better privacy or security i mean i i've
handled Yolo but I've only seen the UI
skin so I know very little about its
actual security abilities Joe you just
did a video about the you OS so what
about that so bhuntu it is it's linux
but it's not really full baked full
cooked linux like you run on a desktop
or a laptop computer linux at least not
yet we'll get to a little bit later
there's some interesting crossovers into
the android we're older than the
hardware that they're running on ubuntu
specifically is one of the districts of
linux that at least in my opinion has
more privacy capabilities than other
flavors of linux and other operating
systems in general I think eventually
that's going to come over to ubuntu
mobile Lubuntu for phone and and you'll
see a lot more encryption a lot more
cool things that you can do to keep
yourself private and secure using that
OS than any other OS right now it's all
just speculation all we've seen is some
some really early proof-of-concept
versions of the OS running on android
centric hardware so it just I don't know
I hope so yeah it's too soon to tell
really I mean I've used I've installed
on my nexus for at least eight times now
maybe nine or so I mean there's really
not much to know about it other than how
it looks right yeah maybe how it
operates but even then you can't really
tell because it's so laggy and it
crashes and yeah it's just too soon to
tell never that was my initial impulse
to I think it is they're both so young
in this implementation that there's no
way to tell at this at this point and AB
staged you
aren't there not there yet so if you're
used to running you know an encrypting
chat client or an encrypting email
client or something on you know your
your desktop a boon to distro you don't
have that same app available just yet
over on a bluetooth phone right right so
yeah thank you for the question Bob I
think I think what it comes down to is
if you're in a rush to do this it's it's
probably gonna prove you to go with an
OS that's actually established and it
sounds like you're leaning mostly toward
Windows Phone you know blackberry has to
grow quickly or else it won't survive so
i think you should still keep an eye on
it i know it's got some teething issues
and who knows whether those will improve
or get worse tend to think they'll
improve but you know if you don't
believe if windows phone is your
preferred option and you can find a way
to get past a live tiles flipping on you
all the time you know there is a way to
configure your home screen so that it's
mostly dominated by tiles that are non
live and you can configure third-party
apps not to update those tiles as
frequently or ever so if you're in a
rush you're probably going to want to go
that route but thank you for the
question and thanks for leading us into
the show considering we did not have a
different thought thread but Jen's I'd
like to jump into Android if it's all
the same to you sure let's do it yes
there was there's a phone coming out
from Samsung that it runs Android it
might be kind of a big deal it's called
the galaxy s4 and there was a leak
recently on Twitter it came from efflux
but in any case it was it this is a very
legitimate very reliable league source
and some other outlets reported on it
and we reported on their report and it
looks it has since been revealed to be a
render and I don't know guys tell me how
you feel about this because when I when
this was when this was revealed to be an
expensive mock-up I was beyond relieved
because this is probably the ugliest
thing I've ever seen it doesn't it look
like an iPad Mini like shrunk down to
phone sighs yes and it's 2d so right
yeah like that's how thin it is
paper-thin galaxy
yeah I'm glad that this is no longer
news I'm glad this kind of this this
cropped up and immediately got
extinguished in the space of a couple
hours apparently is the cut yeah its
expenses have prepared them for its own
site it's just a placeholder image well
while they wait for the for the rest of
the world to to catch up so at least
better mock-ups I know yeah I guess they
don't want to spend spend as much time
on a mock-up as whatever but you know it
i guess it I don't know did you guys get
fired up about this when you when you
heard I'm Taylor and I think we're in
the middle of a gtalk conversation when
this leak dropped yeah I was like oh and
I didn't really look at it I was like
galaxy s4 and just sent an email and
then I look back at it I'm like wow what
is that so I looked at it and saw note 2
without the ugly home button and the
first thing that came to mind was hey
they got rid of the home button right oh
yeah would you like like you and I have
both separately opined should happen to
yes yes yeah the bottom line is that we
still don't know what the galaxy s4 is
going to look like we've got some
screenshots out today I think indicating
maybe corroborating that this I scroll I
controlled scrolling is happening and I
have never been more disappointed to
have held off on an editorial in my life
by the way I was at mwc before any of
this stuff came out I was thinking of
this I was like oh we were playing with
AirPlay with the stylus you know the S
Pen on the Galaxy Note 8 and I'm like
you know the next move is just going to
be to eliminate the stylus altogether
and when you look at the bottom of the
screen it will scroll for your like
that'll be amazing are you guys amped
about about eyeball based scrolling or
does it freak you out like it like
Tony's losing sleep in Romania about
this he hates it he's gonna like leave
the planet it doesn't freak me out but I
just think it's extremely unintuitive
maybe I just my eyes jump around all the
time I'm a TD I don't want to scroll
with my eyes move well what if what if
though that it like establishes a target
zone it's only the bottom of the screen
maybe it's a point at the bottom of the
screen that you just focus on with your
eyes you just look at it and then that's
one of zeros gift to stare at it you
have to give it the stank out or
something promise because I mean because
it's like that's how it is a smart stay
I'm like if I glanced at the bottom of
the screen ass Scrolls down that's gonna
be annoying you know I don't yeah
totally yeah so I mean it's like the red
button you don't push the red button
right right but you don't look at that
part of the screen unless you want to
scroll but inevitably I'm gonna look at
that part of the screen because I know
something's there but it's not there you
know it's you don't think you'll be able
to train yourself not to look there and
tell you wanna scroll no I'll be
thinking in my head don't look don't
look don't look and then I'll look it's
gonna happen and even if you don't look
now you've just eliminated that part of
your screen so haven't you effectively
made yourself a smaller screen by not
what they're oh I can hear the debates
now it's going to be just like the on
screen android buttons like in the
comments like I love those 72 pixels
because of a stupid glancing oh I don't
have to be more than 72 yeah so how do
you click on something do you just stare
at it and then go cross-eyed you got a
double blank if you want to click on
something oh no is he like I think
here's the thing I'm so amped on this
because it's if you Joe you have a note
to Taylor you've used an ode to we've
all you as no choose you guys know what
I'm talking about with the S Pen when
it's an airplane mode and you just bring
it to the bottom of the browser winona
scrolls for you I'm gonna like that and
then I hate it too same thing you do why
cuz you put your you get your S Pen down
there and it Scrolls like you don't you
don't know how to track your your S Pen
you just close I'm fine on your head
spin I don't care what the galaxy s4 is
made of if it has eyeball based
scrolling i will use it for at least a
day even if it is the cheapest plastic
ever and just while we're there i want
to say that samsung finally responded to
this to all of us complaining that the
galaxy s3 feels really cheap by there
was an executive vice president YH Lee
spoke to cnet about why the company
chose to work with the materials it does
and apparently just to kind of
paraphrase Steven here even though
aesthetics absolutely matter to Samsung
manufacturing concerns play a large role
in its decisions about materials it's a
kind of about speed and efficiency and I
guess there's the samsung is saying that
they cannot produce enough hardware or
they can produce it fast enough if they
use metal phones if they use metal in
their phones rather and there is a lot
you can do
with plastics and Samsung makes some
points about it but I gotta tell you I
found this response to be needed but
very disappointing because it probably
means the galaxy s4 is going to feel
just like the s3 does which in my
opinion is very cheap the word you're
looking for here is lame there are lots
of other companies out there that are
doing stuff with plastic and and
non-metal backs covers whatever you want
to call them that's why I yep yeah they
feel good in the hand they look nice
they don't attract fingerprints they're
not slippery Motorola's even got there
Kevlar its Kevlar and it feels nice how
much more difficult would it be to use a
different finish on that plastic so that
that thing wasn't so slippery in a
fingerprint magnet and smudged all over
the place absolutely the hyper hyper
blaze has to go I think they have to
figure out a new finish they can use I
mean they were saying that battery door
on the s4 and on the note 2 is
polycarbonate I mean it's not you know
it's that special type of plastic we all
love when it's naked because it feels
different it feels cool but if they just
slap this hyper glaze coating on top of
it it's like oh wow yeah it's a
fingerprint magnet it's a grease pool
and it sucks day man yeah the the Nokia
article that I wrote yesterday or the
day before I actually wrote it on Monday
but in the comments they were talking
about how the galaxy s3 is polycarbonate
and I'm like oh my god yes of course
it's plastic but we all know what I'm
saying here why not oh no way to really
distinguish between the two it's not the
same yeah it's it's paper thin versus
you know hug aids of an inch thick yeah
while we're on the subject of phone
materials and just so that we don't
spend all that much time talking about
this this interview which I found
interesting but now we're done with Sony
Xperia Z Taylor you have it you unboxed
it tell us your feelings on this glass
then amazingly either beautiful or
boring phone I love it made it the
software is actually the part that I
thought I would hate the most about it
but it's actually not that bad if you
remove all the Samsung or not Samsung
Sony up and saying samsung for several
days now since I got
phone okay whenever to see yes I kept
calling at the xperia x yeah I've been
calling it everything but the experience
II but uh but that's software if you
remove all of Sony's widgets and and try
to just put your own widgets on there
like dash clock it's actually not that
bad I don't like the sony widgets at all
other than that the software is very
stock like you can change the accent
color but it's really very vanilla but
the hardware is probably the best thing
about the device and it's a beast at
benchmarks I was telling you about this
yesterday yeah it absolutely just
destroys benchmarks but it's actually a
little laggy and use yet a little in the
comments on the unboxing were calling
out like I saw these time codes like
seven minutes 23 lag was one that was
like lag 0 out of 10 not buying yeah one
bit of lag on a person like two out of
10 would not buy it's been it's not like
it lags a lot but it just stutters when
you're scrolling between screens sure um
but but like it's quadrant standard
score was 7800 versus the 4800 versus
4800 on the nexus for Jesus Thank same
CPU same GPU there's got to be something
going weird with the with the synthetic
benchmark sure so I don't know anything
about those things that's that's your
guys Department I mean as we were
talking to I think you and I don't like
him very much yeah I don't care for
benchmarks but I ran them just to see
because we have two devices with the
same course basically so yeah yeah so
what I ran it and it was very different
but the the actual design of the phone
is really nice yeah like i like it alot
i want to hear about that i kind of want
to hear about the hardware like I mean
I've handled it but I've handled it on a
tether surrounded by a bunch of people
pushing me and you know like how does
that side mounted button work for you I
mean the thing is like it it looks like
a potato bug landed on the side of the
thing oh the trade show that's the
that's the device that I was trying to
film when the guy like jerked it out of
my hand in the middle of a video are you
serious yeah nice it's some it was some
german dude he's just like started
yelling at me and german like it was in
the middle of a shot
anyway anyway um yeah it feels really
nice but in the hand it doesn't really
conform to the hand it's squared so it's
like a it's like a larger iphone
basically you know I know in a way it
doesn't it's really the hard edges kind
of make it odd to hold and the buttons
are impossible to touch or like press
without readjusting your grip the button
on the bottom of the screen no the the
button the power button the volume
rockers happens really yeah because the
side buttons really low isn't it yeah
the power button is you know like I uh I
just over halfway through halfway up the
edge of advice and the volume rockers
right below that so to get the power
button you have to readjust your grip
and to get into volume rocker you might
as well just use your other hand wait a
whole thing the volume rockers below the
power button on the right hand side yes
kind of sense does that make none none
whatsoever and all of the ports since it
is waterproof and dustproof all of the
ports are covers or are covered right
and then it's waterproof rating requires
those those covers those covers right
like it's not coated on the inside it's
not like a Liquipel thing it's it's a
gasket thing yep yes it's and the thing
is to plug it up you have to remove a
cover to do anything even to listen
music to plug in your headphones you're
gonna have to remove the cover yeah yeah
that's up cool but I didn't know
inductive charging in it so to charge it
you gotta remove a cover right and that
was my next point um there's no wireless
charging I actually messed up and said
there was but there's not it's actually
an add-on you can buy a case for it that
usual utilizes the prongs on the outside
of the case for for wireless charger
induction so I i want to i want to say i
think that the covers a lot of people
are making a big deal about the covers
and rightfully so because they're
they're annoying and whatever and on a
device like the droid DNA i think the
cover is kind of an excusable but on a
device that is as thin and and
relatively aesthetically pleasing as the
xperia z i think that i would be willing
to deal with the covers considering it's
waterproof I think that's I think it's r
it's always really cool when
device can withstand immersion I think
well the problem is that the covers are
hard to push back in all the way um I
found myself pushing it covers back in
and they don't go all the way in and
they'll just kind of slowly work their
way back out mm-hmm so there's that and
there's four of them so there's not just
one or two covers or four covers or
babysit although granted granted you're
not going to remove the micro SD card
slot that often or your SIM card but
there are four slots so it's yeah it's a
little excessive what do you think Joe
over there I feel like shows just being
over there just just like wondering what
what the order is he is all about no I
think it's beard again I found out what
that was i'm sorry i've got a collar on
my shirt that's brushing on the
microphone I thought I did that I tucked
it in so I look all geeky be glad this
isn't a video podcast the xperia z i
love it i did an article about the
Xperia Z versus the the new HTC and how
it's going to be an awesome fight to
watch I like what Sony is doing with you
know kind of push in their their builds
and whatnot into the AOSP to kind of
give it a nexus like experience I I hope
that comes eventually to the Xperia Z as
well in addition to the other experience
that are already there so we could have
a sony nexus phone essentially covers I
don't like covers at all in fact one of
the first things that I do with covers
is take an exacto to them and remove
them of course that means I'm not going
to be waterproof anymore and I can't do
that with a review phone so I'm not
recommending that Taylor but I hate them
I hate them I hate them I can I can live
without a headphone jack and just do
bluetooth audio I could live without you
know a power jack if you will if it had
wireless charging built in but it
doesn't so yeah that's kind of a I don't
like it thing for me yeah I don't
understand why they didn't include
wireless charging i would rather the
device be just a tad may be thicker or
taller or anything just to include
wireless charging because that would
make the
a world of difference absolutely after
having tried wireless charging I'm a
convert I've I've tried three different
wireless charging pads and with the
exception of the one for nokia which was
designed for their their Lumias i love
it i in fact I've got my nexus for the
unbroken one everybody i got a new nexus
4 you can stop asking hey it's sitting
on my energizer pad right now see
wirelessly charge this is the thing
about wireless charging this is the
thing that commenters generally don't
get and just people in general not
because they're stupid but because if
you don't use it if you've never used it
you don't understand the utility and we
actually have a piece of listener mail
later in the in the in the podcast about
this but if you have used it it's
something that is so difficult to give
up and I love it and the fact that i
have been using my droid DNA because we
haven't after the buzz of the droid DNA
going up i think tomorrow or today so
I've had this droid DNA courtesy of
verizon again and the fact that I've
been charging it manually because I
forgot it charges wirelessly is kind of
an excusable to me I just realized this
and I'm an idiot but I've been throwing
phones randomly on this nexus wireless
charger yes you see if they work yeah
just to see and she mean she is great
because it's an awesome standard I mean
like I throw my DNA on my nokia stuff I
throat on my JBL powered power up doc
you know I've it's it's I love standards
there so I keep I keep throwing the note
2 on it just just a pray it works
adventurous to hope yeah yeah well and
that Nexus your charger man just do a
mod it's real easy you won't spent five
hours in your kitchen with copper tape
all over your fingers just mad it a mine
all right all right let's talk software
let's talk let's talk let's give Joe a
chance here because I want to hear about
beautiful widgets I watched your video
Joe about the beautiful widgets update I
use HD widgets on one of those outlier
dudes who like apparently you know uses
the blue chip to buy beautiful women
apparently but apparently this is a
really awesome update and it's really
cool and a lot of people use beautiful
widgets so Joe just briefly talk about
it and tell us what you love so
beautiful widgets was a widget that came
around a long time ago as an answer to
the original HTC Sense widget
with the sense clock that had its
animating flip tiles on it and it was
just just beautiful apparently they
plagiarize them they copied their
artwork they included it in their widget
and eventually got banned from the store
and had to release a non-infringing
version which they did relatively
quickly levelup studio the deadest live
alone okay but they did the right thing
they released a new version that did not
infringe with crappy look in the artwork
and said trust us everything's going to
be okay and they built in a theming
engine where you can have themes and
skins for the clock for the weather and
for the battery all three separate and
independent from from various different
people when I highlighted some some Trek
themes in there with a name drop too
yeah but I've been using that I did go
over to HD widgets when beautiful would
just kind of got old and not really high
res II and then they dropped version 5
and it's amazing it's high resolution
though not necessarily high-definition
some of the themes haven't caught up yet
they have bigger widgets they have all
kinds of stuff and it's easy to set up
now which was the hard part from the
last version like crazy configuration
like the like that pie slice lon Trager
you think well not quite that crazy but
close okay so yeah it's it's nice it's
pretty it pulls in your your weather
forecasts and updates its using
accuweather right now after Google took
their weather api down their unofficial
weather api but i've never had a problem
with that it uses another service as
well right it gives you the option um
wasn't there I've got it right here I
hope not cuz I fit does and I missed
that entirely we're both look at that
yeah but yeah it uses gestures once
you're in the configuration to to
configure and whatnot so I like it a lot
it's it's a really really nice update
it's one of the things that I put on the
agenda back when they originally
released it's been out for at least a
few probably several weeks now but we
had a whole bunch of other a whole bunch
of other videos that had higher prior
this kind of got bumped down the road
whether yes weather underground you know
whether I love Weather Underground the
my thing is this joe i think that my
favorite part of this video was that you
made it at all because we're frequently
asked by commenters on videos what skin
were using and I think Joe you said
that's right in the article you're like
every time I post a video people are
asking me with widgets amusing it makes
a lot of sense to just whip up a video
and be like here's the launcher i'm
using and oh by the way it's awesome
yeah that's it's really cool um and
that's that's really why this video got
made was because our viewers and our
readers kept asking about it and it
would have been that we were answering
their questions in the comments of
course but we thought that if so many
people are asking this we'd be doing our
readers a disservice if we didn't give
it the full you know all the attention
and give it a full video or at least an
article so we did that even though we're
a little bit late and showing it other
stuff had higher priority and my hats
off to level up studios they've done
amazing work and continue to do so yeah
i love the notification if they now have
an expanded notification i touched on
that and one of the videos i did a few
weeks ago about the five apps that make
android feel a little more modern and
the weather notification from beautiful
widgets is fantastic yes yes i didn't
show that off in the video but yes
you're absolutely right do we know
what's next cuz i know its next I know
what I want to talk about and it's not
in the rundown I want to talk really
quickly about whether chose pebble has
shipped yet Joe is wearing his pedal on
his watch here on his wrist right now
welcome to the class yes so we know just
to clear it up so Joe I got my pebble
first Joe apparently has just got his
that's awesome and Taylor I didn't know
this until like yesterday but Taylor's
also a Kickstarter back over the pebble
smartwatch so you are waiting on yours
Taylor you haven't got your email
notification yet right nothing okay oh
not a peep so the first thing i did when
i received this pebble smartwatch which
i saved something like eighty dollars on
by ordering through kickstarter instead
of waiting was it was to pay for yours I
like 80 or 90 bucks I was
one of the 119 people so I got in a
little after you okay and what that made
115 uh-uh well what what happened was
it's okay guy your left you don't have
to feel wrestle you didn't have to feel
bad about it because I immediately in a
game it all of those money savings by
going out and buying a new band for it
so the silicone band that comes with it
is pretty cool but I was like you know
what no I've been wearing a citizen
Stars and Stripes for years and it has a
big thick chunky metal band and I wanted
that so I found a black metal band that
has it's like PVD finish on it so it's
kind of Matt and it is just what a
splendid watch I am having so much fun
with it right after we get off the
podcast I have to cut together in my
video and that'll go up later today so
if you're listening to podcast you want
to see a video about what life on pebble
is like you should watch it this is
going to be awesome and then Joe I
believe you have a video coming up what
next week later this week about it yes I
do in a couple days I'm going to have
about three four days use of the watch
on my wrist and it's got some
shortcomings so the title of the video
is going to be something around five or
so things that the pebble smartwatch is
missing oh okay so you're coming at it
from the opposite side nice the opposite
direction yeah nice yeah i've been using
as i've been using it up and I've been
wishing for certain things like it like
maybe it had a mic interface or maybe it
had a you know an annunciator speaker
like like not just the vibrate and stuff
but you know it's so funny like but I
think by limiting itself to only the
things it can do very well it makes it
makes it a really excellent product
instead of overreaching and trying to be
something it's not like trying to be a
full smart watch on your wrist which the
I'm watch does and I think that thing is
just a total POS the funny thing is
everybody that I've handed the watch
student said here take a look at it and
then I've sent an email or whatnot they
try and scroll the email with touch by
swinging the email up or down in two
rounds up like no it has buttons to
watch I'm also going to do a video on
what a pebble Kickstarter backer is
missing in his time watch and it's it's
like it's just gonna be you with like a
naked wrist yeah just staring angrily at
the camera for five minutes
blinking yes get a sharp one draw one
yeah yeah hey I've got the wristband the
sweatband from the press conference oh
yeah yeah I have a pebble sweatband well
let's we're going to talk more about
pebble next week when our videos are up
and we'll be able to bounce some ideas
around and it'll be fun what well we
close out Android here let's before we
go out on that one Michael yeah yeah uh
can you throw a link to that that
wristband in there for all of us pebble
people who want to upgrade our pebble
respect which is the risk end yeah I
should have thought that actually that's
a good idea Joe I've been asked on
Twitter just left and right all to all
the time about where I got this watch
man and even though i've posted the link
now twice i still get questions so i
will i mean i've already seen that link
because I follow you on twitter so i
know exactly where it is but for
everyone who hasn't no no no absolutely
i wanna i agree i should do that and so
Michael Fisher and I have an unofficial
contest competition going on but you
four thousand followers on Twitter and
I'm just coming up on three thousand we
need to fix that so if you're not
following me I'm at Joe Levi on Twitter
Wow if you're following Michael I'm will
scalp his people so stop Wow shameless
shameless if Joe Lee by redefining the
shameless plug ladies Josh shapes plug
and by the way download my apps Taylor
you want to get in on this you know
we're gonna say the twitter handles at
the end of the episode anyway but you
know yeah i'm not in this competition
but i'm at somewhere around 2,000
followers follow me at casper tech good
because I'm better than both of them
yeah yeah twitter at twitter can we know
mr. twitter can we know about the about
castleton can i ask you about that cuz i
meant to ask you about that in your
intro um okay sure yeah it can we come
we can I just like what was the origin
of Casper tech I mean you're you're pale
dude is that where it started yes um my
friend passed away late last year he's
the one who gave me the nickname he was
in a band he was yeah he was a band mate
and it was a band of straight edge
vegans and on their myspace page it was
a trial that I went to they said you
know please respect our views you know
don't make fun of us for what we believe
in and so on and so forth and I showed
up with chick-fil-a for everyone oh
that's just my humor that's who I am and
that's that's how I broke the ice and
the I don't remember exactly how it got
around to it but the the response was
them making fun of me for being pale
right because I didn't really have any
beliefs that they could make fun of so
so yeah that Casper just stuck and
through tech on the end because well I'm
everyone's tech guy around here so sure
so is that it did you ever I mean so
this is only a year ago you were still
at phoneDog so like it was never
something that you took independent you
never like had a website for example
that was like your own thing called
Casper tech right it's just always a
name you've associated with yourself
personally yeah it's kind of weird
synonymous with me but um yeah actually
I found out a couple days ago that
Casper tech is a manufacturer in an
Asian country maybe China I can't
remember exactly which what and yeah
they have like a DVD player or something
so there's that I use it I couldn't buy
the URL the domain was was taken and I
didn't know why I thought somebody was
just squatting there's nothing at casper
techcom so they are squatting
technically okay but it sits for a
company so it's a comedy just reserving
it's funny because there is a there's a
nascent like carcass of a van idea
called captain two phones on facebook
and it's mine it's when I was going to
do something independent before before I
came aboard with now and I never
got anywhere I just like I just wanted
the facebook you know I just wanted to
hold down the facebook site so i kind of
just threw a stupid picture myself up on
there and i was like coming soon or
whatever and then i forgot it existed
and I think about like two weeks ago I
got a notification on Facebook that's
like someone liked your page captain two
phones no like what and I kind of a page
like what and i go find this like a year
year and a half old page
it has like five likes and they must be
and I was a change the about description
to say like if you like this page you
are the most awesome super hardcore fan
ever because I forgot it existed thank
you for your like there it will never be
anything posted here but thank you so
much it is very funny the names that we
kind of come by Joe to you of a nickname
my software house is called muckle look
at software is that a real whiz that is
that like a Utah Native American word or
what's going this the story behind that
my mother is 85 years old bless her
heart and she was an elementary school
teacher for 33 years and my brother and
I whenever we've get in trouble she'd
always yell at us and call us the wrong
name and so she she eventually just
adopted at one universal generic
nickname and that was pedro month
Luckett that she got from her mother and
so I I just went with you just know it
it you took it for a title and there
there it is I I am muckle nukka that's
been my xbox gamertag and I decided hey
you know it's something that that I can
use for android app development whatnot
so there you go i'm a muckle much this
is awesome uncle nugget all right
speaking of andhra we have to close out
this category move on because we're
gonna we're going to lose the morning we
need to very briefly Joe answer a
question for me is a bunch of fun really
based on cyanogenmod yes and no all
right moving on to windows the abuse new
people canonical they they used an awful
lot of libraries and code check-ins from
the cyanogenmod repository which is
ironic because cyanogen is based on AOSP
so everyone was wondering why they
didn't why canonical didn't go straight
to a sop and get the code and there are
two schools of thought one is why
reinvent the wheel when cyanogenmod has
already done the work and extended
what's in AOSP so they're just being
efficient with their code which yeah I
know no problem with that from from my
end the other thought is they needed to
get
proof of concept phones out there and
because the the Google Nexus phones were
the easiest ones to develop for and
cyanogenmod had done a lot of the work
extending the code to work with those
they borrowed from and give proper
credit for it out I'll follow up with
that but since they'd already done all
that work and put it in there some
people believe that Ubuntu the blue
phone project used cyanogenmod just to
bootstrap the project and get them out
onto devices so they could do proof of
concept and the code may or may not
persist as they go forward with either
their own hardware or other devices but
I think there will always be cyanogenmod
influence in ubuntu foam and this is a
question that you bring up in your piece
like can ubuntu as a result kind of run
android apps and the short answer to
that is a no not in its current state
because they stripped out all of the
dalvik VM and all the libraries and all
the stuff that would be needed to run
android apps but the possibility for
putting that back in is there so you
could do a BlueStacks type thing on your
boon to phone and be able to use your
android apps there it's close enough i
mean it's closer to linux and then
windows is but we can run android apps
on windows using BlueStacks so it's
possible they just took that out
specifically and deliberately and
probably because they want to develop
their own ecosystem their own
environment right because why why go the
route that's practical and simpler when
you can sweat it out in the trenches for
four years and maybe eventually fail
they don't care then they don't need to
care because they've got an itch that
nobody else is filling that they're
going to be able to fill that in with
you know as we mentioned earlier with
security with encryption with extra
stuff that Android just doesn't care
about Google doesn't care about even
encrypted email because if you encrypt
your email they can't go in and spider
it for you know all their keywords and
advertise to you sure Ubuntu's got an
itch and I think they'll do really well
in it what's up there was uh well
and in terms of windows home that's who
you're talking about correct I care
Microsoft there and in terms of sitting
in a trench for four years and not
succeeding oh I was I was kind of
talking about any any new platform that
comes out and says okay I'm gonna build
our own app system which is I think
Noble and really cool but it yeah it's
very difficult obviously I was being a
little cynical good all right well I was
gonna be all solid so we can move on oh
ok i lost the conversation there for a
bit that's okay that's that's totally
fine well it's good because it's time
for us to move into Windows Phone and we
need to talk a little bit about Taylor's
views on how Nokia can can build the
next Lumia flagship device and this is
cool because I think this is a piece
that we've kind of talked about mmm over
and over like we've talked about the
core of this thing like what does nokia
need to do next and we thought we were
going to see the answer to that at mwc
and i'm still kind of a little
disappointed that we didn't but not
necessarily surprised but we've got some
some interesting suggestions here from
from taylor and i want to just run
through them very quickly because i
completely agree that the slimmer
profile and a metal chassis is is
awesome that a true PureView camera is
something we've been crying about
forever and that needs to happen kind of
regardless of the weight penalty but
what about the 5-inch 1080p display
Taylor what's why will consider this a
requirement for 2013 um well okay so if
you read through that it says that you
don't necessarily need 1080p nobody does
it's above and beyond what anybody needs
and it's wasted energy so you don't
necessarily need 1080p and windows phone
doesn't support it anyway so Microsoft
doesn't add it then you can throw that
dream of a 1080p nokia windows phone out
the window but they're going to add it I
mean they they have eventually they have
to end and that's just kind of the point
for relevancy that's why Nokia needs to
do it to be pushing the envelope with
Microsoft yeah you know i mean if if you
have a 1080p and 720p and a WVGA
offering on android then you know
windows will needs to meet that
okay at least to be relevant and
comparable yeah all levels windows one
doesn't need the the hassle of having to
apologize for something like it doesn't
windows phone does not need any more
challenges to its adoption even if it is
just suspect people shopping the shelves
i'm looking at spec cards and being like
a hose is 720p that's man i can have
your size the size is the real issue for
me and I'm after using the DNA and even
the nexus 7 the there are a lot of
Windows phones that are just too small
um the Lumia 920 is what 4.5 inches it
is here yeah so it feels small but the
phone itself is really big so you have
more bezel to screen than I guess
standard smartphones yeah it does every
other substantial bezel so I mean you're
basically I think you're your point
which is a good one is that Windows
Phone needs to do exactly what the other
platforms are doing which is increased
screen size while reducing bezel size
and not necessarily building a larger
device and keeping up with with spit
with its bec wise on the display front
right yeah you just said that a lot more
elegantly what I love is that you're
like two of your conclusions are
directly at odds with each other which I
always love throwing in my editorials
because I'm like yep i'm having a pipe
dream and welcome everyone because
you've got slimmer profile metal chassis
and then you've got true PureView camera
so it's like I I really hope that Nokia
is able to find a way to to minimize the
PureView components but I don't think
they can I think they're butting up
against physics there at some point yeah
and and there's a few lines in there
that kind of explain that either I
battery covered your butt very well yes
yeah I've learned to do that over the
years but uh like for the battery I said
there is however at least one excuse to
make the next Lumia flagship another
heavyweight smart phone and battery for
solutely down and we've all talked about
that how we would rather trade you know
extreme thinness for a large battery I
would seven out of there ten out of ten
times absolutely and you know I think
it's important that we have that the
next Lumia be a heavy phone so that this
very valuable discussion can keep being
had in the comments where we say
something like this is a heavier phone
than some others and then
120 thousand people say workout Susi
pretty much moves together with 83
hate-filled comments on that one yeah of
course there were so I've got a question
on the battery just to throw it out
there do you think that Nokia who's
throwing quite a bit of weight behind
that she wireless charging standard
might be fighting the we need bigger
batteries argument with the why don't we
just have ubiquitous wireless charging
everywhere yes if they could make that a
little more marketable I mean not
everyone has a table for like a dinner
table with wireless charging built-in
they had those at the the press event
which I mistakenly said Michael is that
he was not he was there in spirit rather
than saying hey we need to get bigger
batteries if if Nokia and and whoever
else makes a successful push for well
just go to McDonald's and you know
they've got wireless chargers in their
tables or go to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and
they've if they still exist in a week
they've got wireless charging in their
couches or go on the bus they've got
wireless charging so you don't need a
big battery we can make smaller phones
because look wireless charging is all
around you it's it's ubiquitous the
problem with that is that we still have
these two competing standards which is
so stupid I mean she is up very
obviously to me she is the future they
have they have agreements with so many
companies they're in so many phones
already and then you have these other
Joker's not to you know maybe I'm being
too flipping I don't mean to say that I
mean anybody that's trying to make a
wireless charging standard is worthy of
our respect but I think that who is it
Duracell that does the powermat stuff
yeah yeah so you have power about kind
of over here d and they're still using a
different standard right it's they're
incompatible with with chi am I am I
correct that is correct yeah and I guess
copy you know competition is good and
but and the irony behind that go get us
far good the irony behind that is Google
supports the non Qi standard they are a
factor of not Chi and I think that is
the powermat standard but it's ironic
that LG has chetan it
because it's an optimist g essentially
and the optimus G supports Chi and there
you go and now the Google flagship has a
wireless charging standard built into it
that they are not a backer of but now do
you think do you think that's evidence
of like corporate fool headed full
hardiness or do you think that they're
doing that or just stimulate the
competition or some some other like you
know Machiavellian Google scheme I have
to imagine that Google is supporting the
standard that they think is more
technologically superior and or has a
better chance of succeeding right LG
made a different decision based on that
same how that same question when it was
presented to them and we'll just it was
kind of caught in the crossfire when
their next Nexus partner was supporting
a different standard than they were and
they said well okay let's fly with it
and and we'll just go ahead and run with
it and not disable it luckily they
didn't disable it in the phone so can
you like can you help me out here and
and both of you guys like what is Chi in
smartphone why's she is in the droid DNA
it's in all the it's in the Lumia
devices that have wireless charging
ability that's that's Chi it's in the
galaxy s3 cover right that's a that's a
cheese standard the new wireless
charging ability in there and a galaxy
note 2 what else is I'd seen the nexus 4
yep the LG optimus G uh what else are we
missing I mean there are other ones like
their third verizon phones that oh the
the 8x the HTC 8x on verizon has it and
that's chi i mean like these are all
like high-profile products yeah from big
manufacturers that are selling in a lot
of numbers i don't see how a nan Chi
standard can survive if I were gonna put
my money behind the standard I right now
I would put a pine tree yeah me too
that's where I go and that's where i
have i've bought three separate chargers
now wait are they all nexus for charges
are they all plates no I've got an
energizer charger the single bay that i
showed on video I've got the nokia
charger that i showed in another video
and then I've got the nexus 4 charger
and spoiler alert the nexus 4 charger is
better than all of them hands down god I
love that it's so amazing i love it even
if your phone does not have wireless
charging built into it by that thing
just
you can put your phone on it too to have
it at a nice beautiful angle where it's
always in reach and ready to go yes it's
that good I want to I want a fat boy for
my car though one of those pillows yeah
yeah there's a great to somebody tweeted
a picture at mwc of a of a samsung
employee passed out on one of the fat
boy pillows in the nokia boom yes
awesome if any of you are crafty out
there that fat boy pillow is just a
pillow wrapped around the standard nokia
charger it's exactly the same innards
just with a different packaging the big
old pillow on a big old pillow on it so
you can make your own so we have a least
something cool here even speaking of
Lumias the Lumia 920 it appears to have
an update coming out with which allows
for color adjustment neither of you can
I don't think either of you of it I've
been Lumia 920 so that's going to fall
to me to install when it finally drops
but it looks like it has cash clearing
controls and some additional display
calibration settings which i think the
920 sort of desperately needs not
because it's a bad screen but because it
has that polarizing filter which kind of
takes some of the joy out of using it
and you apparently you can amp up the
color saturation or reduce it and you
can change the color temperature as well
which is pretty cool and it looks like
they've got a cool little test pattern
where you can see just it's like it's
like adjusting the saturation on a
galaxy s3 except it's cooler looking but
this is it's in beta it is the 1308
firmware and it is apparently surfaced
on the Nokia care sweet so if you have a
920 you should go read Stephen shank
story about that from March fifth and
I'm excited about it what yeah it looks
really nice yeah I'm exam it really
excited about windows blue I'm excited
about more stuff by the way I know we
stopped talking about the pebble but
pebble is yet another reason why i'm not
using one on 24 a while i've been stuck
on my galaxy note 2 for like two weeks
because i've had to use i had use it for
the show and now i have to use it for
pebble because pebble doesn't have a
windows phone tap out oh my no mm-hmm no
it's like fun to get spotify on windows
phone and then the pebble comes in with
god I can't
and then there's another app that I
can't use on Windows Phone but nokia is
looking to change that this closes our
windows phone category and this is one
of the coolest moves i've ever seen
nokia make so we all know windows phone
doesn't support Instagram we've
complained about it on the podcast we
complained about in editorials and then
commenters say what's the point of
Instagram and then we have a big fight
but Instagram is important it has 100
million active users over a hundred
million and Windows Phone needs it
desperately but instagram has kind of
stubbornly refused to acknowledge its
existence and so nokia has it has
packaged this app for lumia smartphones
called hashtag to insta with love and
what it does is it allows you to take a
photo put a filter on it and immediately
share it to your social networks and it
automatically appends this hashtag so
what Nokia is trying to do is get
instagrams attention through sheer force
of like Windows Phone fanboy you know
volume and I think it's a brilliant move
what do you guys think about this I hate
Instagram so there's that get out of my
podcast my point is F fault for so long
for better cameras and then the most
popular photo-sharing application for
mobile completely ruins that doesn't
crop down to 6 12 mi sook stove it's 500
x 500 isn't it 6 12 06 12 thank you all
right you it doesn't make them it
doesn't ruin them it makes them
different it makes them artificially
artsy uh but they're still all right
right we've had debated over and over
but uh so that's interesting I didn't
know that about you Taylor it's good
it's good to have a diverse range of
opinions stop talking now Joe so
technical stuff aside I'm not going to
say whether I agree or disagree with
Taylor because I want to come back on a
future episode of podcast it's the whole
social sharing aspect that really is the
go to feature in Instagram and what more
do you need to say if you want
information about any particular topic
subject person place or thing
instagram lets you immediately tag that
and share it all over the place and you
can get information about that person
place thing whatever right there in an
app and it looks nice filters
notwithstanding all right now so yeah
how do you think about nokia's monkeys
move here I mean I think it's brilliant
I think it's absolutely wonderful there
they're saying hey there's they're not
thumbing their nose at Instagram but
they're they're kind of jab and I'm
saying hey if you don't do this we were
going to and we're going to show you
that there's a way to do it so yeah
there's a demand I find it fascinating
that that instagram has remained
steadfast and it's kind of silence on
the issue unless there's something I've
missed and I don't think I have you know
in especially now that it's not just
this small start-up it's owned by
Facebook it got a ridiculous amount of
money thrown at it to be bought by
Facebook and I guess well wait it hasn't
cleared yet right or we still waiting
for a DOJ clearance or something like
that are they officially integrated I
don't know I think it's a done deal but
I could be wrong I could be too i don't
want to look it up because my keyboards
very noisy but in any case i would think
at this point that Instagram would've at
least come out and said yes we're we're
planning something for windows phone but
maybe we'll go ahead too originally they
didn't even want to develop 480 they
didn't even know that's right yeah
because they were on iOS only forever
and then when they finally did come to
Android Tony assigned to me the
editorial it's like what's the big deal
on Instagram on Android and I'm like
okay whatever I'll check this out and
then I immediately found out I loved it
for about about a year and a half maybe
two years and then for the last I don't
know the last probably eight or nine
months that i used it i didn't use
filters and i only really used it to
share to twitter and facebook i never
checked instagram so i'd take a picture
posted to instagram and make it post a
twitter and facebook together so what
what i ended up doing was setting up an
if this then that or if this then that
trigger mm-hmm where if i post a picture
to facebook it automatically posts a pic
twitter picture to twitter but it takes
that picture uploads it to Twitter and
then post the texts so you miss you so
so you you you fundamentally
misunderstood
misused greatest inventions of our time
I understand okay the only thing that
would take me back to to Instagram is
posting to Google+ Oh God ah google+
group less you guys go hangout on
Google+ yeah we'll take all the cool
kids with us and we'll hangout on
Google+ and for it you can stay I don't
know what do you want are you on my face
still yeah I'm on Friendster still it's
um google+ page updates profile page
updates just rolled out there actually
pretty nice it's awesome stir a little
plug there and go check out Taylor's
Google+ page go hang out in the white
space clientele has a google there's
probably no jobs have a Google+ page
it's very nice there's not as much white
space know what that might be V the
chrome extension i'm using I don't know
man i'm falling asleep iOS guys would
you believe it there's new iphone 5s
ipad mini 2 and ipad 5 rumors are you
are you aware of this there are rumors
about apple products they're coming out
with more stuff i thought they were done
no yeah like that huh there's an onion
headline from like a decade ago it's
like dell reaches goal of being world's
largest company shuts down well we
reached it we're packing up shop no um
the iphone 5s is still the rumored brand
name for this new product it would make
sense i mean you know 3gs 4s 5s so so
the iphone 5s that's just like the
iphone 5 but with siri right because
this just for esman Siri right well
embedded journals didn't s what better
internals in a better camera to write
before well uh was it Phil Schiller I
think Phil Schiller said that s &amp;amp; 4 S
stands for dead literally estimates area
oh yeah yeah and I think s 4 3gs meant
speed if i'm not mistaken yes it's yes
and remember what they couldn't decide
whether to capitalize the s or not like
it was it was a whole lot of when nobody
knew had a set us a iphone 3gs um this
is
just pronounced if the iphone 3 cos the
iphone 3gs it's like every time I roll
up to an edit and NEC booth I'm like oh
yes I forgot you own you've got the
casio partnership why do you pronounce
that again geez geez one kiss cos own
and they always tell me and I always
forget um you know that I just wanna
make fun of it I do i do but no it's no
it's legit is that part of the same part
of my brain that can't pronounce ubuntu
correctly oh yes i get so much crap over
that because i say you bun too yeah me
and i say it phonetically i say it how
Google Translate pronounces it yeah that
is just how I've been saying it for
probably I don't know eight years I
don't know yeah and um yes I get so much
crap over that I know how to pronounce
it ubuntu but i don't i say you've onto
because if i try to say ubuntu over and
over and over through video i'm going to
switch back and forth and that's just
awful so i just say you bunt to and
watch people cringe yeah the last thing
i want to touch on today in the apple
category here is that this low-cost out
god i'm so tired of low-cost iphone
rumors but that's what old models are i
know is if it but i think we would talk
about this pretty often but you know i
think apple is under a lot of pressure
to continue its its growth and obviously
it's living the story of pretty much
every major company that has seen
astronomical growth and it's like they
can't really make you can't maintain
that forever otherwise you're just with
you you can only own so much of the
market you can only own so much the
planet and then it just becomes this
horrible tale of woe but the thing that
is interesting to me about the rumor is
that whether it's this low-cost iPhone
or this iphone 5s I think it's a
low-cost when they're talking about
talking about making it out a fiber
fiberglass which is fascinating you
can't anodized fiberglass I mean let
actually why hasn't someone done that
before but why use fiberglass and in a
production smartphone maybe maybe
somebody has and we just don't know
about it thing is I grew up on boats and
so I I know I know about fiberglass and
i know i'm just picturing the first time
somebody like accidentally breaks their
phone open
and like tries to pick it up and they
get those fiberglass others in their
hands demand for a week oh god they give
it it like that welt the other the red
down yeah Oh fiberglass is just a little
itchy yeah yeah but when it's not busted
up and you don't have splinters in your
fingers fiberglass is awesome well yeah
I guess that's true yeah and like so
like you drop your phone you get it all
scuffed up what do you take it to like
the marine store and like get some gel
coat spit on it just auto body shop yet
oh you would just take more fiberglass
and and wrap it around it and sand it
down and yeah we know man there's gonna
be like so much sales of bondo sales or
just approve your surf shops gonna have
an entirely new business line and put
some sex wax on our phone God the friend
named confused me as a child so much
let's looks can we can we close it out
here I think we did we've talked a
little bit about we've talked enough
about Ubuntu that I kind of want to skip
over that topic for maybe leave it for
another day is that alright with you
Taylor fine by me all right unless I
just want to say that ipad mini 2 better
have a Retina display Oh complete I
completely agree but they were talking
about how much how much the price would
increase because it's people means there
is no Retina display at that size that's
an insanely that would be a really dense
display for a tablet it would be
stupidly dense and but the thing is
people would still buy it because I
think now the ipad mini when it and it
launched it didn't launch and do
necessarily have a proven space in
tablets i know that we were all loving
the 7-inch form factor in the nexus 7
but i don't think and and the kindle
fire had sold a lot of numbers but i
wouldn't say that i wouldn't say that
was completely tamed yet right i think
people were still normal folks i was
worse i was bashing 7-inch tablets at
the time were you really yeah I hated
them and then I fell in love with the
nexus 7 after using it for a while
absolutely i got a nexus 7 right after I
oh yeah I got the IO edition Nexus 7
foot one yeah well it's white and pink
oh it is yeah what is that Nexus 7's I
got a red case for it and the suede the
diana suede just I guess got sucked into
the white cases are not your friend
not on the nexus 7 or not you mean it's
it's custom yeah right well so i think
the the ipad mini 2 can they can kind of
charge whatever they want for now that
the ipad mini and other tablets have
helped cement 7-inch 7 and 8 inches as
the as a legitimate category and
recognizing that i paid 600 for mine
because I got you know 32 gigabytes in
32 gigs and it's on my verizon line oh
it's a 3gs now yeah yeah it's an LTE one
so it was 5 530 I believe or 555 I don't
know it was six hundred dollars roughly
if I were still amped on iOS like I
actually said I was sitting with my
roommates last night we were trying to
figure out when we were going to take a
trip together and I was trying to access
google calendar and I didn't have the
calendar app installed or something on
my iPad and I was like trying to do it
through the web interface and I was like
finally after like two minutes I was
like screw this i'm just and I put down
my my iPad and I went and got my Nexus 7
and I was instantly happier so until I
until iOS reclaims my love I'm not going
to be terribly interested in a I've had
many but if the rumors were hearing
about the iOS reinvention are at all
true and at all timely then it'll be fun
to to give it a shot I actually spending
a week with Tony and watching him love
his iphone i kind of want want one now
just to just see what's up that paints a
really awkward picture yeah well not as
awkward as wendy and i were both
carrying note tues and in MVC and like
it's like hey tony i just took this
picture you wanna bump phones yes but
let's move on yeah um actually there are
two things that I would love to see out
of the next Nexus tablet or seven-inch
Nexus tablet if there will be another
and that's high resolution display but
actual LTE connectivity what in that
that kind of kills it because it won't
be carrier device them but it's a tablet
so it's not like a smartphone are you
talking I'm sorry you try my nexus 7
follow-up yeah oh that's the one reason
I didn't go with a nexus 7 hspa+ and
it's because one I don't want hspa+ I
want to see if I can get it and the
display on the Nexus 7 is
notable noticeably worse than the ipad
mini display well I mean in terms of
saturation but not in terms of
resolution right in terms of resolution
yes no it's what isn't the pixel density
higher on the nexus 7 that it is in the
ipad mini I don't think so let me look
it up I remember the nexus 7 ppi is uh
what is it 216 it looks like sounds
right yeah yeah it's to 16 and then what
is it on the ipad mini 2 16 and a half
for the ipad mini it is it's 189 yeah
it's 189 know it so it's 163 163 162 so
it's lower yeah but it doesn't look as
bad yeah it does i think it looks worse
than nexus 7 but anyway but just goes to
show everybody sees screens differently
to me the nexus 7 la is just fine it
looks nice I'm still watching caprica
guys and it looks beautiful on that
thing I gotta take a different path from
Taylor though I don't want anything
other than Wi-Fi on my tablet yeah I
want I want to have just a Wi-Fi tablet
and let me tell you whatever smartphone
I want so that that way yeah I was going
to ask a tail runner to tether exactly
Joe I'm in the same boat yeah I used to
tether money well I used to tether all
the time and I got tired of carrying two
smartphones I have two lines I've got to
pay for it one way or another mm-hmm so
I might as well put a tablet on there
because I'm tired of carrying two phones
everywhere so you don't want to become a
tour to fans no I've been I was I was
commander three or four phones at one
point so I've consolidated that gun
balloon guy he's still like lieutenant
tops and some notes Errol you know as
the general it would be a lot easier to
be to be a multiple phones carrier if
holsters were still in style in fashion
man yeah I don't have enough
that's gonna be my next TL DR I'm
talking about holsters I'm not wearing
mine anymore so there's some some heat
for you if I step dad ordered one and
he's like so holsters are still cool
right oh you're like sure what pistol do
you have we're talking phones and no
they're not no there oh um let's see
let's jump into listener mail unless you
the rabbit's up on Taylor no I was just
going to say that I've actually been
really happy with having LTE on my iPad
I mean I've carried tablets for four
years now I had tablets before the iPad
and it's just not the same having Wi-Fi
and having that tether every time you
want to use it as it is just picking it
up in it working as much as I use the
iPad having it connected as much more
efficient all right so I guess I can
totally see that point and I think I see
why this would be the last thing I say
about it i think i see why i prefer
tethering and it's it has less to do
with convenience it does have something
to do with billing streamlining but it
has less to do with that even than it
does in actually having more gadgets I
like having more gadgets and I
especially like gadgets that talk to
each other maybe it's because I liked
dr. Crusher's medical tricorder or
something you know it's a peripheral but
no I like it when I i have my tablet no
you know what it's stretches all the way
back to a 2003 when sprint was going to
release a sony ericsson t6o 8 and the
reason that was significant was because
it had bluetooth and no other phones in
the lineup had bluetooth and the guy
that now runs phone news.com christopher
price was like a frequent contributor
and he was just so completely amped on
this idea of carrying his Palm Pilot
around his Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled
palm pilot and keeping his t 608 in his
pocket and browsing from the Palm Pilot
because of its bigger screen to a better
web browser and internet tethering for
me is right but in 2003 right that was
like the pipe dream so I think that
infected kind of all of us on the sprint
users forum or howardforums wherever the
hell it was and III still to this day
really like the idea of keeping my phone
in my pocket and having a peripheral
talk through it to the network so that
whether that's a tablet or a pebble you
know I think that's pretty cool I've
always been a fan of the personal area
network idea you know yeah i agree i
like it but on a device that i use just
non-stop having it tethered all day is
not a good idea at least in terms of
longevity so now i have a phone that
lasts most the day in a tablet of the
last two days and i can connect it
whenever that that's my big thing is i
use it literally three four hours
a when I'm not shooting video for 12
hours but I right but but yeah I've been
really happy with us before uh let's
move on to listener mail and then we've
got to wrap it up because I've got some
some video to shoot and soda your tailor
and Joe you've got to get to work at
some point here well yeah and I've got
an article that has to be written today
too I thought that you might be writing
something again today to all right good
so let's jump into our two remaining
pieces listener mail the first is from a
guy named King which I like hate
pocketnow people i love your podcast
listen to it every week thank you for
listening I want to know pocket mouse
thoughts untrue wireless charging I love
talking about wireless charging I bet
it's far away in the future to we're
able to have a device transmitting
electricity that charges a phone or
something but what if wireless chargers
today have internal batteries that way
we can move around freely and just
charge them like every week it have a
huge capacity battery yeah I would have
to so like a portable charger but
wireless and keep up the good work guys
thank you king so this is an interesting
idea what you carry around a boom box
with like a wireless charging pad on top
of it right that's kind of the idea I
don't see why something like that I have
the peak 6000 I have two of those and I
use them religiously what is that it is
a six thousand million power battery
pack okay charges iPhones through you
through the 30 pin and through micro USB
yeah yeah so this is something like that
accepted wireless well yeah why wouldn't
it be able to you can fit wireless into
that I'm right but i think what wireless
charging is still somewhat less
efficient so i think you would probably
lose some some power through through
heat and you know through through the
added yeah there is a step down like on
the nexus charger hot wireless charger
for the nexus i think it receives 1.8
amps and then puts out at one amp right
so there's definitely a step down there
yea though i guess there that makes it
practical right initiate that for
convenience to right yeah I I guess but
how don't have to carry around this
device and then charge your phone on top
of it versus having to plug it in yeah
like I think that's the thing i don't
think it necessarily solves a problem
like i would rather just if it comes
down to it i'd rather
a light pocketable corded AC adapter as
opposed to like a car battery with a
wireless charging plate on top yeah but
I think what he's after is like
legitimate wireless charging where you
can charge six inches away or what it
sounds like he's saying is across the
house that's the round thing yeah you
mentioned that it up front but you know
and he says this will be a far away in
the future and yet hopefully not but
aren't their televisions that are
wireless what I think so their wireless
televisions the the power adapter is you
plug the power adapter in the wall and
with if it's a within I think like a
foot it'll charge your television it
will give you a television power and you
can just you don't have cables it's just
that science fiction yeah but what that
can pretty sure it is I'm having visions
of like the house parakeet like flying
between the beam like jacket in gray /
or Jar Jar sticking his tongue between
oh yeah yeah don't worry he'll only do
it once I remember like all the pipe
dreams about the galaxy s3 like when
people were doing the the feature
speculation back last year and a groomer
that gained a lot of traction was that
the galaxy s3 was going to have across
the room wireless charging and if I had
had a little more sense back then I
would have said like everyone you need
to chill out this is not happening
because that of science fiction's like
cray but I still think I don't know I
Taylor if you can find that link to the
TV I would love to see that I'd be it
still though you're talking about a foot
right you're not talking about across
the room yeah you're not talking about
across the room but it's yeah so here's
I i think my point of view on this
question is the convenience of wireless
charging is not that kind of convenience
it's not a portability enhancer it is a
convenience enhancer in that you don't
have to fumble with the stupid wire they
have to pick up off the floor and remove
a flap aside and plug a cable in you
just drop it on the touchdown and you're
done so that's that's what I think the
thrust of wireless charging is and
that's its value proposition and King I
think it would be cool to have a piece
of technology like the one you described
I don't see it necessarily
opening or if it happens I don't see it
selling very very widely so my two bits
on that we've already got all this
wireless energy flowing all around us
all the time whether we want to call
that HSPA or edge or LTE or Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth all it is is energy flowing
through the air can we receive that and
turn it into a usable electricity source
probably not without a really big
antenna you know we've already seen the
coil that you need to further the Qi
charger and it's it's pretty darn couple
inches around so there's that can we
harvest it some day in the future maybe
I don't know and then we don't got true
wireless stuff and I know I'm talking
over to talk to your tailor because
you're the good guy and gosh but true
wireless charging I think if you're not
familiar with the works of Nikola Tesla
check him out he was doing wireless
electricity transmission over distance
there are some yeah a long long time ago
there are some problems with that in one
experiment he was able to successfully
send a huge amount of power across a
town from peak to peak and blew out
every window in town and there are
theories floating around that the
Russian village that mysteriously was
destroyed way back in the early 1900's
might have been Tunguska I don't yeah
that no it wasn't about yeah I was a
forest yeah they did a meteor impact or
they've done right impact yeah yeah
there's something that it could have
been a military vessel extra yeah I know
it the Tesla's tower was only a couple
miles away from my house growing up his
the remnants of his facility which later
turned into a Kodak plant that kids at
school awesome yeah yeah but anyway yeah
a so you're right we've done wireless
transmission of power over distance
before it's just a question of
commercializing it and making it safe
but Taylor what were you going to say
there I was going to say one I just
tweeted you the link to the wireless
television wandering boom watch in your
face thank you
i watch this basic go ahead that second
one the second one is that there is an
heard there was an adapter in 2010
created by RCA the aired energy I think
it's how it's pronounced but it's really
lame this it is supremely thing but what
it does is pretty cool it's basically it
was a mini USB charger so obviously that
would be need to be updated but it was a
Wi-Fi charger it uses ambient Wi-Fi
signal to trickle charge your device
what oh it doesn't charge fast it
charges really slow basically it keeps
it where it's at and might charge if
your phones on standby or something but
it uses ambient Wi-Fi signal tuning
Archer device I need to get i'm all
about this i'm all up on this what is it
awesome you link to that said that
second thing because I that's that's I
just you just blew my mind killer Martin
tell them our new guy in the podcast
just just eliminated my brain and if
we're lucky Michael will post these in
the article at pocketnow.com so you guys
can share in the Wellness to an
incredible discovery yeah I'll see that
I just give you more work yeah thanks
thanks man thanks i'll hit it anytime
good thing I don't already have to waste
a lot of time editing out all the sky
problems I blew your mind yesterday to
write solve the problem that you
couldn't solve yeah but I've since
forgotten that so it wasn't too let's
get into the last piece of listener mail
here from Carlos I hate packing out to
you I love this opening hinge I baccano
team love your show blah blah blah
listen all the time to move along
awesome colors now that Android for
tattoo has official lock screen widget
support with good widgets like the new
dashboard clock and you can swipe down
for notifications what are some good
uses for my home screens I love this
question so my view on this is that I
have not yet used any lock screen
widgets I know this makes me a weird
weird dude but I am not running a
version of Android that supports home
screen widgets because I'm stuck behind
stupid TouchWiz don't have to edit that
out night to have to edit that uh I'm
stuck behind TouchWiz so guys tell me I
love the question because it's basically
now that end
it has built in this awesome new
functionality they've sort of shot
themselves in the foot and made their
other their older functionality useless
what is your opinion on this hello
pebble well lock screen widgets are kind
of they're not as optimized as they
could be to access the lock screen
widget you have to pull the page down or
swipe left or right so the main lock
screen budget the one that's standard
just a clock right doesn't really do
anything if you tap it it doesn't do
anything it flashes and says hey unlock
the phone it's like okay so it's not
really that useful I use dashclock and
it's really nice it looks great but I
have to drag down on the lock screen to
reveal the full widget so it's kind of
yeah it's like a pseudo widget okay yeah
it'sit's information at a glance so you
don't have to unlock your phone to get
at the information and I love using
dashclock as an example because that's
what I use it's right there if you need
to know when your next appointment is or
your next or what your email inbox looks
like you can do that so you're saying it
lets you get in get out and get back to
life yeah you don't even have to unlock
your phone it's just right there but it
doesn't give away too much personal
information so you're not worrying about
exposing stuff that should be kept
behind that security wall so what did
you keep on your on your home screens
like to you know what it would so you
keep stuff on your home screens that is
maybe stuff that is you want to be more
secure than stuff you keep going to your
lock screen I keep icons on the home
screen because you can't keep icons on
the lockscreen see you I just say I
moved all my accounts down into the dock
because i don't like yeah that's my home
screen but yeah if you look at like a
picture of mine like or the video that i
did all of my icons are in the dock and
i have two widgets on the home screen to
do two widgets on your lock screen you'd
have to have two pages to have four or
five widgets you'd have to have one page
per widget so it's not that useful
beyond one widget sorry our advice to
carlos is to use the different use cases
as their intended use lock screen widget
says they're intended and continue using
home screen widgets as they are intended
because they're set it and end to his
point i'm down to where i have one home
screen that I use all the time and then
I hardly swipe left and
right anymore there used to be a time
when oh three home screens wasn't enough
we got to have five or we got to have
seven we got to have nine so you can
have all your stuff on it and you do
that through custom launchers well
anymore even if I have a custom launcher
I'm pairing off stuff so that I don't
want to have the seven home screens I
just want to have three maybe and I use
my main home screen my home home screen
ninety percent of the time and the
others hardly get used at all yeah I've
I've narrowed it down to one yeah I
float go ahead I put the soundhound
widget that I use a lot on a lock screen
widget to the left of the main widget
and I have one home screen with dash
clock and the battery widget reborn
that's it and you know when I use
launcher or I use active action launcher
well I almost got that wrong he's action
launcher with covers in the dot the dock
at the bottom so they don't look like
widgets their folders sorry they look
like icons not holders so it's very
minimal to it this is this is
fascinating as I want to actually have a
discussion about this on a future
podcast because I too have reduced the
number of homescreens i use on average
on a phone i still use three pretty
regularly but on my Nexus 7 I don't like
I think well my home screens are empty
it's the same as I thing I made fun of
Toni for back in Berlin when I first
gave him the Nexus 7 and he was like yes
this is how I would set this up and it's
just blank and but I've ended up in the
same place because I don't find the
widgets as useful as I used to I think I
think androids widgets do need to
refresh the stock ones but that's that
is unfortunately discussion for another
time because we do have to go gents and
I know commenters I want to say this
right now thank you so much for all of
you who were out there who say make the
show longer because it's so much when we
first started the weekly I was I think
we were all petrified that everyone was
going to say why is the show so long and
we wanted to keep it to 45 minutes but
that is proven impossible because we
just have so much to talk about so it's
really nice to get the support from all
y'all saying that the show is you know
long it's just the right size Carlos
were sorry we couldn't get to the other
half of your question but we do have to
move on
that first heavier question which
prompted probably at least one editorial
at one of us right I want to write about
a shrinking home screen problem I can I
can editorial as anything I see a
picture of George Costanza somewhere in
that in that edit whoever writes it yeah
I was in a pool I'm there was shrinkage
all right let's get the out of here what
