will bring 5g capabilities and you're
gonna have to wait for them while we may
be losing an incredible amount in
international smartphone shipments and
we have details on how much and the
Google pixel 3a seems to be Amazon's
best selling at the moment and we don't
blame consumers
I'm hi Natalie that I Happy Father's Day
to you all I'm here in Guatemala City in
the moist most noisy echoey apartment
ever but I'm here to celebrate this is
parking out daily the official loose
today begin with the deals that keep on
coming men I love Amazon being an Apple
retailer this is so cool we use MacBook
Pros for our video editing and right now
these are $199 off if you go for the
15-inch variant 149 if you go for the
13-inch just to give you an idea
obviously if you go for the max that
variant depending on that is a discount
these are the computers that we use man
I mean if you're in the market these are
not the best these MacBook Pros been
plagued with issues but they are the
best at what we do at least in our
opinion so you can learn more about them
in the description
and speaking of Amazon believe it or not
if you're wondering which is the best
sold unlocked smartphone right now
believe it or not it's the Google pixel
3 a and expect our full review as a it's
gonna come out in the next few days
I have no brahmin recommending this
phone it is a really good phone for its
price its debunked or pretty much thrown
off the shelf devices from Samsung and
Blu that we're even less expensive you
get a great camera or great software
experience the build is good enough I
mean you can learn more about it in the
description as well I have no problem
I've been enjoying that phone a lot now
let's move the spotlight over to the
samsung galaxy note 10
I've been really looking forward to this
phone but I've been skeptical about
things like the loss of the headphone
jack and everything today we have some
case leaks and you know once case makers
get the phone we pretty much match them
with the renders and see what matches
and what doesn't right now we're pretty
much sure that this phone is not
bringing a headphone jack which is sad
and then we've got that vertical camera
array that looks let's hung like the
Huawei Pete 30 Pro I would love to know
what you guys think about this phone in
the comments I mean I'm really
disappointed
unless Samsung is like oh yeah sure
here's a pair of galaxy but
in the Bark's then that would probably
make me be like alright fine cuz I love
the galaxy buds but other than that if
I'm just getting another USBC pair of
headphones I am NOT interested we'll see
what we get on the end now let's talk
about iOS 13 beta which is pretty much
iPad OS 13 beta and also the new Mac OS
a Catalina and even the new TV OS all
these have just reached beta 2 the
reason why we're covering this even
though we rarely do is because we have
the advantage that once things reach
beta 3 they go public in most cases I'm
not guaranteeing this but for those of
you that want to give it a try and not
have to deal with the bugs or at least
not the major bugs you get in the first
two betas expect that coming very soon
probably a week away from now and the
thing about it is now we've got some
enhancements in the file system for iOS
we see that there are new lighting
options for portrait mode in addition to
other changes in performance
enhancements that we've been waiting for
I cannot wait to try that iPad OS
particularly so stay tuned we will be
covering whenever that public beta comes
out I will definitely work on a video
for that and now let's talk about Huawei
we've been covering everything that's
been happening with the company for the
last couple of weeks and I find that
funny whenever people call as fanboys or
whatever the main reason why we're
covering the news is because there are
350 million units out there obviously
350 million people concerned and worried
over what the future is going to be and
trust me you're not the only ones Huawei
has pretty much come clear we've got
analysts already providing details on
the numbers of what the losses are going
to be seems that Huawei would lose 40 to
60% in international smartphone
shipments the honour'd 20 will be the
device used to test how the market
behaves this month however the report
has some conflicting numbers because
later on it we have mentions of 40 to 60
million in losses but then on the other
hand we've got CNN claiming up to 30
billion in losses which matches more
what that 40 to 60 percent range should
be cos obviously Huawei is not
celebrating they've got a lot on their
hands over what the feature might be I'm
sure that there's a lot of political
talk over how this is going to be
handled and I'm hoping that this gets
better particularly for again 350
million consumers who
are probably going to have a brick in
their hands which you were hoping is not
going to be the case and then finally
the hottest news today I have to do with
the next generation iPhones not this
year but actually the ones after as once
we get make sure you talking about
iPhones we never think twice about
covering this those of you wondering if
we're getting 5g capabilities on iPhones
this year yes there is a negotiation now
between Qualcomm and Apple so that made
me excited for 5g but according to quo
that's not going to happen this year
it's going to happen next year and only
the premium variants are getting in so
I'm actually expecting that only the
Mac's variant is going to be getting 5g
capabilities and one of the main reasons
according to quo is because obviously 5g
is still being deployed there's no point
in rushing and getting us phones with 5g
this year according to Apple if the
deployment is not expecting to be major
until 2020 so that is a definitely one
thing obviously we hear that it's not
until 2021 that all smartphones across
the board from Apple are going to be
getting 5g capabilities so yes prepare
your wallets if you want to get 5g on an
iPhone as of next year true that's going
to be the case let us know in the
comments down below what do you think do
you think that it's a bad idea for Apple
to wait on 5g until next year or not
because in my case there's a video I
highly recommend that you watch it we're
gonna link it at the end of this video
where you can watch our experience with
5g and Verizon in Chicago with the
Galaxy S 10 5g it was very positive but
there is still a lot more to be done so
I don't blame Apple for wanting to wait
it out and having allowing that to be
perfected but that's my opinion leave us
a comment down below we left it under
yours
