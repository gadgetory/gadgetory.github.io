the wearable space you know that things
are about to get very interesting for
pebble with new features and
functionality I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and these are my top watch
apps and faces with pebble steel the
pebble app store and the pebble OS
version - Tony release a lot of great
stuff is about to happen for their
current leader in the SmartWatch
industry that doesn't mean you can't do
some seriously cool stuff with your
pebble right this second however like
install the Michael Fisher or Taylor
Martin watch face on your very own
pebble joking aside with a little
know-how and openness to buggy betas you
can get the pebble to do beta 5 up and
running on your own pebble in a matter
of minutes just as I did earlier today
once you have beta 5 on your pebble let
the fun begin
there are countless new applications
with additional functionality waiting to
be tinkered with keep in mind not all of
these require to die dough for example
two of my favorite watch faces work
perfectly fine on the most recent
official build of pebble OS modern and
revolution these are two of the most
popular watch faces to date and can be
installed very easily both of these are
available directly through the official
pebble app open pebble select watch apps
from the drop down menu tap get watch
apps and select modern or revolution
modern is an analogue watch face it
shows the date behind the virtual hands
and it even has a moving second hand
it's a classy watch face that easily
disguised as pebble as a normal watch
until it buzzes revolution on the other
hand is a big digital watch face with
some cool animations it too updates by
the second which I'm not very fond of
each screen updates sips at the battery
life so I prefer watch faces which only
update by the minute
but I've been switching back and forth
between Revolution and modern since the
very beginning and constantly finding
myself coming back to them they're both
oldies but goodies if you're looking to
get a little more out of your watch face
experience there are two watch faces
worth checking out pebble cards and
glance pebble cards can be downloaded
from the developer site a date and time
are always displayed but the lower half
of pebbles display is utilized with what
the developer calls cards using the
pebble applique
from your phone you can customize which
cards appear and their order as well as
the information on each card you can
make a note and have it display at all
times you can select whether a world
clock sports scores the battery status
calendar and six other available cards
it's definitely one of the most useful
watch faces out there Glantz is another
watch app which can be installed
directly to the beta pebble 2.0
application it has multiple
customization watch faces to choose from
and the buttons on the right side of
pebble are shortcuts to more in-depth
information such as weather calendar
entries SMS and other phone statuses it
comes with Tasker integration and it has
a companion application which can be
downloaded from Google Play using the
companion app you can customize glance
to your liking if that's not enough for
you there are two more applications
which really open pebble up to an entire
world of possibilities pebble Tasker and
music boss the latter is not unlike the
native music functionality of pebble
except it can do much much more you can
control volume change the default music
application and launch different music
apps straight from pebble double tap the
middle button to switch the default app
and long press to launch it in order to
use music boss you will need to purchase
the companion application from Google
Play for a dollar ninety-nine but the
additional control from your wrist is
well worth the $2 did I mention it also
has Tasker integration pebble Tasker is
Tasker integration for pebble first you
must have Tasker which will set you back
$2.99 but it will allow you to create
virtually endless profiles on automated
tasks for your smartphone pebble Tasker
is another dollar ninety-nine and it
will allow you to quickly access and
control specific tasks from Tasker on
your phone from pebble I quickly created
three tests and Tasker and loaded them
into the pebble Tasker application
toggle Wi-Fi silence and Google search
if I open pebble Tasker from pebble and
hit the top right button Wi-Fi is
toggled on my Moto X if I press the
middle button all noises are silenced on
my phone and if I press the bottom
button Google now is launched if you
long press the middle button you can
access up to 20 more tasks or tasks
straight from pebble
not satisfied with any of the watch
faces you've seen you can make your own
and believe it or not it's actually not
all that difficult
yes coding one from scratch requires
coding knowledge specifically C but
there are two ways to make your own
watch faces in a matter of minutes the
first is through an application called
canvas download it to your Android
smartphone customize the watch face to
your heart's desire and install on
pebble the other method requires a
computer and it seems to be a little
easier to work with
it's aptly named the watch face
generator with the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get builder you
can add a background picture text time
date etc it generate when you're done
moving things around and resizing and
scan the barcode with your phone hit the
download button and the watch face will
automatically install watch face
generator works for the two Naoto beta
while canvas does not everything in this
video with the exception of canvas or
work with pebble steel once it's
available once canvas is updated to
support the two dot IO SDK it will work
on pebble steel as well did any of these
watch faces and watch apps appeal to you
