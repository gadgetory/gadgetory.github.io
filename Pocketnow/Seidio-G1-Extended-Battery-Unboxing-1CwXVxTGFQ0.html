today showing you an unboxing of the CDO
extended battery for the t-mobile g1 now
the battery that comes in the T the g
one here is eleven hundred and fifty
milliamp hours which really isn't all
that bad but over time batteries lose
their capacity especially the more times
that they're charged and discharged they
just wear out so you can get a
replacement one of these for right
around 20 bucks you can get an off-brand
14 somewhere around 45 plus shipping
shipping usually ends up being another
four or five bucks however see the CEO
over here I still don't know how to
pronounce their name right has got this
new battery which I'd like to show you
this battery isn't like other extended
batteries it actually fits in the same
space as the default battery the stock
battery for the phone and if I can find
it on here for you this is actually a
1400 milliamp hour battery so that's
going to give quite a few more minutes
of run time talk time standby time for
your g1 which is really good in addition
to being a brand new battery that it
doesn't have any problems with having
been worn out like your old battery does
it's also got more capacity putting it
in is pretty easy simply drop it in put
your back plate on okay after booting up
the phone for the first time the battery
charge indicator showed that we had
about twenty percent battery life that
came with the battery just right out of
the box that might not be entirely
accurate because the phone is used to
the battery that it had in it so the
statistics are going to be off until you
go through a few charge and recharge
cycles that said after having the phone
on the charger with the screen off or
right over an hour you'll see you here
I've got about forty six percent of
battery life
which really isn't that bad that's
plenty enough to get me through the rest
of the day on this battery alone once we
get a full charge on it I expect that
we'll be able to go full day plus
without needing to hook up to an outside
power source so with the first look of
the CDO extended battery for the
t-mobile g1 I'm Joe Levi for
