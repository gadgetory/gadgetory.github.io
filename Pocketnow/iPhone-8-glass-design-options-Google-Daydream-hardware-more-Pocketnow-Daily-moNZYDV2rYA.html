one glass iphone not to we get a teaser
of Android applications running on
Chrome OS and analysts claim that iOS
and Windows Phone are falling hard
lately I'm hi Mary vetta and no I didn't
just take the cap side but also the
Thundercats side cuz I'm from that
generation this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with analytics
a few days ago we heard that Apple was
down when it came to its market share
but Gardner analytics just came to
confirm Android is seven points up to
eighty four percent of the market share
Apple is horribly down it's barely
scratching fourteen percent and then for
those of you that are asking just how
well Microsoft is doing with Windows
Phone the company went down from two
percent of market share 2.7 I think they
should just pretty much call it quits by
now other very interesting news come
from Android as we hear that family
sharing for applications is finally
coming to Android it's existed on iOS to
a certain degree though it's rather
cumbersome but yeah it works Android is
apparently also getting that apparently
google is a roughening things up with
developers for that option to be
available sometime within june or july
it's been available for google music for
the longest time as well so let's see
when that lands and speaking of Google
another very interesting development
when it comes to applications is also
having Android apps run on Chrome OS we
have heard of this for the longest time
it's pretty much the only way that
trauma West would have a point of being
and apparently it is going to happen
soon i just got demo to google i/o and
the only problem is not every chromebook
will be able to run these you actually
need a chromebook with a touchscreen so
if you don't it seems that's the
requirement but hey we could be wrong
whitford to become official and since
the news continue being all things
google those of you that are wondering
exactly when you will be able to get one
of those daydream vr headsets google is
apparently building its own just like we
have a nexus smartphone and pretty much
everything else it seems that we will
a daydream VR from google along with the
controller we pretty much did see the
controller at Google i/o it reminds us
of the one for the Apple TV but it's
great to see that thing I me and it
could have been worse it could have been
much worse and now that controller looks
cool let's just see how functional it is
and hope that we get it for gameplay not
just for selecting things on a display
buddy and finally the very hot news that
they have to do with a feature our
iPhone and glass on glass design
apparently we're not talking about the
2016 iphone 7 apparently it has to do
with next year's iphone it seems that
even though we've heard rumors of glass
on glass apparently it won't come to
both devices apparently only one is
getting this the other is remaining with
the metal design that we currently see
and we don't know why that is we do
notice that Apple will probably
differentiate the iphone 7 plus with a
dual camera and it seems that design
will be a thing next year and it leads
me to the question of the day when
choosing a smartphone what do you prefer
do you prefer an aluminum designer you
do you prefer glass on glass you know I
prefer aluminum mainly because of its
durability because replacing a glass
back is just horrible but then again I
don't know Samsung has done such an
amazing job with the galaxy s6 and
galaxy s7 I pretty much have never seen
a shattered back on any of these up to
the point where it seems the technology
is there for this to be worth it I like
it I prefer it but then aluminum on
devices like the HTC 10 is also crazy
gorgeous leave us a comment down below
