never intended to be flagship
smartphones where the spec list is
packed with the latest and greatest in
technologies and components to try and
edge out over their competition such as
the case with the latest desire but did
HTC go too far in paring down the spec
list and sacrifice the user experience
let's find out in the htc desire 816
review first glance it may look like the
desire 816 spec sheet was the proverbial
chopping block where HTC cut
specifications in order to cut costs
unlike its flagship sibling the One m8
the desire 816 is powered by a much more
modest quad-core Snapdragon 400 clocked
at 1.6 gigahertz at 5.5 inches the
desire screen is noticeably bigger than
the One m8 the two phones look very
similar but the desire uses a
cost-saving 720p display instead of
1080p the big Super LCD panel still
manages a respectable 267 PPI pixel
density with bold bright colors and it
looks fantastic flanking the screen is a
pair of front firing boom sound speakers
which are loud clear and produced more
depth and tone than we're used to on
other mid-range phones desire 816 is a
big phone or is it a small phablet here
HTC opted to include LTE support but
kept its Wi-Fi limited to 2.4 gigahertz
in our tests Wi-Fi was quick and
reliable
but t-mobile's high-speed data bans
weren't supported so we never got to
test anything quicker than edge which
we're sure had a positive impact on our
battery life moving on to software since
UI 6 is a lot less in-your-face than
previous versions of HTC's customized UI
interacting with the desire was
intuitive both for those used to stock
Android as well as those used to sense
HTC doesn't go overboard with bloat but
even still almost half
of the desires 8gig internal storage is
used up right out-of-the-box thankfully
HTC included a microSD card slot
capable of accepting up to a 128 gig
card it also included a very useful
Settings panel to instruct the device to
put files from various sources onto the
card
unfortunately moving apps to the SD card
is still a manual process but at least
it can be done let's dig into
performance the Snapdragon 400 SOC was
never intended to win any performance
contests which is reflected in its
benchmark scores in everyday use the
desire was responsive and quick and we
never found ourselves waiting on it
while we don't want to call it lag
because it certainly didn't feel like it
we did experience an occasional
hesitation but nothing that was
particularly distracting everyday apps
were smooth blinkfeed was fluid even
some of the more graphically intense
games in place or ran just fine 2600
milliamp hour lipo battery inside the
desired nether that's two solid days of
use this is due to its power efficient
CPU and GPU and underscored by the 720p
versus 1080p screen keep in mind that
LTE and HSPA+ an hour's but should still
easily get you through an entire day of
moderate use the desire 816 s camera has
all the right specs 13 megapixels for
Stills in 1080p for video though there's
a lot of detail in the desire shots it
doesn't do as well in low-light
conditions but the pictures did turn out
quite well images were generally sharp
colors were vibrant and the shutter
speed and the stock camera app was quick
though not instantaneous
phone calls were above average - caller
said we sounded crisp and clear and they
came through very loud we had to turn
the volume down a few times which was a
welcome change about some pros and cons
the htc desire 816 is a great value
especially for a device with such a
large screen
it's got loud clear front firing
speakers that make listening to music
and watching videos a dream to top it
all off
it's got outstanding battery life as far
as cons go that screen it's only 720p
the backplate is a slippery fingerprint
magnet and it squeaks when you hold it
rounding it out
there's no NFC no tap to beam and no
Google Wallet for all the htc desire 816
is a very enjoyable phone to use it's
big enough to comfortably watch movies
on with a bright screen and wonderful
speakers to back it up but it's not so
big that you can't comfortably carry it
around or use it as a normal phone sure
HTC had to cut some corners but did so
to keep the price down all factors
considered the sacrifices are well worth
it
the desire 816 is much closer to a
flagship than it is to a mid to your
phone more on the desire 816 a whole
bunch of sample photos benchmark and
battery results and our final score head
