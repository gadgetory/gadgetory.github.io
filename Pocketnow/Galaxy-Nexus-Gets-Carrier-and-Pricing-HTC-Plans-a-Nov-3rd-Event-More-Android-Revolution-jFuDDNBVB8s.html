carrier and release date information HTC
plans another event on November third
and don't get your hopes up because the
nexus one won't get ice cream sandwich
all this and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm high memory better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's start this week off with what's
hot well now that we have ice cream
sandwich and a phone let's begin going
through what to expect first of all
verizon has already launched their
signup page for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
to launch on November 10th at first the
sign was saying exclusive but eventually
they ended up pulling the exclusive Ward
from it which is all good news for us
the phone seems to be scheduled to be
launched in the UK on november
seventeenth so have your wall is
prepared motorola just made a bold bet
in telling everybody that they'll be
getting ice cream sandwich on their
Motorola devices just six weeks after
Google releases Ice Cream Sandwich so
what else could we expect I mean Google
just bought Motorola I mean that's what
was expected HTC has just sent out
invitations for November third event
where many of us are speculating that
they'll be releasing their recently
leaked HTC Rezound now HTC really needs
to work on those names probably bring
some numbers because they're kind of
getting weird and funny at the same time
now HTC better get their act together by
bringing something that's really
groundbreaking or else well their device
will be dated because of the Galaxy
Nexus that will be released in a couple
of days so let's see what they come up
with out of the smartphone releases for
the wig motorola droid razr pre-orders
have begun and we could expect the
device to be released to everybody by
November 10th now sadly as we mentioned
earlier this device has already been
dated just a couple of days after was
launched because the Galaxy Nexus pretty
much left it obsolete with all its specs
so again it's your call if you want to
get yourself a razor or not t-mobile has
also announced their Samsung exhibit 2
4g where everybody's calling their
phones 4G this is the equivalent to the
samsung galaxy w that we talked earlier
it brings men grain specs though what's
amazing is they could actually pick up
the phone for thirty dollars after fifty
dollar mail-in rebate in a two-year
contract or actually pages two hundred
bucks for the phone unlock and that's
pretty much it which is not bad for 4g
phone samsung has also made their
monstrous Galaxy Note available on
November first for Germany and
in November second for the UK now it
should be a matter of time before we get
to see that beauty on our shores but
again not really sure if you want that
big phone unless you really want to
stylist so leave us a comment down below
to tell us if you're really interested
or not and yes Samsung Samsung and
Sampson there are more samsung phones
being released now we have the mid-range
transform being available for sprint
which brings the security device
mid-range specs not really something
compelling but it's coming for sprint
now so again if you're really a need for
acuity device that not really it's your
wallet well this is a really good option
out of this week's leaks we have the
motorola droid for making its first
photo appearance though it looks like a
droid just about it every way but again
it has some changes in design looking
like a razor with a keyboard so that
could be interesting we recently also
got some videos on the LG switch
smartphone concept which brings two
screens one on each side so kind of
interesting to see a lot of people were
actually crazy when the iphone 4s came
out because obviously you have glass on
glass and obviously the glass on the
other side does a really good job at
breaking so not really sure if this is a
novelty or a good idea so leaders are
comment down below because apparently
the idea here is that you could actually
multitask within we each screen though
imagine flipping your phone all around
and other people being able to see what
you're watching or the other things that
you're not really supposed to be seen
not really sure that's a good idea and
finally we get images of the LG product
k2 that everybody's expecting really
great design really studying device
though sadly we don't get any specs
aside from the 4.3 Nova display that
everybody already knew about so let's
hope that thing comes to our shores and
while it's soon out of our weeks
coverage make sure you watch Brandon's
recent video on how to get Android Ice
Cream Sandwich running on your google
nexus s so far runs flawlessly so it is
a good idea to point it to your device
dickies also finishing his round of
videos on the HTC Flyer which proves to
be cool though sadly a little dated and
also make sure you catch Joe Levi's
recent articles on what Ice Cream
Sandwich means to Android because
definitely brings a lot of changes that
many of us were really expecting over
time and also why the Galaxy Nexus will
make
next device really good points on why so
make sure to read up and tell us all
about it and when you think about the
Galaxy Nexus in the comments down below
well that does it for what's hot let's
continue on with what's not and while
the biggest debate now is who will be
getting ice cream sandwich on their
smartphones and let's bring some sad
news because for one I'm disappointed
about the fact that my google nexus one
is not going to be getting ice cream
sandwich you'd wonder I mean Google is
really the one that's supposed to be
pushing their updates to all their
phones the google nexus one is barely
out not even two years recently I mean
the iphone 3gs even got iOS 5 which is
dated in smartphone specs and everything
so what's the excuse about getting ice
cream sandwich on the google nexus one
if the Nexus S is pretty much almost the
same device I really don't know what to
expect but sadly Google I mean you're
really disappointing imagine if Google
is not really doing a good job in
putting their OS to other smartphones
what can we expect about other
manufacturers like Sam your HCC sad news
and bad job Google that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm high Meadow iveta remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
