the Moto X was my favorite Android
smartphone of 2013 it shunned the speck
race in favor of a smarter better user
experience bucking the trend of evermore
powerful bigger smartphones for
something different one year later the
new Moto X changes its size and its
specs but not its spirit I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow join me for
Motorola MOTO X vs. Motorola MOTO X
we've only had the new Moto X for a few
days folks so to be clear this
comparison isn't a full review if you
don't want to miss our full review when
it does land subscribe here on youtube
and bookmark pocketnow.com get these
things in front of you and the most
striking difference is in size and
design where last year's Moto X was
understated above all this year's is
well not first of all it's larger in
every dimension except for thickness and
you really feel that difference when
you're holding it on the one hand the
new Moto X does have a more
sophisticated feel with the aluminum
trim and thinner edges but on the other
its sacrificed some of the portability
and one-handed usefulness of its
predecessor the custom backing material
has definitely gotten an upgrade poor
ween leather joins new wooden options in
a variety of colors and the leather
feels soft and supple to the touch
specific elements have been enlarged as
well the most obvious on the back side
is the finger dimple which was subtle
and tiny last year and now it's a cereal
bowl same for the camera which has
expanded in diameter to include the new
ring flash more subtle changes include a
ribbed texture on the power standby key
to help you tell it apart from the
volume rocker and the very welcome move
of the speakerphone from back to front
above that speaker the display on the
new Moto X is much larger 5.2 inches
versus 4.7 and it's also full HD this
time around which renders crisper lines
and text the new screen is still AMOLED
but its color reproduction is sometimes
warmer often with a greener tint than
the old device at least on our review
unit bordering that display almost
invisible on this black faceplate are
four IR ports three transmitters and one
receiver which enable the approach
functionality new to the Moto X on the
old device motion was required to
trigger the active display when sitting
on a table while the newly renamed and
redesigned moto display reacts to a
reach
you can also silence ringers and snooze
alarms using the same method
it's one of several handy new functions
brought by the Moto X software
customized build of Android 4.4.4 the
new version brings the bigger icons and
brighter look of Google's latest
launcher and also anchors Google now in
a permanent slot to the left of the home
screen also the Motorola connect app has
been enhanced to support and manage
connected devices instead of just
serving as a link to your browser on the
computer one of my favorite features the
Moto X touchless control has been
renamed it's now called moto voice to
fit in with the Moto suite and it's been
repainted in lighter colors too
its functionality is largely unchanged
you can ask it to do everything from
setting alarm clock to taking a selfie
and best of all you can change the
launch phrase to anything you want hello
computer responsiveness on the whole is
a bit tighter as you'd expect on a brand
new device versus one that's been used
heavily for nine straight months but
some of this and the added graphics
performance is also due to the new
phone's Snapdragon 801 processor which
is a real monster compared with the old
chip one of the biggest disappointments
of last year's Moto X was its 10
megapixel clear pixel camera which
generally underwhelmed in most lighting
conditions even after a software update
boosted its saturation and contrast
somewhat the new camera is slightly
higher in resolution and it retains the
same viewfinder which I've always
admired for its simplicity
you can still double twist your wrist to
activate it too though the newer phone
is a little less sensitive takes a more
forceful action in terms of end results
well let's just say that the Moto X
still wouldn't be my first choice for a
smartphone camera the out of box
resolution on the new edition defaults
to about 10 megapixels to keep the 16 by
9 aspect ratio which I prefer but the
new lens has a narrower field of view
meaning you need to get further away
from your subject to fit it on the frame
in good lighting the new model keeps
pace with the old one even reducing
digital noise in a few HDR shots in
automatic though the software is less
likely to use HDR which is either a
bummer or a boon depending on your
preferences
in low-light the apparent lack of clear
pixel technology means the new phones
photos are generally darker unless you
force HDR on on the brighter side the
flash on the new device is much more
powerful useful in backlit situations
and there's also a time-travelling burst
mode for fast-moving objects the video
camera can record in 4k and the new
device as well but you'll have to wait
for the full review to see our footage
on that altogether I'm not seeing a lot
of improvement in the stills here which
is a shame I was really hoping for a
sizeable boost in quality motorola has
always been excellent at the
fundamentals of voice calls and that's
no less true here with a fourth
microphone helping out with crystal talk
noise reduction the new Moto X is
significantly clearer on phone calls
than its predecessor especially in the
presence of background noise testing it
on AT&amp;amp;T and Greater Boston colors said I
sounded fuller and richer on the new
Moto X which I always like hearing and
the same was true of them on our end
speaker phone calls and media playback
were also helped along by the front
mounted position of the speakerphone
which is sometimes tinnier but
definitely louder than the aft firing
unit from last year
again we'll have some more detailed
impressions of the new Moto X and our
full review in terms of this comparison
motorola has succeeded in delivering an
improved version of its tightly focused
feature set while also bringing enough
of a hardware boost to keep the spec
heads happy again I'd like to have seen
a bigger jump in camera performance and
I wish the company hadn't felt the need
to go so burly with the build but on the
whole the new Moto X seems a worthy
successor to my old favorite for the
full review we've been teasing all this
