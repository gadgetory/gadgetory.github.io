the consumer preview of Windows 8.1 this
is mainly a developer release for
testing applications some whatnot but I
decided to install it on my surface pro
right away so let's check it out and see
how it works so right now I have one of
the new features running this is the new
lockscreen slideshow so it's taking
pictures from you know a couple my
folders on the device and it's doing a
nice little mix you'll see them change
once in a while but that's a really cool
feature so next up we're going to show
you how quickly this boots up and you
just press the power button and there we
are and I'm logged in a little bit
quicker than normal Windows 80 so next
we have our new start screen and you see
I have tiles of all sorts of different
sizes we have the normal wide ones the
square ones and now I have even larger
square ones and very small small ones so
we have all sorts of sizes and you can
customize in layout however you want if
I tap and hold this is the new edit mode
let's get out of there previously you
had to like kind of tap and swipe which
was weird and then you had to like drag
it and have a unsnap and moon around so
now we tap and hold similarly to Windows
Phone and I can see I can select
multiple ones at the same time and down
here we have options and there's your
resize option
I don't can change it like so and I can
select two of them at the same time and
make them both
well that one did go to large alright
only the main weather and tile can go to
large let's say a separate pinned so
there you go and you see it's much
easier to see that you can name these
groups
to zoom out and then right click or tap
and hold on one of the groups you can't
do that anymore you have to tap and hold
on an item and then you can name the
group so different things here so that's
the customized mode and something that's
not immediately discoverable on a tablet
mode but if you use your mouse and move
it around like so you'll see a little
arrow to see all of your apps and this
is really nicely done you can choose how
to sort them most used the installed
name I kind of like date installed
because I see which ones are the newest
and you can search here and get to
whatever app you want that way it's kind
of redundant because there's also the
search bar which is totally new and
really nice so let's go back to the
start I can type the name of an app and
it is immediately selected I can hit
enter and launch that or and there it
goes I can hit the search charm and we
have everywhere selected so it's going
to search everything or you can change
it to do settings web images video files
those are the only options so let's
search for
Koby
and this is going to give us something
really cool it's a new kind of a beam
layout app and skewness all sorts of
search results for Colbie Caillat and I
can play music let's go ahead and do
that and it's jumping into the new Xbox
music app and it's going to start
playing the music and you can see
there's more results from the web all
sorts of websites here Facebook so lots
of options pictures and now I'm going to
snap let's snap over here there's Xbox
music and you see the search results
have gone into a vertical scrolling
let's go back and the music is playing
over here
and you see it's a 50/50 split view and
we can change the ratio and you see the
music player turns it to the narrow
vertical format that's pretty nice and
this goes back to horizontal scrolling
and now let's see what happens when I
launch another app hot weather well look
at that that's kind of weird it's just
floating there there's no indication of
what I'm supposed to do with this it
looks like a bug but really the reason
it's doing this is because I have to
choose which window pane I want it to go
into so I can put over here or I can put
over here so you gotta choose I'm gonna
put over here and now the app can load
so that's kind of weird here we go
little buggy there
so now my weather's loading something
that I've been missing and using this
for the past couple hours or so there's
no more online integration there's no
more Facebook messaging there's no more
MSN messaging in the people up there's
still notifications for Facebook events
i mean facebook notifications still show
up along with twitter but there's no
more chat and the messaging app is
completely gone
so you're gonna have to use Skype for
Windows Messenger and we hear there's
going to be a Facebook app so maybe that
will bring Facebook messaging back now
let's look at the settings a little bit
over here while we're on the Start
screen you can get to the personalized
area and we can choose all sorts of
different colors you can also choose the
background so that's gonna load my
desktop background let's go to the
desktop and let's change this
personalize about the default Windows
theme and there we go
so now you see the background comes
through on the Start screen and that's
pretty nice
depending on what kind of background
image you choose for your desktop and
you see the difference here it blends
really nicely another new thing is the
start button is back on the taskbar in
the desktop mode so you can get to that
but I don't care because it's also over
here on the charms
we have some new apps here this one's
pretty nice
new bing food and drink so let's choose
a recipe and you can read it and there's
a new hands-free mode which is pretty
cool so it's hands-free mode on and just
the camera turned on and I can just wave
my hand and it is giving me the
instructions for this recipe so the
camera is seeing my hand and it just
goes through so your hands can be wet
and dirty and you can still read what
you're supposed to do next in the
kitchen that's pretty nice
health and fitness app for Bing
you've got stuff like diet tracker
nutrition all sorts of cool things the
Photos app has been updated but it has
lost practically all the functionality
there's no more SkyDrive there's no more
Facebook there's no more clicker
let's look at the settings you got
nothing options it doesn't mean it
doesn't even load pictures from other
folders that are set as pictures library
items this is only the default pictures
of library the games app is looking very
buggy see this is all squished
there we go it's loading and can't see
stuff down there and the friends we lost
all of our avatars the Maps app has been
updated it still goes straight to the
map with no controls or buttons so you
don't really know what you can do so you
might have to do a search or swipe from
the edge and you get more controls
and that gives us the location and we
see we got some good information about
that I was the Facebook button and
here's the browser so it's loading the
webpage that I clicked on right next to
the previous app that I was in that's
pretty nice feature now I can also tap
and hold on I'm link and then you see
some options down here copy link it
doesn't have the little pop-up menu
anymore but now I've got two browser
windows side by side so maybe I want to
go to Facebook on this one
no problem now let's look at the PC
settings so there's a completely
different layout here who's your
slideshow options you choose folders for
this slideshow lock screen and we can
see PC and devices options there's a
lock screen there display change the
resolution lots of options here
the new settings area is much more
comprehensive for the keyboard junkies
Windows X will give you quick access to
shutdown as well as lots of other great
power user features so with about two
clicks you can get all this important
stuff for the power users but on our
tablet we got lots of touch friendly
options to the Windows Store has a new
layout sound looks completely different
now we see some weird angular graphics
at the top and it looks more like live
tiles so that's a quick look at the
Windows 8.1 preview running on the
surface pro tablet that's there for now
sure to give this video a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
