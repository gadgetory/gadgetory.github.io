the consumer preview of windows 8.1 this
is mainly a developer release for you
know testing applications someone not
but I decided to install it on my
surface pro right away so let's check it
out and see how it works so right now I
have one of the new features running
this is the new lockscreen slideshow so
it's taking pictures from you know a
couple my folders on the device and it's
doing a nice little mix you'll see them
change once in a while but that's a
really cool feature so next up we're
going to show you how quickly this boots
up and you just press the power button
and there we are and I'm logged in a
little bit quicker than normal windows 8
so next we have our new start screen and
you see I have tiles of all sorts of
different sizes we have the normal wide
ones the square ones and now I have even
larger square ones and very small small
ones so we have all sorts of sizes and
you can customize in layout however you
want if I tap and hold this is the new
edit mode let's get out of there
previously you had to like kind of tap
and swipe which was weird and then you
had to like drag and have a unsnap in
mood around so now we tap and hold
similarly to Windows Phone and I can see
I can select multiple ones at the same
time and down here we have options and
there's your resize option you can
change it like so and I can select two
of them at the same time and make them
both well that one did go large all
right only the main weather tile can go
to large let's say a separate pinned
so there you go and you see it's much
easier to see that you can name these
groups previously you have to zoom out
and then right click or tap and hold on
one of the groups you can't do that
anymore you have to tap and hold on an
item and then you can name the group so
different things here so that's the
customized mode and something that's not
immediately discoverable on a tablet
mode but if you use your mouse and move
around like so you'll see a little arrow
to see all of your apps and this is
really nicely done you can choose how to
sort them most used the installed name I
kind of like date installed because I
see which ones are the newest and you
can search here and get to whatever HAP
you want that way it's kind of redundant
because there's also the search bar
which is totally new and really nice so
let's go back to the start I can type
the name of an app and it is immediately
selected by going to enter and launch
that or and there goes I can hit the
search charm and we have everywhere
selected so it's going to search
everything we can change it to do
settings web images video files that's
the only options so let's search for
Kobe
and this is going to give us something
really cool thats a new kind of a beam
layout app and scooters all sorts of
search results for Colbie Caillat and i
can play music let's go ahead and do
that and it's jumping into the new xbox
music app and it's going to start
playing the music to eli's video and you
can see there's more results from the
web all sorts of websites here facebook
so lots of options pictures and now i'm
going to snap let's snap over here first
xbox music and you see the search
results have gone into a vertical
scrolling let's go back and the music is
playing over here and you see it's a
50-50 split view and we can change the
ratio and you see the music player turns
it to the narrow vertical format that's
pretty nice and this goes back to
horizontal scrolling and now let's see
what happens when i launched another app
hot weather well look at that that's
kind of weird it's just floating there
there's no indication of what I'm
supposed to do with this it looks like a
bug but really the reason it's doing
this is because I have to choose which
window pane I want it to go into so i
can put over here or i can put over here
so you got to choose i'm going to put
over here and now the app can load so
that's kind of weird here we go little
buggy there
now my weather is loading something that
I've been missing and using this for the
past couple hours or so there's no more
online integration there's no more
facebook messaging there's no more msn
messaging in the people of there's still
notifications for facebook events I mean
facebook notifications still show up
along with Twitter but there's no more
chat and the messaging app is completely
gone so you're going to have to use
skype for a windows messenger and we
hear there's going to be a facebook app
so maybe that will bring facebook
messaging back now let's look at the
settings a little bit over here while
we're on the start screen you can get to
the personalized area and we can choose
all sorts of different colors you can
also choose the background so that's
going to load my desktop background
let's go to the desktop and let's change
this personalized about the default
Windows theme and there we go so now you
see the background comes through on the
Start screen and that's pretty nice
depending on what kind of background
image you choose for your desktop and
you see the difference here it blends
really nicely another new thing is the
start button is back on the taskbar in
the desktop mode so you can get to that
but I don't care because it's also over
here on the charms we have some new apps
here this one's pretty nice
new bin food and drink so let's choose a
recipe and you can read it and there's a
new hands-free mode which is pretty cool
so it's hands-free mode on and use the
camera turned on and I can just wave my
hand and it is giving me the
instructions for this recipe so the
cameras see my hand and it just goes
through so your hands can be wet and
dirty and you can still read what you're
supposed to do next in the kitchen
that's pretty nice health and fitness
app for Bing we've got stuff like diet
tracker nutrition all sorts of cool
things the Photos app has been updated
but it has lost practically all the
functionality there's no more SkyDrive
there's no more facebook there's no
marks liquor let's look at the settings
you got nothing options it doesn't image
it doesn't even load pictures from other
folders that are set as pictures library
items this is only the default pictures
of library the games app is looking very
buggy see this is all squished
there we go it's loading and can't see
stuff down there and the friends we lost
all of our avatars the Maps app has been
updated it still goes straight to the
map with no controls or buttons so you
don't really know what you can do so you
might have to do a search or swipe from
the edge and you get more controls
and that gives us location and we see we
got some good information about that
I'll just facebook button and here's the
browser so it's loading the web page
that I clicked on right next to the
previous app that I was in that's pretty
nice creature now I can also tap and
hold on I'm link and then you see some
options down here copy link it doesn't
have the little pop-up menu anymore but
now I've got two browser windows side by
side so maybe I want to go to Facebook
on this one no problem now let's look at
the PC settings so there's a completely
different layout here who's your
slideshow options you choose folders for
this slideshow lock screen and we can
see pc and devices options there's a
lock screen their display change the
resolution lots of options here
the new settings area is much more
comprehensive for the keyboard junkies
windows X will give you quick access to
shut down as well as lots of other great
power user features so with about two
clicks you can get to all this important
stuff for the power users but on our
tablet we got lots of touch friendly
options to the Windows Store has a new
layout sound looks completely different
now I see some weird angular graphics to
the top and it looks more like live
tiles so that's a quick look at the
windows 8.1 preview running on the
surface pro tablet that's it for now
sure to give this video a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
