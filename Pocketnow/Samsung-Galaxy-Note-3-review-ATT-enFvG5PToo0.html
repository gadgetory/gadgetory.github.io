smartphone tablet hybrid is now out and
available and as we learned in our
extensive review of the global galaxy
note 3 it's a force to be reckoned with
now we're taking a look at the stateside
model I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and this is our full review of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 for AT&amp;amp;T the
Galaxy Note 3 the latest addition to one
of Samsung's most unlikely popular
brands is the first to receive a slight
exemption to his design rules as Michael
explained in his review of the Exynos
equipped global edition the note 3
features a lined faux metal trim to
mimic the pages of a notebook though we
also feel it resembles the metal trim on
a 50s era diner or saloon car and the
rear plastic battery door imitates a
leather texture with fake stitching
around its edges the somme this
imitation comes off as a bit cheesy but
we like the change from the scratch and
fingerprint magnet hyper glaze coating
of years past the texture in the faux
leather allows for a considerable amount
of grip and simply makes the device feel
nicer in the hand like its predecessor
the note 3 is a handful but Samsung is
up to its old tricks again the note 3
sports a slightly larger display than
the note 2 5.7 inches instead of 5.5 yet
its physical measurements are smaller in
nearly every dimension it's also
significantly lighter 15 grams to be
exact
yet in the hand those differences are
hardly noticeable and that's a good
thing the hardware is subtle and that
means Samsung is on the right track the
note 3 doesn't feel like a cheap toy an
improvement we can't help but notice
also improved are the specs in almost
every way the combination of a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core Krait 400 CPU and
Adreno 330 GPU is impossibly fast it
comes with an impressive three gigabytes
of RAM a first it has a 13 megapixel
camera around back 2 megapixel camera on
the front as well as a beautiful 5.7
inch 1080p Super AMOLED display of
course the 3200 million power battery is
removable and it comes with a micro SD
card slot just above the SIM slot it
also has no shortage of connectivity
options or sensors LTE Bluetooth Low
Energy Wi-Fi AC infrared NFC barometer
thermometer etc oh and it all
has USB 3.0 along the bottom edge to
boot another first and lest we forget
the s-pen the sole tool that makes this
device part of the Galaxy Note brand and
not one of the others that blends in
with the masses its new and improved
with a rubberized tip and a design that
allows it to slip into its integrated
holster in two orientations all of this
and Samsung has still maintained every
detail which makes this device a note
without blowing out its proportions or
losing sight of what's most important
value proposition versus size and that
brings us into what alongside the s-pen
takes the note series so special all the
additional display real estate is
effectively useless without software to
take advantage of it along with all of
Samsung's feature dues or such as smart
stay smart rotate s-health
Samsung hub watch on etc the S Pen comes
with its own software suite pull the S
Pen out of its holster and Air Command a
radial palette of actions appears action
memo scrapbooker screen right s finder
in the pin window most of these are
features that cannot easily be imitated
at least not with the same level of
integration or ease of use within
certain apps the S Pen can be used to
slowly pan in any direction thanks to
air view pressing the button and double
tapping the display brings up action
memo and pressing the button plus a long
press quickly captures the current
screen without these features and its
pressure sensitivity the S Pen would be
no better than any old capacitive stylus
if you want the absolute best smartphone
for multitasking this is it / multi
window with pin windows floating apps
and you have the utmost utility at your
fingertips you can literally have five
six or even more apps open at once
excessive sure but it's there for the
taking there are some low points worth
mentioning though the software is
bloated beyond belief as anyone who is
used a touchless device before knows all
too well
a staggering six gigabytes of the
initial 32 is reserved for the system
alone 6 gigabytes for a suite of
software most of which will never be
used and sure it seems trivial to
complain about 6 gigabytes when you have
over 20 gigabytes left and a micro SD
card slot for expansion the TouchWiz
still seems to buy even the most
powerful smartphones down at times
fortunately we haven't experienced the
same kind of performance problems with
this model as we did with the eggs under
powered note 3 but there are times when
we wonder how much better this device
could perform with an all-around lighter
UI we can't say we've experienced any
noticeable lag with the note 3 yet but
there are times where 2 fills hesitant
to return home yes even with the S voice
shortcut disabled load a new app or even
open the app drawer his performance in
benchmarks as you would expect is
nothing short of phenomenal but let's
not get tied up in that argument what
matters here is real-world performance
and the note 3 delivers exceptionally
well gaming with the 1080p display and
Snapdragon 800 is second to none
graphics are beautiful and fluid we
couldn't ask for a better gaming
experience on a smartphone and the 12.16
wide hour battery is more than enough to
power you through an entire day of
fairly heavy use including short spurts
of heavy gaming since we received the
AT&amp;amp;T note 3 review unit last Wednesday
VfL to successfully drain the battery
fully in a single day one of the only
upsetting features of the note 3 is the
loudspeaker it's more tinny than we
expected and it struggles with volume
even when your finger isn't accidentally
covering the thrill this carries over
into the speakerphone performance which
is not very impressive using the
earpiece speaker calls are clear and
crisp and the volume is loud though it
could be louder for use in noisy
environments even with the extra volume
setting enabled data speeds have been
average in the Charlotte metro area
averaging upwards of 10 megabits per
second down and 7 megabits per second up
even in the typical signal abyss in the
Charlotte office finally the camera is
every bit as impressive as we imagined
like the 13 megapixel shooter on the s4
the note 3 provides vivid warm colors
with a considerable amount of detail in
great lighting by today's standards the
note 3's low-light performance however
is subpar without optical image
stabilization the note 3 is forced to
use Samsung's somewhat confusing smart
stabilization software which provides
passable yet not very impressive
low-light images unlike the global model
the Snapdragon equipped Note 3 is
capable of capturing 4k video like with
1080p the quality is great colors pop
assuming the white balance isn't thrown
for a loop and accurate we did note that
the footage got a bit jittery shooting
at 4k and prepare for extremely large
files 121 second clip weighed in at a
hundred and thirty two megabytes
put simply the galaxy note 3 is the best
smartphone Samsung has made ever it's
more than a worthy upgrade to the note 2
and it provides one of the most
compelling user experiences to date as
well as one of the most compelling
arguments for larger display smart
phones making full use of its 5.7 inch
panel and that paired with the s-pen
exceptional hardware battery life and
unbelievable performance is why we give
the Galaxy Note 3 a 9 point 3 out of 10
