being the company's largest event but
also for being very software oriented
ever since the last iPhone they
announced that that event a few years
ago that being said Apple does regard
itself as a software company it does
play a major role so I'm high Meadow me
better with pocket now let's talk about
what to expect believe it or not we're
going to begin this video talking about
OS 10 because we think it's now going to
be called Mac OS it's that time when iOS
is actually turning 10 and therefore to
avoid any sort of confusion we've seen
rumors where it's now going to change to
mac OS with the whole camel case just
like we currently see with iOS TV OS and
watch OS now the changes aren't expected
to be major apparently Apple will give
you now options to have Siri on Mac OS
which is great but in addition to that
apparently you'll be able to unlock your
computer through your iPhone pretty much
the same way you can do so with the
Apple watch through touch ID obviously
this is the smartest way to bring touch
ID to a computer without having to make
any amendments to hardware because we're
not really expecting that to change much
and speaking of Siri that has to be
another major change google i/o showed
us google assistant and it pretty much
left Siri to shame we've heard two
separate rumors over what to expect
number one that Apple has made a few
acquisitions of AI companies obviously
with the focus of improving their
artificial intelligence that's good the
second is SDK support because currently
sir you can only tinker with
applications that come built into the
iphone apparently third-party
applications will now be able to take
advantage of Siri even though we still
don't believe that that will be enough
to compete with assistance from google
then again we could be wrong let's see
what we get now we do expect a major
change to come to watch os3 we just
haven't heard any rumors of it the
reason why we're assuming this is
because watch os/2 as it stands is
terrible applications barely load at
times the watch is extremely clunky and
it just does not make sense for you to
spend three hundred and fifty dollars on
a watch that only gives you the time
because that's pretty much the only
thing that the
watch concurrently do we're not
expecting any hardware refreshes but it
could just be that Apple figures out a
way to optimize watch OS and make it a
little more usable it's either that or
the apple watch will just continue on
the Cline now believe it or not this has
been the year with the least amount of
rumors focused on iOS up to the point
where we only hear about service changes
coming to iOS 10 we could be wrong but
so far we talked about Siri already it
seems that other changes will come to
Apple music because indeed there is a
desperate need for an update it is
currently extremely convoluted
apparently Apple will focus on that we
also hear that Apple pay might get a
little more robust with other options to
be able to swipe your phone instead of
having the contactless payment that's
not available in every store and in
addition to that we also hear changes to
the App Store like for example things
like subscriptions but not subscriptions
for you to be able to have all the apps
you want we're talking about
subscriptions to help developers
monetize more for applications iOS 10
should be major just because its iOS 10
there is a major number change here just
like OS 10 was in the past but we could
also be wrong Apple is desperate for
changes it is in need of improvements
for things like the iPhone we're at
least expecting some major improvements
coming to touch ID and options of what
to do with it as I'm one of those users
it just doesn't care about it now we're
going to wrap this video up with one
thing that's common for all Apple events
the one more thing it doesn't always
happen but it could just be that at this
event we will be getting something there
are no rumors for hardware but we have
seen the shells of the macbook pro with
the USB type-c new speakers in addition
to a new keyboard type could just be
that that's coming it could also be that
we're getting the TV subscription
services that should have made the Apple
TV since day one could just be anything
else we'd love to know in the comments
down below what you think that one more
thing might be or what you would like to
see in my case I want a new Apple watch
one that actually works it was a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion thats it for our quick
predictions video of what to expect for
