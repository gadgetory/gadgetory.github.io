com you're watching a comparison between
androids Ice Cream Sandwich and windows
phone mango let's check it out okay now
let's do a little browser comparison
between ice cream sandwich and mango so
there we have the android browser that's
a button to go to different tabs this is
your menu button and that's your
bookmarks so let's go to the same page
and let's do an html5 performance demo
let's see if I can get them at the same
time there we go both of these devices
are connected to Wi-Fi so it's fair
especially since LTE over here is a
little bit unstable for me and you can
see the performance differences let's
try another one there we go and you can
also see the frames per second
yeah 17 frames per second over here and
about 22 over here
we have music yep there's another
performance comparison and now let's do
some regular websites actually let's
look at the interface a little bit we
don't have any navigation on the screen
until you move it and now your address
bar is up there so it goes away when
you're looking at the web page so you
can get more more of the view whereas
here we have a little address bar as
always there and the menu is always
there as well which makes it easy to
access but you know it does cover up a
little bit so to get the bookmarks you
gotta go to favorites and let's go to
pocket now you'll get them both the same
time and that one loaded d desktop
version instead okay let's try that
again well do this this first one at the
same time pretty quick
now let's do the video
we'll choose browser so both pretty
close and let's press play
there we go
both pretty good at playing youtube
videos all right now let's go to the
desktop version and who's finished first
taking a while
both pretty good now let's stop zoom in
both pretty smooth
one more thing android we have we do
have flash support so see if i go to
flash com it's going to say on mango
this content requires flash whereas on
Android we have it spleen pretty nicely
except when you have to move it can zoom
out
and
it gets a little bit unresponsive but
flash does work on the ice cream
sandwich so there you have our browser
comparison between Windows Phone mango
and androids Ice Cream Sandwich give us
a thumbs up if you liked this video and
that's it for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
