huge section of the market is affordable
phones and a lot of the time the cheaper
the phone the lower the quality these
two phones break that stereotype
bringing high performance at a low cost
I'm hi out to Houston with PocketNow and
this is the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3
versus Motorola's 2014 Moto G first
things first the hardware these two
phones have pretty similar designs both
bodies are made entirely of plastic both
feature front firing speakers and both
utilize on-screen buttons the most
obvious difference here is size the Moto
G is already fairly large with a 5-inch
display but the idol 3 packs an
additional half an inch bringing it up
to 5.5 inches measured diagonally the
idol 3 also has an advantage in pixel
density the Moto G's 720p display sits
at a reasonably 294 pixels per inch but
the idol 3 packs 401 pixels with it's
1080p panel if you're shopping for a
low-cost smartphone little things like
this might not bother you but the
difference is definitely noticeable when
you hold the two phones side-by-side
also noticeable is the difference in
screen quality where the idol 3 wins
again with its superior color
reproduction and viewing angles
internally the Moto G packs a quad-core
Snapdragon 400 processor clocked at 1.2
gigahertz within a dream of 305 GPU and
a gigabyte of RAM the idol 3 sports an
octa-core Snapdragon 615 at 1.5
gigahertz with the adrenal 405 and 2
gigabytes of RAM moto G with a 20 70
milliamp hour battery idle 3 with a 29
10 million power battery both support
microSD expansion but the Anil 3 has
double the internal space to begin with
versus the Moto G with 16 gigabytes to
work with versus the 8 gigabytes
respectively a lot of these spec
differences can be blamed on more
internal space to work with or an 8
month gap in release but no matter how
you look at it it's abundantly clear
here that Alcatel has the advantage in
hardware
moving onto the software side of things
both phones ship with a very close to
stock Android experience both of our
units are running android 5.0.2 though
your moto G might soon be updated to 5.1
mine hasn't seen that update quite yet
Motorola is offering certainly looks
closer to stock and in fact for all
intents and purposes it is running stock
Android with a few Motorola tweaks to
enhance the experience features like
moto assist that smartly judge when you
might be driving or sleeping or in a
meeting and adjust the phone's behavior
accordingly
there's also moto migrate to make moving
from another phone a bit easier jumping
to the idol 3 while the software
experience is definitely that of stock
Android it doesn't really look the part
Alcatel has added some custom icons and
a few tweaked apps but rest assured when
you launch the phone dialer or a clock
it's the same software that you'll find
on the Moto G the companies made a few
changes of their own like the quick
access toggles on the lock screen to
launch frequently used apps but again
both phones are nearly identical in
software without leaving any outstanding
features to indicate a clear winner
cameras are another gray area neither
phone has a particularly good camera and
both suffer from similar problems poor
saturation lack of depth digital noise
and so on they're not the worst cameras
in the world but don't expect either to
produce stunning results under any
circumstances in daily use both phones
are surprisingly fast given their price
tag neither phone suffers from excessive
stutter or lag and neither feels like a
budget phone if we had to say one phone
was faster than the other it'd have to
be the idol three by a hair but then
again that's to be expected when you're
operating with double the cores and RAM
all so predictable based on specs is the
idol threes superb battery life which is
something the Moto G just can't match
where the Moto G clocks out at about
three hours of screen on time the idol 3
can go anywhere from four to five and a
half hours on a single charge all while
powering a bigger sharper display
so what's the verdict well motorola is
offering with the Moto G was and
continues to be a great option for
anyone looking to save a buck and still
get a great phone but it came out back
in September and the next refresh is
probably less than half a year away if
you already have a 2014 Moto G there's
no need to rush out and order the idol 3
but it goes without saying that given
the superior specs the sharper display
and a longer battery life the idol 3
from Alcatel OneTouch is probably the
better bang for your buck here if you
