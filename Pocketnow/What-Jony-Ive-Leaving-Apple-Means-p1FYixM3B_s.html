Cupertino as Johnny Isle is leaving
Apple to create his own company later
this year we have a new case renders for
the Galaxy Note and this show off the
devices curves and still no headphone
jack
it looks like companies are finding
their ways around the Huawei Ben and
have resumed their shipments I'm happy
that I end up last day in Tokyo but I'm
actually gonna continue in Japan for a
couple of days it's been great but wow
these news of Johnny and I've they're
they're hot this is bargain al daily the
official news today begin with deals
don't don't worry it's not about Apple
it's actually about Google home minis
they're currently $25 and there are a
couple of retailers that are offering
these for a discount like PNH Amazon
Google I can't really tell you that I
recommend the Google home Mini as my
favorite speaker I mean if you've got a
small room and you want the Google
assistant to be there with you it's
really practical I've got a few don't
get me wrong but still it's retailed for
49 bucks over 25 that's actually good
though it could mean we've got a new
mini coming soon now let's talk about
the Sony Xperia one a lot of people were
like whoa you're in Japan are you there
for anything Sony you know it's funny I
try to understand how Sony works their
PR because even though we have a really
good relationship with them there are
never announcements here in Japan for
their mobile division and well we still
don't have a unit cuz that's the way it
is in the United States but anyways
pre-orders have begun the launch is for
July 12th but the interesting part is
whoa the Sony mark 3 headphones are my
favorite hands down and they're
currently bundled with the Xperia one of
you pre-order so you're saving three
hundred and fifty bucks right there so
that is a good deal it's not like if the
Experion one is a bad phone it's
actually a really good phone my buddy
bored at work and a bong I'd say I
already reviewed it so I highly
recommend you watch his videos on this
now let's talk about Apple and
investments again it's interesting that
I'm talking about Japanese companies
right now and I'm in Japan but think
about it is the company has decided to
invest more money in Japan this play
this is interesting I had really not
realized that the company had invested
1.5 billion dollars
in 2015 in Japan display and apparently
the company has decided to invest even
more money to keep the company alive
right now obviously the only other
provider of LCD displays is LG so pretty
much Apple has a stake in Japan display
in order to keep competition obviously
drive the prices down I assume that
that's the strategy but also because the
company has also begun providing all ads
which also help provide the amount of
displays needed for the Apple watch in
addition to Samsung and LG in certain
cases so yeah this is the way Apple does
things it's good to see that there's
another company out there let's just see
what that means for future Apple
products now let's move the spotlight
over the wall way and certain
developments I mean I'm WC in Shanghai
is currently underway and the company
has just pretty much announced that they
have already secured 50 contracts or 5g
that they have also deployed a hundred
and fifty thousand base stations for 5g
we know that there are countries in
Europe that have already signed on with
Huawei we've got Russian obviously other
countries around the world and it's just
interesting to see that the company
again countries continue even with all
the threats from the United States even
funnier is the fact that US companies
have already figured out a way around
the China ban and even Chinese companies
back and forth we forgot qualcomm just
to mention some that have already begun
redistributing their products to Chinese
companies and back and forth because you
know trade that's the whole idea and
this was a u.s. idea anyways so yeah
that is a deal right now let's see how
this continues to evolve and how about
if we move the spotlight over to the
Galaxy Note 10 at unev us have
considered that it would be great if we
saw a galaxy note without curves and
part of the rumors were that at least
one of these two Galaxy Notes was not
going to bring curbs
which is one of the main reasons why I
was really enticed for the note 10 to
small variant but we've got some case
razors and do you know the way it goes
once these are out that's that's it and
so apparently we are getting curbs
across the board curved displays curved
backs apparently there is a silo for the
stylus which is fine we were expecting
that but we don't see a compartment for
the headphone jack this is obviously sad
it seems that this is going to be the
way to go I can't wait to see that
presentation and hear the reasons why
we're getting
the headphone jack being killed on the
galaxy after the company has spent years
marking others for losing it we'll see
about that
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with Apple and the end of an era
there is an apple before the return of C
Jobs an Apple after and well that return
of Steve Jobs includes Jonathan Ive
taking over the design studio or
creating the design studio that's pretty
much made the most iconic mobile
products that we used today starting
with the first generation iMac the iPod
iPhone and absolutely everything else
that we've seen later I mean John Ã«if
has been extremely famous not just
admired by you know people that use
Apple products but designers in general
even dieter Rams who's famous for his
simplistic design back in the day
admired Johnny Ivan so he's starting his
new company called the love form along
with Marc Newson and well the question
is what's going to happen with the
feature of design for Apple obviously
one of the biggest concerns is that
whole you know Mac Pro display and the
fact that the stand is separate so
vehicles like my god a lot of things
start making sense now
I don't think that's gonna be the case
but yeah he is going to continue working
with Apple apparently Apple is going to
be one of the company's major customers
obviously there will be others and it's
rather interesting what isn't in the
comments down below what do you think
are you concerned for Apple because of
the departure of Johnny ever not in my
case I'm not because of Apple's going to
be the major customer that I know who's
going to be a consultant and in another
way I do love the fact that companies
can hire Johnny I've to provide them
insight on design so this could be a
great new time for mobile products or
other things that's just me let us know
what you think in the comments down
below
