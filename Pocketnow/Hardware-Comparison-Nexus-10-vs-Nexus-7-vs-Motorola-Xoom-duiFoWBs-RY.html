pocketnow.com michael fisher unboxed us
the nexus 10 just a little while ago if
you missed that video make sure you
stick around to the end of this one i'll
give you a link directly to it but today
i want to show you a comparison between
the nexus 10 the motorola xoom and the
nexus 7 let's go take a look so first
off we've got the brand new Nexus 10 if
you haven't had a chance to hold one of
these things yet I've just got a mirror
what Michael Fisher said this thing is
amazingly light this back plastic is
incredibly grippy in fact I've got this
test here where you just hold it on your
hand that's over 45 degrees i'm not
holding on to any edge it's just not
moving it's great i love this feel it's
lightweight you've got enough room
enough bezel to put your thumbs just all
around really nice but what we want to
do now is compare this to a couple other
tablets so the other tablets that google
has of course is the nexus 7 and then
they've also got kind of the the
redheaded stepchild right here which is
the motorola xoom now this isn't
necessarily a Nexus device but it is a
launch device or launch partner device
where motorola Google got together and
launched honeycomb the redheaded
stepchild of Android versions but we're
not here to talk about software let's
talk about hardware first of all you can
see that the zoom is just a little bit
smaller in front dimensions then the
zoom is which is really surprising
because in hand it feels a lot smaller a
lot of that get a side shot here a lot
of that is because of the thickness so
if you take a look at the thickness you
can definitely see the difference there
the zoom which is this one I'll move it
over here has a nice rounded back so it
doesn't feel quite as thick as it looks
so on the edge you can see it's it's not
nearly as thick as it is over here in
the middle the zoom still feels nice in
hand but the nexus 10 just feels so much
nicer it feels solid it feels
like a high quality construction even
though it's so thin okay so on the Nexus
10 we've got a 10 point zero 5 inch
display at 2560 by 1600 compared it to
the zoom which has a 10.1 inch 1280 by
800 display the pixel density on the
zoom is 150 PPI whereas the pixel
density on the 10 is 300 PPI so about
twice as many pixels and twice the
density of those pixels on the Nexus 10
sticking with the 10 for a minute we've
got a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core Exynos 5
processor compared to the zooms 1
gigahertz dual-core nvidia tegra 2
processor so a good comparison as far as
size goes but not much else let's switch
gears and look at the Nexus 7 so here
we've got the the nexus 7 obviously
significantly smaller that's the
difference between a 7 inch and a 10
inch so let's get right to that we've
got a seven inch display up here running
1280 by 800 and about 216 PPI the
processor inside of this is 1.2
gigahertz but its quad-core the fact
that it's an NVIDIA Tegra 3 so what
makes up the difference between the 1.7
dual core versus the 1.2 quad-core
there's also that speed difference in
there looking around the Nexus 7 you've
got this nice dimpled back that you have
up at the top of the Nexus 10 this is
relatively grippy but it has no
comparison to the grip eNOS of the Nexus
10 if we were to do that 45 degree angle
I don't know if I can quite do that
because it's still a little slippery you
still have to kind of hold on to it no
rear facing camera here volume buttons
and whatnot in power over there so kind
of in the same location although a
different orientation the reason for
that you're supposed to hold your 7 like
this in portrait view so volume up is on
the top volume down is on the bottom
versus on your 10 when you're holding it
like this and your volume slider
goes that way your volume up is over to
the right and your volume down is over
to the left as far as which one I'd like
to carry around in my pocket well
obviously neither one of these is going
to fit well in a pocket but their votes
both very portable this one especially
because it's so lightweight and so thin
but feels so durable so then you go a
quick look at all three of the tablets
from google the zoom the nexus 10 and
the nexus 7 how they kind of stack up
and compared with one another we're
going to keep working on our full review
so make sure if you haven't subscribed
to our video channel that you do that so
you don't miss out on that and of course
the videos that we're going to have
leading up to it if you want to follow
us over on Twitter so you don't miss out
on any of that we are at pocket now
tweets for pocket now showing off
tablets I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
