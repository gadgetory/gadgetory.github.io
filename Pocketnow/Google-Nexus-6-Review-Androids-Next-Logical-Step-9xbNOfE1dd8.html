and there's a lot of prime technology
packed into its ponderous frame does
this Jolly blue giant punch above its
weight class or fall on its fat face
well neither but it's still the boldest
Nexus yet I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our Nexus 6 review
brought to you by Al key as we discussed
in our earlier Nexus 6 comparisons with
the Moto X and Nexus 5
Google's newest smartphone doesn't have
much in common with either its immediate
predecessor or its Moto from another
mother most obviously the Nexus 6 is big
as its Motorola code name implies and
while we've seen oversized smartphones
before we haven't seen one bearing the
Nexus name on the one hand this isn't
great while other so-called phablets
have justified their large screens by
filling the expanded canvas with extra
features stock Android doesn't do that
yet so you're left with a smartphone
experience that just feels kind of
inflated sound familiar look at the new
calendar app it's wonderful and
functional yes but on a screen this big
and sharp why is there so much wasted
space why don't I have two column view
in messaging apps or the ability to use
Google now or the homescreen and
landscape mode if I want this thing's
only an inch smaller than last year's
Nexus 7 so it seems odd to restrict me
from treating it like the pseudo phablet
it is on the other hand the big screen
does offer the usual advantages in
browsing video reading and gaming
sometimes bigger is just better and on a
broader note average smartphone screen
size is ballooning and these larger
phones are selling to expect Google to
sit on the sidelines for that is kind of
irrational so yes
the Nexus 6 is a big phone because it
has to be and in exchange for that
bigness you get some of the best specs
you can find on a smart phone in 2014
specs that'll hold up well into next
year on top of that
Motorola's industrial design is
outstanding as ever with an aluminum
antenna band subtly tinted to match
comfortably curved backside a spine
dimple so you know where to rest your
finger and loud front firing speakers
two of them dotting the Gorilla Glass 3
up front I wish the soft touch paint job
from the Nexus 5 could have made a
return here because the plastic is a bit
slippery on white and blue versions of
the six but you can't have it all the
big Nexus banner on the back means this
phone is also a software showcase and
here of course we're talking about
Android 5.0 lollipop this is to our eye
the most beautiful version of Android
with gorgeous animations and more
attention to detail than we've seen from
the platform in the past it's a version
of Android I'd feel comfortable
recommending to someone intimidated by
technology it's friendly enough for them
while still powerful enough for
technophiles and if you have both types
of people in the same family you can
switch back and forth between user
profiles on the same phone so you're
each set up with your own home screen
and your own apps owners are admirers of
the Moto X we'll also find things to
like here there's a low-power lockscreen
called ambient display that wakes up
when you pull it from a pocket or pick
it up from a desk and you can double tap
a notification to jump right into the
corresponding app and you can interact
with the Nexus 6 with your voice
even when the screen is off both of
these features are better realized on
the Moto X but it's great to see them
here nonetheless ok Google what's the
length of the USS Enterprise there are
some downsides to lollipop on the 6 the
size of the device makes one-handed use
difficult especially if you're lying
down and you want to get to the top of
the screen say to access your
notifications it's frustrating that
Google didn't add a shortcut toggle down
low for that purpose as some other
manufacturers have done on their builds
of Android more frustrating is the new
volume control paradigm it took two
steps to silence the ringer on the
previous version of Android it takes
double that on lollipop if you're
listening to a song or a podcast you
can't control the ringer behavior
without digging into the Settings app
or closing whatever you're listening to
and while we appreciate the device wide
encryptions lollipop brings all
throughout the OS there are hints of lag
stutter and hiccup whatever you want to
call it many people think the encryption
is to blame for it whatever the reason
it's disheartening to see stock Android
stutter in 2014 the Nexus 6 camera is
powered by a slightly upgraded version
of the Google camera app we've got to
know a few months back it's friendly
colorful and simple to use and that goes
a little ways toward making up for its
lack of manual controls as for the
camera itself this is a 13 megapixel
Sony sensor with optical stabilization
and a fancy ring diffuser on its dual
LED flash and the photos it kicks out
are fine thanks to those comparison
videos you mentioned earlier we know we
prefer the Nexus 6 s photos to those of
the Moto X and mostly the Nexus 5 so
it's great to see that progress here I
wouldn't mind a bit more punch to colors
in contrast this camera tends to err on
the safe side when it comes to the
authentic versus oversaturated debate
but you may prefer a more faithful
reproduction of color to a more vibrant
photo so that's a matter of preference
my only real letdown is low-light
performance which is just average and
it's annoying to have to toggle HDR mode
to really milk the highlights from those
darker scenes the stabilization does do
a fine job in video mode thankfully and
while the focus jumps around a little
bit the auto exposure is very quick to
adjust to changing lighting conditions
overall this is a fine camcorder in
1080p and you can shoot in 4k too if you
want so what about the day to day slog
we've had the Nexus 6 for nine days
enough time to answer some of the
questions you asked in the comments of
our unboxing video and a popular one was
what's it like to use such a big phone
as a daily driver
the answer awkward on the ear and taxing
on the pockets but not only do you get
used to it you learn to appreciate it in
everything from added space on the
keyboard to added room for movies
the Nexus as you can tell the front
firing speakers are incredibly good but
I've had issues with variable or
distorted audio in some apps like
Spotify and Sparkle - and I'm not the
only one add that to the list of
lollipop issues Google needs to sort out
better news near as I can tell audio
through earbuds is just as good here as
on any other modern Android that goes
for everything from podcasts to hardcore
gaming which the Nexus 6 handles as
nicely as you'd expect given its Burley
spec loadout while we're looking at that
display you also asked about reports of
variable color temperature and burn in
or image retention well I haven't
noticed anything of the kind on our
unlocked or AT&amp;amp;T branded units this
could be a batch specific issue there is
a pronounced pink tint on the screens
dimmest setting but that's a small price
to pay for being able to comfortably use
your phone and dark environments on
medium to high brightness the screen is
just okay in direct sunlight indoors
it's quite vibrant with amyloids
bottomless blacks and saturated colors
making it stand out nicely I had no
trouble talking on the Nexus 6 this is a
Motorola handset after all and
everything from audio quality to
reception was spot-on my trouble came
instead when I wanted to talk for a
while or really do anything for a while
because as big as this battery is it
should really last longer than five and
a half hours of screen on time
in fact I'm lucky to get to four hours
of screen on time in a day-long period
with moderate mixed use screen
brightness set to medium automatic and
excellent LTE coverage on AT&amp;amp;T
fortunately lollipop gives you a battery
saver mode if you get into trouble and
the Nexus 6 also gives you a few ways to
charge it you've got a turbo charger
right in the box that'll kick the phone
from 0 to 15% in 10 minutes and a half
charge in 40 minutes if you're more
beguiled by convenience than speed
you've got qi wireless charging built
right in so you can drop it on a charger
like the LG luna the most stylish
wireless charger i've ever seen by the
and keep an eye on your notifications
while you top-up check the description
below for details on that so what we
have in the Nexus 6 is a rather mixed
bag you're getting a fantastic spec
sheet made into the most compatible and
capable Radio stack around and lollipop
is the prettiest Android yet in other
ways like fluidity big screen
optimizations and living up to big
promises about the battery life it falls
flat given that compromised you might
expect me to say it's full retail price
looks a little high but it really
doesn't look at the equivalents on iOS
and Windows Phone and the Nexus 6 kind
of slots neatly in between them
consumers just think the Nexus 6 is
overpriced because the last two
generations of Nexus phones have been
wildly under priced and if cost is an
issue you can get the Nexus 6 for
cheaper or at least on an installment
plan if you agree to a carrier contract
to bring it all home the Nexus 6 is a
lot like most large format smartphones
with some missed opportunities on
hardware and software alike but it also
brings stock Android and a promise of
timely updates backed up by a great
track record assuming those updates
continue to land regularly that makes
the Nexus 6 if not our first choice then
at least a solid Buy
and a worthy addition to the Nexus
portfolio this review was brought to you
by al key maker of computer peripherals
mobile power banks bluetooth speakers
and of course wireless chargers like the
Luna you saw in the video every alkie
product was designed with details in
mind by passionate gadget lovers who
live and breathe technology and with a
comprehensive worryfree guarantee
customers spent less time fretting and
more time enjoying cutting-edge gadgets
so why make your digital life hard make
it smart without key
