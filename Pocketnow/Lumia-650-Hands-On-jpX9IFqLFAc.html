already know about the Lumia 650 but not
because of its features or its standout
specs it's because it's a mid-range
phone that looks better than most
current Windows Mobile flagships I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow at MWC
2016 in Barcelona
let's go hands-on let's get one thing
straight right up front
you're not gonna mistake the 650 for a
high-end device at 122 grams it's super
lightweight in the way that affordable
phones are and there's very little about
the industrial design that sets it apart
from countless Android mid Ranger's that
we've seen for years but in the Lumia
world where unremarkable and sometimes
chintzy plastic dominates the high-end
the 650 brings a much needed dose of
design Flair tempered aluminum side
rails bracket a matte polycarbonate back
that snaps off so you can access the
micro SD card and removable 2000
milliamp hour battery that's pretty
small and there's no dedicated camera
key which is a shame but the 5-inch OLED
display is gorgeous nothing about the
spec sheet is a surprise from the
snapdragon 212 processor to the 8
megapixel camera to the lack of
continuum support remember this is a
phone that's selling for a reference
price of $199 us which is actually kind
of expensive given the Android
competition but compared to say the
Lumia 950 that's a bargain and a bargain
is just what the 650 was built to be I
just didn't expect such a low-end
Windows Phone to look and feel so nice
in the hand here's hoping Microsoft
brings this level of fit and finish -
its next round of home-built flagships
we've seen other Windows devices at MWC
2016 including a huawei convertible and
the phone formerly known as the HP
Falcon check them out here on YouTube
