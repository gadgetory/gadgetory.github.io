year for phablet fans where we used to
experiment with a number of large screen
phones now displays above that 5.5 inch
diagonal are becoming a bit of a rarity
Huawei is wrapping up the year with a
beast of a phone so let's see how it
stacks up to the competition and first
for you Hardware junkies you can pause
the video here to check out what this
slab is packing and with that wrapped up
there's no way around it the mate 9 is a
big phone but we need to start with
praise as Huawei has done a fantastic
job of minimizing bezel sizes on the
front face there's little else to look
at just this big old screen this layout
does a respectable job of keeping the
phone in your hand
the rear mounted fingerprint sensor is
appreciated controls both on the
right-hand side though I mostly kept the
plastic cover on to help provide just a
touch more grip it is attractive
hardware especially these glossy sides
with an almost jewel like faucet running
around the display edge though these
traditional Huawei cutouts on the back
could be cleaned up it's an abrupt stop
for these antenna bands ultimately
though it's a premium price device and
it definitely looks the part
approaching mini tablet sizes you're apt
to use the phone a little farther away
from your face but we still would have
preferred moving up to a quad HD display
on this device 1080p is more than
adequate for getting your daily tasks
done but switching to smaller text it's
not quite as sharp for fine detail when
I do get the phone closer to my face
it's also not the best screen resolution
for diving into a little virtual reality
but it will easily be pentile AMOLED
screens under magnification its
respectably bright decently readable
outdoors in auto mode it falls just a
fraction behind the LGV 20 but it's
easier to get the hallway up to that
maximum brightness where LG all what
requires using the phone in direct
sunlight we do appreciate this quick
toggle for the iComfort mode we just
wish the screen got dimmer for late
night reading and just a quick mention
this phone does have an IR blaster to
use the mate as a universal remote we're
big fans of this feature especially with
the small child in the house who loves
hiding our TV remote now moving over to
software we're running emu i5 on top of
Android
seven Donegan it's a much-improved combo
over previous wall ways and honors we've
used in the past emui five defaults to
the home screen only view where all of
your apps are just on your home screens
but it's an easy toggle to return the
app drawer a lot of these menus have
been cleaned up where we used to have to
dig through more options now key
settings are a little easier to find and
we're also happy to see this new shade
no longer the iOS style split between
settings and notifications it's a more
traditional Android layout and Huawei
continues to use the fingerprint gesture
as a way to pull that shade down it's
not all roses though some folks will
likely chafe at some of these settings
confirmation dialogs the main settings
menu still has an iOS flair to it and
can we talk about notification icons
because there aren't any nope you just
get this little number if you don't want
the number then you get nothing
literally nothing this is terrible
designed for those at a glance moments
when you just want to see what's going
on we're really hoping this has changed
in a future build of emui
and we also have a little bloat I mean
pre-installed value added software news
Republic booking.com todoist and WPS
office if these apps aren't your cup of
tea they can be uninstalled we can't
fault the performance here though the
karin 960 chipset does a wonderful job
driving this phone you'll rarely
encounter stutters or lags even digging
into features like split-screen
multitasking for CPU intensive tasks
this phone is a screamer and takes a
significant step up in graphics
performance over the mate 8 in
benchmarks it falls between 10 and 15%
behind the Qualcomm 821 but running
through games like Marvel future fight
and implosion we're maintaining fluid
frame rates at high graphics quality
while Wei is showcasing on device
machine learning to better predict your
behavior and to better allocate
resources to the services you use most
over time Huawei claims this should
maintain fast performance when other
androids start to slow down in our
limited time using the phone we can't
quite comment on that feature so we'll
have to revisit that at a later date
Wi-Fi performance is solid hanging
directly with phones like the LGV 20 and
just slightly behind glass and plastic
back phones but we were pleasantly
surprised by the LTE radios on the mate
9 it was often within 2 decibels of our
galaxy s7 active around town and it
absolutely shamed our HTC 10 using
androids Network reporting we've
produced a separate video detailing
audio performance but as a brief
summation the story here is a bit mixed
these are the best speakers we've heard
on Huawei falling just behind some of
the better stereo options available
unfortunately headphone performance is
just okay this isn't the loudest amp and
quality numbers punched below this
phones price tag you can hit the link in
the description below for our full reel
audio review to get the full scoop we
are happy with this camera performance
though the second generation like the
dual camera shooter features some nifty
tech and can produce some of the best
looking images we've ever seen from a
phone now rocking a 20 megapixel
monochrome sensor paired with a 12
megapixel color sensor and optical image
stabilization
leica is really showing off their
processing prowess contrast and clarity
are terrific white balance tends to err
on accuracy over representing the color
of the light in your scene but color has
a nice pop to it and the phone utilizes
a number of slick software tricks to
improve zoom or to beautifully blur your
backgrounds video is also improved as
the mate 9 joins the Nova and being only
the second Huawei phone able to shoot
UHD video oh is is definitely
appreciated but you'll often arrive at
shake your footage than on many
competing devices overall there's a lot
to like here for folks who prefer having
manual options to control but we'd be
remiss if we didn't acknowledge that
this camera comes with one of the
steepest learning curves we've yet
reviewed it's not that it's particularly
hard to use if you've ever handled a
camera before but users will need to
spend time familiarizing themselves with
where every option lives and what
settings you can use in which modes like
not being able to zoom when you're
shooting and manual and capturing RAW
images also like as involvement on image
processing means output won't feel like
other phones like it Engineers prefer a
particular look for photos for example
no
really isn't a deal breaker if it adds
to the feel of the capture a color
processing also has a very distinctive
look to it if you've handled an iPhone
in the last four years you can be pretty
confident what your photos will look
like the mate nine will be very
unfamiliar in operation and output to
most users just picking it up with a
little practice though this camera is
capable of absolutely stunning output
and we'll have more to say about camera
performance as we wrap up our real
camera review shortly Huawei has also
improved the microphone array on the
mate nine in the camera and in the audio
recording app the phone can focus the
onboard microphones to adjust for the
directionality of your audio subject a
certainly handy for folks who record
meetings or want to do some casual
interviewing or podcasting lastly
packing a larger than average battery
onboard retreated to some pretty stellar
daily performance running our media test
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the mate drained 4% of
its battery making it one of the best
Android performers we've run on this
test falling just behind the more
power-efficient iPhone 7 plus we just
might have a new champion for recharging
however using the supplied charger for a
half hour the may hit an incredible 58
percent recharge while only getting
slightly warmer to the touch after one
hour we hit 87% Huawei claims the phone
will charge fully in ninety minutes and
we're seeing faster performance than
advertised so let's wrap this up where's
that leave us with the huawei mate 9
this is a damn fine phone see there's
this big gaping hole in the phablet
offerings this year because of one
device which will remain unmentioned
that left fewer options for folks who
like truly bigger displays the mate 9
fits this niche nicely it's a killer
all-rounder big phone great performance
very good battery life and one of the
most unique cameras we've ever reviewed
the few compromises here like headphone
audio and screen resolution we wouldn't
consider them outright deal-breakers
more a personal preference decision for
folks shopping a premium phone it's a
big bold brassy offering from a company
looking to turn the heat up on the
competition
