calm and you may have already seen my
video about how to plan a trip using
bing maps and windows mobile where you
know we save much locations on bing maps
and then transfer them to the windows
mobile well you can also do that with
google maps so here I am was my phone
and that window over there and here we
have google maps on our tablet pc and i
am logged in so that's going to be
important over here you see my maps if
we click on that and you got some
collections to choose from i'm going to
do create new map that's right there and
i'm going to call it why and then i am
going to import cool thing about google
maps and bing maps is you can actually
transfer saved locations between them
real easily so here i am back in bing
maps i'm going to go to actions export
georss and then i am going to copy that
into google maps paste that RSS feed
here and it's going to import those
locations so look at that how easy was
that
and all my information got transferred
over here so that's real nice let's just
zoom in on one up to close
let's go to that one
okay it's having some issues here
alright that was weird let's zoom in
anyway there's the airport so that's
really nice i'm going to get down there
and so now all my points of interest for
ye are saved into google maps now we
want to get that from the phone of
course over here let's make that
bigger and i go to menu layers browse
layers my maps now i am logged in to
google maps on my phone with the same
gmail account that i was using on the
web page and look at that there's why
so there you see
all my saved locations are now in google
maps so very similar great way to plan
trip save all your favorite points of
interest and just load them up into your
Windows Phone really excellent that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
