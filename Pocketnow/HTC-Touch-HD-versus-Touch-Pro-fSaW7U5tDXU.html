pocketnow.com and this is a comparison
between the HTC Touch HD and the HTC
Touch pro you could also consider a
comparison between the Touch HD and the
touch of diamond since the pro and the
diamond are very similar devices so in
this video we're going to take a look at
how they compare in terms of performance
and screen visibility obviously the
touch HD has a larger screen by a full
inch and it also is a higher resolution
screen
it's got 800 down instead of 640 down as
found on the diamond or the touch pro so
we're gonna go in we're gonna look at a
lot of applications we're gonna try to
synchronize things together just as a
little bit of a note both devices have
just been soft reset they're connected
on the same Wi-Fi network they have no
third-party applications installed so
the the field is very even across both
devices ok so here we are in touch flow
3d and the screen brightnesses are set
to the same level and I can tell you
that the touch pro has a slightly higher
contrast it seems than does the touch HD
the whites are just a little bit wider
and the colors are a little more crisp
so let's slide over on the icons here
and back again alright let's go into
calendar
alright let's go into the programs menu
and of course you can see more icons on
the screen with the touch HD since it
has a longer screen and let's go down to
the YouTube application and I'll try to
launch them at the same time see which
one does it faster
it looks like the touch pros a little
faster so far and let's try to get it on
the same video so we can see which one
will lo it load it faster and it looks
like we're in science and technology so
let me go to all videos oh here we are
okay so I'm going to choose this Gears
of War video and play it at the same
time see what your device gets it on
first and see how it looks on the larger
screen
looks like so video really looks
fantastic on the touch HD which with the
large screen it's high resolution in in
YouTube the video stretches for the to
the whole screen so that you can see
everything on one shot so let's go into
another program now okay let's go to
opera mobile next and I'm going to
launch them at the same time see which
one gets it open first
all right touch pro got it first and I'm
gonna go to Amazon on both devices see
how it looks all right so I'm gonna
click go at the same time
looks like the touch HD oh no actually
the touch broke kind of loaded it fast
at the last minute there and it's almost
done web browsing is one of the places
where the WVGA screen really shines I
mean look how much more you can see on
the HUD than you can on the touch pro
and I'm gonna flip it over to landscape
in a second just so you can see even
more so of this effect and here's what
they look like both in landscape as I as
I said before you see so much more on
the screen and the experience is so much
better on the touch HD looking at the
web than it is on the touch pro now just
for comparative purposes let's look at
the iPhone and see how Amazon looks in
Safari you know it's funny I turn on the
iPhone the other day for the first time
in a really long time and this screen
looks so grainy in comparison to the
touch HD because the resolution is so
much lower alright okay so here we are
with the touch HD in the iPhone loaded
onto the same page we can of course
flick our finger on both devices to to
move down the page and you can see so
much more on the screen at one time on
the touch HD because of the higher
resolution screen and it really looks
fantastic it kind of makes the iPhone
look like a much lower resolution device
which it is in comparison okay we're
back with these two devices let's go
into the album at the same time see
which loads it faster it looks like the
the touch pro is slightly faster in that
test and of course on both devices you
can flick your finger to see pictures
but you can see more pictures on the the
touch probe because the higher
resolution screen let's open this one
and let's do a slideshow on both devices
so your choice between the touch HD and
the touch pro or diamond is really going
to come down to what you use your device
for they're very similar in terms of
performance some in some instances that
touch HD was faster in some instances
the touch pro is faster if you use your
device for a lot of multimedia like
video and pictures and you intend to do
a lot of web browsing then you're really
going to appreciate the big screen on
the touch HD but if you want to be as
productive as possible and you're a
business user and you want to have
hardware keys
plus a full keyboard then obviously the
touch pro will be your best bet
keep in mind that the touch HD has a
price premium right now of a hundred to
two hundred dollars depending on where
you buy it from so that's it for this
comparison
be sure to check pocketnow.com soon for
the full review of the touch HD or will

every single thing about this device
