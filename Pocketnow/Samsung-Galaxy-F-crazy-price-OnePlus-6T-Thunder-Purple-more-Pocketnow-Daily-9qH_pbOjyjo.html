March and you thought apples price tags
were crazy think again for those of you
that wanted the oneplus 60 in purple
it's coming to the United States in the
UK very soon and if you're having screen
problems with your iPhone 10 our data
issues with your Mac don't worry Apple
apparently has you're covered I'm Jaime
Rivera deeply mourning the loss of the
genius that was mr. Stanley such a sad
day this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals and
yes for those of you wondering I'm
currently in Taiwan on a mission that
you'll learn about shortly Samsung's got
some Black Friday deals that are very
compelling $200 off devices like the
Galaxy Note 9 $70 off the Samsung Galaxy
watch which is currently charging right
there that I'm using and there are up to
three hundred dollars off 4k TVs you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about Samsung one more time as to
my understanding this whole new user
interface that the company just launched
it's called the 1u I no longer the
Samsung user experience experience so it
seems that not only new devices are
getting it apparently according to
famous tipster ice universe we should be
getting it up until devices like the
Galaxy s8 I have no idea when you're
getting it though because Samsung is not
famous for that but hopefully because
this is apparently a less bloated
version of their custom UI it might take
them less than before the spotlight over
to Apple as apparently there are some
bugs that might get you a new device if
you're currently using devices like for
example the MacBook Pro 13 inch non
touch bar from June 2017 to June 2018 it
seems that there are some data issues
that might get you a replacement and the
same goes for the iPhone 10 last year's
device is having touch response issues
on the display which might get you in a
display so if you're having problems my
advice to you visit your local Apple
Store now stalk about oneplus as the
company has chimed in on a couple of
projects that they're working on one of
them being 5g it seems that it won't be
the one plus 7 but it will be a device
that the company will launch next year
which we assumed to be the oneplus
so yeah by the time of the fall we might
be getting a 5 g 1 plus device that's
great and for those of you that wanted
that Thunder purple device it was a well
just announced for other countries that
are not China seems that it will be
coming to the United States and the UK
we'll keep you posted on that and
finally the hot news that they have to
do with Samsung and it's foldable device
Fiat galaxy after galaxy x which we're
expecting to launch sometime next year
and we are expecting it because
apparently components have already begun
shipping manufacturing has already begun
the problem is when we learn the price
tag by tipsters I mean this is a phone
that folds into a tablet nothing new
here I mean we've seen it from the
Kyocera echo terribly the X on M
terribly yes this is a new way with a
foldable screen that's actually not two
screens that's put into one I get it but
the price seems to be seventeen hundred
and fifty dollars that thing is going to
have to be able to drive me to work
every day for that price tag let us know
in the comments what do you think do you
think that it's crazy do you think that
it's possible I don't think so I think
that Samsung right now is so in need of
a vanguard product to pull it out of the
mothballs that it's been when it comes
to sales that it would just shoot itself
in the foot with this price tag that
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what you think friends again if
