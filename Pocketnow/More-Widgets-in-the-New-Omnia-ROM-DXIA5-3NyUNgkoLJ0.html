pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to show you the new samsung omnia
rom which is actually quite good and
brings a lot of new widgets for those of
you keeping track this is the Dzi a
five-run last time we made a video about
this it was the DX h j1 rock now we're
actually giving away a samsung omnia at
pocketnow.com all you have to do is
subscribe to our Twitter feed at
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets and
on Friday which is May fourteenth we
will post a link in our Twitter that
will link to a registration area and
that is where you enter the contest so
watch out for that ok so the first thing
I'm going to show you are the new
widgets that come on the new omnia rom
and if you're if you're not familiar
with the omnia the home screen has all
of these widgets so you can drag them to
the right you can move them around and
then you can bring them back to the
sidebar here and then put them away if
you don't want to see them now if we
scroll down the line here we'll start to
see some new widgets we've covered all
of these before in previous videos but
there are some new ones here let's take
a look this one in particular is new
although it's very simple it's simply a
link to your messaging application so
I'm going to close that and bring it
back nothing too interesting there the
next one is new it's the accuweather
widget and it actually works very well
and it keeps everything within the the
TouchWiz interface so here we have the
temperature in Philadelphia if I tap on
that it will bring me to another screen
which will show me a really nice
forecast of what's going around on in my
area and I can actually have multiple
cities so I've also entered New York so
if I go to the left there I see New York
it's overcast we can choose how often it
updates and I've it updating every six
hours and we can go to edit to add the
cities that we want and looks like you
can have about six cities they're so
pretty neat weather widget there and the
last city that you look at will be the
city that is shown up on that shows up
on the screen here so I'm going to bring
that back over to the side here the next
widget is CNN com which is basically
just a news widget and what you can do
here is
you see a headline and you tap on it if
you want to learn more about it and then
you get into this kind of CNN com
application where we can go to top
stories tab over to the right world news
over to the right again world business
and if you tap on any of these it will
open up opera mobile and you'll see the
story at cnn.com it would have been nice
if it all stayed within the same
interface and didn't have to launch app
or mobile but I guess we can't have
everything okay and let's get out of
there and look at the next widget the
next widget is one that we've been
asking for a lot and it's the stocks
widget finally we have a widget to track
our stocks although these days you
probably don't want to track them so
this kind of operates like the weather
widget so we can tap on this the the
ticker there and then we see the stocks
that we are tracking right now we can
add stocks and have multiple stocks if
we click over to the left it'll show the
Indus II so the dow jones industrial
average and if you tap on any of these
you'll get a more detailed view that
will show you a graph of what's been
going on with the stock like so this is
this actually is kind of reminiscent of
touchflo 3d stocks so you can it uses
yahoo to find the stock charts and it
shows you the highs and the lows and you
can check out the graph of the stock
pretty neat all within the whole
interface here we're not actually going
out to opera mobile or anything like
that okay and let's put that back and if
we go down the line we have 14 g which
is actually just a plain old with google
search bar which is cool so you tap in
there and you will get a keyboard you
can type your search query it'll launch
opera mobile and if you don't like
Google but you like yahoo the same
widget exists but for Yahoo and you can
choose whether you're searching for
international or based on whatever
country you are in now there is another
widget that is actually called the more
widgets button and it actually doesn't
work unfortunately so if you tap on it
it brings up a search bar and I'm not
even sure what to search for here I mean
I'd like to see a list of all the
widgets available but because i get this
network connection error and i have a
full Wi-Fi signal
this tells me that this isn't set up yet
and hopefully Samsung will be expanding
this into the future the omnia is a very
popular device and there are other
devices that actually use this widget
interface so I expect them to expand
even more on the widgets so some good
improvements on the widgets we still
don't have next appointment I think
that's the most necessary widget to have
so that you can look quickly on your
screen and see where you're supposed to
be at that time one other thing that I
want to show you in this video that has
been added to this newest rom on the
samsung omnia and it is called favorite
settings and you can actually access
this too if you press the side button
over there and you just saw the screen
animation let me turn it back the other
way you can actually access this
favorite settings much quicker if you
touch the side button and you tap on
favorite settings right here so
basically what this does is it puts
certain device functions at your
fingertips that you would usually take
several menu options to go through to
get to so we have sound and from here we
can adjust this the system sound we can
change the ring all from this screen we
can change the profile and that sort of
thing very touch friendly interface it's
great click on display we can change our
theme power will show us the power
options you can flick your finger to go
down if there are any other options we
go to memory it shows you how much
memory is being used right now and we
can hard reset the device from this
screen if we flick our finger to the
right we get a lot of switches here so
we can turn on flight mode Bluetooth
Wi-Fi we can turn on and off the motion
sensor so that when you turn your screen
this way it will either rotate or it'll
not rotate those are crazy animation
there turn on etiquette mode which will
use the motion sensor to mute the device
when you put it down on its face kind of
like some of the HTC devices we have
flashlight mode which is a very quick
way to turn on the flashlight and mouse
which will turn on and off the optical
mouse and USB mode which will determine
the behavior of what happens when you
plug it into your computer so a really
great addition I think to the the the
omnia to make it very easy to change
certain things about the device without
having to dig into a lot of menus so
that's pretty much it for the Rama
on the samsung omnia I think this is
probably the best rom update yet it adds
a lot of widgets it adds the ability to
hopefully have even more widgets in the
future and we can get to that screen
quite easily that allows us to change
certain things about our device without
having to dig into a lot of menus so
that's it for now like I said we're
giving away a samsung omnia on
pocketnow.com all you have to do is
follow us on twitter twitter.com slash
pocket now tweets and on March
thirteenth 2009 we will post a link on
that will point to a registration page
so that is it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
