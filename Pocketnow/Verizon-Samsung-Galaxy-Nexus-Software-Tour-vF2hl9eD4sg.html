next up we're going to take a look at
the software tour of the new Samsung
Galaxy Nexus 4 horizon let's check out
first off you've already seen a lot of
courage on the Galaxy Nexus version of
Android called ice cream sandwich so
with the verizon version it's mostly the
same but we have some a couple verizon
apps that have been included so in this
video i'm going to show you those real
quick and then go over some of the
things i really like about ice cream
sandwich as well as some issues that you
may want to know about so first off go
to the app tray and we see all the apps
that comes with facebook i downloaded
separately so we have messenger gmail
google+ all the usual stuff these two I
added my verizon mobile this one is from
verizon so you can access your verizon
profile you got to log in and we also
have one more verizon backup assistant
so this will let you sync contacts with
verizon and you can set a schedule and
all that so those are the two apps that
verizon adds to the Galaxy Nexus now let
me talk about ice cream sandwich a
little the first thing I really like is
the recent apps listing so this gives
you a good thumbnail view of about three
and a half of your most recent programs
and you can scroll through and it's
really easy to see and we can tell very
easily what we're looking at in terms of
different programs so that's really nice
and we swipe it like that it goes away
but it doesn't really it doesn't
actually close so that may cause some
confusion
now let's go back I also really like the
live wallpaper if you can see that's
very subtle that's one of them we have
more this is the default one this very
slow-moving it's not terribly
distracting good still see all the
button is in navigation and we also have
the google search stays on all the home
screens and overall the design has come
a long way since my first android device
dg1 so we see a lot of differences the
design really looks a lot more digitally
authentic which is kind of the same
thing that when does phone was going for
and we'll also see some similarities
there for example let's see if we go to
Facebook you see down here there's a
little dot dot dot and that is kind of
like the same dot over here now on
Windows Phone the reason this makes
sense is because that's obviously an
ellipses symbol which generates
generally stands for more information or
some text is missing and we tap and we
see obviously a menu comes up and we
have a translation of these icons there
in English on Ice Cream Sandwich the
menu comes up normally there and the
dots are vertical so it might be a
little less obvious as to what that
means
and one thing that might be weird or
confusing is the dot dot dots the many
me isn't always there the menu button
moves around okay right now it's up here
and now it's even in a different place
its way up here now so there's your menu
that it would be nice if it was always
in the same place that way we would know
where to find it but it isn't now guess
where it is a total another different
place it's not in the normal row of
navigation buttons it's a little bit
above it so there's your menu and
another thing that I don't like none of
these buttons have any translation you
have to you have to figure out what
these little icons mean I really like
the calendar it's a new design much
cleaner we have our menu up there ok
let's go home now these are not hardware
buttons anymore these are all part of
the screen and the advantage to that is
that they can change depending on what
you're doing so for example if you're in
the camera the buttons kind of go away
they become little dots a very subtle
now while we're in the camera this is a
5 megapixel camera and we have the
shutter button there and it is very very
quick so just BAM rep rapid fire those
are the three pictures i just took and
you have options here and they're not
labeled and there's no text so you gotta
kind of guess what they do that's a
panoramic and it's going to tell us to
well it didn't tell us to do anything
capturing panorama and so you get
panorama picture and sometimes it's a
kind of off okay but the camera is
really quick sometimes it's too quick
and doesn't focus first but anyway back
to the buttons if you press it it'll
show up and you can see it now let's go
home so like I said when the advantages
of having those buttons be screen-based
is that you can change them and we saw
that the menu would show up there
sometimes but what Google forgot about
is when they don't do anything do do
they really need to be there I mean
obviously this looks like a bug back
button doesn't do anything so this one
still works but if it's not going to do
anything doesn't need to be there no
another thing if we look at the screen
and say you're a new person or you have
a feature phone and you really don't
want to learn something new if you look
at these buttons nothing is labeled
you're really going to have to look at
these to figure out what they mean or
just do trial and error which a lot of
people don't really feel like learning
and we still have all our home screens
there's no pinch air which is fine now a
couple of things I only download a few
gaps and a lot of them just don't work
like that one viber just tries to launch
and then goes away and one more thing
with facebook so i go into the contents
and counts i kind of want to add my
facebook friends as an account in my
contacts
so go there and it doesn't do anything
Google actually blocked facebook from
integrating with D Galaxy Nexus so you
won't be able to access your facebook
contacts from there you'll have to go to
the app and that has some issues to say
I forget and leave this running so we're
loading the battery level is going to go
down very quickly normally if I keep
everything to shut off and just have
some push email accounts and whatnot the
battery would last a very nice day and a
half two days which is really good I was
very happy with that but if you forget
and leave something like Facebook
running battery will last about four
hours so you gotta really babysit this
device and make sure you close your
programs and again doing it like this
does not close the program's it is still
running what you have to do is go into
apps and see the running apps and this
is where we'll be able to stop them okay
now the settings are very comprehensive
and they're all in one place so I really
like that and also have some special
developer settings so I got some cool
things there now next up you probably
want to see the speed test this is a
verizon 4g LTE
and at least according to the speed
tested it is crazy fast we only have two
bars here so it's only getting four but
I can look the results and you'll see
some of my results here we get 12.9 12.3
different locations sometimes 0.8
there's 11 there's 0.12 there's a 17 and
there's actually some bugs sometimes
sometimes it just completely loses
connection doesn't have any internet
access sometimes it's extremely slow
sometimes it's ridiculously fast I'm not
sure if that's a Verizon network issue
or something with the device but it's
kind of annoying another thing that I
like is if you press the blackberry
button right here okay well it's not
really blackberry button but it looks
like one we get the app drawer but we
also have widgets they're all in one
place now so that's really easy to find
all the little programs since the
widgets are kind of kind of a program
that just runs on the home screen so
it's less difficult to figure out where
everything is and you have marketplace
button right here so that's really easy
to quickly go there and find new apps I
really like that all right so that's our
look at the software on the verizon
version of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus now
with Google's Ice Cream Sandwich
operating system the latest version four
point oh I give us a thumbs up like this
video and that's it for now
