now it's time to upgrade that tied a
shirt what tight a shirt what a time it
always look like if he's looking at a
spider hanging on the ceiling to the
right just off the camera and you know
it's funny it's not a prompter I
actually don't read it's all improvised
it's just the stupid tick that i have i
really and honestly respect this guy
because he is a very hard worker and a
dude that just made me blush really
appreciate it yeah it's these are long
hours that's right it's that time of the
week I am hi Natalie that this is pocket
now and this is the pocket out daily
recap for last week so on Monday the
news were about the Galaxy s7 we've got
rumors that we will be getting
expandable storage on this model and I
asked you if you would buy it if that
were the case we have 993 comments we
start with storage I can deal with just
one other tiny thing more battery more
battery more battery more battery and
yeah I want more battery to yes i think
i would buy the s7 personally i swapped
the SD card two different phones and I
need expandable storage it has always
beneficial to have microSD expansion and
dude that's the story of our lives here
reviews we have to be swapping phones
all the time so it is a pain to have to
be moving things around yeah indeed I
love the s6 edge+ but I went with the
v10 French removable battery and
expandable storage so please bring back
both and you know I you know they figure
out the battery life I really don't care
if the replaceable battery comes back
because I'm never really swapping
batteries but from the expandable
storage is a big deal so yeah if the
needs of everyone are different and I
get your point Tuesday was a day for
Star Trek fans as a Google is apparently
working on their own combadge and I
asked you if you would be interested in
the product like this or do you see if
it has a feature we have 476 comments we
start with combadge can come in handy
for some people people working in
construction sites won't have to carry
the book radio or a walkie-talkie they
can wear it a little badge and yeah that
could be the case it's just you know
these construction sites are just so
noisy these are the combadges would have
to have really good noise cancellation
in addition to other things so I don't
know we'll just see Michael Fisher would
disagree with you hi
really I mean it's not like if Michael
was a huge Star Trek fan is he I'm not
satisfied with just the brain cancer
cell phones were giving me thank you
google for letting me by my very first
heart attack I'm sorry I just I could
stop laughing with this comment and yeah
it seems that will be the next thing
just weren't on the other side Wednesday
the news were about the Lumia 950 XL
which had just reached pre-orders and I
asked you if you ordered any of the new
microsoft Lumias we had 436 comments I
think the Lumia 950 XL is going to be my
next phone and I thought so too but
after watching Michael Fisher to review
of the Lumia 950 not so sure I've never
used the windows phone before but this
new Lumia is especially the XL makes me
very excited to try it and you know
visually it looks gorgeous that's the
great thing about Windows Phone but the
usability of its applications watch
Michael Fisher's review of the Lumia 950
but it's probably that'll open your eyes
a little about it i'll be picking up the
950 XL at my local microsoft store when
it's available i will also be looking
forward to michael's review as well as
long as Lumias are going to be made i'll
be getting them and you know i am a big
fan of the lumia 930 i love it to death
especially for its camera but i'm gonna
be waiting out for windows tend to get a
little more mature so on thursday
something funny happened the news were
about Google helping Samsung improved
TouchWiz I asked you what was your
favorite android launcher and interns
everybody gave me feedback about
TouchWiz let's just focus on that we had
1351 comments thanks a lot guys hope
they make TouchWiz look like stock with
the TouchWiz features and you can
actually do that with the new galaxies
there is a skin that's available that
looks like marshmallow but hasn't such
was features I can't stand TouchWiz
first thing to do after buying a samsung
phone is the flasher rom and you know if
the null knock security features weren't
so bad I'd probably do the same like
TouchWiz but it would be nice if it had
customizations like LG offers it also
needs to stop closing all applications
as it made it hard to multitask and you
know this is a particular problem with
lollipop necessarily with TouchWiz and
the customizations from LG are good but
as an LG user I'll tell you this much
after a few hours the
just wear off because of the bad taste
of you I from LG and then finally on
Friday everybody was out shopping for
black friday or so I thought and I asked
you what did you get and we had 553
comments we start with what i got for
black friday was oxygen yes nothing I'm
broke and yeah that's the case for most
of us right now I got absolutely nothing
because surprisingly I am satisfied with
everything that i have so I don't see
any need to go out and I'd like a wild
beast over some electronics the deals
were really good dude I just understand
that more people just do it online and
that's what I do I picked up a 32 gig
Nexus 9 that deal was hard to pass up my
Nexus 7 is starting to show its age and
man this was the best deal of all the
Nexus 9 is a good tablet of even though
Android tablets aren't great but this is
a good deal it was extremely affordable
and yeah you get stock Android there
were some really good deals out there
but a lot of people have just gone crazy
buying products on launch day because of
the scar City problems and therefore it
wasn't really much left to buy on black
friday but TVs that's it for the parking
out daily recap thank you very much for
