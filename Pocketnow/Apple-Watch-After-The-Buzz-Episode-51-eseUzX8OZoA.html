over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's revisit the SmartWatch leader at
least by a sales figures and see if it's
still worth the Apple tax I'm high
memory better with pocket now this is
the Apple watch sport and this is
episode 51 of after the buzz if you
haven't been approached at least by one
person to ask you hey is that the Apple
watch then you're lucky Apple does this
so well they see a market that's still
experimenting and launch a competing
product that infuses maturity through
simplicity and elegance
all the while marketing the hell out of
it in order to drive that consumer
awareness that makes people know what
the Apple watch is while completely
ignoring your Moto 360 it's proven to be
brilliant with the iPod iPhone and iPad
markets which Apple didn't really invent
but that did help jumpstart but oddly it
hasn't been the same story with the
Apple watch
surely Cupertino is selling five times
more watches than all its competitors
combined but not necessarily with a far
better product than the rest for
starters this continues to be the oddest
looking watch for its price range
wristwatches have existed for decades
and people have historically paid
thousands of dollars for them but it
seems that only Android wear devices
like the Huawei watch and LG watch
urbane have decided to pay respects to
that mentality
by contrast Apple has decided to
challenge it with a product that instead
mimics old Casio watches from the 80s
which are okay for people like me that
grew up using them but that you'll
rarely see in the market today for
obvious reasons
yes there is some cool to the way you
can quickly replace the watch bands and
some third-party accessories do
contribute to adding some style to the
watch but if anything it stands out as a
different product not necessarily a more
elegant one aging is also a mixed bag if
you've joined me in choosing the Apple
watch sport well I do love how readable
this peel that display is even in direct
sunlight
I still hate having to move my wrist to
see the time every now and then since it
does lack an always-on mode you'll also
be annoyed by the scratches on the
ionics clasp which are clearly visible
at some angles and the same can be said
about the composite back which looks
even worse after six months of use
thanks in part to the scratches from the
Apple wall charger also do yourself a
favor and don't buy the white poly asked
from a band option mine has survived my
two hours of daily gym routine but no
matter how much I wash it there will
come a point where it'll just look dirty
regardless about the only thing that
still looks like new is the 7000 series
aluminum chassis which I'm still shocked
to report has survived without a single
scratch even after all this time
watch OS has also aged in a mix way if
you measure its usability the whole
digital crown UI continues to be more
confusing than revolutionary if you
can't press it to select anything and I
have yet to use the context button for
anything else than turning the watch on
or off yes this is one of the few
watches out there that allows you to
pull it too crazy by being able to call
your contacts from this button but the
speaker is just so terrible you will
rarely ever want to even use it the
operating system has an H well if you
measure it against competitors as well
while Android wear has evolved to become
far more usable in the way it stacks
notifications third-party applications
and health metrics with the Apple watch
well it depends for example even though
watch OS 2 now allows you to act on
notifications when they arrive sadly
that won't work unless third-party
developers have chosen to create a
native application that uses
this drives a lot of confusion and even
frustration since applications like
outlook give you a bevy of ways to
respond to an email and then whatsapp
just kills everything for you not having
a native application shouldn't lead to a
cumbersome experience but it does in
most cases if you get more than one
notification of any of these the Apple
watch just starts giving you a number of
notifications pending and then forcing
you to dismiss them and call on the
notification tray to read them or just
pull your phone out which just
completely defeats the purpose of having
a SmartWatch uploading times are also a
mixed bag at this point we're already
using watch OS 2.1 and we still have a
hard time figuring out which of these
applications are native in which aren't
native applications were supposed to
load faster but instead we noticed that
even the native applications take time
to load if you haven't been using them
complications now also allow you to add
information to your watch face that
weren't available before but again it
depends on how many developers have
decided to support it and right now the
list is rather small as a result the
lack of consistency makes you forget
that the watch actually has third-party
applications or third-party
complications in my case in particular
if it's not part of the watch face or
part of the notification tray or a part
of the few glances that I use every now
and then I can go for days without
remembering that these third-party
applications are there or that the
complications are also useful something
that has also deteriorated over time is
the way the Apple watch handles fitness
after watch OS 2 it could be the
scratches on the composite back that
have led to the sensors providing less
accurate readings but we'll have a
separate pocket now fitness segments to
provide you with more details and
comparisons over how the Apple watch has
aged over time in the fitness department
about the only thing that has aged well
and that I would rather recommend the
Apple watch for is battery life I
usually end my days with around 50% of
juice which is actually good compared to
most of the Android wear offerings out
there and actually makes this the go to
watch that I wear whenever I travel or
I'm planning a night out for example
overall this is the set curse of the
early adopter today people have
forgotten that the first iPhone didn't
half 3gr couldn't run third-party
applications and that the first iPad was
a heavy brick that really couldn't even
multitask Apple is known for its
restraints when launching a new category
and then there is a lot of that with the
Apple watch yes there is a lot of
promise with watch OS 2 but developers
clearly still need to catch on and you
know what maybe you should too
there's a lot of cool with this watch
and it continues to be the better option
for fitness when compared to most but it
might not be cool enough to pay $350 or
$400 for this particular unit if you're
in the market for a SmartWatch I would
highly suggest you wait for the Apple
watch to in 2016 and save yourself the
frustration but if we just really want a
SmartWatch right now you might as well
just get yourself a pebble for any of
the Android wear offerings that already
work with Apple's ecosystem as well
folks just like with the Apple watch
every other product comes of age so stay
tuned for more episodes like this one of
after the buzz at the same time make
sure you also follow us on social media
so strep change of channel as well you
can follow me on Twitter
