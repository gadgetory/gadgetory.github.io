today I've got a quick look at wave
launcher for Android one of the most
novel and unique ways for launching apps
on Android that I have ever seen let's
go take a look okay like I said in the
intro this is one of the most novel and
unique ways for launching apps that I've
ever seen and that's a big statement
because I've seen a lot now the first
thing is this isn't a launcher per se
meaning you don't have to replace your
stock launcher in fact here I am I still
have launcher Pro running with beautiful
widgets and my kids fishing and all
kinds of stuff or beautiful live whether
I should say it's my wallpaper there so
that's still my launcher it still
functions just like you'd expect it to
it still does everything that I'd want I
still have you know a whole boatload of
screens on here seven I think to be
precise but what wave launcher does is
it kind of sits resident and you can see
that right here wave launcher can tap on
that to get to my settings so really
quick and easy way to do it and then I
can do all kinds of stuff your edit
change the colors calibrate it settings
add some plugins really cool things now
this down here that's what you see as
the the wave launcher itself now what
does it mean by wave well let's go ahead
and invoke it and I've been having a
little bit of a problem invoking it
today for some reason but there you go
you can see all I did was I came down to
the bottom and I swiped up so there's my
gesture and now I can just kind of roll
over each one of these and you can see
that wave in there where the icons kind
of get bigger and zoom in and I can do
it up here or I can do it down here all
kinds of stuff now I can go ahead and
watch this so barcode scanner BAM there
we go
i man barcode scanner just a minute to
load that up but it did it come back I
want to load another one my camera app I
can do that I want to load my Congress
app I can do that awesome and the cool
thing is this works on any screen so
we'll fly them over here on this I can
now swipe up
and check out my music now that's a
widget I can go ahead and play that
widget and do it and it's right there
I'm look at that I'm flipping around on
my screen doing whatever I want and the
widget is right there on top of
everything go ahead and pause that close
it down you can do that with any one of
your widgets now it's really kind of
basic you know it doesn't have an awful
lot of stuff that you can do with it but
it still is really cool it's really easy
to edit and this is the last thing that
I want to show you here let's say we
don't like that music widget for some
reason we press and hold and we can
either move it change the icon or remove
it so we'll go ahead and do that and now
wow we got to put something there we can
put a folder there and inside that
folder we can put a whole bunch of apps
several of them half a dozen or whatnot
now I'm not going to get into detail on
that but if you have a Maps app for
example you can do I two of these two
and all kinds of fun stuff if you want
to put maps in there you can do that
let's see if I can show you a little bit
here let's say we want to put wherever
it went
Carl okay that's a good one so we're
gonna click on this little arrow that
says add to folder just did and we could
do another one
yada-yada-yada and move on down move on
down
latitude that's a good one so we'll do
that you can see it contains two of ten
items let's go ahead and go out of this
it does take a moment for things to save
and for some reason like I can't press
left-handed so as soon as the settings
have been saved then we can just come
back in now you can see we've got this
app drawer when we release it it shows
us all these apps which I thought it was
only gonna show us that too so kind of
interesting there then it's not doing
the whole folder in fact I think that's
on the other side isn't it yeah right
there there's our folder that we were
putting stuff in anyway a little bit
rough on how to do the more advanced
features but if you have just a few apps
that you use all the time and you want
to have access to them anywhere
you've got these down here but you can
go up and grab that really really
quickly so let's go ahead and know what
I just launched there okay so we've got
our browser coming up you can launch
stuff from the home screen and you can
launch stuff from inside other apps so
that's really what the utility of this
comes into play it's really really quite
cool I like it quite a bit
it's only a couple bucks out in the
Android Market so if you want to have
something to kind of impress your
friends a way to quickly and easily
launch your apps from just about
anywhere I would highly recommend you go
out and give Wave launcher a try really
kind of fun I like it
got a little bit of rough edges on how
you can use the folders but running apps
on top of everything else that's really
kind of cool kind of neat let us know
what you think in the comments we want
to know if you like it if you don't if
you've run into problems or maybe if you
saw something that I did wrong because
that happens you know let us know that
if you liked the video give it a thumbs
up subscribe to the channel so you don't
miss out on other cool videos in the
future
and of course head on over to
pocketnow.com so you can read all kinds
of cool tips tricks and articles about
not only Android powered devices but
Windows Phone and iPhone stuff as well

launcher for Android I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
