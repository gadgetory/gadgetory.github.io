mischaracterizations of the tech world
probably the most ignominiously
the point upgrade no matter how many
major improvements they've contained
updates like the bump from Android 4.3
to 4.4 and blackberry 10.1 to 10.2 have
always seemed somehow less impressive
due to their miniscule numeric promotion
and that's more true than ever before
with Windows Phone 8.1 from the
introduction of a native voice assistant
to some long-overdue interface overhauls
Microsoft's new software brings sorely
needed modernization to its smartphone
platform and we're here to show you how
it looks and tell you how well it works
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our video review of Windows
Phone 8.1 Microsoft Editor Adam Lane and
I have spent six days trialing Windows
Phone 8.1 on a Nokia Lumia icon provided
to us by Microsoft as a disclaimer the
software we've been using is obviously
pre-release and it doesn't include the
improvements coming with Nokia's Lumia
cyan update later this season we cover
only the major changes in this video for
a more in-depth look at Windows Phone
8.1 see our full review at PocketNow
linked in the description below probably
the first thing you notice when powering
on a Windows Phone 8.1 device is the
revamped Start screen a dot one
continues the trend of offering an added
column of tiles and it also introduces
the capability of custom graphics
instead of the old monoblock colors
rather than just being painted on the
tiles though your graphic actually
floats behind them this change makes
many of the default tiles essentially
transparent and finally gives Windows
Phone its own form of wallpaper without
sacrificing that look that makes it so
instantly recognizable or the live tile
functionality that makes it so useful
the transitions between screens have
also been slightly tweaked with
tightened animations making the whole
thing feels zippier and resurrecting
some of that hip modernity first brought
by Windows Phone 7 four years ago sadly
not all of the original intention had
survived intact the signal strength and
battery life indicators which used to
elegantly slide out of the way when not
needed are now displayed more off
than not a change we don't think was
necessary also some of the more
beautiful and simple corners of Windows
Phone have been sacrificed in the name
of features the new Photos hub no longer
has that gorgeous panoramic image behind
it those new volume sliders offer more
control but at the expense of some
simplicity the music and videos hub has
been completely removed along with its
accompanying live tile Windows Phone is
still quite distinctive but bit by bit
it's visually centric nature is being
chipped away in favor of a features
first mentality that better resembles
its competitors that resemblance though
is more than welcome in the area of
notifications aggregating alerts has
always been a pain point with the
Windows Phone experience live tiles
notwithstanding and it's an issue
Microsoft has finally addressed in 8.1
with Action Center a pulldown shade
containing system toggles alongside a
unified list of notifications grouped by
app you can choose which apps are
displayed in the notification center and
in the same settings screen you can even
set customizable alert sounds for things
like different email accounts another
feature we've been waiting a long time
for and while we have a few qualms we'd
like to have seen it placed elsewhere
other than up top and we'd like the
ability to dismiss individual messages
instead of entire categories we'll
gladly live with those limitations
because at the end of the day it's a
Notification Center in Windows Phone
that works well and that alone is reason
to celebrate
speaking of features inspired by other
platforms Microsoft's new voice
assistant finally breaks cover in
version 8.1 replacing the old Bing
functionality of the capacitive search
button down below and enhancing it with
device wide search and other modern
touches in terms of her vocal presence
Cortana is fortunately more than just a
clever halo inspired name in day-to-day
use she feels about as smart as Siri
first did on the iPhone 4s allowing you
to set reminders and alarms perform
searches voice tile and so on she's
something of a blend of Siri and Google
now with the personality of the former
and some of the power of the latter with
some very useful Microsoft touches
Cortana's notebook allows you to
customize exactly what she
was about you and her third-party
plugins mean you can ask her to read the
news for example NBC news headlines
reading headlines headlines for top
stories most challenging hunt ever
commander breaks down jet obstacles
Sebelius Obamacare timeline was flat-out
wrong raised or contact someone using a
specific app she also plugs into bings
music search so you can identify a
mystery track playing at your favorite
dive and she can also provide specific
reminders for specific people the next
time you talk to them the next time I
talked to Taylor Martin remind me to ask
him where I can get a sweet hat like his
okay next time you talk to Taylor Mardon
I can remind you to ask about his new
hat sound good yes if you're in a loud
environment you can also type your
commands rather than speaking them and
if you opt to give Cortana a live tile
she'll periodically throw up headlines
and other relevant info Cortana is
definitely still in the beta phase again
she's a lot like early Siri in terms of
how well she understands voice input and
some of the features she relies on like
Maps still have some annoying
limitations
show me the closest Dunkin Donuts
Washington Street
also it's sadly no easier to text by
voice in Windows Phone there's still no
punctuation support and the system still
cuts you off if you even take a breath
microsoft says Cortana's functionality
and reliability will grow with use for
now she has a lot of growing up to do
but she still adds a lot of convenience
to the Windows Phone experience and
she's worlds better than what we've seen
on the platform up to this point
while most higher-end Windows Phones
will likely continue to ship with the
professional-grade
Nokia camera app Microsoft can't afford
to ignore the non Nokia segments of its
lineup particularly with so many new
OEMs coming aboard as such the stock
Windows Phone camera app has been given
a facelift with a button layout that
makes more sense and a burst mode option
to the photos you take are now organized
into collections in the gallery based on
location and date though again we wish
Microsoft had managed to retain that
beautiful panoramic photo design from
the previous version behind the scenes
clean-up and enhancement is a huge part
of the 8.1 update and while the list is
covered more extensively in our full
review at pocket now here's some of our
favorites the excellent data sense app
now has some company in the form of
Wi-Fi sense which logs into familiar or
free networks on your behalf and also
lets you share your own access point
without also sharing your password
storage sense lets you see what apps are
taking up space and your device battery
saver functions as a kind of power sense
allowing you to see which apps use the
most battery and also allowing you to
govern which are allowed to run in the
background and if swiping rather than
tapping makes more sense to you
Microsoft's word flow keyboard is here
and it works quite well even if you're
an old-timer not used to that newfangled
swipe input the People Hub was early on
one of our favorite aspects of Windows
Phone but it fell out of favor over the
years as its functionality lagged behind
the social networks it depended on well
with 8.1 the hub has been for lack of a
better word platform eyes
meaning tapping on an update brings you
right to the app of the network it came
from that means more features and more
abilities it brought more quickly we no
longer need to wait for Windows Phone
upgrades to enhance the people hub
they'll come when the third-party apps
which plug into it are updated and in
the same vein sharing media has been
rethought to better resemble the Android
paradigm you're given a list of apps and
you're taken directly to them to share
once developers update their apps to
take advantage of the new framework this
will be a very welcome change
and speaking of app updates they can be
set to automatic now one of the many
such enhancements sprinkled throughout
the OS these enhancements help take the
edge off some of the weaknesses of the
platform some of which persist the
mediocrity of Internet Explorer compared
to competitors the confusing inclusion
of two Maps options neither of which
work terribly well at least here in the
States and yes the app gap which has
narrowed tremendously over the past year
but which is still very visible in areas
like gaming where iOS and Android
continue to boast a commanding lead a
comprehensive list of improvements would
take many videos this length which
brings us back to our first point don't
judge an upgrade by its point value
while this iteration doesn't reinvent
the wheel that's a good thing we've
always liked the clean modern look and
feel of Windows Phone it was the gaps in
functionality that we often took
exception to version 8.1 fills an awful
lot of those gaps while preserving the
soul of the platform's design and its
glanceable information aesthetic we'd
have liked to have seen many of these
improvements come sooner but as they say
better late than never
our numeric score will be available in
the full review linked in the
description below but those still
wondering about Windows Phones viability
in the modern world can stop wondering
version 8.1 isn't just a solid upgrade
it's the first incarnation of Windows
Phone to feel complete enough to tempt
people away from competitors that in and
of itself makes 8.1 probably the most
significant Windows Phone update ever
and it makes us more hopeful than ever
for the future of this plan
