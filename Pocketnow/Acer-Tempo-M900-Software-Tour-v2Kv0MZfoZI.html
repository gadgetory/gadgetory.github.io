pocketnow.com
and this is the software tour of the
Acer tempo Emma 900 now Acer has added a
lot of software to the M 900 a lot of it
comes from the OD 10 devices and that's
kind of unfortunate because it's kind of
haphazardly thrown together software but
there is some new and cool stuff and
we're gonna go through that now we're
gonna cover everything in full detail on
the final review of pocketnow.com you
just heard I got an email so this is
this this is the shell they call this
Acer shell and basically it's a three
looking interface that's trying to
emulate the desktop experience so you
have an a envelope on your desktop which
implies email and it tells you the day
in the the time and your next
appointments so let's go through all
these items a lot of these things are
hot linkable so if we tap on the little
envelope we are taken to our email and a
very touch flow-3d like display so we
can flick our finger to go through our
email it's kind of a slow way to go
through the email I think I much rather
go right into the inbox but it's a it's
a visually pleasing to go through your
messages another thing you can do is tap
where it says messages here and see the
same kind of display and tap through
your text messages if we tap on where it
says today we are taken to our calendar
just a quick link to the calendar if we
tap on the device right there it'll
actually take you to your call history
and the one implies that I've got one
missed call if we tap on the date over
here we are taken into kind of a world
traveler time display so we can you know
choose between Philadelphia where we are
now we can go to London and I'll spin
the globe this part is kind of a novelty
I'm not sure why it needs to have a
picture of where it is on the map but it
looks kind of nice if we tap on the
window we will actually get the weather
and the weather for the cities that are
pre-configured based on the previous
screen where you said in the cities that
you want to see for the time so we can
tap to London and see the weather in
London and again the globe moves and
shows you exactly where you're going so
a nice way to kind of get the weather on
this interface let's go
back okay now let's flick to the next
panel over to the right so from here we
can access our pictures photo gallery so
if we tap on the picture frame we are
taken to a very touch flow 3d like
interface where we can flick our finger
up and down and go through the pictures
and if we tap on a picture it'll open up
in the Acer gallery and from there you
can email a picture set it as background
and do all those sorts of things if we
tap on the rolodex we'll actually get a
list of people that we call on a regular
basis a bunch of pictures if there's a
picture assigned to their their contact
card you'll get their picture if not
you'll just get another placeholder icon
so this is kind of a quick way to dial
people though I much rather press the
call start button and go to my recent
call list and just go right into the the
person I want to call finally over here
there is a button or a section for media
playback and it'll show you the album
art if there is any and you can play
music right from here you can manage
your media just like you would on an HTC
device in the media tab I think a lot of
this comes from touchflo 3d and again if
you tap on the window here you can see
the window is kind of continued you will
get the weather one more over to the
right this is the final part of the
shell if we tap on what looks to be a I
don't even know what that is it looks
like a calculator but it's not you tap
on that it'll give you a program
launcher called the Quick Menu again
this comes right out of touch flow 3d if
we tap on the ruler and the pen we are
taken to some links to do things on our
device that we want to do like change
the backlight adjust sound profiles
communication manager things like that
and finally if we tap on the picture of
the globe we get our internet favorites
as they are set and pocket Internet
Explorer although it looks kind of
crappy on the screen but the letters are
jumbled together so it doesn't look well
optimized for this this device now this
mobile shell uses twenty megabytes of
RAM and for a device that already has a
huge deficiency of program memory for
such a high-end device here I'll show
you right now that's a big problem so
right now we only have 23 megabytes of
program memory free meaning you're not
going to get a lot of multitasking out
of this if you unload them the shell
program or take it off you actually get
40 megabytes free which is still very
very low and if I go into the task
manager I'll show you what's open right
now pretty much nothing ActiveSync
calendar and the task manager and we
only have 23 megabytes of free program
memory available so I am going to turn
off the show for the rest of this
demonstration okay so here we are in
programs and we're gonna go throw a few
things right now in terms of screen
sensitivity the screen sensitivity is
quite good it's not as good as the touch
pro2 or the diamond tube but it's
probably a little bit better than the
old touch Pro in the old diamond and at
at times there's I think a bug with the
screen where you have to press on an
icon several times in order for the
press to get registered you maybe you'll
see that during this demonstration and
also a note on screen rotation speed
it's very very fast it's almost as fast
as the touch pro2 just about instant so
that is not a problem alright so let's
go through this let's go to multi media
so this does have an FM radio which is
good it's it'll look familiar if you're
used to the old e 10 devices it wants
you to attach a headset so a simple FM
radio camera 5 megapixel camera we're
gonna cover photo quality in full in the
review streaming players so that you can
watch em youtube.com and album is the
photo album again we'll talk about all
this stuff in detail let's get to some
more interesting stuff let's see what we
have in utilities we have the backup
utility which is a simple backup program
that lets you backup certain parts of
your device and it looks like it's
backing up right now and I don't want it
to do that
memory optimization which is actually
kind of funny it'll automatically reset
your device on a scheduled basis so that
it clears out all of the programs in RAM
and this may actually be a good idea to
use this because there's such a
deficiency of RAM on the DM 900 and then
we have a program for a GPS and here's
the Communication Manager which has been
skinned a little bit for the the Acer
device going down and by the way it does
have flix scrolling although sometimes
it's a little clunky and goes a little
too much or not enough
going down we have some other things
like zoom status which is actually
pretty cool if you remember in the
HTC touch pro if you tapped on the
notification areas you would get these
zoomed in buttons so that they're much
larger well the same is the case here in
the EM 900 except I think it's done a
little nicer so we can close things or
we can go back up there and tap on this
memory manager which will actually give
you a test manager and you can see how
much free RAM you have or stop all of
the applications but let's go back to
where we were before missed it there and
so that is zoom status I installed
Skyfire in Opera Mobile this doesn't
come with a better browser like Skyfire
Opera Mobile but of course those
browsers are free to download twe Keaney
is an awesome Twitter client by the way
and let's go into settings because
there's some interesting stuff in there
to talk about so let's talk about the
biometric security right it has a
fingerprint scanner built into the
bottom which can be used in several
different ways
it can be used and see the screens not
responding here comes let me swipe my
finger it can be used to unlock your
device after it comes out of standby so
let's say when you power it on you want
the prompt to come up to swipe your
finger or you can have when your
calendar contacts tasks or inboxes
opened a prompt comes up to swipe your
finger so I'm gonna do this I'm going to
turn off the device and then turn it
back on and it should prompt me to swipe
my finger yep there we go so I can't do
anything unless I swipe my finger
sensitivity is really great on the
biometrics and of course to edit any
settings in the golden finger
application you have to swipe your
finger you can also protect a folder on
your device with the security I'm going
to need the stylus now because things
are getting kind of small down here you
can actually protect a folder which is
cool and this is how you register our
finger it's very easy you swipe your
finger four times and there are some
other settings here so it's a pretty
cool application to use if you want to
have an added level of security for your
device if you're afraid that someone's
going to pick up your phone at work we
can also change the today's soft keys
you can customize them so right now it's
set to speed dial and private folder but
there's a whole host of things we can
choose which is great a lot of devices
don't let you customize the soft keys
okay let's go over to system we have
some unique entries to talk about here
this device has an accelerometer but it
only works in certain screens that you
dictate so it's not working right now
but if I tap on the icon I can choose
which program DG sensor will work in so
obviously you want to do something like
Internet Explorer if you're using
Skyfire in office mobile you don't want
to have it turned on in all screens
because it really doesn't make sense to
have it rotate especially because you
have the slide-out keyboard to
automatically rotate it at any time and
you can adjust the sensitivity which is
great so that if you're walking down the
steps and you jiggle your device it
doesn't actually accidentally go into
the landscape orientation now here's
something real cool you can actually use
the biometric pad for more than just
security you can use it for navigation
you can use it as an eight-way d-pad a
four way rocker a joystick a mouse a
touch stick although I'm not really sure
the difference between a lot of these if
we use the mouse watch this it'll give
you a tiny little mouse on the screen
very very small you see it over there I
think it's a little too small to be
usable but it'll definitely help a
little bit with one-handed usability
I've been keeping it on the d-pad
setting because it gets way too
sensitive when then when you're using it
has a mouse in addition you can actually
tap down on the button gently or the the
security pad and have it select so if I
go to the Start menu let me try to get
the little mouse up to the Start menu
and I tap it'll open up the Start menu
so pretty cool they're added
functionality so again I like to leave
it on the d-pad and that way I can move
my finger to the left it doesn't always
work so well but it's a good feature to
have if you can get used to the the feel
of the swiping your finger and adjust
the sensitivity so it's just right you
can't really help for one-handed
usability and kind of bring back a deed
the d-pad because you know of course the
touch pro2 doesn't have a d-pad or any
way to have a multi directional input
method down here okay so let's go down
to see if there's anything else that's
interesting something called touch
control which will actually stimulate
the sensitivity of the flick scrolling
nothing too interesting there and over
in connections they do have a connection
wizard that is supposed to configure
your device to what carrier you are on
I'm using this on AT&amp;amp;T in the u.s. I'm
getting HSDPA but for some reason when I
choose AT&amp;amp;T from the drop-down list
it doesn't configure the device properly
so here it is 18 t Wireless I had to
manually put in the settings to get it
to work so overall I'm not too impressed
with the software on the ma900
I find that the Acer shell program that
we talked about the beginning it's kind
of a ripoff of touchflo 3d it doesn't
really bring anything unique it doesn't
have much utility it's a lot of it's a
novelty it looks kind of cool the
concepts interesting but the
implementations not that great it
requires a lot of screen taps also the
software on the M 900 is somewhat buggy
in terms of flick scrolling it doesn't
always work right or works too fast or
too slow
sometimes icons don't select when you
tap on them also another weird behavior
is that my internet connection settings
which I've had enter manually sometimes
disappear for no reason within the last
few days they just disappear I'm gonna
try hard resetting this and bringing it
back to factory condition maybe not
installing all of the software that
comes on it because it gives you the
option to check or uncheck certain
pieces of software anyway we're going to
cover everything in full in the review
on pocketnow.com
if you haven't seen the unboxing or
hardware to our video I'll put it up on
the screen right now and you can get to
those and again the M 900 right now is
shipping it clove technology that's
clove co uk and its cost about $80 less
than the touch pro2
and it of course it does u.s. 3g which a
lot of people will be happy about so
we'll be back with a full review soon
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
