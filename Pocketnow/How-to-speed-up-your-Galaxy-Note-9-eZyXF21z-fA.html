thousand dollars on the Galaxy Note 9
you want it to be as fast as possible in
this video I'm gonna show you five
things that I do to speed up my note 9
so let's get to it okay so the first
thing that I do when I get a Samsung
device or a note device especially if
it's a carrier version like I have here
with the AT&amp;amp;T note 9 is I disable
bloatware and there are a lot of apps
you can't disable and you can't
uninstall but if you use an app like
package disable or pro which is about $3
in the Play Store
you can force these apps to be disabled
plus package disabler Pro comes with a
database that knows what on your phone
is considered bloatware and what is just
something that you need to operate the
phone so let's take a look at package
disable or pro here there are three tabs
along the bottom so you can see all of
your packages which is really all of
your apps and really every piece of
software on your device plus the ones
I've disabled just all the AT&amp;amp;T stuff
and a bunch of Samsung stuff that I
don't really need and there's a
one-click button in the upper right
corner to disable all bloatware but I
don't recommend that you do that because
there are some pieces of software that
are associated with some Samsung theming
services and apps edge and other things
that you might use that you don't want
to disable so I really like going one by
one just going through I look for things
that say like Samsung on it or AT&amp;amp;T like
I don't need a teen to call protect
mobile security or protec and if you've
any questions on what these actually do
you can click on it you can see how much
space it's taking up and then you could
click google it which will let you see
specifically what a particular piece of
software is doing and then you can make
the determination if you want to delete
it the second thing I do on my Samsung
phones I actually do this on every
Android phone is change the default
animation speed and that's really easy
to do I'll show you so you're going to
go into settings you have to enable
developer options if you don't know how
to do that super easy go to about phone
go to software information scroll down
to build number tap that a bunch of
times and you'll enable developer
options so you go into developer options
you scroll down until you see animation
scale and I put these all to 0.5
by default there on one and by doing it
point five the animations are sped up
50% which is very significant and you
can actually get really granular using a
DV by switching this to 0.25 if you want
or point two or something if you think
point five is still too slow
but you'll you'd be surprised how much
of a difference that makes in the speed
of your phone now another thing you can
do to increase the speed of your note 9
is change the screen resolution or keep
it at the default so we go over here to
display we go to screen resolution I've
bumped it all the way up to the top
because my phone is finished setting up
I've disabled a lot of bloatware and I
think that my phone is fast enough now
to handle the higher resolution but by
default it's on fhd plus which is
twenty-two twenty by ten eighty which is
a pretty good resolution so you want to
keep it in that middle setting if you
want to maximize the performance of your
device and battery life the next thing
we want to do is disable all the
gimmicky Samsung features that keep the
sensors on a standby state to perform
certain actions so let me show you what
I mean by that so if we go into settings
and we go to advanced features all this
stuff is enabled by default smart stay
for example is something that uses the
front facing camera to determine if
you're looking at the phone so that the
screen doesn't go off you can leave this
on if you want but I don't like the idea
of the front-facing camera being used to
detect if my eyeballs are open so I
disable that there's a lot of other
stuff fingerprint gestures I like quick
launch camera to be on smart captures
palm swipe to capture I mean does the
phone really need to be on standby for a
palm swipe action I don't think so I can
just use volume down and power if I want
to take a screenshot direct call smart
alert easy mute swipe to caller send
message I just say about all of it
the last thing I want to talk about is
with the edge panel which I have set up
to display one thing which is my
calendar but by default if you go into
edge panel all of these things are
loaded into RAM on standby apps edge
people edge smart select which is
actually a really good one by the way to
keep on tasks edge Samsung internet Yelp
then you can go out to their App Store
and get even
edge panels so the point is if you don't
use edge panel turn it off if you do use
it disable as many of the panels as
possible because they're little apps
that run in the background that you do
not need to have so if you guys have any
tips or tricks on how to make your
Samsung or Note device faster please
drop a comment below and that will do it
