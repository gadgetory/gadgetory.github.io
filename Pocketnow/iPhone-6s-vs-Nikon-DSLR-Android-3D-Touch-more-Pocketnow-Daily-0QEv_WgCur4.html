wins a battle against a nikon DSLR in 4k
video companies are already working on
3d touch for Android and they'll jumps
the wagon with a new 4k tablet I'm high
emitter iveta and is it just me or has
this week just breezed by really quickly
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with Dell those of you
to think that Microsoft neglected its
partners at its event two days ago
that's because it was the microsoft
event dell has just announced a new
tablet its new XPS 12 line up and it's a
line up because well the higher end
model includes a 4k tablet display fully
detachable from its keyboard great
specifications all the nine yards for
1,300 bucks but if you want a regular
1080p display just about everything else
on such a capable product you pay a
thousand dollars in another
configuration so like solicitor for full
details and specifications and whatever
choices you want an even though we're
still skeptical about the functionality
of 3d touch on the iPhone particularly
in our review well companies are already
working on bringing that technology to
Android yes we do know that there is a
for such capable Huawei smartphone but
synaptics has just announced new sensors
that will allow any Android smartphone
to be able to do this by the end of this
year obviously we're not sure if this is
something that will come in future
Android smartphones particularly due to
the patent things with Apple but stay
tuned that could probably be something
next year and yes believe it or not the
facebook like button is going to make
the news today not because we heard
about the rumors of a dislike button to
happen that happened weeks ago but
apparently Facebook is willing to give
reactions a tried not necessarily just
this likes but people can actually
respond with other things like smileys
emoticons or whatever these options are
apparently already going to be test
fitting countries like Spain very soon
if not already it's interesting it's
hard to predict that this will ever gain
the same popularity as the like button
on Facebook but then again it's Facebook
anything goes and for those of you that
joined us in the skepticism of the
coming soon announcement with the iPad
pro and the new generation Apple TV
we've got some trusted sources the claim
that Apple is gearing up
more orders to happen as soon as by the
end of this month exactly sure which
particular date but it seems that
Cupertino wants to get things ready for
order by again end of this month for
shipments to begin sometime with a
November of these products that's a
great deal we just don't know exactly
how many people are going to go crazy
over that ipad pro even though we do see
it happening with the new generation
apple TV and finally the hot news of
today are things that actually make me
roll my eyes I hate comparisons between
a DSLR and a smartphone there is just no
room for comparison but this one's kind
of interesting as the smartphone
actually won this one we've got an
iphone 6s being compared to a nikon d750
when it comes to 4k video recording and
it wasn't really 4k was more the quality
of the video and when you look at the
footage in the video that's a link to
the description you'll notice that the
iphone success was actually capable of
winning this and adequate lighting
conditions bear in mind when it comes to
contrast the image reproduction and
color saturation when compared to the
DSLR but remember it was inadequate
conditions meaning if you do this at
night obviously the DSLR is going to win
this but it leads me to the question of
the day how often do you rely on your
smartphone for video recording do you
prefer smartphone over a bit camera or
is it just the convenience because in my
case I'll be honest are the only reason
why I have a cameras to do this video
but then I can I do everything else with
a smartphone leave us a comment down
below we would love to know what you do
