licking the galaxy s6 new carrier
unlocking loss take effect very soon and
we've got some new leaks of Windows 10
for mobile even though it's not out yet
I'm home it'll be better and I am
nostalgic this is the last video from
the studio on to a new one this is
parking out daily brought to you by
Linda calm the official news today are
actually mixed with brewers let's talk
about Windows 10 number one Microsoft
has officially confirmed that Windows 10
will support the devices with 512
megabytes of RAM which is cool as the
fact that there are a lot of entry-level
smartphones out there Nokia Lumia is
that are really cool we'll be supporting
Windows 10 at least in theory and then
again if you're interested to see what
Windows 10 on mobile looks like we're
still waiting for the preview but we've
got the first leaks in the description
look at the links detachable keyboard a
new joystick function there as well
interesting and see you have Windows
Phone what company that has not been to
Windows Phone in a very very long time
as LG that was probably one of our
favorite ones back then and the reports
claim that apparently LG is already
working on one we shall don't know when
we might get it but apparently LG is
focusing on getting this phone to
verizon and now just got a very
interesting partnership with verizon
recently new phones that are exclusive
to LG so let's see what we get with this
product hopefully 2k display we don't
know we'll see one of our favorite
smartphones of the year is the Moto X or
should we say last year and we win
hearing that apparently Motorola is
already working on a successor or should
I say a new flagship that will be
smarter than any other smartphone in the
market according to the quotes from the
source which is really interesting we
don't know if this will be the next Moto
X mainly because according to the source
the photo will be ready very soon the
Moto X has barely been in the market for
a couple of months so we'll see and for
those of you fans of unlocking your
smartphone like me for example new
unlocking locks become effective as of
februari 11th in the United States now
bear in mind these laws are interesting
mainly because it's not like if they
stop protecting carriers for example you
have to finish your two-year contract
for you to be able to do so with your
current phone you will be able to unlock
prepaid phone after a year of using it
unless you're in the military for
example you get your phone unlocked if
you can prove that you're in the
military there are a lot of loss here
some of these protect consumers some of
them don't really do so links in the
description read the whole thing really
interesting to see what we're getting
hopefully these laws will get better at
some point and finally for the very
interesting leaks of the day let's talk
about the galaxy s6 s case makers
continue to spill everything that we
want to know got the first leaks of the
cases that we're going to be used for
the galaxy s6 and the phones are right
beside it and we see the double-edged
galaxy s6 and we also see the regular
galaxy s6 really interesting as the
design is definitely different to
everything we've seen from Sam sing in
the past and we're just waiting to see
exactly what we get but it leads me to
the question of the day if both devices
were priced at the same range meaning if
both costs two hundred dollars after two
year contract which one would you pick
because in my case I would give the
double edged phone a try why not leave
us a comment down below what is your
case and folks have you always wanted to
learn Photoshop or become a master in
web designer even build a cool video
like this one there are thousands of
awesome courses at our sponsor Linda
calm / pocket now that's ly nba.com
slash pocket now for a free 10-day trial
you also know the drill if you want to
get those earlier before this video is
filmed make sure you follow us on
parking out our comment subscribe to
youtube channel as well you can follow
me on twitter hi my underscored iveta
