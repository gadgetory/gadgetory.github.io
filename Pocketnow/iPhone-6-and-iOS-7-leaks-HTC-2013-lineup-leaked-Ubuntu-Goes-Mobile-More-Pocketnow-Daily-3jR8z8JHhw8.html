season to aggressively serve 2013 and
you bunch of ghosts Bobo or at least
sort of I'm high memory vana and while
you're at it why don't you just launched
daus 4.2 as a mobile operating system
this is parking out daily that's right
an iPhone model 6.1 is already being
tested but you already knew that usually
the device get tested months before
gizmodo catches it and apparently it's
already out on the blue but what makes
this news interesting is the fact that
iOS 7 is already being tested and for
those of you that know iOS 6 was barely
tested a month before it was announced
so it does seem as if Apple is already
worrying on their dud and trying to fix
it with this new version of iOS 7 could
this be Johnny hives first operating
system will surely know by WWDC and for
those of you that didn't know
instalação is dead we know that many
of you jailbreak your devices with the
need to probably get tethering or their
services but other people were out there
to get applications being siloed into
their device obviously this is a big win
for the developer community by our
biggest concern is that sadly the
jailbreak community is pretty much in
dire straits lately no enhancements no
changes the iPhone 5 is still not being
able to be jailbroken at least until
early so it does make you think of the
jailbreak community is doing something
for the future hopefully in better and
more legal terms that's actually a word
now HTC makes the biggest news today
their China president already came on
record to state that the company's
agreement with Apple when it comes to
patent litigation will allow the company
to bring a lot more innovation in 2013
there's already a big list of 35 devices
being launched during the year and we do
know that includes a lot of variants but
the droid DNA that was on the list is
included we do know that the m7 is
coming probably at CES 2013 and
apparently we do have the quattro coming
back which was the tablet that was
pretty much ditch months ago so we'll
see what happens probably see us
probably mwc now the harsh predictions
came to nokia this time because forbes
already came on record to predict that
the company will sell their mobile
division to huawei in 2013 and then
they'll sell their smartphone division
to Microsoft and when you see Nokia
struggling for
up to the point of selling their own
house you could come to understand that
Microsoft pretty much could buy the
whole company with just one stroke aside
from that we also see that within the
predictions it is said that the company
will dedicate themselves to only
software and services and when you see
them bringing their map services to iOS
everything just comes to make sense
sadly and finally for the wait what news
of the day you bunt to is just announced
their new mobile operating system that
reminds us a lot of me go on the Nokia
n9 lots of swipes everywhere are very
nice UI very elegant and it handles HTML
applications in a unique way that even
provides notifications now what's
interesting though is that sadly it
won't be available until 2014 and even
though there will be a port for the
Galaxy Nexus not the Nexus 4 for some
reason it'll sadly become suicide when
you think about having to wait so long
for mobile operating system and giving
everybody the chance to just bring their
own variations of whatever that leads me
to the question of the day what would
you think about a fourth or fifth
operating system when it comes to
smartphones I mean you bunt to would
pretty much be the fourth or fifth or
six I think it is leave us a comment
down below I really like the design and
everything I just feel it's gonna be a
little too late and if you want an
earlier a scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
will make sure you follow us on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hi meri
behna thanks for watching see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
