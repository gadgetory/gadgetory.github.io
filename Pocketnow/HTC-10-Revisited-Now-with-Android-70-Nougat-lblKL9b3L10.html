seven but new cat adoption is still
willful eloah many manufacturers are
running beta programs but one of the
only phones to receive a proper update
is this here HTC 10 we spent a few days
putting this update through its paces
and the outlook is pretty rosy HTC has
been steadily walking away from severe
UI changes relying more and more on
stock Android nougat continues that
refinement using the HTC launcher we
still have blinkfeed docked to the left
and we still get HTC's take on
customization with more options to play
with than google's launcher the app
drawer is also a significant departure
from stock android with top-level
shortcuts and organization settings so
HTC maintains a unique feel to the phone
without completely removing the user
from familiar Android territory now with
Android 7 the notification shade
benefits from richer content reply
options and maintains more of a stock
layout for quick actions like Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth control additionally the ten
makes great use of new multitasking
features toggling back and forth between
two apps is an easy button tap long
pressing launches a handy split-screen
option even for a regular-sized phone
it's a handy option for keeping info on
the screen when you need it this has
been a well-executed update performance
numbers are on point
the HTC 10 still benches near the top of
the charts for a Qualcomm powered phone
battery life is in the same ballpark
where we were on marshmallow and we
haven't run into any crippling bugs
exactly what we would hope to find when
these updates are supposed to be just
that updates improvements Android is a
flexible operating system and there's
still benefit to manufacturers
customizing the experience nougat is
well improved and brings fun features
we've played with on some other skins in
the past but there's still room to
innovate on top of what Google supplies
heck even Google is getting into the
game with the pixel one small step
removed from stock Android itself the
Google still faces some significant
hurdles in the software strategy though
we're waiting on numerous manufacturers
to get this out to consumers but
comparatively HTC is ahead of the curve
here one of the most underrated phones
of the year HTC 10 owners will be a
little more on the pulse
