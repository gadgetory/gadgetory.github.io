paka now calm and today we're looking at
a Windows Phone app for language
enthusiasts particularly those who like
to use the google translate portal on
the web the google translate website
allows you to enter a word phrase
sentence and so on and it'll actually
translate them into a number of
different languages very useful if
you're trying to learn or communicate in
a foreign language so last month we
checked out the official google
translate application for android and
found it to be quite robust google
hasn't released an official app for
windows phone so one developer actually
decided to make a comparable app on his
own alright so I apologize if I'm
butchering the pronunciation but I
believe this app is appropriately called
anuva duck which is Hindi for translator
and as you can see it looks very similar
to the Android Google Translate app we
looked at before so let me bring in this
verizon droid incredible here so i can
give you a quick overview of the android
version and then i'll go over the new
windows phone equivalent so you can see
the resemblance all right at the top
here we have the text entry field so
let's just erase that by pressing this X
and now we have a microphone that's
actually for speech to text so you can
speak to your device and it will fill
out the text for you very cool feature
and unfortunately this windows mobile
version does not have that feature but I
did speak to the developer and he
mentioned that he's actively working on
implementing this feature in a future
release so that's great news moving on
we have this button over here to reverse
the input and output languages and we
can change lang languages by pressing
the middle button over there and of
course we have the translate button so
over here I already have a phrase that I
looked up which is where is the bathroom
in Spanish and it gave me donde esta el
bano
so we can actually press this little
speaker over here no new style manual
and as you can hear it does pronounce it
for you so a very cool feature so let's
move that to the side and drill into
this windows mobile version so up here
we have the similar text entry field and
we can press that X button just like in
the Android version to get rid of any
text that we input there under that we
have a feature called enable instant
translation this is an alpha and I
believe it helps boost the speed of
translation if you're on a very slow
connection over here we have the similar
reverse language button and next to that
we have our input and language options
so right now it's set to English for
input and French for output I want to
change output to a different language so
I'm going to go ahead and press that as
you can see there are a ton a ton of
languages I actually counted over 50 of
them so we'll go back up to the top here
and i'll go with spanish and i'll go
ahead and type in where is the bathroom
just like in the android version
? that looks good we'll press translate
okay and there it is translation donde
esta el bano to recall the same as the
android version and under it it has the
English input language we put so if we
actually tap on that we get some other
options we can listen to it and as you
can hear it's the same robotic voice
that we get on the Android version so
very good good feature to pour it over
to this version let's go over here we
can copy to the clipboard in case you
wanted to mail it we can actually send
an SMS with the translated included very
cool and we can translate to another
language so if we wanted to pick another
language we could do that and finally
let's go ahead and reverse the languages
and i'm going to type in ola which
should be hello there it is in English
so let's go ahead and listen to that
with ll text to speech option sorry i
was speaking hello so it works very well
so this was a look at a Google Translate
app for Windows Phone it brings many of
the cool features found in the official
version we've seen for Android and I've
got to say that this version seems more
powerful and looks better than many I've
seen in the past for windows mobile and
the best part of it is that it's free as
usual i'll post a link on pacquiao calm
