packing.com and if you want to increase
your vocabulary or just entertain
yourself for a little bit then weirdly
would probably be the game for you so
what this is is kind of like a boggle
based game in which you actually have to
select words based on a four by four
grid of letters okay so I'm just going
to start a new game and the way that it
works is you actually have to scroll
your fingers on the letters to select
that word so let's see I have pins and
nip and looks I have pins again but I
can't think that you can't have the same
word twice and as you can see on the
bottom it actually shows two out of 86
words possible so tad hmm let's see min
now that's not a real word okay nip nips
din-dins soaps okay so anyways as you
can see you can just pick many different
words and when you get to 20 seconds or
less it will start counting down your
clock and to show you how many words you
got right so let me just see if I can
get any more at the very end tad now we
are going to have that one so I think
that's about it okay so when you're
finished it will show your results so
six out of 86 that's only six percent so
not too great and then it will give you
a list of all the available words that
was inside of that puzzle so I'm just
going to go to the main menu right now
and we can go into some of the settings
and here's where you can actually change
your time limit so you can have one
minute three minutes five minutes or
unlimited depending on how you want to
challenge yourself you also have can
turn on your sounds and turn off your
sounds we'll just go back by clicking
this arrow so this is wordly and the
game is only 99 cents on windows mobile
marketplace and this is another
marketplace take where we choose some
fun and interesting games on windows
mobile marketplace thanks
