this is a viewer request episode you see
we've had actually a couple viewers say
hey you've talked about Evernote in the
past now Evernote looks like that is an
app that lets you take notes and sync
them with the cloud so in this episode
we'd like to show you a little bit about
what Evernote is what it does and get
into how I use it and how it might help
you in your life let's go take a look
all right so normally this is the part
where I would start showing you the
application in use but before I do that
I've got to explain to some of you guys
who don't know what Evernote is well
whatever note is so if you already know
what Evernote is in order to use it then
go ahead and skip this part and jump
right over to the app no problem I won't
be offended go ahead and do that for the
rest of you guys Evernote is a web app
it's also got desktop and mobile clients
kind of like Gmail but for notes now
Gmail is free but it's ad based Evernote
has kind of a different platform it's
got a different philosophy of how to do
it and they call it freemium I know it
sounds weird it's their word and not
mine but what they do is they have a
free version or a free level of service
and then a premium version or a premium
level of service and the apps are really
all the same the level of service is
what differentiates it and it's really
how much data that you sync to the web
that determines whether you're on the
free of the premium plan so it's really
kind of nice if you want to try it out
go ahead and try it it's not going to
cost you any money until you decide to
pay for it so they're not going to
automatically start charging your credit
card don't let you know how you've
exceeded your free allocation and it's
going to start costing you money so here
it gives your credit card money if you
want to do that or scale back to use
they'll let you know they're really good
I haven't hit that cap yet I don't use
it a lot but I do use it you know quite
a bit so a little bit more detail it's a
web app so you have to be able to sync
to the cloud to be able to get the full
use out of this now early versions of
the app you also had to have an internet
connection so that you could basically
use it because everything was downloaded
from the web and upload it to the web it
was all right there on the web not on
your device the new version which a
couple of you son that's why I'm doing
this video that version has a local
store that will basically queue up
anything that it needs to send to the
web and it won't worry about not being
able to synchronize your notes from the
web if you're offline if you're
unavailable to get out if you're only on
$7 data and you don't want to use you
know any of your megabytes or whatnot
for a furling Evernote so this version
they've thought it out really really
well and it is the Android version I
can't speak to any other versions
honestly I don't know they have an app
for iPhone they have an app for Windows
Mobile I don't think they have one for
Windows Phone 7 yet if they do make sure
you let us know that in the comments
down below so we can get one of our
windows 7 guys when it's bone7 guys
working on it now on the desktop side
they do have apps desktop apps for both
Windows and for the iOS or for the Mac
OS whatever their Apple computers just
kidding guys don't flame me okay
basically what you can do is if you're
on your desktop you can take a note you
write you know you save it and it's
there you can then have access to that
on your mobile phone or on a browser on
you know a friend's computer or whatever
and it synchronizes all this on the web
and it's just beautiful everything works
the way it's supposed to you can take
web snippets so that you can remember
web page it's kind of like a bookmark
but in your own Evernote book you see
that if that forever note little play on
words they did there anyway yeah I don't
know funny to that you decide but what
it'll do then is it'll keep all this for
you all together forever and ever so
that you can have access to it whenever
you want whatever you need and they
really want you to to get addicted to
this so if you want to have that the
playground drug-dealer metaphor you know
that's great the first one is free and
once you get hooked then it's going to
cost you that's their model like it or
not that's what it is
so there's your background there's your
history on what Evernote is and what
Evernote does one last thing before we
get into hands-on Evernote is not just
text notes it's spoken notes
it's pictures it's web snippets it's
it's actually handwritten notes it's all
kinds of stuff and it's really cool it
also does you know handwriting
recognition on their servers it does
text recognition if you want to take a
picture of
this card it'll recognize that text on
their servers and then allow you to
search for that on your mobile device
it'll actually let you search for what
the content is in the picture of that
business card or that picture of that
advertisement in the magazine or that
hand scribbled note that you wrote down
it's going to do all of that text
recognition in the background turn it
into text that you can actually search
on so really really kind of cool
Microsoft's trying to do something like
that with their OneNote application it's
quite a bit different and there's not a
one-note Android app so uh you know I
don't know why I'm even mentioning it
but that's the intro all you guys who
fast forwarded through it can now get
back to the practical hands-on so let's
all go take a look at that okay so after
that long intro we're going to keep this
hands-on practical relatively short all
right first and foremost you've got
different types of things that you can
do you can add a new note or you can add
a new snapshot there's a little divider
line right here separating it out from
all notes all of your tags your
notebooks and the ability to search can
also go into your menu and synchronize
with your online notebook now it's going
to do that automatically in the
background if you tell it to in the
settings which is over here here's where
you can upgrade to premium if you want
gives you more notebooks increased quota
more fun stuff like that you can also
select what notebooks you want to
synchronize and keep offline right now I
have none and it says in order to do
that I've got to have a premium
subscription to it so I'm not buying the
app the app itself is free it's the
service that I'd be paying for upload
notifications Here I am going to be
notified up here in my status bar of
basically the upload status so I'm going
to write a note it's going to be local
to the device and it will let me know up
in the status bar when that's been
synchronized to the cloud so kind of
nice there I can clear history clear
cache send a log of information to
Evernote in case something went wrong
it's got my current version I can check
for updates here's where I can save on
my my data use if I don't have an
unlimited data plan I can choose to sync
over Wi-Fi only I can choose to sync my
data when
the device powers up I think that's a
good idea so we'll do that it's gonna
sync automatically every you know every
day is good so I'm going to uncheck the
powerup thing use GPS so it's going to
geotag my notes which is nice I can look
for all of my notes when I was at mix in
Las Vegas or when I was at and MWC
because it's all geo tagged and then if
I want to use my network which could
have monetary cost I can choose that or
unchoose that
so there's settings of course I can log
out if I want to using the Sign Out
button as well back here down at the
bottom I've got my last sink it says it
last sink ten minutes ago so fabulous
great good job tags tags are just like
you'd expect them to be they are key
words that you can use to identify your
notes so here you can see I've got some
stuff tagged Android I got some stuff
tagged bus a salt ALK those the copilot
live people activation stuff android
cemetery just a whole bunch of stuff I
can come through here and do all kinds
of cool things I can sort it by note by
title by whatever and you can see I've
got little little counters little
indicators to let me know how many notes
have that here's my hit and run notes
which was actually one of my very first
Android articles for pocketnow.com so
make sure you go back in the history and
and check that article out I can also
look up my notebooks so I've got
notebooks for church for contacts geeky
stuff Michael that's my son
lifetime unfiled of course and that's
where I got most of my stuff I didn't do
better with filing in notebooks my
wife's phone yada yada yada basic stuff
there and you could have notebooks now
I'm just associated notebooks with
generalities because the free version
doesn't let you do an awful lot of of
notebooks so it's very very limited in
that aspect but you can repurpose that
too to have different areas or different
aspects of your life instead of very
granular notebooks about specific stuff
like at pocket now I could have a
notebook all about the t-mobile g2 I
could have a
look all about the the HTC Desire HD and
have all my stuff my photos my articles
videos any notes that I had any websites
and I wonder for - all in that notebook
and what goes in notebooks well notes do
and here's a list of all my notes which
I mean that's pretty obvious instead of
showing you that lets go into new note
now in this new note you can give it a
title so we're gonna do this and I
showed you the the voice features before
new note and didn't hear me new new note
okay it's not like in Texas or voice
today so we're just gonna call it what
do you guys want to call it pocket now
and o/w okay great and now we could
write some content and my title just
moved up off the screen automatically
for me now I can either do an attachment
I can attach something to it a picture
audio video or just a regular file I can
come over here and add some tags skip
that I can tell it what notebook I want
it to go into and I can take a picture
with the camera which takes a minute so
there's my hand if we wanted to take a
picture with my hand you like that kinda
creepy isn't it we'll cancel that and
then of course we've got the microphone
using the microphone you can actually
have a recorded a voice recorded note
and on this ROM I'm having a little bit
of problem with with microphone stuff
with spoken stuff as you could tell and
with the camera that's not an Evernote
thing that's a wrong thing custom ROM
it's a bug so just don't be worried
about that but now you can see I've got
this little player icon so I can
actually tap that and either remove it
do it or go back just just a nice audio
note and it's included right there I can
even have a text note to go along with
that so all kinds of really cool stuff
I'm relatively impressed with this app
and I think that if you do not have
a note-taking app that you use regularly
this is it the one thing that it doesn't
have that I would really like it to is
to have a to-do list basically a daily
task list where I could have on this
view maybe a to-do or goals or whatever
so that I can check stuff off when
they're completed I can assign deadlines
and whatnot to it that's not really the
intent of Evernote but when I'm thinking
about to-do lists and notes that kind of
go hand in hand I don't know what are
your thoughts then again what what apps
are out there that do the to do stuff
like I've just mentioned that you use
what other notes taking apps are out
there that you use instead of Evernote
of course I want to know that go ahead
and leave us comments down in the bottom
especially if you can give us videos of
your favorite note-taking app in action
that would be amazingly awesome and all
of our viewers would love to see that so
we've come to the end of it it's a very
basic program with lots of cool stuff
that you can do with it I highly
recommend it like I said the app is free
in the Android Market the service is
free up to a point with certain more
cool and more powerful features
available at a very very affordable
price so don't be shy away from the
premium end of things I like quite a bit
if you like this kind of video and want
to see more reviews and hands-on of
specific apps let us know down in the
comments below and give this video a
thumbs up so we know you like this kind
of stuff just in general subscribe to
our video channel if you haven't done so
already so you can make sure that all
that stuff that you know everyone else
is commenting about that they want to
see yeah that you don't miss out on that
and of course head over to pocketnow.com
