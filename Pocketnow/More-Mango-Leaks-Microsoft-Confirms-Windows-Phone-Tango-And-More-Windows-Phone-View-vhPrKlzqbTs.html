application logs Microsoft confirms with
tango will be four and rumors point out
to Windows Phone only HTC event all this
and more coming up right now hello
everyone I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter with
pocketnow.com and welcome to Windows
Phone view the show we wrap up all this
week's good and bad inside the world of
Microsoft's Windows Phone platform let's
heart this week off with what's good
well more windows phone mango devices
have been leaked best developers
continue posting the Lords of the
devices that have been testing their
applications at Microsoft or somewhere
but it seems that now aside from the HTC
eternity and Omega that we talked about
in the past and also the Nokia 800 which
is supposedly a seer a device which
would be that n9 converted to Windows
Phone we also have information of a new
LG fantasy that we did here up in the
past but didn't know what to make of yet
or if it was official and aside from
that there's also an HTC radiant which
we don't have any specs yet but is also
a promising future windows phone mango
device so stay tuned as we continue
digging up more information of devices
that will probably be released hopefully
soon and while continuing on with more
rumors we have a recent job posting
where Microsoft is searching for
somebody that will bring better desktop
integration to the Windows Phone
platform something that's long overdue I
mean even activesync did a better job
than the current zune software can do
back in the day so really interesting
news and aside from that there are
rumors that we will finally get internet
sharing to be ported to windows phone
mango devices in the future sadly we're
not sure this will be available to all
windows phone devices because sadly
that's pretty much locked by carriers
not sure if you're going to have to pay
for it most likely will but if you have
an unlocked device like the dell venue
pro you're most likely in luck so let's
see what develops of these rumors
eventually and well speaking of devices
ACC has just posted an invitation on
their facebook page for an event on
September first in London and at the
beginning we thought this would be a
typical Android device events
rumors have it that it will be a Windows
Phone exclusive event will definitely be
getting the omega and eternity they have
been rumored but aside from that if this
is going to be a Windows Phone exclusive
events will most likely get more devices
other rumors have it that the eternity
will be sporting a 3.7 inch screen and
the P Omega will be getting a massive
4.5 inch display really nice devices
coming up hopefully we will get more but
aside from the fact that we will be
getting more mango devices the
interesting news here is that will
probably be getting windows phone 7
mango as of September first being that
fall launched the Vice event hopefully
and speaking of more manufacturing
rumors we recently revealed an LG
smartphone that took its a while to
figure out it was the lge 906 which is
very similar to the current Optimus 7
which is the e 900 but interesting
enough but it had a couple of
differences and well it turns out that
just like LG brands their LG prada for
style this will be the Jil Sander
smartphone in honor of the famous german
designer and we still don't know when it
will be sold or how much it's going to
cost but we'll definitely be looking out
for that and aside from that we also
caught the fact that LG is working on
porting their own smartphone
applications for windows phone 7 just as
a way to differentiate their smartphones
from others just like HTC does which are
really good new so not no shirt baits
for that hopefully when mango gets
released we will be getting those so
really interesting news out of the
software releases for the week microsoft
is justin veal the service called we're
in which is inspired on google latitude
if you're going out with friends but
have a hard time knowing where you're
going well this application will allow
you to share your location with friends
in real time just like you can do in
latitude sally at the moment the
application is limited to Windows Phone
7 devices but thank God Microsoft's a
software company because they have
confirmed that they are working on
porting the service to other platforms
in the future aside from that Microsoft
has also released an update to there
soon client which brings mango support
so make sure you hit that update as soon
as you can and we'll start from that
famous pens have just been approved to
Microsoft for their Metro UI so
it's really cool to see that this Metro
UI will be exclusive to Windows Phones
platform from here on and nobody will be
copying it hopefully and that's webOS
rest in peace you'll be happy to know
that Microsoft is now offering windows
phones free windows phones and actually
free developer tools for all webOS
registered developers to be porting
their applications to Windows Phone 7 I
really got to give a lot of love to
Microsoft where their aggressiveness and
what they're doing now because currently
we only have thirty thousand
applications in the windows phone
marketplace and well it's really good to
see that Microsoft is being aggressive
and bringing more applications because
competitors currently have hundreds of
thousands of applications to compete so
we really need that to be leveled up and
well it's really cool to see that it's
happening well that does it for the good
let's continue on with what's bad we're
all wondering what's Microsoft going to
be doing with this Windows Phone tango
that's been rumoured and well
Microsoft's came on record to confirm
that this will be just a minor update to
Windows Phone 7 mango which will allow
the platform to work on less capable
hardware and while this not necessarily
bad but the sad news is that this new
platform will apparently be only
available in developing countries it
won't be sold in the United States and
well we really don't need fragmentation
in the United States anyways and we do
feel that Windows Phone is competitively
priced they're really well priced but
still it's sad to see that these other
options will not be available in the
United States and only in other
countries I mean it's really good to
have options some people don't really
might like sophisticated devices they
like something that's a bit chopped down
and well it's sad to see that that
simplicity will not be pointed to us
customers but still these are just
confirmations for Microsoft and they do
change their mind a lot so hopefully
they will change their minds about this
in the future that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
Jaime better remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
