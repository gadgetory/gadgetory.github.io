phone nowadays we want to customize them
we want to personalize them we want to
get them in all kinds of different
colors I'm Joe Levi for pocket now
here's how you can make your nexus 4
look like a mahogany Moto X this is my
nexus 4 on the front is a very nice
piece of glass with rounded over edges
that I just love the way this thing
feels on the back however is another
sheet of glass that's very very slippery
so when you hold it there's a good
possibility it's going to slip right out
of your hands and mine did and that's
what ended up in it being broken if you
haven't seen that i'll have a link down
in the description over here on the back
you can see i have covered up that glass
with a little adhesive cover from a
company called debrand this just fits on
the back this one's a nice bright yellow
faux leather finish and it adds just
enough grip that I've never had a
problem dropping this and really makes
my phone stand out and a lot of people
now recognize this is a Nexus device 1
i'm out in using it in public whereas
before they always wondered what phone i
had oh that's a nexus because it calls
it out well now that the Moto X is out
and will be available soon in well would
which i think is cool by the way I want
to do something with this to make it
look more like that and the answer is a
new product that they just came out with
called mahogany so let's go ahead and
unbox this this is from addie brand and
they say they are the boss of vinyl
skins will just unbox this really fast
there's there's the unboxing just a nice
plastic sleeve there's their brand if
you want to know where you can get yours
and this this isn't anything that they
sent us for free or anything i bought
this because i am a fan of their
products so here's the vinyl skin has a
little bit of grip to it which is nice
and it looks like wood grain it's not
really would but it looks a lot like it
so let's go ahead and get this installed
on the back of our nexus 4 so we for
need to take off what we already have
and I cheated a little bit off camera I
already started the corner so I'm going
to just lift this off and i will save
this for later use and we just peel it
just like that being a little bit
careful around the lettering and just
like that and now you can see there's my
back of my device right there it's got a
little bit add a little bit of goober on
it but it doesn't so we're good to go
next thing we want to do is put this
down now this isn't like a screen
protector you don't have to be nearly as
precise with it what you do want to do
is just take it off the back so that's
what I'm done took it off the backing
very quick very easy and then you simply
line it up with your camera hole your
flash and your speaker so I'm going to
stop looking at the camera and start
doing this down here it is a pretty
precise fit but the adhesive is a very
forgiving so as long as you don't press
it down really good you can lift and
reapply and it's not terribly difficult
the nice thing about the nexus 4
specifically is you've got this nice
reference point in this corner and in
that corner and I'm just going to make
sure everything is good set it down and
then you'll want to spend a little bit
of time right here pushing down in your
cutouts you can get it without the word
Nexus cut out if you desire I personally
like it but there you go nexus 4 wood
grain and when I turn it on let me
unlock this with my face I've also got a
matching wood grain background from the
Moto X so there you go a woodgrain Nexus
4 thanks to our friends over at dbrand
Inc now this is not quite as Griffey as
the fake leather that I had on there
before but it still is really good I
have a lot of tact to it it's not
something that's going to slip and fall
out of my hand like the naked nexus 4
wood with its glass back I like it quite
a lot and as you can see their
installation is not new
is difficult as you may think that it is
