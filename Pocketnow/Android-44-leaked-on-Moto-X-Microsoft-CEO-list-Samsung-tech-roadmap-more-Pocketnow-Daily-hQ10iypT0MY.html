technology coming soon to a galaxy near
you leagues of android 4.4 kitkat beam
test on the Moto X begin to surface in
Microsoft's lists the possible CEO
successors emerges I'm hi Mary that up
and don't worry my name will be on that
Microsoft list very soon or at least I
hope this is out daily listeners
day off with some official news as those
of you interested in getting Microsoft's
first windows phone phablet which would
be the Nokia Lumia 1520 we can get in on
a TNT as soon as November 15th for two
hundred dollars after a two-year
contract somewhere around five thirty
nine if you want to get that phone
unlocked and this is pretty much the
most powerful Windows Phone ever aside
from the biggest one as well so there
are a lot of cool things to expect on
this device let's see how it goes now
let's talk about Samson as the company
has pretty much showed as their
technology roadmap for the next coming
years which is kind of interesting if
they're sharing that already and we are
getting 64-bit custom-made CPUs for
their future galaxy phones next year
that was an expected one but even more
interesting is the fact that the company
is working on display technologies to
bring 4k which is great and also
foldable displays which I am really
trying to understand if you get a
foldable display does that really mean
that you have a foldable phone which
would be great I mean think about a
tablet that is foldable to become a
smartphone and that's ever gonna happen
anyways now let's talk about Apple for
those of you worried on trying to get an
iphone 5s after so many shortages well
it seems that the company is already
working on getting more suppliers and we
know Foxconn we know hon hi but
apparently the company has just hired
Taiwanese company Worcester on to be in
charge of the iphone 5c in order for on
high and for Foxconn to focus on the
five s so this should increase
production capacity soon or at least
expected for the holiday season so stay
tuned for that that's how they sell more
phones as well and if you're wondering
who is the next Microsoft CEO sadly I
haven't been called yet but so far the
list narrows down to three people
Stephen Elop from Nokia which you
already know when is probably one of the
biggest candidates then we have Alan
Mulally from Ford who has confirmed for
the second time that he's not interested
but is on the list somehow and then
we've got Tony Bates from skype so
interesting we've got 3x CEOs that are
apparently or silently or just being
considered for the job or applying for
it we don't really don't know how things
are going to happen here but hopefully
they will find a CEO before the year
ends as Microsoft is desperate for a
turnaround and finally for the hot news
of the day android 4.4 kitkat is leaked
as being tested on a non Nexus device
for the first time this time being the
Moto X from t-mobile so yes carriers and
OEMs are having some fun with it already
you know it's easier for Motorola for
reasons that are definitely obvious but
still since android 4.4 kitkat was
designed to run on lower and hardware
better than previous versions of Android
that leads us to the question of the day
how much would you be willing to pay to
get 4.4 on your current device because
in my particular case if they told me
that if I paid fifty dollars to get that
on my old Galaxy Nexus I would
definitely pay for it the Galaxy Nexus
was a great phone so leave us a comment
down below would you be willing to pay
to get 4.4 on your current previous
generation device and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is film make
sure you follow us on pocket our comment
