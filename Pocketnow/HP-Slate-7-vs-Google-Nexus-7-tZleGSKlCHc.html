pocketnow.com Tony behind the camera
checking out the HP slate7 the new
android powered tablet at seven inches
from HP as you can see we got the red
one here it's gonna do a little
comparison against the nexus 7 the
google powered nexus 7 from a sous so
let's check them out so as you can see
this the Red unit here is a little
different from the silver one we just
checked out in our initial hands on but
the material is the same it is a soft
touch rubber over a stainless steel
chassis we learned in between the videos
so that's pretty cool that's in contrast
to the Nexus 7's stippled rubber feel
but in each hand you can tell that the
materials are very very similar they're
both very grippy it is very easy to keep
these devices in the hand and their
weight is not all that dissimilar at all
this comparison is especially impressive
considering these devices are running or
not impressive this comparison is
especially important considering these
devices are both running stock Android
jelly bean but before we get into that
let's just have a quick look here these
are both right around 1 megabit 1
megapixel on the front facing camera but
the Nexus 7 features no rear facing
camera the HP slate7 does although it is
a 3 megapixel shooters you're not going
to be taking any major landscapes there
obviously volume rockers on both power
standbys on the right with a nexus 7
where it is on the top on the slate
there's your microSD expansion not
present on the Nexus 7 but on the slate
7 you're starting out with only eight
gigs of on-board storage there's a
headphone jack on top it's on the bottom
on the Nexus 7 both have micro USB looks
like stereo speakers here and of course
beats audio on the HP slate7 this once
we power on the displays we can see this
1024 x 600 aspect ratio in the HP slate7
kind of an oddball number when you when
you come down to it for the first time
but you'll notice it gives you a very
portrait exit portrait heavy arrangement
on the display here compared to the
Nexus 7 which appears a little bit wider
but as we mentioned before both devices
are running the stock build of
droid jellybeans and you can see here
you can see a little bit deeper blacks
on the Nexus 7 this tends to shine with
a little bit of gray when we amp up the
backlight as much as we have on the
slate 7 but aside from that software
differences there aren't many except HP
is going out of its way to kind of point
out that when you're on a site like say
for example androidcentral or pocket now
whichever you can select the new print
option down here and the website will be
rendered in a format that is friendly
for printers which is pretty cool also
when you hop into the settings you can
see that there is a special section for
beats audio and its respective
equalization settings and of course to
support that on the software side so
once again just a quick look at the new
HP slate7 next to the asuste made google
nexus 7 we'll have some more thoughts on
this device and others here at mwc 2013
until then once again michael fisher
with pocket now Tony behind the camera
keep on watching and we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
