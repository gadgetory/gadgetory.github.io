pocketnow.com and we've got Li who's
gonna show us how the HCC media link
works with an HTC One X right now tell
me about it
mini-league tasty okay enter your TV
through HDMI so it'll work any device
which has HDMI okay it's powered by USB
incredibly easy to set up and to
continue you loose it setup get your any
of any one of the one series we're using
the One X here
swipe off with three fingers and then
it'll mirror the screen onto the device
automatically kicks in to landscape
because obviously TV is in landscape we
can then do anything we like on the
device interesting now one question
do you have to connect to the media link
for those four that swipe to worker
there's a device immediately detected
yes it's the swipe which connects to the
media link HD so that's how you set it
up initially and then when you go into
the same Wi-Fi network that's how you
continue to use it okay so you first
have to be all everything has to be on
the same Wi-Fi network for this to work
yep okay aside from mirroring what other
services do you get through medially so
anything you want so any videos HD
videos
Egypt also the advantage of the new
media linked with the linking of sense
Dameon content is protected so if you go
to watch and you have your premium
videos which previously been DRM okay
wouldn't have worked my idea and they
all work well with other devices through
DNA that will work in this situation so
you watch that not only can you watch
your video on your big screen in the
highest quality but you can then once
that's playing Christian funky and it
continued to use the device as a mobile
device then it's still playing and we've
got the mobile device back on the home
screen very good yeah and then whenever
you're finished with it free fingers
again just swipe down to the interesting
interesting now tell me can we get like
a quick demo like a quick real-life demo
where we start start media length start
playing a movie right now can you show
me
yep so Peter link is off yeah good new
1x
swipe off
connect you'll see that the screen water
muscular tape videos a picture story to
the gallery so you can see it'll soak up
all of your gallery click on videos
press the video bill then up to the
screen so we'll just take a look while
okay it's actually quite faster than
what we get between the iPhone and Apple
TV now you don't need any particular you
know I was hearing Peter Chao saying you
don't need any particular TV all you
have to do is purchase this media talk
right there any TV the one thing you
need on your TV is HTML all you need to
get power to that okay one of the one
seriously perfect and it actually has a
power connection right there is there
any pricing for that device there's no
pricing at this point yeah he'll be
different for each market okay okay very
interesting okay well thank you very
much that was appreciated Lee this time
