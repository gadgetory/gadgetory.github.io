Google envisions the perfect smartphone
should be but we don't blame you if you
feel that there's a striking resemblance
to a very direct competitor I'm hanging
out of event with pocket now and let's
find out which one is better in our
Google pixel versus iPhone 7 comparison
brought to you by T brand pocket now
Google pixel coverage is brought to you
by deep brand to buy the best fitting
skin for your phone or tablet visit deep
brand calm
if looks could kill neither of these
phones would win a beauty contest the
iPhone 7 has followed apples
conservative design language focus a
moron field and in looks and you could
argue the same thing about the pixel
rounded curves and 2.5 the glass give
each of these devices a pebble like
appeal and the obsession over thin and
light contributes to a compact feel in
the hand even if neither is really a
small phone about the only way to tell
them apart is by holding them given the
pixels rougher texture in the aluminum
which I actually preferred when compared
to the slippery iPhone in dimensions the
pixel is taller wider thicker and
heavier than the iPhone you could argue
that the larger 5-inch display on the
pixel compensates for the added size but
if you were to subtract the navigation
keys versus apples home button I call
this one its high what is it similar are
these displays Google offers a more
dense 1080p display with punchy er color
thanks to AMOLED technology while
Apple's p3 capable IPS panel is more in
the realm of 730 PE I'm personally more
inclined to the deeper color on the
pixel but you won't complain about the
beauty or color accuracy on the iPhone
and another thing you're not going to
complain about what the iPhone is
consuming content thanks to these dual
stereo speakers they aren't just some of
the loudest that we've tested this year
but also some of the most difficult to
muffle while holding the phone where the
pixel by contrast is probably the
easiest one to muffle thanks to its
inset design but it's plenty loud if you
just know how to hold it the speck
battle would be a wasted time given the
power efficiency of the iPhone the
topics that matter we have non
expandable storage options for 32 128
gigs on both though the iPhone 7 could
pony up to 256 for extra cash the pixel
sports a larger battery in addition to
some of the fastest charging
capabilities in the market but both
devices are comparable and lasting
through a day of myth to low use not
moderate or high where the iPhone swings
back heavily is with its ip67 water and
does resistance allowing for submersion
up to 30 minutes under a meter of water
where you won't be able to do more than
splash the pixel with its IP 53 rating
the topic of software is where things
get really tricky
we won't sit and argue over iOS or
Android being a better platform but it
would be fair to compare these based on
their approach the convenience i OS 10
has become a fan favorite thanks to the
evolution of certain gimmicks into real
features 3d touches grown up to now
include widgets for select applications
iMessage is now more playful thanks to
its new enhancements and the little
things like grace to wake in addition to
a more streamlined UI with Apple music
or all welcome changes Android 7.1
nougat on the other hand has stirred
more polarizing responses given the
weird circular icons that lack
consistency though and everything else I
will admit that I do love the denser
grid of icons on the launcher the more
customizable notification shade the more
useful approach to split-window
multitasking and why not we've even got
some sort of 3d touch here overall you
could say that Google does a far better
job at taking advantage of high density
displays than Apple does Google also
argues that its new assistant is far
more useful than Siri but this is one of
those arguments that's still hard to
prove you can call on both by simply
having the phone on standby and calling
hey Siri or ok Google both responds to
direct questions with either cards or
web searches Google assistant claims
that it has the advantage of being able
to follow context of a conversation
which we do agree that's actually very
good at keeping track of what you say
the only problem is that it's always
really just cumbersome to be saying OK
Google for every single question you ask
so you could say that it really breaks
the mold of how you would typically have
a conversation with a human where I feel
that Siri is more useful is in the fact
that it has homekit integration making
it very simple to just say good morning
and the lights turn on or 3rd party app
integration where you can simply call an
uber or send the tweet on your behalf
Google is still working with developers
on allowing the assistant to be able to
do that but in a nutshell from my
personal preferences I do prefer an
assistant that's actually
able to do things for me and not just
answer questions with some cumbersome
conversations if anything I would prefer
Google's approach to Google now which is
still here but let's face it on a
day-to-day basis it's really rare that I
call on either assistant which just
proves that there is still more work to
be done here for everything else I would
say that the experience of using either
phone is delightful both devices are
perfectly sized in my opinion for
one-handed use they offer very snappy
performance for gliding through menus
and launching applications even though
both devices are powerful enough for the
most intense graphics-intensive games
the regular battery life won't really
keep you playing for long and then call
quality and data speeds over 80 MT in
project 5 work great in New York City
and callers on the other end can really
tell which phone I was using a broader
topic of comparison is how both devices
approach the camera on one hand we've
got Apple catching up to things like
providing F 1.8 aperture on the lens
optical image stabilization and a 12
megapixel sensor and by contrast we've
got Google which wants to solve
everything with software by having f/2
aperture electronic image stabilization
and the same pixel count now if you
would stack these photos side by side
it's really hard to declare a winner
both devices shine and they with great
colour saturation and contrast and the
trick in low-light with the pixel is
just to have a steady hand where the
iPhone really shines more in avoiding
grain compared to the pixel if you
weren't holding it right the viewfinder
on both cameras is extremely practical
even if I would prefer the pixels quick
launch toggle over the power button
stabilization on video is top-notch on
both devices and notice the pixel
doesn't have optical image stabilization
and really the other spot where I would
give the pixel an edge is on the selfie
camera mainly because well it's got a
far better field and view that the
iPhone
on the whole declaring a winner of this
comparison that's definitely going to
stir controversy there is enough cult
following on both platforms to make the
end dramatic what I will tell you is
this I feel that google shot itself in
the foot by pricing the pixel at the
same level of the iPhone 7 and even
other flagships like the galaxy s7 don't
get me wrong the pixel is a very good
phone but its specification would have
made it a great phone for last year
standards not for 2016 charging $650 and
not matching the iPhone and stereo
speakers and water-resistant just really
kills the pixel for me yes you could
argue that the inclusion of the Google
assistant makes this phone compelling
but even there I would say that the
assistants still has more work to go
maybe 2017 will be a stronger product
that's worthy of driving iPhone users
away from their platform but from where
I stand today if this were my money I
pay for a device that the liver is on
everything the 2016 has to offer and not
something that was more baked for last
year pocket house Google pixel coverage
