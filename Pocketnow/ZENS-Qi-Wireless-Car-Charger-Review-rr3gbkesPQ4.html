is more practical and arguably useful
than any other place in your car of
course but is it as good in practice as
it is in theory I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and this is a review of the
Zins qi wireless car charger wireless
charging the technology many would have
loved to see take off is still in a
questionable infancy state five years
after first coming to smartphones only a
small fraction of modern devices shipped
with wireless charging embedded and even
fewer come with aftermarket options such
as wireless enabled cases or batteries
and the market is split over a few
competing technologies fighting to
become the standard that however doesn't
stop some manufacturers from continuing
to develop neat and useful ways to use
wireless charging earlier this week our
own michael fisher published his review
of the Zins qi wireless portable speaker
and NFC enabled bluetooth speaker that
charges your phone and lasts through an
impressive eight hours of playback and
phone charging I also reviewed a Qi
enabled case for the iPhone 5 from since
last year but the company isn't stopping
there
it's tackling an area where Qi has thus
far been mostly absent an area where the
hassle of wires can be particularly
distracting and dangerous where wireless
charging is arguably the most useful and
practical the car there are some
existing aftermarket Qi car chargers as
well as a limited number of cars that
roll of the lot with the Qi standard
embedded there are also some DIY methods
which may include tearing your head unit
out and stuffing a wireless charging
plate somewhere in some unused space in
your - but Zins method is quite simply
the most foolproof and practical way to
bring Qi into your daily commute it
utilizes the one thing practically every
modern car in this world has cupholders
aptly named the Qi wireless car charger
the device itself looks more like
someone chopped the top half off a
travel mug and stuff some circuitry
inside it's a glossy black cylinder not
much bigger around than your standard
biggie size soda and it's approximately
four inches tall the sides are bare in
the bottom has a rubber pad for traction
but the top is where all the action
happens there are two labeled led status
lights one for power and one for charger
there's also a port for power in 12
volts at 3 amps and a 2.1 amp USB
for charging phones and tablets and the
large cutout in the middle is where you
drop your Qi enabled phones a charge of
course its directional so orientation
matters you'll want the phone to face
the status LEDs not the power in and at
least for the Nexus 5 charging happens
immediately upon dropping the phone into
the slot there is no hassle with
positioning and that's both a good and
bad thing with the device that fits in
the slot and lines up with the coil
inside the charger it's as hassle free
as it gets
vital for in car charging however if the
coil doesn't line up the charger is
practically useless for your phone and
there's no easy way to reposition the
phone it either works or it doesn't
zen says the charger will comfortably
hold phones with five inch screens or
smaller but in an age where 5-inch
phones are the average and 6.3 inch
phones are actually a thing the slot
size could be an issue for some then
again this design is limited to the size
of the standard cup holder so don't get
mad at Zins get mad at car manufacturers
for not making cup holders large enough
to hold your big gulp or your oversized
smartphone that aside how well does it
work how quickly does it charge
it's exactly what you'd expect from any
other wireless charger the average
charge rate we measure with the Nexus 5
was approximately 0.5% every minute
meaning a full charge from a fully
depleted battery would theoretically
take 3.5 hours that's approximately half
the charge rate of your standard 1 amp
wired charger which charged our Nexus 5
at approximately 1% every minute or 0%
to full in just over an hour and a half
that's the price to pay for the
convenience of no wire hassle while
driving and we see it's a pretty fair
trade-off sacrificing one of our two
poorly placed cupholders on the other
hand is still up for debate and that's
the other thing this entire concept from
Zen's brakes depending on where your
cupholders are in your car if a cup
holder isn't near the 12 volt socket
you're out of luck or in our case the
cup holder actually rests somewhat
behind the driver seat in the center
console making it a bit difficult to
comfortably reach also if you happen to
stream music from your phone while in
the car you'll have to constantly take
the phone off charge and you can't
really interact with the device while
it's charging that or it will encourage
you to keep your eyes on the road and
stop fooling with your phone which we
suppose is a good thing it's just
unfortunate so few smart phones support
the Qi standard what happens if your
next phone doesn't what if there are no
cases or accessories built for your
current phone you're just out of luck
and with so many what-ifs on the table
it will certainly be difficult for most
to stomach the ninety one dollars and 69
cent price tag not only are so many
other Cheops ins much cheaper the size
shape and design of this particular
charger severely limits its flexibility
but if you're behind the chief movement
and want wireless charging in your car
is this certainly one of the coolest
in-car gadgets around right now
and so long as your device fits and your
cup holders are in a convenient location
it works fantastically well whether $92
is offset and justified by the
convenience of simply dropping your
phone in a cup holder to charge is up to
you to decide we feel it's a little
steep but we won't deny the small amount
of satisfaction we get every time we
hear that subtle chirp
