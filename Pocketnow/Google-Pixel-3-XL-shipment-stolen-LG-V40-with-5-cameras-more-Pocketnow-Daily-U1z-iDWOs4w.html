impossible with some stories of a full
Google pixel 3 shipment getting stolen
warranting the leaks the LGV 40 caches
on the latest tendencies with the notch
and more cameras and ZTE is reportedly
finally bringing a successor to the
Exxon 7 hopefully for Aoife I'm high
metal Iveta and for those of you that
wanted Q&amp;amp;A is we just begun one and
Instagram stories in the pocket now
account we started with the Galaxy watch
everything you want to know follow
what's there this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
there are now buy one get one free deals
on AT&amp;amp;T for the samsung galaxy note 9
obviously there are some conditions it
depends on the installment plan it
depends on the fact that you first have
to get the Galaxy Note 9 and then you
don't necessarily get another Galaxy
Note 9 or there are options depending on
your legibility you can learn more about
everything in the description now let's
talk about Motorola and tendencies as
nostalgia we've seen companies focusing
on foldable displays as their next big
thing now we've got a patent from
Motorola that shows us the possible
successor to the razor but not the razor
Android phone that many of us didn't
really like this is actually a foldable
clamshell like razor like back in the
day if that actually ever does happen
that's gonna be I would say cool but
there's only one way to find out now
let's talk about ZT as apparently the
company is already working for its
successor to the Exxon 7 we didn't get
an Exxon 8 and then we had a whole
political mess that recently happened
now we hear that the company might be
gearing up for a launch at Aoife with
the axon 9 it seems that the number is
going to be 9 there's only one way to
find out as well will be a Tifa covering
everything live and keep you posted now
let's talk about LG and the v40 for
those of you wondering exactly what this
powerhouse is going to bring the rumor
is according to some renders are that
it's getting a notch it's gonna look
like the g7 which is kind of unfortunate
I like the screen on the G sorry on the
V 30 as it was but then we also hear
that it's gonna get more cameras we're
hearing five cameras two at the front
three at the back what are these cameras
gonna do that's gonna be a huge question
- stay tuned
and finally the hot Mission Impossible
style news have to do with the Google
pixel 3 pixel 3 excel
we've been scratching our heads over the
leaks exactly trying to understand that
these are controlled or not as it turns
out it seems that there was a full
shipment of phone stolen that they were
being sold in a black market in Russia
for two thousand dollars but wait
there's more it gets better and that
this is the reason why we're getting
these phones in Canada and that is the
reason why the leaks are probably
credible what I don't understand is why
I mean if you know if you're willing to
pay two thousand dollars for this phone
it's because you know what you're
getting here so why aren't there any
leaks showing us the phone have got a
pixel three here from all the people
that I know would chime in on the fact
that they have one whatever the case may
be let us know in the comments what do
you think about this new episode of
Mission Impossible think it's real think
it's fake I even think that this is fake
because it doesn't make sense people
would tell us that they've got a phone
it was a comment down below we love to
know your opinion friends again if you
