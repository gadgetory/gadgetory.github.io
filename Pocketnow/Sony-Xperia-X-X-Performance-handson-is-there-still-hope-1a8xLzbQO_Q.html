morning here in Barcelona when they
announced their new lineup of Xperia
cons the Xperia X's there are three in
the lineup we only have two here on
display in Barcelona and we're going to
take a closer look at both of them right
now if you're not able of telling these
two apart you are not the only ones I've
been told that the Xperia X performance
is the one that has the larger century
and hence this is the X performance this
is the X they have specs which are
common to both and if you look at them
closely they look identical give or take
a millimeter and measurement sony has a
new design philosophy we're not pretty
sure where Sony wants to position its X
lineup especially granted that the X
performance outclassed is the Xperia z5
premium and specification so we'll take
a look at this at this a little bit
later walking around the device you'll
see the same button layout with the
power button with the embedded
fingerprint scanner on the side volume
rockers dedicated camera key the camera
is on the back it's a new camera we'll
talk about those just in a minute and
the glass is a little bit curved on the
front facia of the phone and the
aluminum because it's no longer glass on
the back is also a little bit curved
sony says it's more ergonomically and
I'll give you this much it feels better
in hand because you don't have those
rough edges anymore waterproofing is not
in that as a feature which is unique to
the Xperia Z class phones the z5 s and
the following phones but I'll give you
that
they look good they're new it's a little
bit step away from their current design
philosophy but not such a huge leap
you're still instantly recognize this as
a Sony smartphone let's get into the
details with the Xperia
Z performance we got a 5-inch screen
which is a full HD display same as on
all three of the phones in the ex class
except for the x8 which has a 720p
screen
these two have 1080p displays we've got
a snapdragon 820 processor which is
powering the xperia x performance it's
the same processor that is powering the
LG g5 and some versions of the upcoming
galaxy s7 is a snappy processor it's
paired with three gigabytes of RAM of
course going through the menu is fluid
but we'll have to test in depth just to
see the endurance and the long term
performance 32 gigabytes of storage are
onboard of course expandable via microSD
card slot and the camera on the back is
a 23 megapixel camera with a new sensor
which allows opposed to the z5 s z5
premium which had phase detection
autofocus this is a new hybrid autofocus
system as this were at the back behind
the aluminum there's a twenty seven
hundred million power battery and sony
has a brand new implementation of its
own battery performance and stamina
features which were great on previous
iterations as well but this phone will
have awesome endurance putting away the
X performance for a bit we're looking at
the X which is the phone situated in the
middle of its x-class same 5-inch
display same Poe HD resolution this time
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650
processor same amount of three gigabytes
of RAM but storage options will defer we
will have either 32 gigabytes of storage
options or 32 and/or 64 for the dual SIM
variant of course all of these will be
expandable via microSD card camera is
the same 23 megapixel sensor with the
improved hybrid autofocus system and the
battery is a little bit smaller at 26 20
milliamp hours of course this is not
such a power-hungry processor whether
the decision to come up with a
completely new family of products is a
good or a bad one
it's up for you and the market to decide
we are waiting for these phones to
and in our labs or our usual review
treatment and after that we will tell
you whether these are worth purchasing
or not until then I have an answer
denied coming to you from Barcelona
thank you very much for watching you
know the drill subscribe everywhere to
not miss a beat see you in the next
