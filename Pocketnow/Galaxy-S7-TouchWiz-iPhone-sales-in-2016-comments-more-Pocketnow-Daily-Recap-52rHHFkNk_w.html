I think the same thing every time I look
at myself in the mirror hey Mateen de
semana tendremos frias hasta para
asistir da yo che viene estas invitado
know me que es mal que si pero no me
pone en la direccion teacher my comment
on the daily recap video Hyman damn it
ain't got nothing smart to say to get
thumbs up and I could totally get with
you me that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi I'm Eddie Vetter this
is pocket now and this is the parking
out daily recap for last week we started
off monday asking you which would you
pick LG g5 or galaxy s7 next year as
we've got rumors that both phones are
actually going to be launched very close
to each other and we had 918 comments
neither LG and Samsung need to fix their
skins before I can hop on board and you
know I do feel that Samsung it's done a
really good job with their skin but in
the case of LG I do agree in for the s7
to have USB type-c it SD card slot with
some leaks pointing towards it not
having it either if so then I'll stick
to the g5 and I think you'll most likely
stick to the g5 I'm gonna wait for you
guys reviews so that I can decide on the
s7 or g5 and that's actually the same
thing I did this year both phones were
really good but then up you know I ended
up choosing the g4 but eventually that
got replaced by the note 5 so it's kind
of a pickle I'm Tuesday the topic was
iPhones as analysts are predicting that
next year there will be a sales decline
for the first time ever and I ask you
why do you think analysts predict that
this could happen we had as always 866
comments we start with lack of
innovation same old design same old
price I do agree on the same old design
and same old price not necessarily lack
of innovation particularly because every
other OEM is doing the same thing with
for such technology now Apple is selling
less phones because Android has gotten a
lot better and though Apple is actually
not selling less phones right now the
prediction is for next year but I do
agree that Android phones have gotten
extremely great this year drop an iphone
sales next year I'll believe it when I
see it and I do agree Apple has got some
very interesting tactics into telling us
that they sell it to the phone starting
with the fact that they never tell you
exactly which phone sells the most which
is rather revealing the ones think the
discussion was all about the oneplus men
eight we saw the rumors and I asked you
do you think there's a spot for it
particularly what the 1+2 when the
oneplus X we hand corner in 81 comments
we start with four point six inches too
small for me five inches please and yeah
I'm not gonna bring though that's what
she said jokes but I kind of agree i do
feel the same about the iphone
particularly 4.7 inches on a display and
you know with the way they can innovate
with bezels I think that it's probably
too small question is with the 1+2 many
have the same specifications of the 1+2
the oneplus x is already a great budget
phone and I do agree to and you have a
solid point there that's the reason why
I got featured because that's the
question if they're gonna give me a one
plus two with the same specifications
only on a smaller chassis that can make
a lot of sense I think this can be a
great idea many people want the 4.5 inch
phone with top specifications that
surprises me that no android oems are
getting into that market sony is with
the experience c5 you know the compact
of the problem is that for some reason
sony is not selling as well as it should
on thursday we had a skeptical question
there were rumors that the snapdragon
820 might be exclusive to samsung for
period and i asked you if you thought
that was a smart idea we had sixteen
hundred and seven comments thanks a lot
guys we start with exclusive only works
if it's the best and yet it's the case
with certain products where the products
are just so good the marriage of
hardware and whatever just makes a lot
of sense i do get your point but in the
case of android i don't think it would
make any sense at all I don't understand
why Samsung is even considering the
Snapdragon 820 the exynos 7420 blew me
away going back to Qualcomm will be a
step back and you know it is a good
processor but that doesn't mean that
every previous samsung galaxy with a
Snapdragon processor perform better than
the X and O's counterparts that we saw
they're working with Samsung for it I
don't think they'll have a choice of
Samsung wants exclusivity Samson working
with Qualcomm for the chip and then
Google for touch was on the s7 series is
shaping up to be for the next phone of
2016 you know oh I don't think it's
going to be an exclusive we heard
previous rumors that said that there is
a variant of the Snapdragon 820 that is
being built along with Sam
yeah you make a really good point the
fact that Samsung is actually listening
to others for their future smartphone
makes a ton of sense obviously these
companies meaning Qualcomm and Google
are both interested in samsung success
so it makes all the sense in the world
and then finally Friday the topic was
TouchWiz the rumor is where that the
Galaxy s7 is going to be mostly about
improving TouchWiz not really changing
design and I asked you well how can
touch was be any better than stock
Android which is probably the most
beloved skin out there we had 881
comments I'd rather have touch wisdom
stock Android I like the features that
uh Liam's add to their own skin of
Android and you know in this particular
version of TouchWiz I will agree with
you I find it to be more useful than
stock Android she was already better
than stock I would theme support it's
actually more fluid than stock lollipop
and yeah again I guess I'm not the only
one that feels this way just eliminate
the carrier updates and just update all
at once make carrier bloat illegal
you're probably not gonna be able to get
rid of carrier blows but yes I feel that
this would be a major selling point if
Samsung would figure out a way to have
Android of 7 dot o or sixth auto-updates
just a week after the updates for each
Nexus devices that this would speak very
highly of Samsung I just don't think
it's gonna happen anytime soon that's it
