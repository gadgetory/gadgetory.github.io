I think the same thing every time I look
at myself in the mirror I mean I think
this American dream was free as a stair
para asistir Daniel que vienen estas
invitado make it as mark hey si pero no
map on la direcci√≥n teacher might
comment on the daily recap video hi man
damn it ain't got nothing smart to say
to get thumbs up and I could totally get
with you me that's right it's that time
of the week I am hi madam Iveta this is
PocketNow and this is the bargain out
daily recap for last week we started off
Monday asking you which would you pick
LG g5 or galaxy s7 next year as we've
got rumors that both phones are actually
going to be launched very close to each
other and we had 918 comments neither LG
and Samsung needs to fix their skins
before I can hop on board and you know I
do feel that Samsung has done a really
good job with their skin but in the case
of LG I do agree in for the s7 to have
USB type-c it as the car slob with some
leaks pointing towards it not having it
either
if so then I'll stick to the g5 and I
think you'll most likely stick to the g5
I'm gonna wait for you guys reviews so
that I can decide on the s7 or g5 and
that's actually the same thing I did
this year both phones were really good
but then you know I ended up choosing
the g4 but eventually that got replaced
by the note 5 so it's kind of a pick
week on Thursday the topic was iPhones
as analysts are predicting that next
year there will be a sales decline for
the first time ever and I ask you why do
you think analysts predict that this
could happen we had as always 866
comments we start with lack of
innovation same old design same old
price I do agree on the same old design
and same old price not necessarily lack
of innovation particularly because every
other OEM is doing the same thing with
four such technology now Apple is
selling less phones because Android has
gotten a lot better and though Apple is
actually not selling less phones right
now the prediction is for next year but
I do agree that Android phones have
gotten extremely great this year drop in
iPhone sales next year I'll believe it
when I see it and I do agree Apple has
got some very interesting tactics into
telling us that they sell it to the
phone starting with the fact that they
never tell you exactly which phone sells
the most which is rather revealing
once the discussion was all about the
oneplus many we saw the rumors and I
asked you do you think there's a spot
for it particularly what the oneplus 2
when the oneplus X we had or 981
comments we start with four point six
inches too small for me five inches
please and yeah I'm not gonna bring
though that's what she said jokes but I
kind of agree I do feel the same about
the iPhone particularly four point seven
inches on a display and you know with
the way they can innovate with bezels I
don't think that that's probably too
small question is with the oneplus 2
many have the same specifications of the
oneplus 2 the oneplus X is already a
great budget phone and I do agree to and
you have a solid point there that's the
reason why I got featured because that's
the question if they're gonna give me a
one plus two with the same
specifications only on a smaller chassis
that can make a lot of sense I think
this can be a great idea
many people want the four point five
inch phone with tough specifications
that surprises me that no Android OEMs
are getting into that market Sony is
with the experienced c5 you know the
compact of the problem is that for some
reason Sony is not selling as well as it
should on Thursday we had a sceptical
question there were rumors that the
Snapdragon 820 might be exclusive to
Samsung for a period and I asked you if
you thought that was a smart idea we had
16 hundred and seven comments thanks a
lot guys we start with exclusive only
works if it's the best and yet it's the
case with certain products where the
products are just so good the marriage
of hardware and whatever just makes a
lot of sense I do get your point but in
the case of Android I don't think it
would make any sense at all I don't
understand why Samsung is even
considering the Snapdragon 820 the
Exynos 7420 blew me away
going back to Qualcomm will be a step
back and you know it is a good processor
but that doesn't mean that every
previous Samsung Galaxy with a
Snapdragon processor perform better than
the X and O's counterparts that we saw
there working with Samsung for it I
don't think they'll have a choice of
Samsung wants exclusivity Samson working
with Qualcomm for the chip and then
Google for TouchWiz on the S 7 series is
shaping up to be for the next phone of
2016 you know I don't think it's gonna
be an exclusive we heard previous rumors
that said that there is a variant of the
dragon 820 that is being built along
with Samsung and yeah you make a really
good point the fact that Samsung is
actually listening to others for their
future smartphone and makes a ton of
sense obviously these companies meaning
Qualcomm and Google are both interested
in Samsung's success so it makes all the
sense in the world
and then finally Friday the topic was
TouchWiz the rumors were that the galaxy
s7 is going to be mostly about improving
TouchWiz not really changing design and
I asked you well how can touch was be
any better than stock Android which is
probably the most beloved skin out there
we had 881 comments I'd rather have
TouchWiz than stock Android I like the
features that only Eames add to their
own skin of Android and you know in this
particular version of TouchWiz I will
agree with you I find it to be more
useful than stock Android chews is
already better than stock and how a
theme support it's actually more fluid
than stock lollipop and yeah again I
guess I'm not the only one that feels
this way just eliminate the carrier
updates and just update all at once make
carrier bloat illegal you're probably
not gonna be able to get rid of carrier
blows but yes I feel that this would be
a major selling point if Samsung would
figure out a way to have Android seven
dot o or sixth auto updates just a week
after the updates for each Nexus devices
that this would speak very highly of
Samsung I just don't think it's gonna
happen anytime soon that's it for the
parkin out daily recap thank you very
