have the can one device which is our
smaller kind of good for one-handed use
it fits really easily in your pocket and
the kin to has a little bit larger
screen it has higher resolution camera
so has an 8 megapixel camera on board as
well as the capability to shoot HD video
so you'll see it's a horizontal slider
so it reveals the full qwerty keyboard
and it's got an 8 mega mint Emory so
this home screen is what we call the
loop and this is where I can keep in
touch with all the people and all the
websites and RSS feeds that I'm
interested in so you'll see my friends
lenee and Heather are on here as well as
I'm a big music fan so you'll see MTV
buzz-worthy that I have I'm
I have their RSS feed in my loop so one
of the great things is that this loop is
automatically updated with the content
coming in from all of my social networks
and any RSS feed that I subscribe to and
say I see a piece of information coming
through here that I think my friends
will be excited about I can use I can
share it using the spot so the spot is
this dot down here and it really is the
new way to share I no longer have to
think about how I want to share thinking
something and open the right application
I just worry about what i want to share
and who I want to share it with and drag
it all down to the spot in one easy
location so i can drag this mtv
newsfeed and then I can go over to my
favorites so my favorites are all the
people that I've told can I contact the
most so while all of my contacts were
imported from my social networks when I
signed in I've actually told my phone
that you know I'm really good friends
with Sam and Justin and Cecelia and so I
want to make these people really easy to
contact I don't have to hunt through all
of my contacts anymore they're right
here and I can tap on them and quickly
call text or open their concepts
and if I open their homage
I can go through and see Sicilians
facebook page and it actually is all for
wall postings all of her status message
updates and everything that's going on
so I don't actually have to go to
Facebook at my browser it's all right
here and for myspace page as here as
well
so I think Cecelia is really going to be
interested in that MTV article that I
found so I'm going to take her and drag
her down to this spot and I'm going to
take my friend Justin who's really into
music and drag him into the spot
all of a sudden I have that RSS news
article that I found and I have the
people that I want to share it with and
then i can hit send
and send it to them via text message mms
or email
and I cannot go over here as well
we look on board the camera application
that comes with kin is really great so
we found that a lot of our customers are
using their their phone camera in low
light situations that they're going out
at night the club or someplace with low
light and they still want to get good
pictures so we've actually have a lumi
LED on the back of the phone and the kin
to as i said before has an 8 megapixel
camera and shoots HD video so i can go
through and take tons of photos and
they're all automatically backed up to
the studio so the studio is the cloud
for Ken and so I never have to worry
about deleting any photos off of my
because they're all in the studio for me
automatically backed up so even if I
lose my phone I'm not I don't lose all
of the content and I can view all of my
photos on the big screen studio so say I
want to post this photo that i just took
to my social network again I just
dragged it into the spot which is there
on the camera application to and I can
tap upload and I can upload it on one of
my social networks really quickly and
easily cool really quick walkthrough
yeah so let's go ahead let's go over to
the studio and check it out so again
these are my photos and videos and it
really you'll notice up here is we have
kind of a timeline of all my photos so
say you know my birthday was in February
and I want to go back and relive my
birthday party I can click back through
and time and look at gatech the messages
that happens in all the photos that I
took thin and really here we have you
can view your photos in large scale on
on your screen so you don't ever have to
tether your phone to get your photos off
they're automatically here when you log
into your stew
and if I want to know if I forgot where
I took that photo it was quite a crazy
night out I can actually track on the
map and find out via the GPS the geo
tagging I can find out where I took that
picture
and if I forget my phone at home one
night I can go back into my messages and
see who has been texting me or calling
me and what they text
so even if I lose my phone or leave it
at home one night i'm not completely
lost on all my approach and the feed
reader is here as well so i can see my
loop and all of the stories that were in
my loops i couldn't see it from the home
screen from my studio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
