taylor behind the camera still here at
CES still looking at the huawei ascend
mate you who went to sleep and we're
going to compare it to another big phone
the competitor the samsung galaxy note 3
let's take a look at the differences and
the similarities as you can see we have
two extremely large devices here but the
Hawaii s inmates U is somewhat taller
and it's also somewhat wider now in
terms of in hand feel because the guava
is tethered I couldn't tell which one is
heavy but if you clip them to the side
you can see immediately the differences
that we have the what Samsung used to
call the hyper glazing finish which is
slippery and you can see it collects
fingerprints and grease like a champ and
this is the white version of the phone I
haven't seen another version of the
phone yet maybe there will be a black
version and Samsung's using this faux
leather which I'm not a fan of but it's
not slippery and you cannot see the or
feel the grease or the fingerprints now
since we're at the back we're gonna
compare cameras to cameras we have a 13
megapixel camera here 13 on the guav hu
Sony sensor being used here flash and of
course the 4G LTE because this is a
Verizon version as you can see but in
terms of the who are they it supports
all US carriers and all the world wide
modes in terms of compatibility with GSM
CDMA and all the other ones now flipping
it to the side we have the huge 6.1 inch
screen on the Huawei device and the
Samsung has a 5.8 inch screen but we
have a higher resolution on the note 3
as it is running full HD with its Super
AMOLED screen but the huawei ascend
mates you is I just drew another
and who RVs inmates you has a 6.1 720p
screen which they call a HD as an
enhanced HD which is 720 by 1280 1.6
gigahertz processor a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 on the huawei device a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 on the note 3 of
course we have 2 gigs of ram on the pave
3 gigs of ram on the samsung you can see
the home button we have no buttons here
but the huawei device is employing the
on-screen buttons which is ok because
you don't have any buttons placed down
below but it will take up a little row
from from your screen now the biggest
difference between these two and the
Huawei device will go back but will
follow is that the Samsung has an S Pen
this is something which the Huawei
device does not have though they said
that it is relatively easy to use it
with one hand now I got big hands and
this is the 90 degree circle which I can
reach to I cannot hit the Help button
the help icon I cannot even hit that
icon there so it's gonna be difficult
for you to use this one handedly however
just as the Samsung the guava device
also has multi window applications at
the moment as we can tell that we can go
that there we have only four supported
as you can see we have a calendar
calculator a notes application and the
SMS application and it looks like this
Eliz on the Samsung you have a lot of
applications supported more are being
added and you just drag some along let's
see let's drag something which Taylor
will not get upset about
let's drag YouTube
and this is for those who know the way
you can
what else can I use Taylor let's try
music this is the way you can use it on
the note 3 and of course this is the way
you can have the floating device have
the floating window on the guava let's
see if we can add some more let's see a
notes application now you cannot have
more than one at the same time but this
is not final software as being told
there will be software updates and they
will also increase the battery life of
this device which is marketed to be as
high as two days on LTE operation so
before we talk too much this has been
anton theory behind the camera with a
very very quick brief look at the guava
s and may - compared to the samsung
galaxy note 3 thank you very much for
watching subscribe to pocket now lots
more coming from CES thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
