new unbreakable panel that we expect for
the Galaxy S 10 and even their foldable
phones if you thought the Galaxy Note 9
was bringing a big battery trust me
honor is about to cook something bigger
and if you want to smart display Lenovo
and Google have just brought us
something really cool I'm Jaime Rivera
and speaking of cool
it's Friday with car content for the
weekend on both our Spanish Channel in
English make sure you subscribe this is
pocket out daily brought to you by Nord
bpm let's begin the news with Google as
the new Lenovo smart display that's
pretty much powered by a new Google
operating system called Android things
has taken the headlines because well
it's actually really cool it's based on
Android even though we were expecting
fusia to take over this and according to
some recent videos that we've been
watching everything seems to work great
even better than some solutions that
we've seen from Amazon and other
companies this is actually interesting
as the price tags are better than things
like the home pod there are two variants
you can learn more in the description
and hopefully I don't have to say the ok
phrase because my Google home is right
here hopefully I get one soon now let's
talk about Facebook other very
interesting headlines have to do with
the company's quarter results which were
disappointing and ended up becoming a
disappointment to them back because the
company lost a hundred and twenty
billion dollars in valuation over a day
that was the result of the stock market
that was the response of the stock
market just to give you an idea one
hundred and twenty billion dollars is
pretty much what Nike and McDonald's are
worth that is a ton of money and it
obviously makes everybody worried over
what tech companies are gonna be value
going forward I wouldn't worry as
honestly companies like Netflix are up
90% companies like alphabet are up 50%
so that's not necessarily that we should
worry Facebook just needs to do a better
job about their privacy now let's talk
about the honor note 10 I know I got
confused on the last video over the name
we've been hearing some monstrous
specifications but what's been fumbling
has been the battery what is going to be
the size believe it or not according to
honor it's gonna be five thousand
milliamp hours
hey honor has been surprising us with
their hardware let's just see what we
get in the end because of I can't wait
to you know experiment what it's like
for 5,000 milliamp hours with the
efficiency of Karen processors now as
will the spotlight over the Samsung most
people don't really hear about the Dec
stock and it has a lot to do with the
fact that you need an extra dock that's
extremely expensive now we've got rumors
that we're not getting a dock it's just
gonna be a cable pretty much like what
we see in Huawei the question is if
we're gonna get this in the box or not
because the biggest problem with decks
is not just the fact that you don't
really need it it's you know the fact
you have to pay for it and then you have
to also buy a monitor keyboard and just
about everything else just doesn't make
sense might as well buy a laptop so
we'll see in the end we get and finally
the hot news today have to do with
Samsung and the probability of
unbreakable glass and it's next
flagships the company has just announced
an unbreakable panel that will have
plastic cladding instead of just having
glass we're hoping this is a blend by
the way because we've already seen
plastic displays on devices like the
Galaxy s8 active and the Moto you know
their Z lineup the problem is that the
you know the glass scratches it doesn't
really look well or aged well but we're
hearing that this also works with
foldable panels so we're expecting the
Galaxy S tend to bring this in addition
to the galaxy expert and today's
question let us know what you buy a
Galaxy S 10 of it brought the innovation
of an unbreakable display because in my
case I totally would again if it doesn't
scratch because break the panel on any
galaxy and it'll cost you 300 bucks in
the display 50 bucks in the back but
