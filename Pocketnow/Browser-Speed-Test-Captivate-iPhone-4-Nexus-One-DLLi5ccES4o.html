pocket now calm and this is a look at
the built-in applications on the samsung
captivate we're also going to do a web
browser speed test versus the captivate
the iphone 4 and the google nexus one
let's get to it okay so well unlock the
device and i already talked about the
home screen setup in the unlock screen
i'll put a leg up on the video in case
you missed that let's dive into some of
these applications now this application
tray is very very unique to android on
other android devices like the nexus one
you get a very long list of applications
but on the captivate what samsung has
done is put them in a grid form like so
and what's interesting is that every act
that you download gets its own colored
background but only in this screen so
you can see we have a green background a
teal background sort of a pinkish
background and if i take any of these
icons off of this screen they change
color so if i go to the gmail icon and I
drag this over to one of my home screens
you get the standard gmail icon it no
longer has that purple background so
it's just a really nice way Samsung has
spruced up the application tray and has
made it a bit more unique than what you
get on other devices there's a lot of
other cool things that you can do from
the application tray you can jump from
one part to the other you can also
customize this a lot so you can press
the menu button here and we can change
the type we can do a customizable grid
an alphabetical list or an alphabetical
grid so let's look at the alphabetical
list if you like it better arranged in
that long list you can do it like so or
more interestingly if we do two
customizable grid we can actually edit
the layout and we can change the dock
icons down here in a previous video I
mentioned that you can't change the dock
icons but that's obviously not the case
we can take out any of these icons and
put your favorite programs in the dock
so that when you go back to the home
screen you've got your own set of icons
always down there so very nice way to
customize furthermore let me put it back
to the way it was you can move around
the icons within these screens so let's
say I want to put calculator over here
kind of
the iphone the other ones move out of
the way we should be able to slide these
off to other screens and place them
there so you can really customize every
panel of application so maybe the first
panel as the acts you use the most the
second panel has apps you use sometimes
and so on and so forth so really nice
addition to to the android application
trade that help you customize things so
let's go through a couple of these
applications before we get into the web
browser test there's an application cure
here called all share this is for the
DLNA support which will allow you to
play multimedia on other supported DLNA
devices like TVs or web consoles things
like that let's go back in a lot of the
applications that come on here our AT&amp;amp;T
really bloatware so you get AT&amp;amp;T Maps
AT&amp;amp;T music stuff that you're probably
not going to use that much unfortunately
you cannot delete them from the device
we can jump into the gallery which is
just the standard Android gallery really
nothing has been done to spruce this up
and we can go into landscape this comes
right out of the nexus one so we can see
photos we can flip and it's got a good
level of multi touch sensitivity so we
can do that very smooth looks good we'll
talk more about photo and video quality
in the upcoming review on pocketnow.com
let's go back okay here we are back in
the application tray a lot of these
things I've downloaded it comes with an
instant messaging platform so that you
can go on aim or yahoo messenger it's
got a memo application which is nice to
have a trial of mobitv let's see what
else we have here it doesn't come with a
way to view Microsoft documents
microsoft office documents so you have
to download something like documents to
go which unfortunately is fifteen
dollars so just be aware of that if
you're getting this device and let's
jump into youtube real quick and see how
video quality is we are over Wi-Fi so
everything should be super smooth so i'm
just going to pick really anything here
and just so you can get a sense for how
smooth video playback is here on the
samsung captivate
clean the screen a little bit there we
go so in this case the Super AMOLED
screen is really shiny I mean look how
dark the black is compared to the other
colors this just looks awesome very very
good video and photo quality on the
captivate so I'll stop that video okay
so what we're going to do now is get set
up for the web browser test so let me
get that ready to go okay so here we go
all three devices let's try to go to
pocket now calm and see which phone here
gets there fast we're on the same Wi-Fi
network let's do it okay they're typed
in and let's try to get this at the same
time is never an easy thing to do and
they're off perfect all going to pocket
now calm let's see which gets there
first this is thrilling it looks like
the nexus one up no the captivate finish
first looks like the nexus one finished
second and the iphone 4 is still
struggling to load the page there oh the
nexus ones up okay so let's say
captivate first nexus one second and the
iphone 4 3rd so we're of course running
on froyo here so this is supposed to be
the fastest browser on the planet
according to google let's double tap to
zoom in here and you can also get a
sense for how smoothly they zoom in the
iphone has the smoothest zooming it
looks like we're going to try to open up
this link at the exact same time on all
three devices let's try it I think I got
it good here it comes
okay so the next is one finished first
it's living up to its claim as the
fastest browser captivates second and
then the iphone 4 keeps coming in last
let's take a look at scrolling see how
they go down the page captivate just
went to sleep wake up there we go so
Nexus One scrolling okay captivate
scrolling seems a little bit smoother
iphone 4 probably the most smooth let's
check screen rotation speed on this
particular page before we do another
speed test okay captivate was faster
there captivate was faster there let's
compare the captivate and the iphone 4
screen rotation captivate one so it
looks like the captivate is definitely
rotating screen a lot faster than these
other devices let's jump to another
website this time we're going to go to
engadget on all three of these phones
and see which gets there first okay
something to try to press these go
buttons at the same time go and they're
off and gadget
captivate one followed by probably the
nexus one the nexus one and the iphone 4
is again in last place let's do a flick
scroll here because these are very long
web pages so we'll go all the way down
or most of the way down you can get a
sense for how smooth the scrolling is
the iphone will have the smoothest
scrolling although it's not loading the
the pages that fast so let's go to this
particular page let me bring up the
headline and we'll drill into that see
which goes faster and then we'll
conclude the browser test here for this
round all right and they're loading and
nexus one first followed by the
captivate followed by the iphone 4 so it
looks like overall the captivate in the
Nexus One are beating the iphone for
every time although it's really back and
forth between these two devices
definitely very very fast and capable
devices here we've got the froyo web
browser supported by the Snapdragon
processor and the android 2.1 browser
supported by the hummingbird but the
captivate that's the subject of this
video is definitely a very very capable
internet browsing machine it does a
great job with scrolling and panning and
definitely loading the pages so Samsung
did a great job at making the captivate
into a really fantastic web browsing
machine and something else that's pretty
unique is that up here in the address
bar if a site has RSS and you tap on it
it will actually open up the RSS
application pretty unique something that
really only desktop browsers do but
Samsung is bringing it to the mobile
phone so that was a look at the software
on the samsung captivate we've got some
good offerings I really like how the
programs are arranged in this nice grid
with a common color background and it's
also great to see that the captivate can
handle the web is so capably be sure to
check pocketnow.com for the full review
and give the video a thumbs up if you
liked it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
