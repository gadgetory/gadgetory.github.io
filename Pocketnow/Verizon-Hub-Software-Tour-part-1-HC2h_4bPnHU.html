to go over some of the applications that
come with the verizon hub last time we
left off on the home menu which presents
the time whether messaging center and
call features let's go to the menu and
this is where the applications come up
you've got essentially your
communications application which is your
phone contacts messaging directories
movies chaperone which is a service that
allows you to I know the location of
your family's phones great keep tabs on
kids be cast which is the verizons of
video service verizon relay which is a
way to display threads of text messages
that you associate with members of your
family or other friends that have
verizon phones go to page two we've got
the calendar a calculator I can check on
traffic you've got your settings a
widget bizarre and basically that's
their little application store where you
can actually download small applications
that run on the verizon phone feedback
internet radio you can listen to the
internet radio the recipes is one of
those widgets that I was talking about
it's allows you to view some recipes
online and then photo viewer is another
application that i downloaded which
turns the verizon hub into a photo
viewer so let's go back to the first
page and let's try a couple of these
applications out one real interesting
application is the move
the application so let's say you want to
go to a movie theater and find out
what's playing at that theater you would
press on theater and let's say we picked
this regal ballston we can look at
showtimes and it basically tells you
what movies are playing at that theater
and let's say we wanted to we're
interested in going to knowing we press
on knowing and it gives us the Showtime
more interested in a trailer from that
movie click on trailer and the trailer
for that movie appears which is a really
pretty cool
I want each of you to draw me a picture
of what you think the future is going to
look like so the quality of the image is
actually pretty good obviously it could
always be better but it's not natural
and as you can see the video quality in
terms of the motion is excellent so
there's no stuttering whatsoever I am on
verizon fios so I wouldn't expect that
most other offices you decide to stop it
you can go back you decide this is the
movie theater you want to go to you can
actually let's say we want to go to the
four o'clock showing and it's checking
the availability of tickets and the
ticket sales is actually handled through
fandango so that's a very nice feature
then let's say you don't know where this
theater is you can view the map it shows
you where the theater is and one of the
great features that verizon has and it's
a service feature is this verizon
navigator i can actually send verizon
navigator to my cell phone let's say
we'll just put in movie here click enter
and send the message and then once that
message is successfully sent it will
actually come out on my Anya and you
just heard ionia saying that there was a
message received here it is and I can
actually view it and it's downloading
the message and it says here we go real
ballston common and I can
actually map it where it shows me where
that location is and I can route to it
so that's a really cool feature where
you actually don't have to fumble with
your mobile device to enter addresses it
send it directly from the hub and you
can say I could do this all with my
windows mobile device and that's true
but usually when picking a movie you
know you need several individuals to
make a selection it's nice to have the
hub with larger screen than your mobile
device so let's go back to the menu and
another nice feature is the V CAST
feature and the V CAST feature allows
you to view different categories of
videos so 4 into sports right here and
ESPN and fox sports are the providers so
pick off so let's say we want to see
this video or SC tops plays three to
twenty eight then we can actually go
fullscreen and the quality you can see
with action images there is some
pixelation that occurs but that's I
think the problem with the pcat system
is not high quality video so we're going
to go back another nice feature is the
iheart radio system and
you can have by location alphabetical so
I've got a favorite which is at WK x q
in New York and you can play that and
the quality of that is pretty good we're
listening to Pink Floyd here so it's a
nice radio to have on your desk
and the radio keep playing until you
stop it so if we want to stop it we can
actually
here
stop it right here so then we'll go back
to menu one last thing I wanted to show
today was the ability to have a radio
widget on the home screen so you can
actually go into settings in home screen
settings and down here display radio
widget click OK now when you go to the
home screen you can actually move this
around and there's the radio so you can
actually access the radio directly from
the home screen raft so that's a nice
feature so you can see that the verizon
hub has quite a bit functionality and it
has quite a bit of potential as well it
would have been quite interesting had
verizon chosen the windows mobile
platform i think they would have gotten
a lot more out of the box but that said
I think there's a lot of promise to the
verizon hub and there's even talk of
adding a browser which seems to be a big
request from the current users out there
I'll be back to take a look at some
other features of the verizon hubs such
as messaging and the photo display
features on my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
