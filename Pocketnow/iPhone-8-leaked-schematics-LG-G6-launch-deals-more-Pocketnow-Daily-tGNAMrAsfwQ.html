see some significant changes and some
non significant ones Samsung has already
begun to forecast an insanely great
quarter in sales and you can already
find some significant deals for the LG G
six today I'm hanging out Iveta
and aside from the dark side of the
Deathstar which I love this t-shirt
let's get over the new so that we can
all party this Friday this is
out daily the official loose today begin
with deals of a brand new phone the LG G
six pretty much just reached the market
now and Sprint has already begun
offering the phone 50% off now the
company is trying to be aggressive it's
just changed it's unlimited plans and
obviously it wants a little more
mindshare and makes a lot of sense and
the g6 is a phone that we would highly
recommend so if you're on Sprint you
might as well now how about if we talk
about more creepy changes Facebook
earlier announced a couple of months ago
that it would bring a eye to its
messenger and apparently it's gonna
start rolling out now and one of the
things that makes me the most skeptical
is obviously Facebook is extremely bad
about advertisement they really feel
that they need to sell you stuff so much
so that I cannot wait to see how much of
a dumpster this is gonna be but this is
just me being biased maybe some of you
like it probably two or three of you
that don't work in Facebook you know one
of the reasons why I criticize the
announcement of Android oh so early in
the game is mainly when you see Android
market share believe it or not listen to
these numbers thirty one percent is
marshmallow 23% is lollipop and guess
how much it's for nougat four I didn't
forget numbers oh well if you want the
decimals 4.3 that is the market share of
nougat it is terrible it is really bad
and oh it's just gonna make it more
complicated I mean Google why don't just
stick to nougat for a bit or make
Android oh just I don't know mandatory
it's just it's such a nightmare
well the spotlight over to Samsung as
the company has already predicted how
its sales are going to be for
1 2017 I'm not going to bore you with
the numbers you can see them in the link
of the description but the most
interesting point is that the company
claims that it'll break all records when
it comes to sales and you know it makes
sense if the Galaxy s8 is included and
obviously they add whatever money
they've made already in pre-orders this
means that the phone has really sold
like crazy I doubt that it will but
anyways this just proves that Samsung is
having a lot of faith in its s8 or
whatever strategies is done even after
the note 7 so hey we'll see and finally
the very interesting news that they have
to do with some leaked schematics of the
iPhone 8 that emerged in Weibo and that
we're later told luckily we were able to
get them and what we see here is a
couple of things number one instead of
horizontal dual cameras at the back we
have vertical ones which we saw in a
previous leak in addition to that we
also noticed that there is literally
almost no camera hump which is awesome
even better at the front we see a lot of
camera holes in this design that's all
great and everything but notice what's
not changed much is actually the chassis
it seems that the iPhone 8 would look
pretty much like the current iPhone 7
plus only with a couple of things moved
around which is terrible in my opinion
but it leads me to the question of the
day do you like these schematics do you
feel that Apple can play along with this
design in another year in my case I
don't but leave us a comment down below
