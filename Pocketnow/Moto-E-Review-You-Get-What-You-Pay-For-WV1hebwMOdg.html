advisors and other dispensers of wisdom
far and wide you get what you pay for
that's not necessarily a condemnation
Motorola's new super chief Moto e is
certainly an accomplishment on the price
tag alone the question is did this
affordable smartphone sacrifice too much
of the smartphone in the name of being
affordable let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now's
video review of the motorola moto e
motorola says it built the Moto e
because using a smartphone should be a
right not a privilege
and of course affordability is a huge
part of that the company already has
some experience in this area thanks to
the Moto G which we compared with the
Moto e in a video last week check it out
here on our channel page to stay within
its price boundaries the Moto e makes a
lot of sacrifices and specs from the
dual-core Snapdragon 200 processor to
the 4.3 inch quarter HD display with
mediocre viewing angles to the paltry 4
gigs of built-in storage only half of
which is accessible out of the box and
those skeletal features are bundled up
in a thick somewhat homely package whose
loan concessions to style are asymmetric
chrome strips hiding the speakers and
changeable back covers which cost more
money but Motorola is not after
fashionistas here with the Moto e it
promises a smartphone made to last and
to that end the device is somewhat
ruggedized with Gorilla Glass 3 and
water resistance functionally it's held
up well to fairly careless use over our
7 days of testing but the back cover
isn't hard to scuff up still the e feels
like a phone you can take almost
anywhere without worrying about breaking
it which is nice a microSD slot does its
part in making up for the on-board
storage shortage a hefty gig of ram
backs up the processor dual SIM
capability and a digital TV tuner are
available in some markets and topping it
all off Android 4.4.2 is here with
guaranteed timely updates from Motorola
but for all its distensible optimization
for low spec devices even KitKat shows
signs of sluggishness honest
dragon 200 the Moto e isn't unusable by
any means but it is slow even at medium
typing speed keystrokes lag behind
switching between apps and multitasking
mode takes a few extra beats and app
crashes are much more common than on
higher-end devices this is not a phone
you can trust to manage itself apps need
to be aggressively policed and you
should plan to restart it on a regular
basis just to keep it happy also you
might as well factor in the cost of a
microSD card if you're considering a
moto e a big part of the smartphone
experience is downloading apps and
you'll power through the available
onboard storage in no time without a
memory card there to soak up your media
speaking of media the Moto E's camera is
everything you'd expect from a five
megapixel fixed-focus shooter it's the
only camera on the phone and in bright
sunlight with a good angle and a little
bit of patience or just a bunch of burst
shots you can capture some good-looking
photos as with most cameras these days
even Motorola's temperamental HDR mode
offers a boost from time to time but
turn the lights down and well it becomes
pretty clear very quickly that this
isn't a phone for night owls especially
considering the lack of a flash also the
absence of variable focus means close-up
shots are basically off the table and
the viewfinder itself is slow to launch
slow to save slow all around and so is
the frame rate when shooting FW VGA
video in short the camera here is nice
to have if conditions are right but
overall it's little more than an
afterthought
Motorola's focus has instead been on the
fundamentals and that shines is
specially brightly in terms of reception
the phone calls and endurance the Moto e
doesn't sport anything fancy in the
radio suite but it holds on to a signal
just as well as you'd expect from a
Motorola especially when it comes to the
FM radio as the company's website says
there's free music in the air and the
Moto e does a great job of snapping it
up with a minimum of static also sauce
for the goose when it comes to Motorola
call quality is excellent on both hands
that's also true on speakerphone mode
with the single front firing loudspeaker
making everything from a two-way
conversation to a quick YouTube video
much more enjoyable than on other budget
smartphones $9.00 direct from Motorola
the question becomes how much are you
willing to give up for 50 bucks and if
you get too caught up in watching or
listening and suddenly find yourself
under attack or otherwise endanger
motorola alert has a few helpful tools
we're not sure how well the alarm will
do at attracting attention honestly it's
not as loud as we expected but the tools
that enable trusted contacts to track
you or to meet you at specific locations
could be quite useful especially for
parents or really anyone who needs
something simple and effective for peace
of mind
finally there's battery life with a
non-removable 1980 milliamp hour power
pack we were slightly concerned
especially when our day of heavy use
shut us down after only eight hours with
less than four hours of screen on time
but that was a stress test of aggressive
media streaming using the Moto e more
like a flagship than a budget phone with
more moderate usage the phone delivered
closer to five hours of screen on time
an impressive stat for such a small
battery and that's without using power
saving mode which could extend endurance
even further between the software
stumbles the storage shortage and the
camera you might think the Moto e a
pretty wimpy contender we're not
confident that it'll age well updates
aside smartphones usually slow down over
time and when a phone is this sluggish
out of the box it doesn't bode well for
its future
in the US or just $50 separate the two
we still think the Moto G is a much
better buy but in some of the markets
Motorola is targeting with the Moto e
the price golf is far wider and in those
markets the Moto e brings you durability
excellent call quality and a modern if
not perfect smartphone experience in
terms of getting what you pay for it is
a very good value
just remember to factor in the cost of
the microSD card and remember when it
gives you trouble how much you didn't
spend on it for more on the Moto e see
