should be looking forward to as much as
we have it's been heavily teased over
the last few days and let's just say
that the end product lives up to all the
hype reporting from New York City I'm
hey Matt I'm with pocket down when let's
go hands-on if last year we had tech
Tober I wonder if we could call this
phone brewery or phone ooh airy as the
closeness to MWC means lots and lots of
phones to see and we begin with one of
the most interesting ones
I don't know how xiaomi does it they
launched awesome phones and they price
them aggressively visually the mean line
is simply gorgeous we have what they
call a full curved glass made of Gorilla
Glass five in the back with an
interesting holographic spectrum that
shifts color depending on the variant
you choose an angle you look at it
sadly the lighting in this venue didn't
really help me portray that but we'll
have a full review soon to share more
like in the case of the meat aid there's
also a transparent addition that's quite
stunning obviously I can't confirm if
what you see here are true internals
being shown but what I do know is that
the back is a co marketing strategy with
a movie Elita with the codename shown in
the back the front is of Gorilla Glass 6
and there's a six point three nine inch
full HD plus AMOLED display at nineteen
point five by nine aspect ratio it's a
good display though not the brightest at
four hundred thirty minutes there's a
teardrop notch at the top that houses
the 20 megapixel camera it enables a I
portrait selfie scene detection and also
face to unlock and there's also an
optical fingerprint scanner embedded on
the display which shortcuts if you use
gestures while unlocking the phone there
are three important characteristics to
this device the first being its
internals this is one of the world's
first devices to be powered by the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 it's matched
with six ego bytes of RAM and storage
options that are either 64 128 gigabytes
we have a 3300 milliamp hour battery and
a fast 18 watt charger supplied in the
box so the phone is capable of up to 27
watts in a technology xiaomi dubs
charge turbo that note segues into the
second crack tourists
this device the support she wireless
charging but at its fastest she usually
tops at 15 watts which is still kind of
slow show-me has a new proprietary
charging technology on this phone that
could go up to 20 watts and charge the
phone in an hour and four minutes best
of all the special charger only cost $30
and can charge any other Qi device with
a typical 10 watts ShowMe is also about
accessories as well they showed us a she
wireless charging power bank and also
the coolest car mount I've ever seen
the next one you want to attach the
phone and opens the grips and then
loosens them when you want to remove the
phone all while charging the phone
through she the third characteristic are
the three cameras the camera in the
middle is a Sony IMX five eight six
forty eight megapixel camera at F 1.75
aperture that uses pixel bidding to
create a larger 1.6 microns at 12
megapixels at the top we have a 16
megapixel ultra wide camera at F 2.2 and
117 degrees a field of view below we
have a 12 megapixel telephoto at F 2.2
there's AI portrait scene detection
wide-angle distortion Corrections 30
night photography and more powering the
show is me UI which is not my favorite
but at least is powered by Android 9 Pi
with lots of services mainly geared
towards the Asian market sadly it's too
early to provide a full opinion over or
if it's useful or not overall the Xiaomi
me 9 is a very beautiful phone it's
powerful and offers unique features that
we can't really wait to try out in our
review period this is Xiao Meis first
time launching a product both in China
and globally at the same time so there's
lots look forward to also keep in mind
5g related announcements will happen
during their event at MWC which we will
be covering as well let us know what you
think about the Xiaomi mean 9 in the
comments down below and while you're at
