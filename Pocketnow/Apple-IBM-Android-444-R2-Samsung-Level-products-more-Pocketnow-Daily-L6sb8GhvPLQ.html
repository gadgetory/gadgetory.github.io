iOS software in the enterprise Samsung
audio products are now available in the
US at prices you won't want to pay and a
phone unlocking bill passes in the US
Senate in order to end all the drama I'm
hi Mary vet I and I'm trying to talk
myself into remembering that today is
Wednesday and bars are open today as
well this is forking out daily you know
it doesn't matter what Steve Jobs movie
watcher what book you read from the guy
you'll notice that he hated IBM that was
the eternal battle for 30 years and as
it turns out Steve Jobs is no more and
in the official news today at what IBM
just struck a deal in order to bring a
new service called IBM mobilefirst and
the idea is to bring better enterprise
applications to mobile for both the iPad
and the iphone as obviously there are
some mac products already it's really
interesting to see this partnership
after so much drama for years hopefully
this will bring us something better
aside from enterprise solutions and
other official news let's talk about the
google nexus 5 as a the company has just
launched Android for dot for dot for
release to to this device and certain
specific markets linksys referral
details on which ones apparently there
are a lot of bug fixes including some
signal improvements in turn countries
and apparently it's a specific to the
Nexus 5 for reasons that we don't know
stay tuned we'll keep you posted to see
if other Nexus devices will require this
release 2 now if you thought that the LG
g3 Vista on verizon had us confused
trust me the LG g3 mini is even worse as
we've got three names for the same phone
apparently some are dubbing at the LG g3
beat the LG g3 many of them the LG g3 s
we've got some leaked manuals for a
phone with three names and then we also
have leaked images of the phone with
three days we don't know if LG's
planning to launch the same phone on
three different markets with three
different names it's happened in the
past with Samsung products being carrier
based in its name so hopefully that's
just that though the g3 mini will
probably not be a big phone and
specifications at least for those of you
that actually care about smart phone
unlocking and
yeah I know it includes every one of us
it turns out that there is a bill that
just passed the Senate and it should
turn into a law probably by next year
making smart phone unlocking something
that is consumer oriented meaning you
have a right to choose if you want to
unlock the phone that you just bought it
just makes all the sense in the world
for you to be able to do with your
product whatever you want to not have
carriers dictate that as it was deemed
illegal a couple of months ago almost a
year already so obviously it will take
some time for this bill to become a full
legal thing but yeah you should stop
worrying about it being able to unlock
your smartphone though again it will
take some time and finally for the
overpriced news of the day Samsung has
just launched its audio products in the
United States it's starting with gift
calm as of tomorrow then you can get
them on amazon by July twentieth and
then on best buy by July 27 and these
are you know full headphones in ear
headphones and wired and wireless
headphones and then speaker and the
reason why these are the overpriced news
of the day is because when you look at
the price tags the wireless headphones
are retailing for 350 bucks and then the
cheapest wired headphones in the crowd
cost a hundred and eighty dollars and
yeah we know that Apple just bought
beats which is another overpriced thing
but that leads you to the question of
the day how much are you willing to pay
for good pair of headphones I mean if
you know that these are really good
headphones how much money would you pay
for them because in my particular case
the most i have ever paid and will ever
pay for headphones is one hundred fifty
dollars and the only reason why I did it
because those bose headphones are the
only ones that I've ever lasted a year
with the amount of sweat that I produce
when I run so there was a reason why I
wanted to buy these and white made sense
but leave us a comment down below how
much are you willing to pay 180 dollars
is just crazy on my book tell me about
yours friends es you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video is Phil machine follow us on
packing out comment subscribe changeup
channel as well you'd also follow me on
Twitter hi my underscore any better
