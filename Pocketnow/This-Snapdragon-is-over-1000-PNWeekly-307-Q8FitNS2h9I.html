all right and we are live okay
pocket now weekly the note 9 might be
delayed because Samsung thinks you need
a thinner phone Google is going straight
to Foxconn for manufacturing the next
pixel LG and Motorola phones are headed
to project Phi and Qualcomm is betting
big on chipsets for tablets and PCs
we've got a lot to talk about so make
sure you're charged and ready for
episode 3:07 of the pocket now weekly
record a June 1st at 10:00 a.m. 10:00
a.m. Pacific this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid I'm Juan Carlos bag now
contributing editor pocketnow.com joined
as always by plucky podcast producer mr.
jules wang on location again because i
think you're you're probably apt soon to
be getting some some fun info on a
future handset that we can't quite talk
about just yet yeah I'll be helping out
with that operation Jaime Rivera just
outside the door over here are we work
location for now and then we'll be
moving very very fast to I get things
done it's been a long day
well it's been a long weekend a long day
for a long week and you know what we're
busy and I prefer that to the
alternative of having nothing to do
joining us this week to also talk about
all of the tech shenanigans in the news
we are again joined by mr. Nick gray
thank you for joining us on the show
this week my pleasure as always and
you're still in the midst of your of
your travel experiment so where might
you be hailing from from this week this
week I'm hailing from just south of
Boston about an hour south and probably
get close to two weeks now here we we
head back to the road
Monday and next week we cross into
Canada which is exciting we're gonna be
in Toronto for a little bit I definitely
want to pick your brain about the state
of the experiment for you so far you
know traveling with your family like
this especially for our mission
statement of pocket now you know
mobility technology you and your family
have been relying on some of this stuff
so especially after we're through the
news I'd love for you to share some of
your thoughts on what's been working for
you and what hasn't been but before we
kick that off Jules we do have a lot of
headlines to get through if someone were
we're interested or curious about
joining this conversation with us how
might they be involved in communicating
during the live broadcast or maybe
afterwards listening to the audio
version
oh no oh wait I do now and that's
through Twitter you want to take
whatever comments or question or
thoughts that you have and then add the
hashtag P and legally so that we see it
and that were able to respond to it as
this show goes on today at well it's not
10:00 a.m. Pacific I don't you know what
time it is anymore but hey I mean that's
a that's it's amazing the live streaming
possibilities hashtag P and weekly on
Twitter if you want to get us on the
emails too because we still do emails
and you can do that through podcast at
pocketnow.com alright we will be
monitoring that that Twitter feed I have
the live chat up from the youtubes but
yeah I think we need to jump into some
headlines Jules what are talk us through
these are the top stories that were
posted this week to pocketnow.com and
we've got some some media stories to dig
into yeah so let's start off with just
the first one and go from there the
snapdragon 1000 is apparently what's on
cue for now and i'm not sure if i'm able
to reach the story here on our rundown
but in any case win future reports that
there is a snapdragon 850 as kind of the
iteration sort of the upgrade to the 845
and this is all this is for Windows 10
on arm
giving more performance adjusting their
thermal throttling as well as being able
to the the behaviors as well because
it's just a different form factor to
file so that's what the 850 will be to
the 8:45 and supposedly we see new
products or iterations of products
existing coming out over the course of
the summer now if we scroll down and see
what happens maybe fall maybe in the
holiday season well we're talking about
Snapdragon 1000 we've seen a couple of
job listings pertaining to that number
and one feature also tells us that we
might be able to see a thermal design
power basically the output that it would
produce somewhere close to 6.5 Watts now
for comparison these convertibles these
existing intel core y series I think
dual core good for tablets they're at
seven point five watts at this point and
they're on and better not you know
mobile architecture so this is going to
be something that's worth watching out
for over the next couple of well seasons
well and especially what with the issues
Intel's been having with their die
shrinks getting beyond the 40 nanometer
and 12 nanometer process
welcome does seem to be a little
electricity popping have no idea where
that's coming from
that's okay but but Nick I mean have you
been keeping mobility experiment like do
you think that they can make a dent in a
in a chipset race between AMD and Intel
honestly I think I do I mean we've been
looking at Intel kind of stagnating with
the PC and laptop chip market for years
I mean they've kind of gotten into their
rhythm there really hasn't been
a lot of competition there and if all
calm can step in with something that's a
little bit different that's gonna change
the game I mean with their chips they're
promising you know unlimited
connectivity all-day battery life has in
20 hours with some of their chips and
you know somewhat B for your batteries
in there I think they can change things
up a little bit especially if Microsoft
is looking to you know have their future
devices be connected all the time if if
if Qualcomm can land a version of a
surface device running a Qualcomm chip
that's kind of like a slam-dunk and
we'll see more more laptop manufacturers
fall in line with that going forward
yeah earlier this week we were talking
about arm they had a whole bunch of new
designs an arm is the core designer for
the reference design people who I guess
they're owned by Softbank but it's what
Qualcomm mediatek all those ships that
manufacturers use and in terms of
intellectual property to do their thing
and that customer has been well so they
announced a new the cortex 876 CPUs as
well as new VPM GPUs for gaming and for
passive video experiences and it seems
like they're getting into the 8k space
not sure if yeah no seriously 8k 60
frames per second that was their kind of
a push for that when I was at their
briefing so yeah it's basically up to
Microsoft to see if these advanced ones
get into the future question we're
seeing arm we're seeing Qualcomm we're
seeing companies starting to push into
this territory of more mainstream
traditional computing on arm chipsets
but does this maybe hinge a little too
much on Windows you know Windows hasn't
necessarily shown us the the best follow
through Microsoft hasn't shown us the
best follow through
mobility products they're great for
tablets and all-in-one multimode pcs but
you know they sort of biffed it on more
tablet II tablets and phones should we
be nervous about this kind of push with
Windows 10 I don't think so I mean if
you look at computers and where they've
gone and you know if look back five to
ten years and to see what Microsoft
wanted to do with laptops and tablets
and where we are now I mean honestly the
only tablets that are really worth
buying our Apple tablets and their sales
are tanking every year they're shrinking
and shrinking it's not a growing market
it's kind of like hey this was a cool
idea they're not really that practical
if I want to get work done I would never
consider getting a tablet to get work
done so a laptop is a laptop and it's
going to be there for a long time and
you know it's they're not growing their
market share any but that doesn't mean
there's not a lot of money to be made I
mean you know you call it Rosa Rosa Rose
but I mean attachable keyboard style I
all these other features that kind of
spice up the laptop experience I think
does create so I'm sort of a you know
more of a case for laptops these days
especially as when we've seen the
militarization of laptops from like this
huge clamshell or like suitcase sizes at
Downton
like imaginable things where I don't
know maybe this is the next evolution
that people think I'm also really
curious again I mean this is just like
outright speculation for maybe a another
conversation if if qualcomm is pushing a
snapdragon 1000 would that maybe
encourage google to start moving forward
with plans for their next generation
operating system you know whatever we
might find that could potentially bridge
Chrome OS and Android better support for
apps but a more desktop like browsing
experience that would definitely be
something I would hope to see moving
forward if companies like Google and
Apple have the hardware to utilize
more powerful well daring arms briefing
it mate they made it sound like
Microsoft was seeing positive signs they
weren't giving specific numbers but
there was the sense that they were on
the right track so again lots of grow
lots to see over again the next few
months so yeah we are getting some
requests in the live chat to start
talking about the note so we probably
one of the bigger stories we had this
week yeah that's that's true that's true
although I mean I couldn't resist the
number okay I wanted to get to over a
thousand but let's talk about the doubts
nine apparently it's going to be delayed
two weeks from it's rumored late July
release so that the well basically it
all comes down to the vice president of
Samsung having recently taken a trip to
China for some research and found that
from from Oppo from Germany from Huawei
they're all thinner than what was
supposed to be something like my meters
or something like that and he decided
after seeing the phones that were on
display that's perhaps he should go back
to the drawing board for a second and
make the phones half a millimeter
thinner this is all you know going we're
talking about a freaking glass
industrial design so that's already bad
enough news when it's thick I mean it's
just it's brittle glass but there I mean
you know you at one point do you start
cutting into you know muscle instead of
fat and also are you really going to be
able to enhance the experience just by
you know how are you fit just a tiny
little butter into the pocket I mean we
have heard on and off that there's gonna
be in display fingerprint sensing
technology
I mean it's gonna be more definite for
the s10
that's coming out next year but it's
again it's been on and off and I don't
think we'll be able to see that on the
note 9 at least so it's just you know
we're coming down the homestretch here
well Nick I mean I I don't know about
you but I constantly hear from
power-user know fans that what they
really want out of the device is a
diminishing profile make it super thin
and sleek less durable probably less
room for a bigger battery in there you
know less runtime for their super
hardcore note productivity focus device
I hear that all the time that's that
really seems to me like what no fans are
after is a is a more brittle less
functional version of their favorite
phone yes and no I mean my mother's
being completely diseases why why would
you want a note that goes more for style
and you know pocket ability when the
whole concept of the note is the biggest
baddest phone out there with the best
battery life I mean last year we saw a
significant drop in battery life because
of the whole battery fiasco from the
previous year
and that kind of diminished the whole
value proposition of the note I mean
it's still one of the best-selling
devices for Android out there but it's
not as superior to the competition as
what it used to be especially with the
s9 plus being practically the same size
as the note and also having the dual
camera on the back I mean there's no
real reason as of right now unless you
really really need that stylus there's
no reason to buy a note anymore I don't
think and I'm I'm just curious you know
have they made their own large device
obsolete with the s9 plus I mean after
using some phones to like getting a four
thousand milliamp hour battery in a mate
that's been really nice I like coming
back to the mate and I I don't know that
I feel like that fraction of a
millimeter of girth has impacted my
ability to put the phone in my pocket
especially all of these well and
especially when all of these devices
we've linked to the Galaxy S nine in our
coverage on the note we linked to the
Galaxy S 9 d'oeuvre
test from one of those insurance
companies I forgot who I can't click on
the web browser or I'll work my hangouts
connection but but when you have to
factor in like we made the device a half
a millimeter thinner so that you have to
add an extra half a millimeter of
protection to a bumper case it to me
makes this feel even less complete out
of the box and I'd much rather you make
that extra space and give me an extra
battery for it we keep complaining about
this in the tech enthusiast space but it
seems like this is yet another one of
those decisions that's gonna be taken
out of our hands like I'm not gonna have
the ability to really vote with my
wallet here yeah and it really doesn't
make sense for people to be looking at
you know phones with styluses that cost
so much when in fact well maybe
LG might have something down line we'll
talk about that in just a few moments
with whatever that thing is the stylus
but use seven stylus in the mean time
we'll transition over for now to show me
with a trio of new devices this week of
course Nokia had its updates to its new
Q 2 3 &amp;amp; 5 but here we're talking about
something a little stronger we're
talking about the me 8 and that comes in
three flavors the the eights just
generally v8s II which is the kind of
lighter version and then there's the me
eight Explorer edition and that's
there's some sort of this traffic ation
going on here so the me eights and the
v8 Explorer have the infrared face of
lock technology that's of course who
else would you think would copy apple's
implementation well i mean it only has
infrared they don't have a
the grid the shoot of the light grid
that Apple has in terms of sensors for
that true def camera but that's one of
the big amazing features that they've
been able to bring out and also in
addition to that on the Explorer edition
we have that in display fingerprint
sensor that's been some of a very hot
conversation and for the me 8se
there is a the fact that it is debuting
with the snapdragon 710 a new class of
qualcomm silicon for them and well it's
yet to be tested at public but it's
certainly getting closer and closer to
that line where it just blurs between
mid-range and premium flagship tier
specifications so definitely a lot to be
looking forward to from the china
especially as as shabby grows aims to
grab with that IPL coming out and it's
just for them this is gonna be one of
the more important pushes the first
pushes towards that's brand recognition
yeah I think the company overall has
matured a lot in the last two to three
years and they're they're finally ready
for that global push and these devices
pretty much show that I don't know if
you guys saw the pictures of the one
with the clear back on it showing off
the internals I mean I was I was I
talked that like late last night
right before I went to bed and you know
I was just ready to roll over in bed and
saw that and I'm like oh my gosh I need
to read this right now and it looks
absolutely gorgeous I mean for me you
know I might be writing this up later
this week well it's late in the week
already but I might be writing this up I
mean there's there's so many smartphones
with glass backs and what's the point of
glass right the reason why it was
invented is to give us a clear surface
so that you can see what's on the other
side and HTC and
me it looks like they're the only ones
who actually caught on to that you know
we have a glass back let's actually show
the inside of these devices and you know
what makes them as good as they are yeah
it's still unclear if everything that
Xiaomi is showing is actual functioning
on the back I read a couple articles
saying that if they kind of engineered
it to look like it was cooler than it
actually is but you know props to them
for going you know above and beyond
rather than just slapping you know a
case on it and saying calling it a day
they did a little bit of extra work to
do that I'm excited to get my hands on
one yeah I'm really excited again it's
sort of another fun that's adding to
this conversation about what a premium
mid-range device should resemble so when
we're talking about a top-of-the-line me
eight somewhere around just under a $600
price point after accounting for
converting currencies like that that's a
that's a smart place to join to join a1
plus or an honor view that's that's a
it's an interesting price point to reach
for some of the specs that we're talking
about yeah indeed and well let's see if
those prices say stayed the same as we
head out of the country of course
international pricing will definitely be
key but I would not be surprised to see
an explorer edition at five ninety-nine
like I think that that makes a lot of
sense for where they're trying to
position themselves its bold I mean they
have that target of limiting that profit
margin well still being able to produce
a lot off of their services there's
relieves the question of whether shall
we use Internet services and ads will be
able to translate outside of China so
there is you know that that's a
waterfall that they'll have to climb up
a guess hmm all right moving right along
we should probably you know in Maine you
at the story about Google go into
Foxconn how do we this first of all how
do we feel about Foxconn these days are
we concerned about them as a main
facture have they been cleaning up their
image what where where are we with that
right now
China's China I mean if there are a
whole bunch of Lux regulations in terms
of email labor and every company that is
there will take advantage of it in one
way or another I don't blame the I don't
know see like labor issues as
necessarily a Foxconn issue even though
they you do have a responsibility
because you know the they're committing
those acts but when it comes to stemming
the problem it has to really come from
external forces the government so yeah
it's a definitely tough question but I
mean in terms of what they've done and
the substantive work for Apple and for
Nokia especially with the Nokia of HIV
global I think they've done a pretty
good job of their apples kind of because
it's more diverse they have all these uh
you know part sources because of you
know to save money I'm not sure how
Google is going to be approaching this
alone this is not HTC this is not LG
getting the designs and working with the
contract suppliers this is Google itself
we don't have much of a history and
seeing what Google does in the space so
so Nick I mean to that point you know we
we don't necessarily have a lot of
evidence for for Google fulfilling
manufacturing super great in the past
with few issues on the pixels do you
think that this will help iron out some
of those early teething pains for a
pixel three honestly I don't think it
will
moving the Foxconn doesn't solve those
issues I think the issues that we've
seen from Google and their pixel devices
in the past has been they have
underestimated the demand for their
devices and that's we've run into
bottlenecks there and then last year
with the display issue with LG
that was kind of something they weren't
completely expecting I had imagined
there was people who were extremely
pissed off at Google and LG you know
with that whole fiasco but honestly like
I was kind of surprised that they would
you know because they just purchased all
these engineer through these engineers
from HTC those engineers are still
technically working for Google inside
HCC's headquarters they simply moved
them to the other side of the building I
was expecting maybe a renewed
partnership with HTC to build the phones
I mean HTC has a ton of building
capacity that's just going to waste
because they're not selling that many
phones anymore I mean they have enough
capacity to produce about five million
phones per month and they're not doing
that they have you know just lines and
lines of manufacturing that are just sit
closed so the fact that they couldn't
work something out with HTC and move to
Foxconn instead shows that you know
maybe they weren't completely satisfied
with the build quality that they got
from the original pixel and the pixel -
I mean they weren't those devices
weren't perfect by any means but we know
HTC has a good track record there so I'm
wondering if there's something else
that's underlying maybe Foxconn just
gave them an amazing deal who knows yeah
I was gonna say like I think I think
definitely when we're talking about
manufacturing scale Foxconn could
probably throw some attractive numbers
around but I'm wondering if this means
that we're still gonna be seeing
diverting designs LG being responsible
for some of the design implementation of
the larger pixel HTC contributing more
to the design of the smaller pixel if
maybe just pointing the final end
products to Foxconn is a way to maybe
rein in some of the manufacturing
disparity between the two lines of
phones that will likely receive it could
be I mean we there was some design
disparity last year because of you know
the 18 by 9 aspect ratio display versus
the regular 16 by 9 but that being said
they didn't have to I mean they could
have shored up those differences pretty
easily but they chose not to
and I think it was one of the decisions
that was kind of last minute to go with
LG for the larger pixel to rather than
keeping it inside with HTC because if
they would have kept it with HTC I can
guarantee you that those devices
probably would have looked identical
and as they did the previous so I mean
it's it's one of those things you you
never know what the internal politics is
you don't know when these decisions are
being made
I mean HTC has given Google they're the
engineering team or design engineering
team what three months ago now but I
mean the at team would have been working
on these pixel three devices even before
that final you know purchase agreement
signed on the dotted line everything was
taken care of so I think the design of
these two phones has been worked out
months ago
moving to Foxconn I don't think it's
going to change that but going forward
we could see something different where
you know there might be less influence
from LG itself and less influence from
HTC itself and this new engineering team
that's under Google is going to take
full control of that and run with
something that Google actually wants
well Google if Google wants that then
that's fine I mean again we're seeing
the same kind of a step-up differences
between the three and three XL as we did
the two and two XL we're talking about
dual cameras on the front on the three
XL and just a whole bunch of other
features that are cracking up here so
yeah definitely something to look
forward to as we head into October let's
move into a month earlier let's go back
a month actually and talk about well
actually I don't know what timeline this
is no this is 2019 that we're talking
about so I my calendars all screwed up
anyways for thousands yeah that was two
hours of sleep so sorry let's talk about
triple cameras on the next of the 2019
iPhone because yeah that's something
that we want to see
more competition with Huawei I guess
with that p20 Pro triple cameras over
there also a new type of flight sensor
that basically it's a light sensor more
accurate in terms of AR in terms of
determining distance so there's the
advantage that's that sensor would be
able to give and yeah there's a whole
bunch of things that we could see to
enhance the augmented reality experience
from just Apple itself but again there's
a been kind of a slow roll going on here
air kits were expected to see
multiplayer aspects in turn into apps
and games so that's going to be coming
up in that would do DC apparently and
yeah they're trying to build that up but
well after the wait another year to see
if we'll be able to take full advantage
and see full like reasonable purposes
for augmented reality in our lives Apple
well I you know Apple was was a little
early to the conversation trying to try
to work with dual camera sensors and
then also with a our services have any
of those things move the needle for you
Nick and you're through
questing no I kind of I kind of felt
like I knew what the answer to that I
could honestly care less I mean when
years ago when Android first came out
and there was the first you know
augmented reality overlays on top of
your camera and you couldn't you know
pop something up and look at a map and
see some points of interest on overlaid
on your camera that was cool
did I ever use them no have I used any
augmented reality stuff in the last two
to three years on my smartphone no you
know those AR stickers that you get for
cameras and stuff those are fun to play
with for about five minutes but then you
move on
I still haven't seen a
pending application that uses any of
that on a regular basis that you would
actually want to use more than just
testing it out one to two times so I'm
because I'm a it's nothing I was I was a
very early proponent a very early
advocate for a our services I think a
our will be the future of communicating
of Technology but so far I think the
only killer app I found something that I
will turn to more consistently would be
the translation when I'm traveling in a
foreign country I don't speak the
language I can hold my phone up to a
sign those things have been significant
benefits from my ability to get around
to navigate and I would like to see
maybe a are better improve things like
whopping oil walking directions for maps
but I've been less than impressed with
the current fad or trends towards things
like an emojis and a are stickers I
don't think that really properly
communicates to consumers what what you
can do
I give could be maybe moving more
towards like terminator vision for good
in the moment relevant contextual
augmented reality information well and
that's a thing unless unless it's a
wearable device and it it's hassle-free
where you don't have to pick up your
device and point it at something cuz
that's the hardest thing like you look
like a jackass when you pull your phone
out and you're you start putting it
around and you're like hey what does
this look like over here but even to
your point of the translation things I
mean the translation things have been
around for years
they simply you have to take a picture
of it it translated it and then showed
you the translation rather than doing it
in real time so I mean that's available
without the AR aspect of it oh that is
but but I really do like the AR aspect
where you hold up the phone and it
actually changes the sign in real-time
so I mean again it's it's just that one
little bit more convenient than what we
used to have that's not groundbreaking
it's like that's not mind-blowing that
is a nice perk though that it's a nice
benefit I'll be crazy if Apple can
actually move the needle in any
substantial fashion
or should we just expect I don't know
like would it be nice to have an iPhone
with a larger camera sensor like maybe
maybe that's just enough for I would be
better honestly back with those jewels
sorry I know you kind of bounced out
there for a second yeah I'm just trying
to wait out the stutters yeah definitely
of something to look forward to in terms
of just being able to get the hardware
all to you look at a perfect combination
of hardware because at some point
software only gets you so much and you
just need data you can't just
extrapolate things so we'll have to see
if the timer lights on so it gets worked
in another iOS piece of news that we
want to talk about has to be with valve
Balfanz not really happy about it's a
disqualification of steam link
pretty had originally was approved for
steam link to appear on the App Store
but and this would be a mirroring
service so that users would be able to
have their games on their computer get
streamed over into their Apple TVs or
their iPads are their iPhones even and
they'd be able to play with compatible
controllers so that's a different
experience but yeah
this this whole steam like debacle the
ultimate rejection of an app was due to
a few factors the main line here is that
a business conflicts with app guidelines
that had allegedly not been realized by
the original review team so apparently
there have been differences to an in-app
apps like that purchases for the games
if I was going to sell the games on the
app and that would be subject to Apple's
30% cut that they wouldn't want to take
in terms of revenue so now we're going
to see well maybe you can call it
crippled up I mean you have to have your
computer as far as I understand it steam
link you'd have to have you compete on
and at least you know functioning in
order to be able to stream the game so
if you were just to purchase games on
your computer instead of your phone well
and Nick just outside of the this the
more focused conversation on gaming you
know we're talking about Apple they have
a fairly closed ecosystem is this gonna
be is this gonna be a step towards Apple
having to play nicer with outside
services but they can't just walled
garden everything I would say no I think
that Apple's gonna take the cue from
this and close off even more things I
mean when was last time we saw Apple
relax on their walled garden in you know
it for the longest time you know you
they they didn't include subscription
services you know taking a cut of
subscription services that are signed up
through applications and now they do but
this the the fact that they're saying no
to this application means that any any
application that allows you to have
remote access to a computer would
probably fall under the same rejection
because technically if I can remote
access my my desktop PC and I can go to
the Windows app store while I'm remotely
desk you have that remote access and
purchase something from the windows App
Store Apple wants a cut of that because
that's essentially what they're saying
to steam right now is oh you can access
something else and you can purchase
something through your application so we
deserve a cut of that like wait a second
this has nothing to do with your
platform at all you're not buying an iOS
service or an iOS game anything you're
buying a desktop PC game and you're
saying you want to cut of that and
that's that's completely ridiculous
Apple needs to step it back but honestly
I think they'll take this and say no
any remote access application that wants
to do this and you can make a perky
let's say I can go online and make a
purchase through Netflix and sign up for
my subscription there through a remote
access they'll say no that interferes
with our business and we want to cut of
it it's kind of mating you know it's
with the Apple tax that Spotify has to
go through if you're buying your
subscription through Apple then you pay
three extra dollars just because Spotify
has to make up the difference somehow so
it's what we've been talking about with
the smaller developers too that have
been urging Apple to extend the ability
to offer free transfer all apps instead
of just big publishers that have a
dependable steady revenue stream and
also oh the reduction of the they
receive 15% instead of 30 I mean we
understand that for Apple this whole
services game is gonna be it's a game to
them I mean they say they want to double
their 2016 revenue levels by 2020 and
they are looking to do so through some
of their own initiatives such as Apple
music but also just yeah and also
content as well with the carpool karaoke
and other original series I forget what
was the it was Dickenson they're
ordering a series of Emily Dickinson
kind of a serious kind of a funny biopic
deal here so that's their play but
they're also Nichol dining every other
person that wants to play in their
sandbox III thought it was interesting
that steam got as much as attention as
it did because the Apple ecosystem isn't
really known for gaming and any any
household we're looking at a compliment
device to an Apple TV if you were really
into gaming especially a PC gaming
proprietary steam link hardware would
probably have been higher on your list
like I can I can have my Apple TV and
then the other HDMI port I'll plug in
some sort of steam steam remote view
solution too so I thought it was
interesting that this this piped up is
much well gonna see this move the needle
much on on consumer sentiment like I
don't think this changes anyone's
purchasing behavior the next time
they're considering shopping living room
computing device well there was even
steam that allowed max to expand their
gaming portfolio by miles just because
of your new developers so I mean there's
gotta be a favor paid back there really
doesn't I mean like the whole thing is
it's still it's still in in the gaming
community it's still a sort of a funny
conversation that you know you don't buy
a Mac if you're serious about trying to
play your game yep I mean if you're
stuck with a Mac anyways then you want
to make the most of your situation
that's all I'm saying
you probably chew through the recipes
because I do want to talk to Nick about
about traveling a using tech on-the-go
so what do we have up next on the docket
here yeah let's talk about in dromeda
but not from Google apparently we're not
gonna be talking about the merger that
was well it's become fuchsia so will not
talk about that instead we're going to
talking about Microsoft and Microsoft's
Andromeda excuse me and this has long
been rumored ever since perhaps the
death of Windows 10 mobile to be kind of
a multifunctional tablet device and it
would allow users to use Windows 10 but
in a multi form-factor kind of way where
it adjusts the UI to have you know
certain orientations and whatnot and
apparently we saw tassets
kind of acknowledgment happened in one
of Microsoft's first marquee games well
technically it's Microsoft Studios in
partnership with
an electric square it's Miami Street is
the game it's really not much of a game
it's a click click to play QuickTime
event kind of deal it's not really
gaming as it's not really racing as the
cars on this display on this title
screen show it's just well make sure you
drift for the right time and you get
points so there it is but yeah Nick
that's like totally right up your alley
right totally I use but your data that
really talks here because it's there the
game was actually written to be targeted
to both windows 10 pcs and this new
Andromeda OS so I mean that's something
to look forward to right sure Windows 10
on arm and all the other developments
and how Intel Qualcomm are still nodding
at each other's teeth it's it's worth
exploring what can be done in terms of
Microsoft's leading the way in new
verticals and who they partner with to
help materialize those new verticals not
my issue right now is just trying to get
excited about something that we still
don't know the full details of or what
it's actually going to deliver to us as
far as benefits go and the same for you
know Google's fuschia OS and things like
that like there's there's a lot of great
things that are happening out there as
far as the next generations of operating
systems things like that but until we
get to that point where it's actually
going to be coming and we actually know
how it's going to help me or be
different from what we already have I'm
like hey everyone's thinking about
something every day I can think of
something to write its get excited about
my idea I mean go to shark tank and then
you'll get like a thousand a hundred
thousand dollars and like 85% you're
hungry I'm gonna get like five million
dollars from Mark Cuban five million
dollars
- going all the way perfect
I mean good for you good luck and I
wonder what would say I'll definitely
comment like hey I used to know Nick
before you as on shark tank with his
speculative idea for the future of
technology yeah and then if some work
that you could just go to Dragons Den up
in Canada
two weeks later I'll just come back here
we're like yeah actually I blew it guys
I blew it
it'll be the next essential billion
dollars and then go out of business yeah
yeah
- funding rounds a billion dollars and
then you got I mean it'll sell the
company and hopefully like make half as
much as we poured into it but whatever
and so maybe hopefully I mean as long as
your name is an auntie really let's
quickly talk about another device with a
stylus on it the LG q7 stylus has
apparently made its way to Taiwanese
regulators and I just wanted to go down
on just the theme of LG's yearly attempt
at a mid-range phone it's always been a
mid-range kind of Snapdragon 400 deal
with a stylus and there's a counter to
the yearly note the superpower very
productivity hungry deal that samsung
knows has what's your assessment of LG's
is that a response is it just being able
to cater to the subcategory of the
audience that hasn't been served I would
say it's first off I need to clarify is
this an active stylus or a passive
stylus like LG's done in the past that
sounds like it's a passive stylus just
so from its nature it's it's not
anywhere on the same terms as the s-pen
with the note so it doesn't have I would
imagine it would be well that's the
thing it's like if you're gonna do a
stylus do it right to give us additional
functionality don't give me a secondary
device that just replaces my finger I
mean that's the that's the draw of the
note is the stylus has additional
functionality that you don't get if you
just use your finger so I you know if
they're just trying to play me too and
try doing at a cheaper budget price
point and they've done it for years I
outside of Korea I don't think they're
you know note knockoffs have been
successful at all I don't know I don't
know what the numbers are but there's no
way that there's a market of people who
are consistently asking oh I can't wait
for the next you know the stylus and
actually I think of melchi I think in
the past this stylo and the stylus
phones from LG have actually sold fairly
well as those budget carrier handsets
like I think the numbers on the myth
that I've actually been pretty decent
for for LG sales but you know I think
you're right though that what what I
think I'd like to see is because it
could LG do something novel with that
concept and introduce some of those
features to hardware that's been a lot
more exciting or a lot more compelling
to use like a g7 or a V Series phone
that has that kind of productivity
Hardware built into it and unfortunately
it doesn't seem like they consider that
to be a growth market for them well in
that would that's what would make the V
series even more alluring than what it
is is adding a stylus to it and being
that direct competitor I mean it also
comes out in the fall like the note it's
also larger than the regular LG flagship
device like the note is to the S you
know the s9 and I don't see why they
they continually add the stylus to a
device that doesn't have any appeal on
its own rather than being a much advice
yeah again because it kind of makes it
feel like the consolation prize welcome
to Boost Mobile we don't carry the note
stylus instead
and no for the record Pepsi is not he's
not okay it is the the the lg stylus is
the is Pepsi okay oven its smartphone
and that's your that's honestly that's
the cue to move on to something else
yeah I actually I mean in more positive
LG news and some positive Motorola news
let's just kind of clip this one real
quick this one made me made me very
happy to see I've been happy with
project Phi as a service I used it as my
backup SIM card for for my review
devices it's it's just been a nice
catch-all and we're looking at LG phones
and some Motorola phones heading to
project Phi and that not just like oh
you know like you can get an unlocked g6
on Amazon for a little less monies we're
talking the V 35 the g7 and motos new g6
that's a pretty solid lineup for what
used to be just Nexus and pixel devices
I don't know do you think this will help
improve the visibility for a service
like v do you think this is still just
going to be a hobbyist and an enthusiast
service or or or is this the kind of
traction we need to see like going into
a carrier store now project Phi has
direct options for consumers looking to
pick up newer phones for me it comes
down to what the service plans actually
are because when project Phi started out
it was kind of a deal with the amount of
data that you were getting but they
really haven't revamped that recently
and I think actually I think that a new
plan is pretty competitive because now
they've got two caps at that now because
it's there's an $80 cap so once you go
over a gig you you don't keep paying per
gig after that point mm-hmm
well but that's the thing if you add a
like right in line with unlimited plans
at that point an unlimited plans gonna
be like you know around a hundred bucks
a month so now you're pretty close for
t-mobile it's 80 bucks a month for
unlimited for their unlimited plan and
if you do a family unlimited plan then
your second device is 50 bucks in the
third device is 30 bucks so if if you
have you know if it's just yourself then
maybe it's you know competitive with
the unlimited plans but if you're
talking to devices or more than it's a
ridiculous amount of money to pay well
and I and I think well I think project
by also does some sort of family
grouping plan but I think the the
benefit would be is if you have a month
where you're under eight gig then you're
you're under spending t-mobile just to
have that unlimited yeah well I mean
t-mobile a few people know this but
t-mobile actually has a a refund process
if you go under a certain amount of data
that you use every month you get like 15
to 20 bucks back every month if you go
under like two gigabytes of data usage
so it's kind of the same thing where you
know you're only charged so much but
then instead of charging you upfront
they charge you on back end so yeah and
it's particularly hard for me to see the
g7 thank you and the v35 thank you at
project five at the same time when AT&amp;amp;T
passed up the g7 for the v35 well what
what's going on with LG Google I mean
they've been buddy-buddy for a long time
but there's this whole kind of
bureaucracy with oh the v35 is better
for showcasing DirecTV now has OLED that
doesn't have an arch like its own it's
all about the display and like that was
their case but it's like oh hey we're
project fiber Google apparently we don't
we we can do evil from this point on but
it well that's I mean that's I feel like
that's not a direct quote from Google
Jules well like that speculation well
just the mission of like to prevent us
from getting sued by Google we needed
that a little bit of extra clarification
they met and joined and I appreciate
your candor yeah like but apparently we
can still do these kinds of little
friendly things like I'm giving us a $50
discount on the Moto G six as opposed to
MSRP or well I mean yes gonna be priced
at $1.99 if you pick it up on project
fire service I did want to look it up
just because I couldn't remember
what my actual bill was from month month
because I'm usually only using about a
gig of data on my review sim every month
one person is 60 bucks for unlimited two
people to kick set up to 100 for
unlimited three people 124 people 145
people 160 and at 6 people their plans
top out 180 dollars for unlimited data
you know I would say that's competitive
with what you would get on a t-mobile
service but the the way to join t-mobile
and Sprint before t-mobile and Sprint
finished their merger so you'd be ahead
of the curve being able to use Sprint
towers at the same time or you get the
bonus of the bonus of a US Cellular as
well so my question is you know how does
the merger between t-mobile and Sprint
affect project by going forward I mean
if we're looking at a you know yeah a
year from now you know if if it goes
through you know hypothetical if it goes
through t-mobile said that their plan is
to shut down Sprint's Network which
means all of project files customers
essentially lose half of their well over
it no I think they're looking to shut
down Sprint's Network to use their their
towers and their their services like
it's not that they're gonna just gut
sprint and then that that's gonna vanish
it would be I mean they're gonna fill
out the holes in our own network and
then use that for 5g well their
tendencies they're gonna they're going
to keep the some of Sprint spectrum
licenses so that they can use them for
5g and then they're gonna but it's more
primarily on t-mobile's network no but
like so the spectrum that they're
getting from Sprint they said they're
gonna use for 5g which means what
they're using now for CDMA is gonna be
turned off and so any phone that's
connecting with project Phi over CDMA to
those networks will no longer be I don't
I don't think I don't think many phones
are actively falling back to chspe I
appreciate your Voynich and I'm not
not trying to like to fight me this is
an fisticuffs I just think the scenario
you've painted is probably not a you
know a significant number of users
experiences when we're talking about
jumping back and forth between
t-mobile's HSPA Network versus Sprint's
still kinda terrible no totally I
totally get my my question is though
like I I wonder if there's someone's
created an application that tracks a
project feist devices to see how often
it's on t-mobile's network and how often
sits on Sprint's Network yeah and wisdom
t-mobile's network has gotten so good
over the last two to three years and
Sprint's network has continued to
essentially be great as far as you know
in in comparison good defense if he's on
Sprint so but I'm not I'm not saying
that Sprint's network is getting worse
but in comparison to t-mobile's network
getting better the Delta between them
has increased
it feels first so for me in the valley
in Los Angeles where we have just la
being the ginormous megapolis urban
sprawl that it is in the worst way
possible and every carrier has huge
issues with signal dropout around town
it's just impossible to perfectly cover
wide areas of humanity with that kind of
consistency I would say in the valley
Sprint's been in a holding pattern I'm
still having experiences where from one
block one city block to the next I'll
have amazing LTE because no one's on it
and then I'll just find myself in a gap
in between towers where I'm on you know
500 kilobits per second
CDMA mobile actually has been moving the
needle on improving the the holes so you
know again it's great when you're on a
good connection you're getting that
bandwidth you're getting that throughput
but I've seen t-mobile making bigger
strides to filling in the holes in their
service than I have I have well we've
got that six hundred megahertz they got
that they have they're working with TV
stations and other entities that are
currently on 600 megahertz to get out of
there and they're basically
they've been really aggressive in that
they have a 40 billion dollar plan for
the next what three or five years or so
so I mean say just in the context of
taking this back outside of this Sprint
t-mobile in looking at Project Phi as a
service I've been using it with a number
of unlocked phones which means that
they've almost all been defaulting to
t-mobile's network yeah because a third
part does that I don't have the CDMA
exactly and and I would say that using
that as a primary service it's been
phenomenal so I don't think that the
Sprint t-mobile merger is gonna be
necessarily a negative for project Phi
customers I think what we'll probably
see is sort of a status quo than
maintaining the same kind of
connectivity that they had or that you
would have if you were using like a
huawei on project file like I like I did
from my matin and honor reviews and then
from there hopefully that means that
we'll see t-mobile getting you know a
bit more aggressive with their 5g
rollout which I think will just benefit
whatever future version of project Phi
they can they can license out to
especially with regulatory scrutiny over
Sprint and t-mobile representing 54% of
the prepaid market I think they'll be
apt to keep project Phi under their
umbrella I guess they don't want to keep
there as opposed to maybe forcing Google
to consider courting 18t and Verizon
more more aggressively well yeah I mean
they have wholesale data issues that you
know they're trying to sell to MVNOs and
all that they're trying to keep costs
low so that you know regulators do you
see them happy do you see them as more
willing to comply to a certain musters
to be able to go through the merger I do
want to move on we're running short on
time here and talk about the last thing
here little nice note to leave it on
with in terms of accessibility and
that's with the the dot watch one of the
newfangled smartwatches that well it's
not it doesn't have a display it doesn't
have
like notifications as we know it but
it's a SmartWatch it does do a lot of
things but it doesn't embrace it doesn't
in tactile dots and it provides blind
users with a great way of accessing the
time it also Act provides them a way to
get messages or short messages with just
a small thing like these Graham machines
that we've seen these Braille tablets
are pretty big so to be able to have
something substantially smaller I mean
given its six characters that we're
seeing here but I feel like I kind of
want one because I want to teach myself
Braille oh look I think this would be
like an intro to learn your Braille
numbers one I think you know just from
an aesthetic standpoint it's one of the
coolest watches I've seen in a long time
and we've seen smart watches for the
last couple of years and you know large
displays LCDs this looks minimalistic it
looks sweet like I just want it just
because of how it looks and add in the
additional functionality that they're
planning on building into it it's a cell
for me I mean or by design takes me
right into things that I love like my
Skagen you know people who tuned in on
this podcast before I've heard me front
my my hybrid connected watches I love a
classic analog timepiece that also has a
few things like a pedometer built into
it and basic control notifications
certifications exactly yeah so just the
fact that this is I think this is an
amazing outreach - we've had some
conversations with other people in the
industry we had a long conversation with
an executive at AARP talking about
bringing more people into the
technological fold and this to me is one
of those accessibility accessories that
actually moves the needle on improving
the situation for someone who might be
seeing impaired yeah yeah definitely so
I mean mobile technology finally betting
better
instead of the more marginalized
suddenly differently abled communities
out there so I mean that's totally great
so I think what we're going to do
because I've just run out of time I have
to get to our meeting is I think that
you guys can talk offline about the
mobile living mobile and do many thing
and you'll be able to fit in the ad read
for there so I think that would about do
it for this podcast for now live for
noon for life and well we'll continue
the conversation so for the rest of our
conversation with Nick gray and his
mobility experiments catch us catch us
in the dedicated audio feed that you can
find through your favorite podcast
capture subscription service and jewls
thanks so much for hosting and we'll
we'll catch you next week on the show
man see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
