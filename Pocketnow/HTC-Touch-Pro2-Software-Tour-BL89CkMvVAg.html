pocketnow.com
and this is the software tour of the HTC
Touch pro2 now what you're gonna find is
the software is very very similar on the
touch pro2 to how it is on the diamond
too in fact there are only a very few
amount of changes that have been made to
the software experience we're gonna
cover everything fully in the review but
right now we're gonna go through the
main things that are different so to
start we finally have true touchflo 3d
in landscape it's been a long time
coming if you remember touchflo 3d on
the touch pro was just really a row of
icons when you opened up the keyboard
but not the case on the touch pro2
we finally have true-to-life touchflo 3d
in landscape and what it does it just
reorients things on the screen you get a
little button here which expands the
list of of icons on the screen that you
can go through so things are kind of
arranged differently but they are not
too different so we can go into favorite
people you've seen that before we'll go
right into text messaging and here is a
text message from John and I'm going to
tap on the screen to open that up and
here's the new text messaging screen and
we also saw this in the diamond too it's
a much more elegant way of communicating
with people that will put it into this
nice little threaded view now also part
of this part of this screen if we zoom
back out let's go back in for a second
and flip into portrait is the unified
communication screen we're going to talk
more about this in the review we covered
it in the diamond to review the idea is
that when I'm in the unified
communication screen with John I can see
all the emails that I've sent with him I
can see any cause that I've had with him
and I can also see some Facebook
information although the Facebook
integration
isn't that great it lets you add a
picture for the person and also update
their birthday on the contact card so
far I haven't seen that much more
functionality out of this and finally if
you go to the button on the left you get
to see the person's you know name and
address or any other information that
you
entered in again I'm not showing that
now because of security information but
we're gonna cover it fully in the review
great concept to have the unified
communication screen ok and of course we
have email here and we have calendar and
the calendar is fantastic because it
actually integrates with the weather so
if I go to today I get to see the
weather in Philadelphia which is where I
am we go into landscape and screen
rotation is super fast by the way I'm
sure you've seen that by now you have to
scroll a little bit if we go over to the
Internet of course we have push Internet
and the idea behind push Internet is
that you can set up a few different web
pages to preload so let's say every day
at 4 o'clock you check your stocks so
you have yahoo.com slash finance preload
itself every day at 4 o'clock and the
way you add a new push page is quite
simply you add in the address you
specify the frequency there and it won't
get it ready for you now you can also
specify how often this this works if you
go to schedule settings so let's say you
don't want the page to be pulled down
during the weekend so you turn on Monday
through Friday you leave off Saturday
and Sunday and that way you're not
accruing data charges when you really
don't need to be looking at a particular
website and over here as stocks and
stocks have been read down a little bit
it's actually the same stock screen that
you had in the HTC Touch HD so if we go
to Starbucks here we gets to see stock
details now here's where the landscape
integration doesn't work too well if we
flip over to landscape things reorient
but it requires you to scroll things
still don't fit on one screen it would
have been nice if they put the graph
over to the left and put these these
buttons for the various time intervals
to the right of that and put all this
information all the way over to the
right because kind of annoying having to
scroll whereas when you're in portrait
everything is right there on the screen
of course we have photos and video and
we've seen this before
and the camera on the touch pro2 as
we'll see in the review is quite
fantastic and so we can use the zoom
slider to move in a little bit and to
move out or you can flick your finger to
the right to see the next picture and
that's actually a little video
and the the scrolling from side to side
is much smoother than it was in the
touch Pro I'm you can go halfway and
stop before it was kind of this weird
artificial animation but now it's a lot
smoother and crisper and you can also
zoom in by double tapping and zoom out
but the zoom slider is there for you the
zoom slider will only work in Opera
Mobile and in photos unfortunately it
won't work in Skyfire if you get that or
in other programs so it's it's
functionalities quite limited to Opera
Mobile Google Maps and and photos so
let's continue our way in Touch flow-3d
of course you've seen the weather tab
but now that we have a massive WVGA
screen we can see the forecast right on
the screen the touch pro actually made
you go to another screen before you saw
weather but here it's integrated all
into the same screen and finally here we
have settings which bring some new
things if we tap on sound we get this
super elegant display that allows us to
change the various settings for sound on
the device we can slide up the volume
now when you press the start menu button
or the windows flag you're taken to the
HTC program launcher which is it's ok it
allows you to add programs and customize
things and if you press remove there are
some things that are locked like these
ones at the top are locked so if I
really want to have Opera Mobile right
right at the top I can't do that it's
got to be right here this is where you
can start customizing now the only way
to disable this HTC Start menu is to
disable touchflo 3d which is kind of
silly there should be a way to just turn
off this menu I actually like the
standard Windows Mobile
Start menu because it allows me to see
more on the screen at one time more
icons and it's a little bit more
customizable I think this is not very
not very user friendly and we can go to
all programs but again to get to the
bottom of the the huge list we have to
scroll a lot it's not like the standard
Windows Mobile program menu where you
get lots of lots lots and lots of icons
and you can see everything that's on the
screen at one
time now something that is new is the
conference call feature so I'm gonna
bring that up now and you get to the
conference call feature by flipping this
little button in the bottom right corner
now what we can do is we can go down the
list and check off people that we want
to have in a conference call and the
more you check and it seems that you can
check as many as you want you get a
little counter down here where it says
conference now if I tap on conference
it's gonna take me to another screen
that's gonna walk me through connecting
multiple people to the conference call
so basically it's like a conference call
wizard of course with cell phones you
can conference call many different
people and you can do that if you go to
menu and add caller but in but sometimes
if you're adding lots and lots of
different people it gets a little bit
cumbersome so this conference call
wizard makes it a little bit easier to
do that and you couple this with the
Straight Talk function and we
demonstrated that in the last video and
you have a really compelling solution
for having cause with multiple people
and using the device as a speakerphone
and things like that we'll cover this
more in the review coming up soon on
pocketnow.com
so that's pretty much it for the
software on the HTC Touch pro2 again the
software is very similar to what it was
on the diamond too with a few exceptions
and we'll cover everything fully in the
review coming up on pocketnow.com soon
it's great to finally see true touchflo
3d and landscape although the
implementation is kind of strange you
always have to go back to this button to
bring up the row of icons and in some
screens the screen space I don't think
is optimized perfectly for the landscape
because you have to scroll a lot whereas
in portrait you don't for the touch pro2
HTC has added a little bit of eye candy
to the messaging inbox so if you tap on
a message it will fade in watch so I'll
do that again so this isn't really that
functional and it actually probably
slows you down a little bit but it's a
small way that HTC has helped to make
this a little bit more of a refined
experience also lending to better
usability or or improved aesthetics is
the the new soft key menu so they're
much larger kind of like in windows
mobile 6.5 although a little different
looking and this is throughout the
entire operating system you give these
large menus and finally if you tap
the notification area up here you get a
notification box like this so this is a
nice little tray that will accumulate
all of your SMS notifications email
notifications call notifications it'll
tell you if you're connected to Wi-Fi or
if there are any networks detected and
from here you can access the wireless
networks and go to your Wi-Fi screen and
things like that so coming up in the
full review we're gonna have speed
benchmarks battery life tests and
screenshots of pretty much every aspect
of the HTC Touch pro2 so check out
pocketnow.com for that full review it
will be up very shortly that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
