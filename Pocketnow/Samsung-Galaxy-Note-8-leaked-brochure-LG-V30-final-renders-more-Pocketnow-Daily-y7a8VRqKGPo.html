Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be capable of
other league renders show is a very sexy
and curvy LGB 30 coming soon and Nokia
has just announced the much expected
mocha aid flagship I'm hi Marietta and
don't judge me for the t-shirt I was a
big fan of transformers and I was a kid
but no I did not go watch the movies
they're terrible except for the first
one
this is parking out daily the official
news do they have to do with deals if
you're in the market for a SmartWatch
and even if you're not LG watch now is
currently again on eBay for a hundred
and seven dollars and the reason why I
say even if you're not is because a lot
of people still debate if they should
buy a SmartWatch and i think these
entry-level smartwatches are a really
good way to get a feel for it see if you
actually like the experience I seriously
can't go back from using one but yeah
this is a good way to start and if you
don't like it just return it the price
is crazy good now let's talk about the
essential phone to things particularly
number one of your on Sprint and you
want the phone it's an exclusive phone
right now for Sprint as you get it
unlocked there are a couple of flex
fields that make the price tech
compelling the only problem is that even
though pre-orders have just begun well
we don't know exactly when you're going
to get the phone and then the second
thing is that if you are wondering
exactly how long you'll be getting
software updates two years pretty much
just like every other Android phone
which is not necessarily something I
applaud but anyways and yes the Nokia
eight was announced pretty much an hour
after the plugin out daily received its
cut off yesterday so I couldn't include
it in the video but yeah it's now
official we've got snapdragon a 35 4
gigs of ram we have 64 gigs of storage
and an option for 128 gigs depending on
the color varying that you choose
probably the only disappointment is
obviously the huge bezels and the fact
that well it's not an AMOLED display and
number three the fact that it's IP 54 so
it's splash resistant not necessarily
water-resistant we'll let you know as
soon as we know price tags and
availability now let's talk about the LG
v 30 for those of you wondering what
this phone will look like because all
we've seen are leaked photos famous
tipster evan Blastoise just spilled the
beans we've got this gorgeous design
it's actually curvier than the g6 in
both the borders and the
front and yeah if you thought that the
g6 could not get any better in its
design the V 30 is clearly proving us
wrong I can't wait to hold this film for
the first time seriously and finally the
very hot rumors that they have to do
with this leaked brochure of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 it reveals a couple of
good things and a couple of things that
are not necessarily good the first thing
is for those of you wondering what
features we're getting this is pretty
much a Galaxy Note 7 in most things
apparently the s-pen is improved but
then what you're capable of doing with
the s-pen remains the same and then in
other things for example pretty much all
the software features and the things you
could do have been changed but for those
of you wondering this flagship feature
which would be the dual camera what are
you going to be able to do apparently
this is a dual camera that's only going
to provide zoom and it's only 2 X
optical zoom which pretty much doesn't
make it any different to the 1 plus 5 or
the iPhone 7 plus and really it leads me
to the question today are you
disappointed or happy that you're
getting this feature because the leaks
were 3x optical zoom and then in my
particular case I mean you saw my after
the buzz of the iPhone 7 plus I never
used that zoom feature
I would prefer the ultra wide-angle lens
that we get with the g6 or better
photography coming from Huawei phones
with a monochrome sensor but hey leave
us a comment down below this is in my
opinion we would love to know yours and
Friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
videos films and follow as I'm talking
