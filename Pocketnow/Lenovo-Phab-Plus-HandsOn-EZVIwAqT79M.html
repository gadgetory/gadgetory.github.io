comfortably in your hands and pockets
I'm high out to Houston with a pocket
now Eva 2015 taking a quick look at the
Lenovo fab plus okay maybe that was a
little mean but the fat loss is
definitely a niche device with an insane
6.8 inch 1080p display Lenovo is
marketing it primarily as a phone but
digging into the settings shows that
even the fab itself is unsure of its
identity the aluminum design is one of
simplicity with only the essential
hardware controls lining the otherwise
blank citing but one of the most
striking features right off the bat is a
huge speaker grille surrounding the 13
megapixel camera on back it's hard to
get an idea of audio quality in such a
noisy environment but one thing's for
sure it's loud the phone is also dual
SIM capable at least on the units we
checked out and while the Snapdragon 615
and 2 gigabytes of RAM inside aren't
terribly impressive that battle-ax seem
to run fairly smoothly and our brief
time with it it's also compatible with
Lenovo's existing accessories meaning
you can pair it with a selfie flash for
the most superfluous experience
imaginable diving into the software
there are a few considerations made to
accommodate the large display there's a
one-handed mode to shrink the UI down to
a thumb Abul size and a floating icon
near the bottom of the screen gives
quick access to a few select apps and
settings there are also a few
interesting connectivity options in the
settings like WLAN binding and Ethernet
connectivity using a USB adapter we have
no word on availability or pricing just
yet but we'll cover the fab plus a bit
more if and when we have the opportunity
to in the coming months
if the PHAB plus isn't your thing we've
already looked at plenty of other
devices from Aoife so far and we're not
finished just yet so stay tuned on
YouTube and at pocketnow.com provocate
now i'm hyojoo huesemann from eva 2015
and we'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
