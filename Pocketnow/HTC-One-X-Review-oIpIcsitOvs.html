pocketnow.com and this is our full
review of the quad-core Tegra 3 powered
HTC One X let's get to it so before
getting started a little bit of
background in 2011 HTC messed up they've
released far too many phones and even
their top-of-the-line devices weren't
that great while Samsung was killing it
with the Galaxy S 2 selling millions and
millions of units in 2012 HTC has a
renewed focus on getting back to its
roots of innovation they're focusing on
making sense a lot more useful and less
fluffy they're focusing on attention to
detail in their hardware design because
you might remember that last year most
of their phones looked exactly the same
so finally we're seeing some creativity
from HTC so let's get started with the
unboxing HTC is using this new kind of
box the material is kind of like a
recycled paper which actually feels a
little cheap but it's kind of a unique
design it's white it's got a 1.5
gigahertz Tegra 3 quad-core 4+1
chip as they call it which means that
there are four cores to do all the heavy
lifting and then there's one core to do
background tasks it's also got a full
gig of ram 32 gigabytes of storage and
you get an extra 25 gigs of Dropbox
storage which is super cool for two
years it's also got an 8 megapixel
camera with f 2.0 aperture allowing for
a lot of light into the lens 1080p HD
video reporting and it's got a pretty
large 1800 million power battery it's
not listed here so you open up the cover
and we can see that HTC has a new slogan
I'm the one you've been waiting for kind
of provocative so inside the box we have
a little device that helps you cut your
SIM to a micro SIM shape kind of a
template there and it'll also help you
pop out the so tray and underneath all
of this we have just some headphones not
Beats Audio headphones and a charger so
some first impressions of this device
the screen is expansive they call this
the infinity display because kind of
like an infinity pool where it looks
like there's no edge and it's a
different HTC design than we're used to
we've got a new kind of speaker up here
which is nice kind of like little dots
very precise manufacturing went into
making this phone and we've got the poly
car
minute backing so it has a really nice
in hand feel so very nice build quality
one more thing to mention is that we've
dual microphones one on the top and one
on the bottom to help with noise
cancellation always a great feature to
have okay let's turn on the phone and
talk about software first of all the
screen on this phone is fantastic it's
got the widest viewing angles of any
phone I've ever seen the display looks
literally painted on it's an effect that
I've never seen on any other display
it's just that good so let's talk about
Sense 4.0 Sense 4.0 is based on Ice
Cream Sandwich so I've got a lot of the
functionality of Ice Cream Sandwich the
dock has been redesigned no longer is
there the permanent phone and
personalize button down there which is
great another thing HTC has improved is
the way you add things to the homescreen
I don't really like the way that this
this works actually it's just very
convoluted you have so many widgets to
choose from and it gets overwhelming I
like that they added the search bar to
be able to search for widgets but there
are just dozens and dozens of widgets
now just like HTC Android devices from
the very beginning we've got leaf and
people like to show leaf because it's so
fast and fluid something new with Sense
4.0 is that we can finally finally
delete home screen so we can tap and
drag we can have one home screen if we
want we can have up to seven or eight
it's great that we can finally customize
the number of home screens so I
mentioned some areas where the One X
lags and and let me show you some of
those for example if I tap on a folder
it opens pretty quickly right but did
you see how that stuttered but if I go
back and click on the same folder a
second time it will be smooth illness as
if it needs to go into memory first and
it's having trouble doing them another
place that the operating system lags and
I think this is the Tegra 3 chip all the
way if I go into settings here and I tap
on any setting there's a one second
sometimes two second lag watch and
that's kind of ridiculous we're running
on four cores here with a gig of ram and
as i bounced around sense you're going
to see some more lag for example if we
go to the program tray and we open that
up you see how long that took there was
that animation that probably slowed it
down a little bit but it's just not as
fast as it should and something new if
it's talked about some of the positive
thing something new to HTC Sense are
these tabs along the bottom that can
actually
be changed so you what you see a lot in
the operating system these three dots up
here and we can go to edit tabs and we
can customize the tabs you can do this
previously in HTC Sense but it wasn't
very intuitive now one place that HTC
Sense has always excelled as the email
application you can do a unified inbox
which will show you a different color
for every different account we've got
these new checkboxes which actually
could use a little bit more contrast but
when you tap on them you get these items
along the bottom you can mark as red
delete or move to there's a really cool
function in HTC Sense email with
threaded conversations take a look at
this if you have a threaded conversation
you get a counter here and a down arrow
here it allows you to see in different
levels of depth where your conversations
are I think that's just super cool
another thing you can do here like you
could do in the program list is go to
edit tabs again and customize the tabs
that you have because an HTC Sense of
previous phones you had a bunch of tabs
at the bottom and you had to have at
least three well if you leave one down
there there are no tabs at all you get
to maximize the viewing space but let's
say we want to go in there we want to
have favorites then we go back then
we'll have two tabs along the bottom we
get this really cool animation back and
forth row in the email client let's make
a new message and take a look at the
keyboard HTC has made some pretty big
improvements of the keyboard it just
looks really crisp and sharp on this
720p display it has the built-in swipe
like interface so you can swipe along
the screen - if that's your preferred
method of endpoint takes a little bit of
practice overall a really good keyboard
okay so let's talk about this multitask
UI at first I really didn't like it but
it's actually pretty smart what's
annoying about this multitask UI is that
it doesn't give you a high-level view of
all of your apps now something that you
can do is flick programs off the screen
which will actually close them another
thing that has been cleaned up is the
notification shade so we can go up here
and no longer do we have the list of
programs there which was kind of
redundant and you can swipe items off
the screen just like you can in stock
Ice Cream Sandwich something super cool
that HTC did just a little touch is they
made the top notification bar
translucent actually it's kind of
transparent I guess so you can see
through to your background
of course let's take a look at the web
browser web presence is extremely
important on any mobile device and with
a quad-core chip we want awesome web
browsing performance and especially with
the 720p display so we're going to go
into pocket now here and I'm going to
select Internet because I've got Chrome
Beta also installed and this is HTC's
custom browsers so they've done some
things to this and let's load the
desktop version of Pocket now we'll have
browser speed comparisons in future
videos I can tell you that it's quite
fast it's not the fastest browser but
it's definitely very capable so we can
pinch to zoom in it takes a little bit
too long to clear up that's one of the
places where I think that there is a
little too much lag in the operating
system in the browser things just aren't
as fast as they should be so we can go
into landscape get a really killer full
screen view utilizing all of these
pixels on the screen super smooth
scrolling and zooming let's jump into a
story here so web browsing very fast
very proficient and it looks especially
killer on this amazing display super LCD
to its HTC Show in the world that you
don't need an AMOLED screen to create
beautiful vibrant colors and awesome
contrast it's just a wonderful screen
and finally we've got to talk about the
camera because one of the main selling
points of the HTC One series of devices
is the camera in fact their slogan is
amazing camera authentic sound or
something like that
so let's jump into the camera app and
talk about why the camera is apparently
so amazing so it's eight megapixel
shoots 1080p video and one of the really
cool things is that you no longer have
to switch between photo and video mode
it's all here on the same screen another
really cool feature is that you can
record a video and while doing so you
can take a picture while the video is
still recording it doesn't produce the
best shots in the world and we'll put
some samples up in the for review but
it's a cool feature to be able to have
another super awesome amazing feature is
the burst shooting which allows you to
hold down the camera shutter button and
it will kind of make a interesting
ticking sound when you do and what it
will do it will bring up this interface
that allows you to see all of the
pictures and select which one of them is
quote the best shot
which is so useful because you don't
want to sit there with a gallery full of
35 images that look almost exactly the
same but what you want to do what you do
want to do is look at that special
moment
flip through all the pictures that you
took in the bursts and say this is the
one I want to say this is the one that I
want to remember so how's the photo
quality and how's the video quality
again one of some samples in the full
PocketNow review as a preview the photos
are great they're not amazing in fact
the iPhone 4s still kills the HTC One X
in terms of low-light performance fast
motion capturing when people are moving
quickly and in terms a video it does a
really good job with the 1080p video I
have to say very good exposure again
take a look at the samples coming up in
the pocket now review and you can tell
for yourself before wrapping up this
video just want to offer a few test
notes those things that you just get by
using the phone for a few days those
little details that matter a lot like
battery life house battery life on the
HTC One X it's average you'll get
through a day just fine if you're using
it heavily you're going to have to
charge on the evening but if you're
using it kind of on a moderate level
with a few costs here some email
browsing sessions there you'll be fine
to get through the entire day it's got
an 1800 million power battery what kills
the battery is gaming because all those
four cores are kicking on and they are
blazing and yes they are actually
blazing in terms of heat because they
get really really hot the back of the
phone gets really warm when playing a
game utilizing the Tegra graphics and
it's just a true battery life killer so
decent battery life another test note
how does it fit in your pocket that's
always very important the One X is a
larger device it's got a pretty big
screen does it slide easily into the
pocket and yes it does thankfully it's
very thin so you can hardly tell that
it's there it's not like the Galaxy Note
where you can just feel this large brick
thing in your pocket and it feels about
the same as the Galaxy Nexus if you have
experience with that device it's just
it's it's thin so it goes in relatively
easily into your pocket so in conclusion
we give the HTC One X the Tegra 3
international version a four out of five
why four out of five enough five the lag
enos of the operating system is pretty
atrocious it's subtle but for power
users is very very noticeable when you
tap on a setting when you tap on a
folder it stutters it should not do that
with a quad-core chip games look really
great they definitely look really great
in fact the Tegra optimized games look
console quality but in day to day use
this thing just doesn't feel as rocket
fast as it should but of course you can
route it and put any ROM you want on it
to help fix it another reason we're
giving it a four out of five is because
the camera while really cool in terms of
feature set doesn't take the most
amazing pictures as HTC will lead us to
believe the iPhone 4s even the galaxy s2
takes slightly better photos than the
HTC One X that said the HTC One X
Hardware is phenomenal the infinity
screen is gorgeous the display itself is
unbelievably crisp and clear it gets
attention from everyone and the form
factor is gorgeous the HTC One X is
definitely the best Android phone on the
market right now but guess what's coming
up next the galaxy s3 unless you really
want the One X far you and you're
looking at a high-end foam that's this
expensive wait to see what Samsung does
because it might blow this thing out of
the water if you liked this video please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now
