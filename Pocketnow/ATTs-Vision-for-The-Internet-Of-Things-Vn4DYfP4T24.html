frontier that many technology companies
are pushing forward these days and AT&amp;amp;T
has pioneered most of it through a good
portion of the last decade a DNT invited
us to ctia 2015 in Las Vegas the show is
exactly where its innovation is headed
and how you can already begin to enjoy
it I'm hi Mary better with pocket now
here with a quick look at your connected
life sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T the Internet of
Things or IOT is a new term given to a
network of physical objects that can
exchange data between each other but
even before that name actually existed
AT&amp;amp;T was already calling them and to end
connected devices the whole idea of
having our homes vehicles factories and
even medical equipment connected to each
other was a very nifty dream a few years
ago but ctia was proof that those dreams
are now a reality eighties keynote on
IOT was actually the highlight of the
conference and the company's CEO of
mobility Glenn Laurie was nice enough to
give us a quick overview of where things
are headed but I think what you're
seeing is just how deep and end the
breadth of where I OT is going you know
everything from connected home connected
cars obviously on fire and then you're
starting to see other things you know I
think the the wheelchair is a great
example right it's amazing because it
solves a problem and and that's one of
the things we've you probably heard us
talk about a lot it's one thing to
connect something but it has to solve a
problem it has to make people's lives
better the wheelchair allows a caregiver
to see understand how the wheelchair is
working it also allows them to make sure
the seat cushion right has the correct
arenít etc etc but what you're seeing
is is really everything's going to be
connected and that and you go down to
our our exhibit on the floor we're
really trying to show that whole vast
set of devices that will be connected
and how it will immobilizes people's
lives
ATT also took the opportunity during the
keynote to announce that products from
nest will now be able to connect to the
company's digital life platform one of
our major questions is what's AT&amp;amp;T scope
going forward we consider everything you
know one of the ways you be innovative
and Google's are great examples you have
to be open anything yeah be open to what
makes sense yet be open to what
customers may want when we looked at the
digital life platform we felt it was so
important to go have partners is to give
our customers choice and as I said on
stage or the foundation to get your life
is security then when you have the
automation on top you should be able to
pick any automation you like so we
opened our API so that we can bring
those into our ecosystem and let you
choose what automation makes sense for
you and that's exactly what we did your
nest is arguably one of the most
successful they make beautiful products
customers like them then they should be
able to bring them inside of the digital
life ecosystem and let nest get the
credit they deserve and it's working
under digital life but what it does is
the customer a single app and a single
experience and that's exactly what we're
trying to do obviously the biggest
concern we all have as consumers is how
you can take advantage of a connected
like today without burning a hole in
your pocket with so many devices and for
this 18th he already has a solution is
is Mobile share value gives us a really
nice tool which says look you go buy a
bucket of data and we let you put any
device it that you want to strap on to
that data eat out of the same bucket so
you got your smartphone's your tablets
your cars your wearables your dog
collars whatever you have right so for
10 bucks to add a tablet I can you have
the same bucket it just seems fair and
as we go forward we're gonna have to get
more creative with when you add all
these things that ain't the price needs
to be right and fair for the customer to
feel the values there but ultimately I
think Mobile share value is the core of
how we're gonna AT&amp;amp;T envisions your
smartphone to be the controller of your
connected life allowing you to not only
activate and deactivate devices at home
according to your needs but to also help
you monitor them while you're on the go
for now the company has focused its
approach towards four major areas which
are home automation and security IOT
industrial IOT and the connected car
from the few days that I spent at the
show floor i must say that I'm rather
impressed with its progress on all
departments but my favorite was
definitely the connected
i received the very extensive demo on
how your experience driving a vehicle is
enhanced by being connected and all
without taking your eyes off the road
once you match that with the fact that a
significant amount of automakers are
already working together with ATT and
things just continue to get better
what's most important though is that
even though we've seen a lot at this
trade show this is just the tip of the
iceberg when it comes to the Internet of
Things and we can't wait to see where
things will evolve over the next few
years we've got a lot more coverage
coming from ctia in Las Vegas so make
