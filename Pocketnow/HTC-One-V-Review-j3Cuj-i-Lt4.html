pocketnow.com and this is our full
review of the HTC One V the one with the
chin let's get to it
as we mentioned in our review of the HTC
One X and we'll put a link up here so we
can get back to that HTC is on a crusade
in 2012 to take back the limelight they
want to be revered as the number one
handset manufacturer they want to have
devices that are truly compelling with
awesome software and amazing hardware
and the one series of devices represents
their first attempt to do that with the
One X the 1s and the one v that we have
here the one v is the cheapest device in
the one series designed for the
budget-minded it's only 350 bucks if you
buy it from a site like niger
electronics comm and it comes in both
brown and gray this is the brown version
the specs match the price though is
you'll find a one gigahertz single core
Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU with 512
megabytes of RAM and just four gigabytes
of storage but you can actually expand
it with a microSD slot
unlike the One X you might be wondering
if these last generation specs hampered
device performance and will have to
answer that later in the video
we also from UMTS allowing it to work in
the US on AT&amp;amp;T 3G the rear camera is 5
megapixels and shoots 720p video while
on the front there is no front facing
camera it's running on android 4.0.3
with Sense 4.0 and is powered by 1,800
milliamp hour battery the most notable
design feature of the One V is its chin
which is reminiscent of the HTC Hero and
legend the chin really has no functional
value except to make the device feel
more like an actual phone in hand and
not like a mini tablet as is the case
with a 1 V and other devices that have a
large screen the phone has a unibody
aluminum casing which provides a very
high-quality feel it's cool to the touch
when you pick it up which reminds us of
the Desire HD The Legend and other
unibody phones from HTC the aluminum has
a nice metallic shine to it which looks
great in the light the phone itself
feels very much like a phone thanks to
its small form factor overall it feels
pretty great in the hand especially when
you're using it as home phone and
Hornung it against your face here on the
bottom we have a removable panel which
lets you access the microSD and
SIM slot while the 1/v takes a regular
sized SIM unlike the 1x which takes up
Micro SIM you can actually finagle all
Micro SIM to fit if you don't have an
adapter just make sure you have a
paperclip around to fish it out should
you need to remove it as with the other
HTC One devices the One V has Beats
Audio which is an audio equalizer that
does indeed make audio sound better but
now to a huge degree on the front we
have a piece of Gorilla Glass covering
the 3.7 inch WVGA Super LCD 2 panel so
that's 800 by 480 because the screen is
small at 3.7 inches you still get a
reasonable pixel density of around 250
allowing for relatively sharp and clear
text though it's not nearly as
impressive as the One X below the screen
we have the three Android buttons for
Ice Cream Sandwich and then there's a
sharp ledge below the screen which helps
you to feel for the capacitive buttons
when you're not looking
we've talked quite a bit about Sense 4.0
in previous videos and as a summary we
find it to be a big improvement over
previous versions but it doesn't go far
enough to reduce the fluff and the
clutter interestingly because of the low
respect Hardware on the one V a lot of
sense 4.0 has been tuned down for
example folders do not animate when you
open them unlike the One X also the
multitask UI is stock Ice Cream Sandwich
instead of that crazy fluffy 3d thing
that you get on the One X another place
that sense is tuned down for the One V
is the lack of leap feature which means
that you cannot customize the number of
home screens you have nor can you zoom
out to get an overall view like you can
on other HTC devices in terms of general
performance the HTC One V has a lot of
problems we were hoping that the
tried-and-true Snapdragon 1 gigahertz
CPU would provide snappy performance
especially when coupled with ICS but
that just is not the case flipping
around between various apps is often
cumbersome and slow the worst
performance is found in the browser
let's go to pocket now and check out
performance
scrolling is choppy zooming is choppy
it's pretty much intolerable using the
web browser scrolling again is very
choppy
zooming in takes a long time to clear up
it's just a really bad web browsing
experience which is very unfortunate
because pretty much the number one use
of smartphones for most people is
browsing the web and the 1/v just
doesn't do it very well that said you
could try other browsers which might
help but the stock browser really does
not do a good job other than that you
get seven home screens to customize with
a variety of widgets like the One X
there is a new albeit a bit clunky way
to add widgets to your home screen the
one B sputters through this new
interface if you're trying to quickly
add a bunch of widgets the bright side
of Sense 4.0 comes through in apps like
email where HTC has improved upon the
stock ICS email experience for example
threaded messages are displayed with a
little down arrow and when you hit it
you get this nice layered view
unfortunately the One X has trouble with
that animation and it kind of sputters
once again here you can see the Sense
4.0 keyboard which is more compact than
what is found on the One X it's an easy
to use keyboard and it works very well
although you don't get the swipe feature
that you do on the other HTC devices
battery life on the One V is above
average thanks to its single core cpu
relatively large battery and smallish
screen so there's not that massive of a
backlight that needs to power with mine
aren't use expect to get one and a half
days of use out of the one v which is
better than your typical one day or less
than one day with other phones another
test note photo-quality the camera on
the One V is good but not amazing as HTC
would leave us to believe we'll have
some photo samples in the full review on
PocketNow but I can tell you that photos
were noisy and color saturation was in
some cases overdone that said the camera
app is impressive it lets you easily
toggle between photos and videos take
burst shots and even take photos while a
video is running which is a very unique
feature
how about pocket ability let's do the
pocket test the One V slips easily into
a pocket the chin doesn't get in the way
at all when you're trying to put the
phone away in your pocket
overall here's what we like and don't
like about the HTC One V what we like is
that it's using aluminum unibody
construction
we like that it feels really great in
the hand the high degree of build
quality and we like that it has
above-average battery life which is
difficult to find these days
we don't like that performance is poor
especially in the web browser we also
don't like that there's no front facing
camera and finally we weren't excited by
the quality of the photos and video we
were hoping that the HTC One V would be
a very capable budget device the price
is great the hardware is amazing but the
software just does not cut it it's slow
and very laggy in fact laggy is an
understatement it has poor performance
especially in the web browser which is
kind of depressing to be honest because
most people use their phone primarily
for web browsing so we cannot recommend
the HTC One V and we give it a three out
of five stars
until HTC can fix the software it's very
likely that in a short period of time a
software update will fix these
performance issues but right now it's
not worth getting even at a low price
point if you like this video please give
us a thumbs up and thanks for watching
that's it for now
