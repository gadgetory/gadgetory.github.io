Galaxy S 10 and it's finally not screen
protector leaks according to analyst we
could be getting new iPads soon
including a refresh of the iPad Mini and
DSO mark just brought a rating for the
pixel three that we're still scratching
our heads over I'm high netted Yvette
I'm reporting from the country where
spring never ends with in my lap this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals if here in the
market for a good smartphone but from
last year right now we've got some
really good ones for the huawei mate 10
Pro currently 480 dollars and the
specifications are great I mean there
are still products this year that don't
rival that phone when it comes to all
their powers so you can learn more about
it in the description now let's talk
about AT&amp;amp;T as of the companies making
this very interesting change as of next
year they just announced that the LTE
indicator on your phone might change and
now you're gonna get five ge which
stands for 5g evolution which is sort of
awkward because you're not technically
getting full 5g sure lt's part of the
combo but it's not the whole thing one
and two the code is v GN are not v GE so
stay tuned for that yes they have
started deploying 5g in that hotspot
thingy but the nighthawk but hey now
let's move the spotlight over to other
weird news I mean DX o mark I don't know
man they just posted something today
that I'm like no this can't be
they just gave the Google pixel 3 a
rating of 101 which according to pretty
much all of us in this industry is the
best smartphone camera I debate between
this and the huawei mate 20 pro but it's
not at the level of the Huawei P 20 the
standard which has a higher rating and
it's not at the level of the iPhone 10
or the pixel 3 is superior than these
phones let us know in the comments what
do you think about these ratings I mean
hey it's never mind now let's talk about
iPads as we've got China Times reporting
that we might be getting two very
interesting changes as of next year the
first one that the entry-level nine
point seven inch iPad apparently will
grow into a 10 inch
model which I'm hoping what they're
gonna do is grab the previous iPad pros
thinner bezel design and bring that to
the nine point seven inch and then we
finally finally get a refresh to the
iPad Mini my god that one's taken a
while and it'll even support Apple
pencil which for me would be like the
perfect combo iPad Mini with Apple
pencil
stay tuned let's see what we get and
finally the hottest news today I have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10 and
don't worry we're not gonna talk about
screen protectors this time it's all
about two things the first one that it
seems that the aspect ratio of the phone
is going to grow to nineteen point five
by nine or somewhere around there which
makes sense I mean if the phone is going
to be dropping bezels than surely the
display will get taller without
sacrificing making the phone any bigger
but even more interesting is that
xda-developers recently dissected this
one UI build and found that there is
this bright night feature and I know
we've got nightscape night site night
mode we've got so many yeah they had to
come up with a name bright night let us
know in the comments what do you think
about the name brighten landed what
would you like to see cuz in my case
I'll tell you this much I did a
comparison recently with the galaxy s 9
plus I'm actually due to do it after the
buzz for that phone shoot and that phone
with that F 1.5 aperture can make some
of the phones with that night mode
thingy look bad so I can't imagine what
Samsung's gonna bring leave us a comment

opinion friends again if you want to get
