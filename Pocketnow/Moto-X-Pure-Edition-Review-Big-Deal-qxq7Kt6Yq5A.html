breath of fresh air to a smartphone
community already growing fatigue of
phablet disease it was a smaller humbler
phone that focused on usability not brag
ability a smartphone to restore sanity
well that Saturday was short-lived
last year's sequel to the original Moto
X upped the build quality and process
respects while also significantly
expanding the phone's size it was still
a fantastic device but in inflating
itself to appeal to a mainstream
audience it lost some of the whimsy that
had made its predecessor so compelling
flash forward to 2015 and it seems the
newly Lenovo fied Motorola has no
intention of returning to a niche
audience the third generation Moto X
pure edition is a 5.7 inch quad HD
monster of a smartphone primed to do
battle with the top-end phablets of the
modern world and it's price to move how
much of the original Moto X vision does
it sacrifice to get there and is the
trade-off worth it I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow let's find out
the first thing you notice when you take
the Moto X pure edition out of the box
is it's big old footprint motorola told
us it wanted to build something for
people who use their smartphone as a
media device for browsing and movie
watching and the reg was at big display
necessitated and expanded chassis as
well the phone tips the scales at 179
grams more massive even than the
all-glass galaxy note5 and it's chubby
to hitting 11 millimeters at its
thickest point this is probably the
biggest departure Motorola makes from
the spirit of the Moto X as a whole the
pure edition is as prodigious as its
predecessors were pocketable fortunately
motorola makes at work
through organ nom ik's the rounded
backside lets the body taper to just
over six millimeters at the edges and
the trademark dimple is more than just a
visual counterbalance to the camera lens
it's an anchor point for a fingertip to
make using the phone more comfortable
the bezels flanking the display are slim
enough to make the Moto X a fairly
narrow phone while their screen sizes
are somewhat comparable the Moto X pure
edition is a much less cumbersome device
than its wide-body cousin the Nexus 6
and Motorola's spared no expense on the
display itself it's quad HD and 5.7
inches on the diagonal which makes for a
density of 515 PPI more than enough
resolution for even the most persnickety
pixel pusher it's really a very pretty
screen but it's not perfect
direct sunlight can still overwhelm it
and I really wish Motorola had stuck
with an AMOLED panel instead of making
the switch to IPS here LCD technology
just can't replicate OLED Zinke blacks
and the lower contrast means Motorola's
active display is tougher to see if
there's any glare on the Gorilla Glass
fortunately almost anything else you
don't like about the Moto X hardware you
can change before you buy it
ordering a Moto X pure edition through
Moto maker is a lot like custom building
your own car between backing material
accent and frame colors and storage
options there are over a thousand
possible design variations we went with
silicone rubber backing which might be
one of the grip iasts phone materials
I've ever encountered
in concert with the metal side rails it
gives the phone a really solid
no-nonsense feel and it's also a subtle
reminder that the phone is
water-resistant to an extent the pure
addition also packs a nice surprise on
the flip side of its nano SIM tray a
micro SD card slot good for up to 128
gigs of extra storage and while we're up
there fun fact the Moto X does indeed
support a notification LED right behind
its upper speaker grille but it's unused
by the software for good reason that
reason is the aforementioned active
display you can pick the phone up more
just wave your hand over the screen to
trigger an automatic preview of the time
and you're waiting notifications use it
for a while and you really miss it when
moving to a phone that doesn't have
something similar that goes for the rest
of the Moto features - which are largely
unchanged from previous Moto X versions
the phone can still read your text
messages aloud and let you respond by
voice dictation if it detects you're
driving a cool feature even if it's a
little hit and miss new text from Chris
Larson to hear it say listen listen
Chris said Chris Larson yo don't take
Massachusetts Avenue because the traffic
is mad epic and terrible to reply to
Chris C sent message send message to
late burrows if I think you said 28
broseph is that correct yeah awesome
I'll send that now
it'll also silence your alerts if the
calendar tells it you're in a meeting
and you can set custom behaviors for
specific locations like work and home
moto voice is back as well so you can
ask questions and give commands
completely hands-free using a custom key
phrase okay Jarvis play pin back on
Spotify alright
if that's a little obtrusive for you
there's a new boys feature here just
raise the phone to your ear and wait for
the tone then speak a command or
question and you'll get your replies
through the earpiece and if you find
yourself in need of a flashlight on the
quick you don't need to fire up the
display to do it just give the motox a
little chop-chop BAM you're in torch
town some of these features are better
in concept and execution the key phrase
recognition process is still slower than
just picking the phone up and hitting
the microphone button and a voice
dictation as a whole can be hit and miss
at times but overall the software is
probably where Motorola sticks to its
roots than most these are intelligent
improvements that add to the smartphone
experience without crossing over into
intrusive bloatware Motorola didn't go
with the standard Google software for
the Moto X camera though instead of
returning for the third year to its
custom-built viewfinder app that means
you can easily launch the camera using
the double twist gesture one of our
favorite motox features since the
beginning but it's not always so
convenient if you're a fan of one-handed
shooting it can be really hard to change
settings or focus and exposure
on-the-fly and there are precious few
manual controls to help out in a
challenging situation also the pure
addition really seems to hate shooting
in 4k mode it slows the entire phone to
a crawl in the temperature skyrockets
it's literally a hot mess
fortunately the hardware makes it worth
it
the sensor here is a Sony IMX 230 that
maxes out at 21 megapixels and brings a
new and really quite good digital
stabilization package phase detection
autofocus makes it pretty easy to get a
clear shot and color reproduction is
significantly better than on last
generation Sony sensors like the one in
the Nexus 6 as with all smartphone
cameras this one is much happier in
broad daylight turn the lights down and
your photos start getting noisier grainy
er and what's just worse but again
that's par for the course
probably the biggest surprise for me
came in video testing where the new
sensor and stabilization work together
to make for some really excellent
footage thankfully the stuttering in the
viewfinder doesn't translate to the end
result the improvements have made their
way to the front side too with the
5-megapixel selfie cam now augmented by
an LED flash but I'm not a big fan of
this it washes out faces it doesn't work
in anything but the darkest rooms and
third party apps like Twitter and
snapchat can't yet access it because
it's so uncommon besides the camera does
just fine without the flash in most
circumstances anyway I find another
software enhancement much more
compelling the camera will now
automatically recognize bar codes QR
codes and business cards and let you
scan them right into your contact list
or copy em to your clipboard it's a
little on the slow side but there's no
switching modes or downloading apps or
fumbling with plugins it just works
right out of the box when you take the
useful features together with the newly
upgraded optics the pure addition
becomes the first moto X I'd actually
want to use for photography I've used
the pure edition for over a week in
Greater Boston and rural New York
predominantly on t-mobile us what's nice
about a phone marketed as compatible
with any network though is that
switching carriers is literally as easy
as swapping Sims at least when it comes
to GSM carriers the phone doesn't even
need a reboot it just registers on the
new network switches to another
pre-loaded APN set and poof it's like
it's always been an AT&amp;amp;T phone voice
quality is solid as well as we've come
to expect from Motorola and reception is
good too though if you're in a region
where band 12 support is a requisite be
sure to check out our full review linked
in the description below for more notes
on that
less impressive than voice quality or
reception is battery life a 3000
milliamp hour power pack is not enough
it seems to keep pace with all the Moto
X can do if I minimize how much I use
the phone and militantly police my app
activity I can get to the end of a day
with light to moderate use but even then
it's tough to hit 4 hours of screen on
time if on the other hand I use the
phone the way I want to which is to say
heavily the phone is dead in five hours
or less more detailed usage stats are in
the full review at pocket now on the
plus side the included 25 watt turbo
charger juices up the phone stupid fast
it still sucks to be a wall hugger but
at least with this charger you don't
have to be one for long finally general
performance on the Snapdragon 808
processor is very good even graphics
laden games run quite well and the twin
front firing speakers give you a face
full of sound while you play just hold
on tight and you're jerking the wheel a
lot while the silicon is grippy the Moto
X runs hot and under a load it gets hot
enough to get a good sweat film going on
your fingertips if you've been a fan of
the Moto X family since the beginning
the pure edition is only superficially
familiar instead of a smart yet humble
handheld it's a spec packed phablet it's
the antithesis of what the original Moto
X represented but not everyone as a
smartphone of philosophize ER and this
phone wasn't built for old timey
motorola fans it was built to turn
regular people into new ones like
Google's Nexus family the Moto X line
has evolved over time to mean something
different if you like what its evolved
into namely a husky handheld with smart
features and the power to keep up with
almost anything you can throw at it then
the Moto X pure edition is a really good
smartphone add in the class-leading
customizability and the fact that you
can buy it unlocked for way cheaper than
most of the competition and it becomes a
great smartphone
be sure to take in our full written
review at pocket now linked in the
description below until next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
and if you get a Moto X pure edition I
want to know about our tweet at me
captain to phone's captain the number
two phones thanks for watching we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
