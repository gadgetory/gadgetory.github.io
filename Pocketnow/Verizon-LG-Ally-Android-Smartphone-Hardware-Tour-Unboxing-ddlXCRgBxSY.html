calm and today we're going to be taking
a quick look at the LG ally android 2.1
smartphone on verizon wireless the
device retails for ninety-nine dollars
on verizon on contract and after a
mail-in rebate let's go ahead and in
this video we're going to go ahead and
do an unboxing take a quick tour around
the device and see some of the software
that's included so let's go ahead and
see what's inside the box inside the box
on top you do have the LG ally
smartphone it does have a sliding qrd
keyboard that is illuminated by a
backlight when you're using it in the
dark go ahead and set this aside for
just a moment also in the box you do
have a USB to micro USB charge and sync
cable along with a wall charger to
quickly think or to quickly charge your
device there's also a notice here to
give you instructions on how to remove
the back battery cover and into both in
English and Spanish along with some
product safety and warranty information
and a tips hints and shortcuts guide
let's go ahead and take a look at the
device itself the LG ally is a mid-range
smartphone that retails for ninety-nine
dollars but it does have some high-end
features such as the 3.2 inch tempered
glass touchscreen which is a nice touch
and also is a high resolution wvga touch
screen that's similar in resolution to
the larger 4.3 inch display of the
motorola droid x or even the 3.7 inch of
the droid incredible the device itself
has a the earpiece speaker here at the
top and on the bottom of the touch
screen you have two capacitive touch
buttons for the back and these search
buttons below that you do have the four
hardware buttons for the call send and
end buttons as well as the home and menu
button right underneath that you do have
the microphone port on the left hand
side of the device you do have the
volumes up in down button as well as the
microUSB port which is accessible
underneath a flap on the right hand side
of the device you do have the camera
shutter button here as well as a microSD
card slot which is
but without having to remove your back
battery cover or even the battery which
is a nice touch a 4 gigabyte card is
included in the device at the top you do
have a very clean design except for a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack although headphones are not
included inside the box you do have the
option of using any headphones you have
laying around the house here on the back
you have a 3.2 megapixel camera that can
shoot also video video recording is not
an HD resolution however which is
understandable for our budget phone and
you do have a dual LED flash on that can
serve as backlighting for your videos as
well so remove the back battery cover
all you have to do is push in and slide
up towards the camera and underneath you
do see that a fifteen hundred million
per hour battery is included to give you
ample of talktime and surf time on
verizon wireless's evdo rev a network
which is a nice touch the keyboard
offers a dedicated number row at the top
as well as three rows for the letters
the spacebar key is quenched in on the
bottom third row of the letter keys also
on the keyboard you do have buttons
shortcut buttons for the back search as
well as the home and menu button so you
have to reach up towards the screen to
access those features the keys offer an
island style chiclet keyboard layout
which does offer a nice tactile feedback
and a nice clicking mechanism so it is
comfortable to type on the edges of the
keys are beveled up the right side is
beveled up towards the right and the
left side is beveled up towards the left
here to give you a nice angle so that
your keys or your fingers don't slip off
of the keyboard there's also a
directional pad on the right hand side
which means that for summers you would
have to reach a little bit further over
with your right thumb to type on the
off-center keyboard as far as software
goes the device comes with both Android
2.1 and LG's custom software here LG did
include five home screens we
you can see as little bubbles here right
on top of the app drawer pull out along
with a number of widgets so here you
have the events widget which will give
you or show you events that are
happening for today or upcoming events
for the future and you can set that up
to sync with your calendar as well
there's also a clock and weather widget
which will give you the local time and
forecast as well as a widget for your
social networking needs on that will
separate Facebook feeds as well as
Twitter updates into two designated tabs
and it will show you all your status
updates once you configure your accounts
these are for software buttons here at
the bottom of the screen the nice part
about it is that it stays the same no
matter which home screen you're on or
even if you're in the app drawer so
you'll always have quick access to your
phone your address book messaging and
browser no matter what screen you're on
if you prefer the standard Android
layout you can go ahead and switch to
the android home screen which is
somewhat similar to the stock Android
build however LG did create five home
screens here you see four bubbles and
you're on the first home screen and it
shows you where you are how many home
screens you have towards your left and
towards your right which is a nice touch
with the home screen you can also add on
your LG widgets if you want and here we
see the facebook and twitter widget
again another high-end feature the
smartphone is that it does support Wi-Fi
b/g/n n protocols so you do have faster
Wi-Fi access as well as access to
verizon wireless's evdo rev a network so
you do have fast 3g and Wi-Fi access the
device has an accelerometer a light and
proximity sensor to adjust the screen or
turn off the screen when you're in a
dark room or on a phone call which is a
nice feature it does support Bluetooth
and bluetooth stereo as well as GPS you
can navigate on this device either with
google maps with navigation or you can
download verizon navigator on android
market so this has been a quick look of
the android 2.1 device the
LG ally on verizon wireless's evo
reveille network I'm Chung win for
