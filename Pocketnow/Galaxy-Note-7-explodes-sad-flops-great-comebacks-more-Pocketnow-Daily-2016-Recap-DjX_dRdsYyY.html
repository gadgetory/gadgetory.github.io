of exploding phones companies that were
once lost in oblivion or finally back to
smell the coffee and let's face it this
year was the year of flagship killers
I'm high Meadow Nevada and why don't we
round up the hottest and the not so hot
news of 2016 this is the best of the
worst of the pocket out daily let's make
in this video with a moment of silence
probably a fraction of a second for a
company that left us which is pebble
this is the company that didn't
necessarily start smart watches but i
feel that was the company that had the
best approach obviously this was a
kickstarter campaign there was a lot of
success a lot of problems when it came
to finances we really don't know exactly
what killed pebble what we do know is
that we are sad that Fitbit is not
continuing on the legacy oh well i was
willed to spotlight over to probably the
most unfair flop of 2016 which was the
LG g5 this phone was definitely too
early for its time sure it had terrible
build quality to a certain degree but
this was again because the phone was too
rushed still it was pretty much the
first smartphone with a great approach
dual cameras in addition to the phone
that pretty much started modularity
again so we are sad that the g5 was not
that great hopefully the g6 will pick up
where that one left off and if we had to
shift topics to the most polarizing the
price of 2016 it had to be pretty much
the new iPhones why because these were
probably the best iPhones ever I would
say that the boldest iPhones ever in
addition with the fact that we had the
dual cameras on the seven plus the
stereo speakers all that was great but
two things number one this was the first
year that I phones that not sell as
great as they did in the past the first
time that we've seen a decline in iphone
sales and number two apple for the love
of god what happened to the headphone
jack i feel that that had a lot to do
with the effects the fact that your
bravery wasn't really aren't necessarily
one of the best things to ever happen to
smartphones this year now let's talk
about the companies that make great
comebacks like blackberry surely the
company hasn't sold a great amount of
phones but adopting android was great
the fact that
pcl speaking of hardware is awesome we
love alcatel idol hardware and to see
that in BlackBerry's is awesome number
two the HTC approach surely the HTC 10
is not a great seller but it was one of
our favorite phones this year for a lot
of reasons the company is playing to the
right direction number three microsoft
my god microsoft is cool again the
company's approach the hardware
everything that's happening with
software this is the Microsoft that
we've been wanting to see for a decade
we cannot wait to see what comes in 2017
now 2016 was the year of the flagship
killers smartphones that aren't
necessarily premium mid Rangers but that
really put a dent on the smartphone
market when it comes to really affecting
black ships number one the one plus 3t
that was probably our favorite it was
everything you needed on a phone for a
very very good price tag the second
would pretty much be the huawei honor
ate my god that phone was a surprise and
we love its photography and design and
the price tag was amazing but probably
the biggest surprise was the ZTE exon 7
my god the sound on that phone is
awesome again the price tag was really
disruptive and yeah these are actually
phones that we would highly recommend
and finally the hottest news this year
both good and bad was the samsung galaxy
note 7 if this phone would not explode
this would currently be our favorite
smartphone of the year we had come to
that conclusion I really hated having to
return that phone why because it had
everything that I wanted great design
great build it had the S Pen which we
loved it took off Samsung's software
approach into something so much better
it's just so sad to see that the phone
sadly could not stay Samsung pretty much
paid the worst price ever and having to
recall the phone twice and it's really
just set to get on a plane all the time
and here if you have a galaxy note 7 you
cannot fly it is just terrible publicity
for the company and we feel really sad
because this is the Samsung that we
always wanted to see a company that
actually listen to its customers a
company that was extremely humble in its
approach to actually deal with every
users wanted we cannot wait to see what
will happen with the galaxy s lineup
next year and how they will fix
everything that happened with a note
lineup but it leads me to the question
of this video tell us what would you
consider to be the best in the worst of
2016 again in my case rest in peace
galaxy note 7 I wish I could have kept
