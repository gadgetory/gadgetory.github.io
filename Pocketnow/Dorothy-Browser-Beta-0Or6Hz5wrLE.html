partner calm and today I machine new
internet browser called Dorothy browser
for your windows moldavite still go into
that and the browser is a beta browser
and it works actually pretty well for
just browsing around online it does not
include flash so such websites such as
YouTube don't work too well so we'll
just go to a couple websites real fast
ok so I'm just going to go to paki naw
Kham to show you that ok so now I'll
just load the page I'll wait for it to
load now this is on a Wi-Fi network so
it will probably load a little bit
faster than on a cell phone network ok
so here we have the page fully loaded
and we can just scroll through it
actually blows pretty well now it
doesn't do the type scroll like their
foot scroll where you can just take your
finger and flick it down the page will
continually move like on Opera Mobile
this one you actually have to move
independently like with your finger so
if I just click on something I have to
drag it and scroll it it's a little
annoying and but in the same sense is
also good because you're able just to
scroll what you want to scroll and I can
zoom in on pages stuff wanted to I could
zoom all the way and it doesn't go too
far like other web browsers but it does
go pretty good you can actually read
things on here now I can zoom out and
because this is a beta program some of
the settings don't work as you can see
the the star here for favorites like I'm
not able to add favorites so that's
pretty annoying I can also click home
which will take me to a Korean website
and click on some of the settings but
unfortunately none of these seem to be
working right now as well ok so now I'm
just going to go to an acid three tests
so I'm just going to type into Google
search for acid three ok so here I have
a link to the acid three tests so I'm
going to load that and see how what that
acid three test score on this browser is
so just zoom out a little bit ok so
right now i'm running the acid three
tests and what this test is going to do
is
see how well the internet browser words
on the internet so if it gets a 100 out
of 100 score that means that it will
load almost every page out there and has
internet security and all that great
stuff so it's scored a 91 out of 100 so
not too bad I mean a little bit better
than some of the browsers out there so
this is Dorothy browser beta and i will
post a link in park and other comments
how to get this the program is free at
this time thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
