best Android phones on the market today
but maybe it's too big or too expensive
for you and that's why HTC announced the
HTC One mini we're unboxing it right now
let's go check it out yes you've guessed
it this is the HTC One mini and these
are the obligatory scissors this time
scissors version 2.0 since we have a
hunch that the HTC One mini and the HTC
One have a lot in common we strongly
encourage you to check out the full
review over at PocketNow and also
subscribe to our social media channels
to stay up to date while we open up this
package we'll try to get into HTC's head
for a bit and think of the reasons
behind the HTC One mini it is an
alternative to the HTC One flagship
which might be either too big or too
expensive for some and let's not forget
since the one directly competes with the
samsung galaxy s4 the one mini will
continue the tradition and try to beat
the galaxy s4 mini
which we also relieved on pocket now so
here's the box and it's a generic box
pre-production slash demo box your
unboxing experience will definitely vary
once you get this film from your store
or carrier the contents of the box
shouldn't be too different though so
let's dive in and see what's inside
there's the film itself which will place
the decide use for a little bit and see
what else is bundled no literature which
is good but there will be definitely
some pros in the final retail packaging
there's a charger this time with a
European plug there's also the
obligatory USB cable for syncing and
charging and a pair of headphones
apparently these look similar to those
bundled with the HTC One and those
sounded exceptionally well we'll see if
they're the same or not there are also
some different size gels for your in ear
canal drivers there's no battery inside
the box as the pack is not user
replaceable enough of that let's take a
look at the phone itself sorry folks no
special screen protector billing cam
mode as apparently the plastic on this
phone is a sleeve like plastic however
here it is this is the HTC One mini
we can tell you straight from the
beginning that this phone feels
substantial like 122 grams substantial
not heavy but premium and that weight
certainly adds to the experience
generated by the call to the touch
aluminum and while we're here let's take
a look at the one mini side-by-side with
the one it's this much shorter five
point four millimeters to be specific in
terms of thickness they're the same the
back features the same aluminum
construction camera placement and all
let's take a look around the device on
the top we have the main speakers with
an LED notification tucked behind the
speaker grille to the left there's a 1.6
megapixel camera and to the right you've
got your sensors below you'll find the
4.3 inch display with 720p resolution
and a pixel density of 342 on the bottom
there's the HTC logo which just like in
the ones case is not a button with the
back and home capacitive buttons on its
side further down there's your secondary
speaker which together with the top one
is part of HTC's boomsound which will
extensively compare to the one on the
HTC one the left sports the Micro SIM
card slot and nothing else the top has
the power button which no longer doubles
as an IR blaster 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack primary microphone on the
bottom alongside with a USB port volume
rockers on the right side also slightly
tweaked different from the HTC One the
back has a secondary microphone the four
megapixel air quotes ultra pixel camera
with flash HTC logo as well as Beats
Audio cooled out no longer in color
let's size it up against some other
phones we'll start with the HTC One and
we'll add the samsung galaxy s4 this is
the samsung galaxy s4 zoom but in terms
of size it's about the same at least the
front as the s4 mini the One Mini's
direct competitor this is how they
compare but there's no use to compare
thickness since this is the zoom adding
more devices Nakia Lumia 925 Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 and the iPhone 5
interestingly the iPhone 5 is still
smaller than the HTC One mini while
we're booting up let's recap the specs
the processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon
400 CPU with two cores clocked at 1.4
gigahertz helped by one gig of ram
internal storage is 16 gigabytes and the
4 megapixel ultrapixel camera alongside
boomsound is also in there's an 1800
milliamp power battery which is non user
replaceable LTE support and the platform
of choice is Android 4.2.2 with HTC
Sense on top of it
color options include silver which is
the unit we have here and stealth black
everyone is gonna do it for today for
the HTC One mini unboxing but stay tuned
to pocket now we have a lot more coming
including comparisons and the full
review you can follow me on Facebook as
