getting an ipad 5 next week so many
schedules of president focused on mobile
and google is now offering the stock
android keyboard to everyone I'm hi Mary
Vanna wondering why Google allowed us to
be tortured for so long and this is
parking out daily let's start a day off
with some Nokia EOS rumors yesterday we
were kind of taken back because the
photos that we saw were kind of fake and
still we get some more photos today and
apparently the device is real you are
getting a Nokia Lumia 920 design with a
big camera hump at the back then we
wonder if it's replaceable at some point
but anyways real or fake leave us a
comment down below do you believe that
it's real or not on the other hand sony
has just sent out press invitations for
an event to happen in germany on jun
25th and apparently it'll be focused on
mobile so think about it we've got WWDC
happening on monday then we've got a
sansa event in london happening on June
twentieth and now we've got a mobile
have been happening in Germany on the
25th for Sony the question is what are
we getting here could it'd probably be
that we are getting the Sony phablet
that's been rumored stay tuned for that
moving over to google the company has
just made the bold move of offering
their stock android keyboard to the
masses it's being called the google
keyboard on the Google Play Store it's
for free as of today we know that a lot
of you have been in the dark with some
terrible keyboards from some OEM so you
can get it today but it's being blocked
for some countries apparently so make
sure you hit the links in the
description as we've got the apk's for
you to be able to download it now let's
shift the focus over to Apple as the
company seems serious about doing in
store repairs within their Apple stores
we now see leaked photos of the
calibration tool that they're using
after they fix your display within the
genius bar now an interesting notice
that apparently the company is also
working on a trade-in program and this
is much better because instead of having
to ship your phone to a company and get
the price for the phone you'll be
getting it right there at the Genius Bar
they'll tell you how much the phone is
worth and what options you have I would
obviously remember the days when I just
got a free swap but still this is much
better than the customer service that
you get from other companies where you
pretty much have to end up without a
phone for a week and finally for the hot
news of the day you know it's no secret
that almost every
engel iPad design has been leaked by
case makers they know how the products
going to look like and they also know
when it's going to be released and
according to case maker heart candy the
ipad 5 is ready to be announced at WWDC
meaning that if you want to get an ipad
most probably it'll be best for you to
hold on to see what happens on Monday in
ww DC's president is apparently we will
be getting this device announced but
that leads you to the question of the
day are you holding out for an ipad 5
are you shopping in the market right now
for an iPad and you're hoping that the
ipad 5 is your solution in my particular
case I'll be honest with you I'll take
anything from Apple right now that's not
the ipad mini i really want to get rid
of it so leave us a comment down below
do you want to swap your current ipad do
you want to get this ipad 5 what are you
waiting for leave us a comment of course
it's always for another scoop of
everything that's happening in a
smartphone and tablet will make sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com subscribe to
our youtube channel as well you can also
follow me on twitter Jaime underscored
