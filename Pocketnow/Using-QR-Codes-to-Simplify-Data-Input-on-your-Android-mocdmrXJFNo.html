today I've got a question for you do you
remember way back in the day of the
early Windows Mobile's and even the palm
devices they had an IR port or an
infrared port was really neat you could
squirt that's their term not mine you
could send information from one device
over to another device like business
cards documents to-do lists
calendar appointments all kinds of stuff
but then the IR ports kind of went away
Bluetooth became vogue but you really
didn't have the same sharing abilities
with Bluetooth that we were really
promised when Bluetooth was first being
talked about so today I'd like to show
you the next best thing or maybe even
better on your Android it's sharing
information using QR codes let's go look
okay so first of all what are QR codes
well QR is an acronym it stands for
quick response but generally they're
just two-dimensional barcodes that
contain information textual based
information and then through various
different barcode scanners that textual
information can be translated into
readable text or understandable text so
what I'd like to do is show you a app
today called a barcode scanner now this
app is by zebra crossing or Zi Xing
depending on how you want to pronounce
it it's based on a set of libraries
that's hosted by Google so let's open it
up what you'll see is a little Knight
Rider style flashing red bar and before
I show you what this does I want to show
you what a QR code looks like so right
there that's a plaintext barcode in
other words it's a two dimensional code
data is encoded both that way and that
way so that's two dimensions UPC symbols
for example are one dimensional code
they only contain information
horizontally not horizontally and
vertically
so what plaintext does
code contain well let's take a look
we're going to see if I can find it my
viewfinder and right there says it found
plain text the text in this is hello
world and now I can do various different
things I can do a web search I can share
this by email or I can share it by SMS
now that's not a feature of the barcode
that's a feature of this app but in the
barcode itself it says hello world next
let's do something a little bit more
usable and that would be an SMS code if
you want somebody to be able to send you
a text message for example like American
Idol if you want to send a text to vote
for a particular candidate you can
encode that text message in a barcode so
that people just have to hold their
phone up to scan it and there you go
it will automatically compose the text
address it and send it off on its way so
let's see what this one does now this is
normally a little bit faster but I have
to hold it just right for the camera to
be able to pick it up and there you go
it found an SMS address in this case the
SMS was one two three four five
obviously that's not gonna go anywhere
useful but you can see how right here I
can send an SMS or send an MMS pretty
simple let's do something that's a
little bit more user friendly for normal
people like you and me and that would be
a phone number let's say you're a
business and you want someone to call
you
you run a sandwich shop and you want
somebody to call in an order no problem
you print this barcode on your material
you say scan to call and let's go ahead
and do that right there immediately
found a phone number that phone number
happens to be my Google Voice number so
anybody who wants to call me I guess
they can now now this app will let you
not only dial that
it'll also let you add it as a contact
so that's really nice next let's do
something even cooler geolocation what
if you've got that sandwich shop but
nobody knows where it is well you can
gon code your latitude and longitude
into a QR code and then just as easy as
scanning that phone number we can scan
geographic coordinates now from here we
can show it on a map and we can even get
directions
really cool stuff next a URI the
universal resource indicator some people
call this a URL it's a web address very
simple now you'll notice compared to
these other codes there's an awful lot
more data in this code you can tell that
because the dots are a lot smaller
that's one good thing about you are
codes there's redundancy of data so even
if the barcode gets damaged or some of
its missing chances are it'll still be
recognizable you can have up to 30%
redundancy in your code so that's really
neat so let's scan and this URL and see
what happens right there you can see
it's got a URL to my website and this is
actually a link to my daughter playing
the piano kind of cool it could also be
a link to your menu if you're running
that sandwich shop but let's say in your
sandwich shop you've got a an Android
app so you can go ahead and assemble
your sandwich virtually and then send in
your order so all you got to do is
submit it and they'll have your sandwich
ready and waiting for you well to do
that you might want to advertise your
sandwich app that you can get from the
Android Market well to do that just make
a market app barcode and right there a
different URL this time market colon
slash slash search question mark Q
equals blah blah blah blah blah now what
this does is it's a very specific URL
that your phone your Android phone
understands so you can open your browser
and it will read that URL and reader
do over to the Android Market and from
there you can choose to install the app
so again really cool next you've got an
email you want to send me an email
great imagine putting this on your
business card email me here of course an
email address is pretty quick pretty
simple but when you put it into a code
look at that
not only do I have my email address but
I can also embed a comment now
unfortunately the Gmail client doesn't
read those comments and pass it on to
the email but we're hoping sometime in
the future they will you can add this as
a contact or send an email right there
but that's just touching on the real
potential so what I'd like to do is show
you over here on this other Android
phone this is my contact information on
a g1 and I've got that same barcode app
installed now from here I can go to menu
and I can show barcode now in the
Android 2.1 version of this app you do
it via share but on this version for 1.6
it's show barcode so we'll do that and
right now it's generating a barcode and
you can see it's pretty heavy it's got
all of my information right there in it
so let's go ahead and scan it see if I
can get far enough away from it to focus
and right there just like that I was
able to immediately scan that barcode it
found my contact information my name my
address my phone number all that stuff
I'm gonna now it get away from from here
I can add that as a contact show it on a
map my address dial the phone number
right away or even send an email that's
really really cool to be able to go and
send your contact information just like
that now here's what's cooler and this
goes back to the IR port that I hinted
at in the introduction before I could
share this or squirt it via infrared
over to another device but it was
usually you know device to device they
both had to be Android devices they both
had to be Windows devices it didn't work
when you were trying to go from palm to
Windows Mobile or
Pocket PC back then it didn't work well
at all and that was because each device
handles things a little bit differently
specifically that infrared signal well
in that infrared signal you could encode
all kinds of stuff but unless you had
that translation you can do it so people
came up with translation apps to be able
to send data from one device over to
another device here we don't have IR
ports
anymore they've kind of gone away and
believe it or not they're they're making
a comeback to be able to control TVs and
whatnot but I can take this information
from this Nexus One and put it over on
this g1 right there or vice versa or if
I've got an iPhone I can use a similar
type of app and I can still get that the
nice thing is all of these QR codes are
standards-based and they're coming up
with new standards all the time but it's
just data the phone interprets what to
do with it which is kind of cool so now
I can present information it doesn't
even have to be on a phone that can be
read by a phone that has a camera and
let's face it most phones have cameras
today so one last thing that I want to
show you and let's go ahead and use this
I don't know let's use this URL okay now
I've just shown you one app that can do
this let me come over here and show you
the goggles app which does things a
little bit differently now I'm gonna
come in here and I'm going to prop this
just so it recognizes that now you'll
notice it's not doing any active
scanning at all so if I take a picture
it's going to take that picture and now
it's going to scan it this takes a
little bit more time and it kind of uses
a Google search result so you can see
it's got the barcode that it just read
and then web results which is kind of
neat and then other matches similar
images and it lets me rate these results
well that was perfect so I'm going to go
ahead and mark
five stars so just like that you can
scan using Google Goggles one last thing
that I'd like to show you and I don't
have a barcode to illustrate this but I
do want to show you the app because it
does basically the same thing that's
Microsoft tag reader and you can kind of
see not that app you can kind of see the
the way that the barcode looks it's a
little bit more basic than a QR code in
a QR code the more information you
encode the more complex it gets so an
email versus a URI for example URI has
much more data it's harder to read well
with Microsoft tag all of the codes are
exactly the same length at least as far
as I understand what they do is when you
scan that code it goes through it reads
it and it sends that off to their web
server where it resolves what that code
is now that lets you do and this is
obviously isn't a Microsoft QR or
Microsoft tag code rather but you kind
of get the idea it's going to then
connect to the internet and figure out
what that code means and then come back
with the data so the data is not
actually in the code the code is just a
reference to a place on the web where
the data is that lets you get some
analytics to know how many times people
are actually scanning your code but if
they're offline or have poor coverage or
worse yet if they don't have the tag
reader software on their phone they're
not going to be able to resolve that
that's really why I like the barcode
scanner app again by Zi Xing or zebra
crossing it's a free app in the
marketplace and it can scan all kinds of
codes from one decodes to 2d QR codes
and several other that I didn't even
talk about so go ahead and give it a
shot I'd like to see what kind of QR
codes you can come up with in fact if
you want to head over to Joe Levi comm
you can check out an article that I have
basically tells you how to create your
own QR codes using the Google charts API
so take a look at that and tell me what
kind
stuff you'd like to know the one thing
that I couldn't find and if there's
anybody out there who can find it please
let me know there's one format that I'd
really like to see and that is an iCal
format or an event a calendar event I
want to be able to scan a code and have
all the calendar information the title
of it the date and time that it starts
the date and time that it ends the
geolocation where it is some notes about
what it is I'd like to be able to just
scan that with my camera put it into my
calendar and be done with it
but I couldn't find that standard out
there so if you know where that is
please leave me some comments down in
the bottom better yet share with me a QR
code that will let me do that so really
cool stuff again talking QR codes and
the barcode scanner app for Android I am
