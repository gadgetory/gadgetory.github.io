took the wraps off of a new version of
iOS and now that we've got this beta
preview loaded on a phone let's take a
quick tour of what's new in iOS 10 this
is a pretty substantial update looking
at streamlining the user interface while
expanding functionality services are key
and a lot of attention has been paid to
those interactions starting off with the
lockscreen the complaint that touch ID
was too fast has been addressed with a
gesture picking an iphone up will now
light up the screen holding an iphone in
your hand prompts the screen pretty
aggressively it's a bit twitchy but at
least it doesn't seem to activate as
readily when in a pants pocket new from
the lockscreen is an easy way to
interact with the camera and widgets a
slide to the left delivers quick
bite-sized pieces of info you might be
interested in or the ability to write
out messages and replies without having
to transfer to a full app a slide to the
right is the new quick launch for the
camera which works a bit easier than the
old camera icon swipe from previous
versions of iOS once in your home
screens you'll quickly see a new control
center when sliding up from the bottom
of the screen it's a clean layout though
it would still be nice to have a bit
more info here like detailing which
Wi-Fi network you're connected to and
sliding to the side here you get a
dedicated control area for Apple music
and later once homekit is integrated
you'll be able to control internet
connected devices in your house from
here as well alerts can be cleared from
your notification tray with the forced
press but once you push in it will clear
the notification we can't find any way
to back out and preserve the
notification once the pressure pop has
been completed when typing Siri learning
intelligence is now being applied and
the keyboard will offer smarter
suggestions over time including better
support for phrases and full replies
this information will tie into location
data so when asked where are you you can
organically reply with map information
with one button press photos gets an
overhaul the app better organizes
individual photos and videos
categorizing selfies panoramas and slow
motion videos the app will also sort by
date and location this app will scan for
numerous subjects facial-recognition
animals and scenery filtering and
scanning happens on device so searches
should happen
quickly when looking for specific shots
new for this Photos app memories will
automatically sort photos by trips date
people or topics and the app will pool
those photos and videos together to
create short shareable movies the new
Maps app adds the ability to pan and
zoom during navigation and adds traffic
information to the mix the entire
interface has been improved for
delivering info on restaurants and other
points of interest as developers support
this update we'll also have direct
integration with third-party apps you'll
be able to find a restaurant reserved a
table and schedule and uber all without
leaving the maps app the music app is
all new and also receives a major
overhaul focusing on really easy
navigation big bold categories help move
you around what you're currently playing
browse and radio tabs make content
discovery more fun to explore and here
you can find cultivated playlists from
famous people there is an option for
displaying lyrics but if most of your
music collection with CD ripped or
required from another service not only
will you not have access to lyrics you
probably won't even get album art news
also get to touch up following the style
of music but focused on a magazine
layout for top stories subscriptions to
popular outlets like time or The Wall
Street Journal will show up in this feed
alongside cultivated stories from
traditional periodicals and web
resources now messages gets a massive
makeover and was maybe the most focused
on service during the WWDC keynote rich
links display content directly in feed
providing the ability to watch video
directly from a chat or share an Apple
music link directly within this
interface ascending photo seamlessly
integrates the camera app into the chat
interface even giving you a live preview
from the photo options you can convey
tone now with options for individual
message modes like loud and quiet or
play it coy with some invisible ink or
you can blow up the whole screen with
balloons or a laser lightshow emoji are
bigger and as mentioned before the
keyboard is proactive in serving picture
options up for you while you're typing
and for that personal touch you can just
write something on the screen if you
want to do that too it's a big playful
update for people who like to
communicate through iMessage updates to
the phone app were a little bit more
subtle voicemail transcription will be
coming to the eye
phone but we currently have issues
setting up a voicemail box and the new
phone app will also better integrate
with third-party services like Skype to
provide an interface for VoIP calls that
looks more like regular calling
lastly Apple discussed a new approach
for homekit where one app on an iPhone
will be able to interact with equipment
from several different manufacturers
with support baked right in from the
companies involved in home construction
we'll have more to show on this once
this feature is better supported but
it's a tantalizing
early glimpse into home automation with
an easy hub approach from a single app
on your phone which can interact
directly with Siri for automated and
voice controls it's a big step for Apple
this iOS update brings a lot of
functionality to the table catches Apple
up in a couple of key areas and polishes
up the look of a few services which were
falling behind for a beta it's currently
running well on both an iPhone 6s and
iPhone se though the latter obviously
lacks support for some of the 3d touch
gestures and some options in messaging
are achieved through long presses rather
than peaks and pops we'd still caution
against using beta software on a
mission-critical daily driver phone but
this is already shaping up to be a solid
update for the Apple ecosystem be sure

full coverage of iOS 10 and hit that
thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos back now you can chat me
up on Twitter and Instagram and some
gadget guy and I will catch you all on
the next video
