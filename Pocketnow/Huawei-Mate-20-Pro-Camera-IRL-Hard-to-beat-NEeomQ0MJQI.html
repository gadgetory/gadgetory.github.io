am not back in April we decided to start
a new video series because of the Huawei
P 20 Pro the changes in the camera were
so significant that the only way to
review it properly was to have a
separate video just for the camera
features alone but even though the video
served its purpose and we learned that
the camera was great we also learned
that there was room for improvement even
with all of its spec sheets and now that
we've got a new kit in town with a
couple of extra changes how about if we
do this one more time I'm primarily that
of a pocket now and let's see what the
huawei mate xx pro can do from the
beautiful Taiwan
so curly in a sector called gel fen
which is famous for its historical
gold-mining and once again a disclaimer
this is not a full review that is going
to be a separate video mainly because
one more time the features on this
camera are so significant that in one
video is not enough Rebecca in Taipei in
our hotel and just to give you a
preamble we crowned the Huawei P 20 pro
as one of the best cameras of early this
year mainly because not just the va's
software capabilities but because of all
the hardware that was included in the
package now I guess I honestly have to
give that title to the huawei mate 20
pro mainly because you've got the
hardware you've got the software but
then there are some added enhancements
that I really love Huawei dubs that it's
thinking lense tuned by lenka we still
have three cameras but they now have
some added functionality the primary
shooters of a whopping 40 megapixels @f
1.8 aperture and a 27 millimeter
equivalent with an interesting play of
pixel binning that merges four pixels
into one to provide you with more light
in a 10 megapixel shot by default but
that you can switch to 40 megapixels as
an option the second is the return of an
8 megapixel telephoto at F 2.4 ampere
and an 80 millimeter equivalent and the
new addition of a 20 megapixel
wide-angle camera at F 2.2 instead of
the monochrome with a 16 millimeter
equivalent i've always said that if one
company could figure out a way to
provide all three angles regular wide
and telephoto in one module i would be
sold and this is it but let's also
praise this module i love this design it
is completely unique and I love how the
flash just complements the whole array
probably one of my favorite things about
this phone there's also a strong play of
software here with Huawei's new master
AI 2.0 in the past scene detection would
focus mainly on objects or lighting now
the camera is able to detect when using
wide-angle cameras more convenient or
when a super macro would also help you
get a better shot there's also the
addition of other AI enhancements like
4d predict the focus object recognition
active tracking of subjects in real time
etc so now that we've covered the added
functionality of the camera in addition
to the more mature software how are the
photos in a word I would call them
fantastic one of the things that I
really liked about the May 10 Pro that I
thought was missing about the p20 Pro
was that like a approach of more
true-to-life photos where even grain is
a feature the May 20 Pro is more subtle
about saturation more balanced about its
use of color and less aggressive about
sharpening I know the phrase of a phone
mimicking a DSLR gets tossed around a
lot but if you're accustomed to using
Panasonic's which also collaborate with
Leica the photos on the May 20 Pro are
pretty darn close but with the added
functionality that mirrorless cameras
aren't really smart about what they see
they only meet her and shoot while the
main 20 Pro adapts to what it sees and
boosts the results where it should there
are also some additional modes in scene
detection being added to AI like for
example we're currently at the golden
waterfall in Taipei and the phone
detects that there is a waterfall and
adapts absolutely everything to take the
better shot and then we've got the
advantage of how the other camera lenses
complement the experience of photography
most people question things like the
need for a telephoto lens for example
sure it's good for zooming into subjects
but their best use in my opinion is for
street photography the crop serves to
help you feel that sort of postcard
effect but almost feels like if you were
there
I'm a 20 protocol zoom and 5x hybrid
zoom in up to 10x though that's more
digital and this is seriously still the
camera that I trust for zoom photography
I feel that this is the only case where
you get true detail and yes sadly the
monochrome sensor is no more if you want
to take black-and-white photos there is
a mode within the settings to enable
monochrome photos but this is pretty
much a filter that being said I feel
that making the trade-off for a
wide-angle camera is worth it in every
way see the wide-angle camera serves two
purposes
first at 0.6 X you can take a wider shot
which is a more epic photo in certain
sceneries in most cases AI will detect
when widest more recommended but I love
that it won't adjust unless you accept a
switch and then the second purpose is
probably my favorite which is super
macro where you can get as close as 2.5
centimeters from your subject and take
some really awesome close-up shots it's
very hard to find this functionality on
a phone but if you want to get into the
truly epic conversation let's talk about
night mode well it continues to impress
with its way to allow users to take long
exposure shots and stitch together the
best parts if you can hold the phone
still you might not notice much of a
difference between the regular photo and
the night mode and that's mainly because
the phone will select the first photo
this is great because you know you're
still getting a good shot regardless of
you held the phone still or not but for
those times when you were able to do a
good job at holding it still this phone
can really push out light out of a scene
up to the point where there are certain
cases where the result looks so real
I've noticed that whenever I don't
enable night mode some of the photos
result that's pretty much whatever my
eyes see portrait mode is interesting
you don't really have the flexibility to
edit a photo after you've taken it but I
kind of don't think that you'll actually
want to do that
I have this photo of my kids that I show
everyone where we have a backlit
scenario the light was dim and Wow
the photo is probably one of my
favorites of all time I won't sit here
and tell you that the effect is the most
natural but it does work really well and
it has the advantage that you don't
really have to step back to get your
shot there are some optional lighting
scenarios and gimmicks available but you
know I stay away from those and well our
experience filming this outside was cut
short because it's raining and beautiful
Taipei but let's talk about another
important feature which is definitely
the selfie camera as well the specs here
are fantastic we're talking about a 24
megapixel shooter at F 2.0 aperture and
a 26 millimeter equivalent photos are
good and I love that Huawei now has a
setting for HDR on the viewfinder as one
of the most common problems with selfies
are blown out backgrounds as the camera
meters for you and not for the
background I won't say that the results
are the best and even if you've got all
the def sensing technology to allow for
really good selfie portraits at the
moment it kind of seems like if
something's missing because I don't
really notice much of a difference
between selfie portraits and regular
shots but it could just be my unit video
recording has received some very
significant improvements if you compare
the May 20 Pro with the P 20 Pro I have
a full separate video about my
experience vlogging with this phone
during the Porsche experience of the
made 20 RS and in a nutshell we now have
stabilization in 4k and pretty much
every other mode there's also
stabilization with selfie video and I
like that the crop is not so aggressive
to achieve it and then probably some of
my favorite enhancements have to do with
the filters where you can play sort of
like the same effect that you see in Sin
City where you select the specific
portion of the video and in real time
it'll only color specific portions of
the video and the rest will be in black
and white and then there is the benefit
of the larger sensor I took this video
in London where the sensor allows this
amazing shallow depth of field and video
but the only thing that I feel could
improve is the codec as video seems a
bit over sharpened or overexposed in
certain scenarios but I do believe that
it has everything to do with
fact that I recorded almost everything
in a gloomy scenario and not necessarily
with the best lighting overall what can
I say the huawei mate 20 Pro is really
hard to beat when it comes to
photography the hardware is here up to
the point where it's really hard to find
all this package somewhere else and we
also have an interesting play of
software and sure not everything is
perfect but the huawei p20 Pro is proof
that the company could update the phone
and make it really good a lot of the
bugs that I complained about are ironed
out right now so definitely it's really
hard for me not to recommend the huawei
mate 20 Pro this is pretty much one of
my favorite picks as one of the best
smartphones of 2018 I mean you've got
the photography and this sleek design
just makes it really hard to beat let us
