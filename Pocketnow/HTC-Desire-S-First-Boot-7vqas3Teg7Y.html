we've got our hands on the HTC Desire s
courtesy of Negri electronics our good
friends over there have hooked us up and
we'd like to show you now the first boot
and initial software impressions of this
uber-cool device let's go take a look
ok so in our last video we went through
a hardware walk through the device in
this video I have put in my SIM card and
I've also put in my micro SDHC card
which is a 16 gig card it comes with an
8 gig and I just do that to make it
easier for me to keep all of my stuff on
my device so that we don't end up
sending back pictures of my little kids
and whatnot to whoever we got our review
device from and of course FCC notice
this is courtesy of Negri electronics if
you want to get your hands on one of
these unlock devices you'll want to go
over and visit their website we'll have
links and pricing and all of that in the
review so make sure you go over and
visit those guys but this is a limited
evaluation unit courtesy of them so FCC
is now happy that we've included that
disclaimer now even notice it booted up
relatively quickly for a first boot and
now we're presented with the HTC Sense
UI so going through connecting with my
carrier says I've got full bars and
about half a battery life it also picked
up the date and time and the carrier
name while we were talking so let's go
ahead and slide that down to unlock and
we're then presented with the rest of
the boot sequence now this is something
that you've seen before with other HTC
Sense UI devices and I don't expect that
it's going to be all that much different
in fact I don't think that there's a new
sense version on the device but that
could be wrong and we'll see here in
just a little bit while it's booting up
let me go over some specs this is the
Model S 5 10 e it's clocked at 1
gigahertz it is running with 1.1
gigabytes of internal storage and 768
megabytes of RAM which is a very very
good deal of RAM that's quite
substantial on the smart phone
size and weight we're gonna have over on
pocketnow.com the display is nine point
four centimeters which will have inches
for those of you over in the states as
well
does have GPS inside it works with HSPA
WCDMA on nine hundred and twenty one
hundred megahertz uses gsm/gprs and edge
using 850 900 1800 and 1900 so nice quad
band phone there and we're still waiting
on the initial boot here so i'm just
gonna keep going on with the specs we're
really quickly we do have bluetooth 2.1
which has a two DP for all of your
stereo bluetooth so you can listen to
your music and whatnot in stereo if
you've got an a 2 DP compatible headset
of course it also has the ftp profiles
and some other stuff
Wi-Fi is 802 11 B G and n we're gonna go
ahead and pause that for just a moment
and we're gonna try and choose where is
my English Austria Switzerland Germany C
we don't have a US or a UK from the
looks and things unless I'm going past
it so what flavor of English do we want
well my wife is she was born in Germany
so let's choose German say next
on-screen keyboard it gives us a little
tutorial wants us to type simple so nice
little tutorial if I can learn how to
type and it's showing me how to use the
auto correct as well that's what I typed
that's what they suggest okay so we'll
hit the spacebar kind of nice that they
have that you know I'm probably just
gonna load up if this were my personal
device probably just gonna load up swipe
so that'll be kind of nice now you'll
notice over here I've got a download
prompt and it says that I'm on edge
which I can't pull that down because
I've still in the set up I'm gonna go
ahead and skip rather than transfer my
stuff over I'm gonna tell it to use my
mobile network or my Wi-Fi rather than
Wi-Fi only so so far it's the same setup
process that you've seen before I'm
gonna tell it to automatically sync
which is the
default will go to next I'm going to
choose my Wi-Fi access point and I'm
gonna put my key in off-camera and then
we'll go ahead and connect and that's
going out connecting to my access point
which is a buffalo access point about 20
25 feet away
so as I'm connected so that is all good
and this is an 802 11 in network and an
802 11 in capable phone defaults here to
allow Google location service to get
anonymous location data about me and to
use my location for Google searches and
other Google services just like we've
seen before so go ahead and agree to
that I'm not going to set up any
accounts here and well other than Google
I'm gonna go ahead and set up my Google
account which you've seen before so
let's go ahead and sign in and I'm going
to do that off-camera as well and if I
typed my username and password in which
I did if I did that correctly it's gonna
take me to the backup and restore and
ask me if I want to keep this device
backed up with my Google account which
is checked I'm going to say next
that also is what's going to let me get
all of my other wireless access point
configurations transferred down to the
device as well as all of my google apps
so it says that everything's good there
I'm going to finish my setup I don't
want to add anything else at this time
so we'll finish that I'm back to the
nice htc screen just for a moment and
then it's setting up based on the
information that I provided in that
setup wizard it's going through and
configuring my home screens and more
particularly the HTC Sense widgets so if
I have provided my Facebook and Twitter
and other information there it would
have automatically pulled that in and
configured that as well okay of course I
have tips I've got the nice animated
clock all that fun stuff you can come in
here and customize things it's in
Mountain Time which I am I see if I
remember how to change this my local
settings it's automatic 24-hour clock
that's good I'm gonna change my date
format because over here we use that
format so all kinds of good now of
course I'm gonna go through and
customize this some more
obviously I'm not in a Celsius
environment so six degrees isn't telling
me too much low for a while that's
getting down there freezing but from
here
it's basically want you to already
expect it's an HTC Sense UI experience
the device is very very responsive I
like it it's what you would expect with
a sense interface so make sure you stay
tuned to what we're going to find in the
upcoming videos we want to check out the
camera which I'm not gonna do today
because it is overcast and rainy which
we're gonna see right there complete
with the windshield wiper so very
accurate regarding that it is in fact
raining tomorrow maybe worse well
tomorrow may be good but Thursday may be
worse that says that we might have snow
so all kinds of fun overall very
impressed it's the same process that
you've seen in the past not too much
different to see yet but of course as I
come across things I will let you know
and we do have a more complete Wow it
even pulled across my wallpaper that was
a custom wallpaper from my my custom
skin on my g2 that's really impressive
and I haven't seen that before so Wow
way to go Google anyway back to the
video I'm going to use this as my daily
driver for the next week or so and I'm
going to run it through all of my tests
and really beat it up and see if I can
get everything that I need to out of it
and make a good kind of informed
educated review for you I am gonna run
through some benchmarking although it
looks like I'm not going to be able to
get 3G speeds so we'll probably just put
a footnote in there about that even
though it is capable of at HSPA and I am
in an HSPA area it doesn't look like it
has the right bands for me but that
having been said make sure you subscribe
to our video channel so you can see the
upcoming videos all about the HTC Desire
s and what we think about it if you
haven't yet gone over to pocketnow.com
you'll want to do that so you can see
the specifications that we mentioned
earlier and
get the full review of this in the
coming days so very cool I'm excited to
tell you about it if you have any
questions you'd like me to address in my
reviews make sure you leave the comments
down below and I'll do my best to cover
everybody showing off cool new phones
for pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
