first so we may as well be last and know
something i'm michael fisher with pocket
now here with your long awaited unboxing
of the google nexus 6 as you might
expect the new Nexus phone packaging
looks a lot like the new nexus tablets
but hold this box next to almost any
other smartphone box and you know right
away that you're in for something big
and I'm not talking about storage
options here popping the seal on this
packaging reveals a tiny dissimilarity
between this phone and the last high-end
Android built by motorola unlike the
Moto X the Nexus 6 ships face up and its
packaging that's on minut distinction
sure but I think it's kind of
interesting it's a reminder of just
whose smartphone this is taking it out
of the box you can see what i mean by
big I nearly dropped the thing right off
the bat but while it is large it's not
unprecedented yes it's got a much wider
footprint than the nexus 5 the Moto X
2014 and even the tall HTC One m8 but
remember folks we live in a world with
an iphone six-plus so while we've never
seen a nexus this big we've certainly
seen phones this big we've seldom seen a
nexus smartphone this expensive however
and what are you get in the box for your
649 dollars well aside from a sim tool
warranty info and a charger with cable
not much it is the turbocharger the
quick one which is nice but still a
pretty thin collection of bundled
accessories for such a high price tag
here
Nexus has never been about frills of
course it's about simplicity and as we
power the Nexus 6 on for the first time
we get a small taste of that simplicity
when the six asks us to hip check our
current android phone doing so fires up
a quick NFC bluetooth session and
instantly transfers our Google accounts
and starts downloading our apps that's a
pretty convenient little feature that
lists the first of many and we look
forward to exploring more of them on
this monster as we dive into the Nexus 6
for a full review coming next week
you've seen other sites reviews folks so
let us know what you want to see from
ours leave a comment below follow pocket
now on social media and tweet at me at
captain the number two phones that's
captain two phones till next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
thanking you for watching and for your
patience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
