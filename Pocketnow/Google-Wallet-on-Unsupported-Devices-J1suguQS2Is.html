today we're gonna take a quick look at
Google Wallet on some unsupported
devices let's go take a look so Google
Wallet has two components the first
thing is an online component where you
have your payment information your name
and whatnot setup so you can make online
purchases that used to be called Google
Checkout but they've now rolled it all
together under the wallet brand which is
really kind of nice and kind of sets the
stage before being able to deploy wallet
across more devices and more areas now
how can you use this a lot of credit
cards today are coming with an NFC chip
some people refer to it as an RFID chip
built-in most of those are by MasterCard
and most of those are Citibank
you take them to say 7-eleven or
McDonald's and instead of swiping your
card through the reader you simply tap
your card on the little PayPass I
believe is the name-brand doing that
reads the card number essentially off of
that card's chip and you can pay for it
that way without swiping well since the
Nexus S has an NFC chip if you will
right in there with all the necessary
component Ori you can do the same thing
there well if you take a look over here
this is the Galaxy Nexus and it also has
an NFC chip in it so what can we do well
first of all come back over here Google
Wallet is only officially available for
the Nexus S 4G from Sprint which this is
not this is the GSM version of the
galaxy or excuse me of the Nexus S if
you go through and set everything up
just right and don't mind wiping your
phone in the process you can get Google
Wallet set up and running there are some
caveats but if you take a look we'll
open it right up it initializes takes
just a minute
you cannot bypass this pin so we'll go
ahead and type that in once we've done
that and when I say bypass I mean you
can't disable it that that I've been
able to find yet so right now we have
offers which is kind of like
the Google Shopping type stuff we've got
a receipt of what you have purchased
already loyalty cards so that's like
come down in here office max there max
perks rewards there are a lot of other
types of rewards cards like we've got a
whole bunch of grocery store cards that
aren't in there yet
but hopefully soon so you can use those
during checkout
you also have payment cards now payment
cards you can wire up your Citibank
MasterCard or you can set up a prepaid
Google debit card essentially now you
can see we're getting some lag right
here but when you open that up you can
choose your card when you tap this on a
terminal it should open up and ask you
if you want to to pay let's switch over
to the Galaxy Nexus which is kind of the
same thing if you unlock your Nexus
which I have done and if you route your
Nexus which I have done then you too can
see if I put this anywhere on the
screens for us you too can install a
hacked version of wallet so we'll go
ahead and open that up we'll enter my
pin and from here same display we'll
open up our payment cards and here you
can see that I've got a Google pay pass
debit mastercard so i should be able to
use this at any pay pass account and pay
for stuff very simply and then that will
deduct from my ten dollars that they
gave me for free Google Wallet is
allegedly only available in the US and
technically not available for this phone
or the other phone that I showed you but
you can see that you can hack things
into it if you want the instructions are
kind of in-depth but we'll go over them
in brief for you at the article over at
pocketnow.com if you want to try it
yourself just a word to the wise doing
this on the Nexus S will require that
you're running CyanogenMod nightly to
twelve or more recent or another
compatible rom and flash things in a
particular order so you're gonna have to
wipe and start fresh with this with the
Galaxy Nexus you don't have to wipe and
start fresh as long as you have unlocked
and rooted your
phone if you haven't as I hadn't you
will have to wipe as part of the OEM
unlocking process but overall really
cool paying for stuff with your phone
via Google Wallet on unsupported devices
for pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
