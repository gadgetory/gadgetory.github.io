paper is faster than the Xperia z5
premium the Eber flagship of Sony from
FIFA we are here to take a look at the
similarities and differences among the
two and maybe try to come up with an
answer on the entire raz√≥n d'etre for
this X performance
Xperia z5 premium on the left I call it
mr. smudgy because I have the mirror
option and believe me you don't want to
get this unless you want to slap on a
protection on the back but that doesn't
matter right now the xperia x
performance no longer uses glass on the
back it uses aluminum and that's valid
for all the phones in the ex category if
you remember the Xperia z5 premium was
the world's first 4k smartphone and we
had a dedicated segment on how that 4k
works and how it doesn't it runs right
now in full HD which makes the
battleground even because the X
performance has a full HD display as
well five inches compared to 5.5 inches
and you can see the difference until we
talk about specifications you can see
already an interesting shift a small
step away in sony's design philosophy we
have the rectangular sharp edges on the
z5 z5 premium even the Z 3 Z 3 plus and
now we have the X's which are a little
bit more round the glass is rounded
towards the edges the bezels on the
sides are a little bit smaller and you
no longer have these rough edges which
make it let's say I'm comfortable to
hold at one point this one is more
fitting the palm of your hand it has a
good user experience in terms of its
tactile feel also the front-facing
stereo speakers have been repositioned I
can't remember off the top of my head
but I believe it was the Xperia z2 which
didn't have the speakers on the edge but
a little bit lower but might have been
the 3d z5 r z5 premium have them right
here on the very top and bottom flank of
course by the front-facing camera and
these sensors flip them to the back and
we'll just turn the screens out for a
second we can see almost the same thing
going on here with the lens
and the LED flash megapixel count is 23
on both devices
but the xperia x lineup uses a brand new
way of autofocus and it's a hybrid
autofocus employed by Sony on its alpha
cameras LS on the z5 and z5 premium we
have just the face detection autofocus
how well that will perform we will have
to see in terms of specifications
there's an interesting thing going on
because the z5 and a z5 premium were the
absolute flagship from Sony and now the
xperia x performance basically
outclasses it because we have the
Snapdragon 810 of the Xperia z5 premium
and we have to start dragon 820 on the
Xperia X performance which is the new
processor which is powering the LG g5
and the Samsung Galaxy s7 it's three
gigabytes of RAM on both devices so it's
a level battlefield and we have 32
gigabytes of storage both expandable on
both devices so at least on paper DX
performance is right there or on top of
the z5 premium battery wise they don't
even compare we got a 34 30 milliamp
hour battery on the z5 premium and a
2600 milliamp hour battery but it's 5
inches versus 5.5 it's 4k vs. Full HD
it's it's not even a showdown now
whether the X performance is able to
take the crown from the z5 and the z5
premium in terms of smudge enos we will
see but in terms of performance it might
actually be able to because it's got
better specs of course everything will
become even more clear once we get them
in our review laps for proper review
treatment and once we put them against
each other in a controlled environment
until then this was engine denied thank
you very much for watching NWC 2016 se
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
