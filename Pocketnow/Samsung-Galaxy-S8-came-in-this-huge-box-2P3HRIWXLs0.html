waiting outside is from Samsung and
large enough to cover the whole entrance
then we're clearly in for a treat I'm
hiding a bit of a pocket now and this is
our unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy s8
plus brought to you by deep brand okay
this box is huge a clear indication that
Samsung is going all-out and I actually
applaud that many like to downplay the
experience of pulling a new product out
of its box but I'm the type of guy that
actually enjoyed peeling the plastic off
a new CD or the smell of a brand new
book so the unboxing experience for me
is essential disclaimer though your
retail packaging will definitely vary I
know Samsung is bundling the gear VR
with the controller as a free gift but
this box clearly has a lot more
unwrapping the terribly wrapped black
box were greeted by another black box
inside held with foam and the words
we've been waiting to see yes I'm saying
we do want to unbox our phone sliding
the logo to the side the box opens from
the middle and then inside were greeted
by text claiming this to be infinitely
amazing pointing to the infinity display
that we're about to see on the left we
have the new gear VR with controller on
the right we have Samsung's new level on
wireless pro headphones in black and I
think these things cost like 250 bucks
this is awesome but this is not what
we're here for front and center we have
the brand new Samsung Galaxy s8 plus in
midnight black under its cover we have
the usual stuff that you will find on
the retail box like micro USB to USB C
connector USB C OTG connector a fast
charger and USB C connector all in black
color instead of white Thank You Samsung
it is so annoying to keep white cables
clean this is a breath of fresh air
honestly and then the AKG earbuds also
made it to the Vox with a blend of mesh
texture at the lower portion of the wire
rubber at the top so I will leave the
verdict of quality to our expert Juan
Carlos back now and then the Samsung
Galaxy s8 plus comes with this minimal
plastic covering as always the tone of
this midnight black is says darkest can
be with even the metallic borders going
fully dark I really love what I see it
is definitely not a light phone and it
will be a fingerprint magnet but there
is no denying how gorgeous this device
looks even while turned off our own Juan
Carlos Bagnall will focus more on the
review of the plus variant for the next
few days while I covered the regular
sized Galaxy s8 you can bet there are a
ton of comparisons coming soon so shine
in the comments let us know which
specific comparison you would like to
see most now did you know that humans
are born with two and eight fears if you
are falling and the fear of loud sounds
every other fear is developed over time
we'd like to thank our sponsor D brand
for reminding us that if you're afraid
of thick bezels you definitely weren't
born with it and yes this bizarre
Adenauer Samsung Galaxy s8 coverage is
