pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to show you a good way to clean
your cell phone and this applies to the
iPhone or Windows Mobile or any mobile
device that picks up a lot of dirt and
fingerprints and grease and grime and
Pocket lint on the screen or the front
of the device which pretty much happens
to all of us so if you've seen any of
any of my videos you know that the
devices that I have are generally very
clean it looks like it just came out of
the box and while that's really not the
case it's just that I do a certain few
things to keep the device the device
clean before putting it on camera so
that it looks brand new but what I have
here is one of the hardest to clean
devices the sony ericsson xperia x1 and
i've been using it for several days now
without cleaning it and look how dirty
it is it's disgusting but i'm going to
show you how to clean it off so that it
looks like it just came out of the box
now there are a few things that you're
gonna need here you're gonna need a 100%
cotton t-shirt or a towel or or cloth
there's something around the house I
like the the flat material better than
you know getting a bath bathroom towel
that really wouldn't work so something
flat 100% cotton like this you also want
some some compressed air with a little
hose on the top oh this is kind of
optional this is just to get some
surfaced debris out of the way you don't
need this but it helps you also want to
have a bottle of isopropyl alcohol 90%
or greater or that's pretty much the
highest that they sell because the lower
you go they sell 70% that has a lot of
water in it and we really don't want to
have a lot of water next to our
electronics and we also want some q-tips
for the small spaces and of course the
device so let me show you what I do the
first thing that I do is I blow off the
surface dust and debris and there is a
little bit so I try to get around the
screen and around the button okay the
next thing I do is get a q-tip and dip
it slightly into the alcohol but I don't
want to get it too wet just kind of damp
and so I just dip it in and I'm gonna
shake it out because we don't want to
have a lot of moisture here and now I'm
gonna take the q-tip and I'm gonna rub
it around the screen and then I'm going
to do the screen and then I'm gonna go
back into the edges at the corners of
the screen where a lot of Pocket lint
and dirt kind of accumulates so let me
do that now
a little smudge down here so you can
work a little harder on that although
when we agitate it in a moment we'll get
more of that off so I'm going to use my
soft cotton t-shirt or towel here to
kind of polish it so gentle circles and
make sure this is completely clean
freshly washed with no dust on it
because it will scratch the screen okay
that's a little better still need some
more work so I'm going to take another
q-tip in another end and really focus on
the edges now cuz that's really where
especially on a recessed screen the the
debris kind of hangs out and when we're
done after a little bit more work we get
a device that looks like it just came
out of the box with smooth surfaces a
nice shiny screen and just the way we
like it to look so that is a good way to
clean your screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
