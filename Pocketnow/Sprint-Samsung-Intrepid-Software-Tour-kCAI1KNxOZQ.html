going to take a look at the software
tour of the samsung intrepid on sprint
cdma ev-do network so let's go ahead and
take a look at what's included on the
intrepid the intrepid on the home screen
actually uses the default windows mobile
6.5 home screen with the panel's
interface it doesn't have its own custom
home screen however sprint did include a
number of applications that are
customized for the specific device let's
go ahead and take a look at some of them
the first one that we're going to take a
look at is called the tell me app which
is a voice command application tell me
actually allows you to search make phone
calls with your voice and let's go ahead
and try it out so there's actually a
dedicated button or hard hardware button
that will allow you to speak what you
want onto the device so let's go ahead
and search for starbucks starbucks so
tell me will actually use your gps
location and pull up the search results
on bing so it's opening up Internet
Explorer right now Internet Explorer
mobile and we have some bing location
listings here in the Los Angeles suburbs
so that's one application of tell me the
other is you can say call mom and it
will actually call bomb what's
interesting is that the samsung intrepid
actually comes with voice command as
well but tell me is actually what's map
to the hardware key on the keyboard
other applications that come with the
device if you've ever used a samsung
windows mobile device you'll be familiar
with or one of them is the anniversary
ones which pulls up the calendar
application and pulls all the birthdays
and anniversaries you have
stored with your contacts and calendar
the other one is a custom alarm
application which gives you the ability
to set certain sounds and when the
alarms would go off so let's go ahead
and scroll through you can change the
tune if you want and I don't think I
have the sound on so that is the Samsung
alarms application and then samsung also
bundled a bunch of media applications as
well such as Samsung TV you have the
NASCAR application you have also the NFL
application sprint navigation is also
included and you also have a sprint
software to store however there's also
marketplace which I think personally is
a better shopping experience for your
applications what's also interesting
here is that sprint actually with
Samsung put the formal hard reset in
instead of the clear memory they put it
under the phone under settings and you
have to click over to the security tab
click clear awed atta and the password
actually if you need it you have to call
sprint customer care or walk into a
sprint store to get it which is a minor
nuisance but it prevents you from
accidentally clearing out your data if
you didn't want to on other HTC phones
it's actually under settings and if you
go to the systems tab there should be a
clear data icon there the other thing is
that sprint also had a firmware has a
firmware update for you here which
allows you to download firmware over the
air since windows mobile 6.5 is actually
pretty new there
shouldn't be any firmware updates
available but this is a nifty little
feature that came with 6.5 and carriers
can enable it so you can actually
download firmware without having to
tether it to the computer with a USB
cable so that's a quick look at some of
the software options that are available
with windows mobile 6.5 on the samsung
intrepid on sprint's network this is
