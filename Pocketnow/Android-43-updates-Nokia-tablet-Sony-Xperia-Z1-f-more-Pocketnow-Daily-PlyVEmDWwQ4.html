phones than ever and okay Windows RT
tablet now hits the FCC for all of you
non-believers and believe it or not
Google wants to sell apps on bending
machines I'm hi Mary Vanna and does this
vending machine thing mean that we're
getting paid phones as well this is
pocket now daily so if you wanted
official news I'm sorry to disappoint
this is not the day it's full of rumors
and we start with a nokia windows RT
tablet and i'm talking about the RX 114
already being shown at the FCC oh I'm
with the Nokia Lumia 1520 so yeah these
products are happening it's hard to tell
where it seems to the 15 20 is gonna be
an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive as always but it seems
that this Windows RT tablet is going to
verizon so links description for details
on specs and everything if you want to
know from these products now let's talk
about Sony we had heard that the Sony
Honami was gonna be a lineup but not
necessarily just the phone but we only
got the z1 announced so we thought the
things had changed but as it turns out
we do have some leaked renders of the
Sony Xperia z1 Mini or F as it's being
dubbed and as it turns out what makes
this film special as that apparently
it'll keep all the specifications of the
Xperia z1 only in a smaller chassis so
could it be that we are finally going to
get a phone that's adequately science
with flagship specs stay tuned for that
we'll see and for those of you wondering
just exactly how HTC is planning to up
the ante with their HTC One in the
future as it turns out we have some
leaked displays of the butterfly to when
yes this could be just the successor so
the butterfly which was the droid DNA
but it can also mean that this phone
does come to complement the HTC One in
some way it rings colors so that sadly
code for non flex your phone and that's
the reality of the market which I don't
understand why but we do get boomsound
here though we still don't know if this
phone will bring Beats Audio we don't
see the back of it just yet so stay
tuned for rumors and for some hilarious
news of the day believe it or not Google
is now working on selling applications
on vending machines but wait just there
it's not as bad as you think as it turns
out it seems that the vending machine
market is very big in Japan and
therefore google is planning to figure
out a new way to distribute
applications even though people are
going to be carrying their phones in
their pockets and they can buy
everything from their pockets without
the need of actually using a vending
machine so it begs to wonder I mean
imagine a future where you can actually
go to Walmart to buy applications and
you can still also do it in your phone
it's kind of pointless but again you do
see how companies try to tropical eyes
their services what do you think about
this and finally for the hot news of the
day for those of you waiting for Android
4.3 are your current flagship Android
smartphone as it turns out we've got
some credible sources that state that
the galaxy s form the HTC One are
getting it next month meaning October
but we've also got some leaks that
saying the HTC One is actually not going
to make it but then again for those
other phones like the galaxy s3 galaxy
note 2 we are talking about November
December hopefully which bets to wonder
I mean just think about it android 4.4
is pretty much close to being announced
and we're still talking about 4.3
reaching phones by the end of this year
so that leaves the question of the day
what phone do you have which version of
the operating system do you have and how
happy are you of not having the latest
greatest version of Android in my
particular case i have a galaxy s4 at LG
g2 no 2 and none of these phones have
4.3 yet some of them are on for
point-to-point to some of them are on
4.1 so honestly I am not happy that the
iphone 4 from the year 2010 already has
iOS 7 but leave us a comment down below
what do you feel about fragmentation

smartphone and top rope make sure you
