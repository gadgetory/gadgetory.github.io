pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to compare the YouTube application
of the iphone and the HTC touch HD ok
here we are closer in and we're on the
same Wi-Fi network so the field is kind
of even here and we're going to open up
both YouTube applications and by now you
probably know the the iphone's YouTube
application very well it has fantastic
scrolling is found in the entire
interface on the iphone and because the
touch HD has a taller screen and higher
resolution screen this really helps you
to see more videos on the screen at one
time so over here we see about four
videos and over here we see two four six
videos so a little bit more and of
course we have the flick scrolling to in
the YouTube application on the touch HD
but it's not as elegant as it is on the
iphone so we start off in featured
videos we've got a programming guide
here on the touch HD so we can kind of
filter by category we can go to most
viewed videos on the iphone if we go
over to the next button on the touch HD
we have bookmarked videos and that would
be over here on the iPhone and then we
can search for videos of course so let's
search for a common video I'm going to
search for South Park on the iPhone
first
and then on the touch HD
okay and search and they are both
bringing up the results and they brought
up actually the same results which isn't
a surprise and let's start the videos at
the same time see which one loads it
faster so I'm going to just do the video
at the top looks like the touch HD
actually came out a little bit faster
the the color the color looks a little
better on the iPhone but because of the
higher resolution larger screen I'm
actually enjoying watching it on the
touch HD a little bit more alright so
let's get out of this so stop and done
so overall I think the experience of
YouTube application on the touch HD is a
little bit better just because you get
to see so much more on the screen at one
time here's something else I want to
point out so on on these YouTube
applications we get to see how many
stars it has how long it plays for the
author how many views it has and the
name of the video we get the same
information on the touch HD but it's
spread out a lot more because it's a
higher resolution device so over here it
looks a little bit crammed while over
here you have more room so that is the
YouTube application on the HTC touch HD
and on the iphone that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
