we all know that the mytouch 4g from
t-mobile is a really fast phone but just
how fast is it well let's go take a look
alright this is the t-mobile mytouch 4G
and it is one of their fastest phones
available today and let me tell you just
in everyday use this phone is
ridiculously fast there are a couple
different ways to measure fastness the
first one is the quadrant benchmark
scores and I know we've talked a bit
about that before but basically a
quadrant or excuse me a benchmark is a
series of tests that are standard
throughout all phones so you can run
quadrant on any phone it will run the
same set of tests and based on how well
it performs it'll spit out a number now
the way it spits out that number is
subject to debate but it gives us a way
to compare apples to oranges and let us
know what phone is faster than some
other phone so what i've done here is
i've done a factory reset on the phone
and i've gone in and I turned off the
screen timeout turn the brightness all
the way up and installed Quadron now to
do that I also had to put in my my gmail
and google credentials so it's been
pulling in some apps and whatnot but
right now the processor is really really
asleep and it's ready to go this is the
standard version of quadrant so let's go
ahead and run that now the reason that i
run the standard version of the quadrant
benchmark utility rather than the the
full advanced version is because most
people out there like you and me are
going to run this version it's free it's
in the market you can download it
install it on your android phone and get
all the results back the advanced
version basically shows you in detail
what each one of these tests is is
scoring in relation to the whole which
is good information to have but it's
just not information that a lot of you
are going to say when I mean if you get
a phone and your friend has a phone and
you're both run quadrant you're not
going to say hey look mines three times
as fast as yours in system I oh you're
just going to look at the bottom line
and that's what I'm showing you here and
you can see it's running through the
tests very very well and we're running
at 57 frames per second on that last
test this one's at 20
frames per second which is still very
good for this test and at the end we
have to send our results off and get
them back and if you can see that there
the quadrant score is a 1911 which is
right in line with the scores that I've
been getting previously now with all
benchmarking utilities you want to run
these through several times to be able
to well get a high-water mark sometimes
you'll have processes running in the
background that you don't know about
that will affect your score but even
still over 1,900 points you can see that
significantly faster than the nexus one
running android 2.2 so really really
good now of course that's only half of
the speed test and this phone since it
is a 4g phone or what t-mobile calls a
4g phone the other half of this is how
fast is the speed now there are two ways
to test that first is over wireless and
I'm over HSPA though not necessarily
over hspa+ but i do have full bars so
we're going to go ahead and run that
test and then we're also going to turn
on Wi-Fi and we'll run the test there so
you can see how fast the 802 11 n works
over my wireless at my house which is
using a cable modem so it's relatively
fast this is speedtest net it's an app
that's available free in the market and
what it does is it loads up this app
that has a various number of servers
that you can download and upload a
predetermined sized file from the
internet to your device and from your
device to the internet and measure how
fast the internet is now there are three
different settings that I'll get into
our three different measures of speed
that I'll get into but first I want to
show you what I've done I report
everything here in kilobits per second
not kilobytes per second not megabits
per second but kilobits because
sometimes you'll have slower stuff that
you know you're only going to be getting
100 200 kilobits per second and it's
easier to tell the basically the speed
difference is without getting into
decimals and megabits and yada yada yada
I've had some other people say that
they've been confused with that so we're
doing it all in kilobits per second I've
also changed the server to at Salt Lake
City Utah no normally it's going to pick
either the closest server to you or pick
one at random and I've seen different
results
because the Internet is the way it is
you can go very very different routes
from one place to another one and due to
that you might have you know a server
that's say in Modesto California that
seems a lot closer than in Salt Lake
City Utah which obviously is the closest
one to me as the crow flies but as the
network bits travel it might be
something different but just to level
out the playing field I've got that set
to Salt Lake City Utah and then of
course we'll run the test first it lends
a test for latency and you can see here
to mobile right now is running 164 which
is a little bit high for them but very
good compared to some of the others like
sprint and AT&amp;amp;T download speed is 200 or
scuze me 2254 kilobits per second upload
speed test is still completing 854 now
again like a benchmark test you want to
make sure you run this a couple times
these scores aren't bad in fact they've
been improving in my area recently quite
a bit in fact they've almost doubled but
it's still nowhere near where I'd expect
a 4g speed so we'll run this again and
again you want to do this to you want to
run at two or three or four times you
can see here i'm now at 4174 kilobits
per second download my ping time is 108
milliseconds and my upload is 900
kilobits per second we'll do one more
just for good measure and again this is
some place that does not officially have
hspa+ so I'm seeing you know on average
between two and five megabit per second
again you can see here 4306 my ping time
was a little bit high in this instance
which meant there's probably some
network congestion somewhere along the
line but my upload speed came up quite a
bit so make sure you run these tests
several times through and you can see
what I mean obviously very very fast
phone it does very well even at two bars
I'll still have in the several hundred
kilobit per second range so that's very
good for when you want to stream media
for when you want to upload video and
what not the only problem we have there
is YouTube kind of has a limit on how
big video sizes you can upload but
watching t mobile TV on this listening
to pandora
it's great absolutely wonderful but how
is this going to do over Wi-Fi well it
does have 802 11 n so let's take a look
and see how that performs ok now what
I've done is I've turned on my Wi-Fi and
you can tell that up here my h 4f aspa
has been changed into a Wi-Fi signal and
I've got three out of four bars even
though I'm only about 20 feet away from
the antenna so that shouldn't impact our
performance that much let's go ahead and
run it with the same settings and you
can see very quickly this is really fast
45 milliseconds and 12,700 to kilobits
per second download speed 4337 kilobits
upload speed again let's run it again
just to make sure that that wasn't a
fluke ping time 47 milliseconds download
is 8.3 megabits per second and upload is
3.8 last time for good measure now again
we run this because this is Wireless
it's not like the wire where you're
pretty well insulated you're pretty well
protected from interference if somebody
turns on a microwave these speeds are
going to fluctuate so here again 45
milliseconds which is about right for my
comcast net cable modem and I'm getting
just shy of 10 megabit per second down
and about three and a half megabit per
second up which is really good now the
way that I'm doing that this is nowhere
near what 802 11 n that will max out at
I mean that's 300 megabits per second
and obviously this is not anywhere near
that but when you get up to the end
technologies your speeds are going to
increase over say your 802 11 g or 802
11 b and i know a lot of people are
saying why on earth do i need 300
megabit per second now to my phone well
as you can see here you're not getting
that on any phone really but what you
are doing is you're using those newer
technologies and in the better ways of
communicating even though it's over the
same frequency so your throughput is
going to be increased what that means is
you're going to have better experiences
when you're surfing the web
it's going to be faster I've got an
addiction to stumbleupon so everything
you've stumble is going to be faster
you've got all of your videos especially
t mobile TV which you do have to
activate without Wi-Fi on first and then
once you've activated your device
basically once it knows who your phone
is then it'll let you watch this over
Wi-Fi which is a complaint i've had with
look android-based TV programs in the
past but this one it's got it almost
entirely worked out Pandora of course
streaming over this even in high quality
works fabulously but why do you want to
have these kinds of speeds on a phone
well here's the main reason and i know
this is getting a little bit off topic
for this video but i wanted to show you
this is the tmobile Wi-Fi calling and of
course i can view the tutorial which i
don't want to i'm already connected to
Wi-Fi so it's listing that there and i
can now turn this on now every single
phone call that I make and receive while
i am under this recognized Wi-Fi network
is going to be over Wi-Fi instead of
over the t-mobile network now if you've
got a minutes based plan be advised that
calls that you make and receive over
Wi-Fi are still going to count against
those minutes I'm lucky enough to have
an unlimited plan now lucky enough I pay
for it and I pay rather handsomely for
it but those minutes are still unlimited
minutes and I'm good to go now why does
tmobile still count lows against you
well you're still using their network
even though you're not using their
cellular tower you're still using their
infrastructure you're still using their
voice over IP network which they've had
out for quite a while just not available
to many cell phones and that's been
because the platform's really haven't
been that stable and the connection to
the device hasn't been that reliable
once we get up into 802 11 n which this
has your speeds really start to improve
and your phone calls start to get a lot
better now what I like about this if I
come over here to my dialer and that's
all this is this is my stock dialer if i
dial a phone number you don't see
anything different at all this is all
just your stock dialer i don't have to
say oh I want to make this
over Wi-Fi or why don't want to make
this over cellular it's all transparent
once you've set it up if you're under
Wi-Fi it's going to be a call over Wi-Fi
and if it's over you know your regular
cellular network it's going to be over
regular cellular now you notice there I
said or and that's kind of a big thing
to know if I get on to a call right now
i'm on Wi-Fi and this Wi-Fi is going to
be the calls going to be great it's been
fabulous so far unless you don't have
very good signal so i'd recommend
definitely have a bee or an excuse me
have a G or an N connection not a B
because b is a little bit too slow and
has too much latency so you want to have
definitely g or n for your wireless
although will work over be i just don't
really recommend it because you want to
have that extra speed that that lower
latency and that extra throughput both
up and down to be able to make and
receive these calls the one disadvantage
that you have to this is if i get on a
call right now and i'm talking to
someone and i walk out the door get in
my car and start driving down the street
as soon as I lose this Wi-Fi connection
I lose my call now that's because
handing off between Wi-Fi and cellular
and cellular and Wi-Fi is a little bit
complicated though it can be done but
the big complication comes in billing if
I and I don't understand that since this
still counts against your minutes but
basically what happens is if I start it
on a Wi-Fi bubble and I leave and I go
to cellular bubbles well then it's all
since the calls started on Wi-Fi it
thinks that the whole call is Wi-Fi
rather than while you had two minutes
under Wi-Fi and 20 minutes under
cellular or vice versa and then if you
started under cellular then came into
Wi-Fi well you started cellular so
you're going to get billed cellular and
it's going to switch over Wi-Fi that's
the way it's been in the past and that's
when the Wi-Fi calling was just a flat
10 bucks a month you pay ten bucks and
you've got unlimited incoming outgoing
calls over Wi-Fi not anymore but now you
can't do the handoff so I'm a little
confused over why we don't have the
handoff when the billing side which was
really the only technical issue with the
technology was was removed but
that's neither here there we'll just
keep on going obviously very very cool
now this is just boys then you notice
there's nothing in here regarding a face
there is no picture there's no camera
but we've got this front facing camera
right there then in one of my upcoming
videos I'm going to show you a kick call
now this does come pre-loaded with a
t-mobile version of qik if I can find it
in here then call it quick video chat
right there t-mobile preloads that and
it's really cool and I want to show you
that over HSPA network here and if I can
to a sprint 4G network if I can get that
to work out so make sure you stay tuned
to our channel subscribe if you haven't
done so already give this video a thumbs
up if you like to continue to see more
in depth speed videos then obviously for
pocket now I'm Jolie right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
