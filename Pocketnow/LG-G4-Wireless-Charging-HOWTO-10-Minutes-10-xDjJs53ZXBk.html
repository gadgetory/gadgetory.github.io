here on loan from AT&amp;amp;T you've got a
pretty solid smartphone but out of the
box it's lacking one cool feature
wireless charging you could buy a quick
circle case from LG to enable it but
it's pricey and as we recently learned
from a post over at Phandroid you can
achieve the same end for just ten bucks
and a little modding i'm michael fisher
with pocket now and we're going to show
you how so the first thing you need to
do is go to Amazon and pick up this
thing linked in the description it's
called the new wisdom LG g4 Qi wireless
charging IC chip plus NFC antenna
sticker for LG g4 for such a long name
the product itself is tiny as it needs
to be to fit under the g4s battery cover
now while you can do this modification
on the stock cover I'm partial to the
leather backs so LG was nice enough to
send us a couple to test out with our
review unit I'm gonna go for yellow and
just to be splashy about it first things
first
peel off the existing sticker from the
battery door you're working on it's the
large rectangular plate at the
centerline and you may need a knife to
get the peel started use caution if you
do then it gets your knife or pry tool
underneath the corner of this black
plate and remove the NFC module itself
which is really stuck on there so be
patient and don't go too fast
obviously this contains the NFC antenna
but it doesn't matter because if you got
the product we link to you'll get that
functionality back when you connect the
new sticker hey what do you know that's
the next step the new component is the
thicker of the two items in the envelope
and it's backed by 3m adhesive align the
new antenna with the silhouette of the
old one and alignment here is really
important you want to match the contacts
exactly to their counterparts on the
phone side so when the battery door goes
on they make contact don't rush this
when you think you've got it right peel
off the sticky stuff take a second to
admire the inductive charging coils if
you want and smack it on there at this
point you may wish you'd sanded the
plastic to get a better surface for the
glue to stick to but if you're like me
you'll just keep mashing on it till it
stops bubbling up
pop the battery door back on engage all
the clasps and notice how you've added
no measurable thickness to the phone
which we can't always say for these
kinds of mods now it's time to plop down
the charger
keeping in mind that only qi wireless
chargers will work if it starts charging
congratulations you're a hack soar if
not as shown here you're a failure
sad BAE's just kidding remember what I
said about alignment earlier it this
just means you have to adjust the
interface points so they line up better
on close inspection we can see that I
put the sticker a little higher than it
should go here fortunately we don't need
to unstick the entire thing just peel up
the interface portion here and nudge it
just a skosh in the right direction
again be careful and patient pop the
cover back on maybe with an extra
squeeze or two around the contact points
cross your fingers and toss it back on
the charger if you've done it right and
the demo gods are with you BAM you're
sucking juice wireless style and now
keep in mind you'll want to check your
NFC connectivity too that's the other
set of contacts you stuck on there
fortunately I had better luck here and
got the chief floor to talk to one of my
old Samsung tech tiles with no muss when
you're done testing this is the final
step unpeel the bigger sticker you got
in the package from Amazon and seal
everything in place
so it can't shift around on you
so there you have it wireless charging
on your LG g4 no matter what back cover
you pick and it only costs you 10 bucks
and 10 minutes
