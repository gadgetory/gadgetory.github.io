everything takes a tone of leather new
evidence emerges on a galaxy s6 active
in the works and I was doing everything
it can to avoid crazy lines for the
Apple watch I'm high notary that I and
if you're struggling to pronounce my
name trust me you're not the only one
this is parking out daily the official
news today are sadly negative for
Windows Phone fans as those of you
interested in getting a fat with Windows
Phone what the Lumia 1520 is about to be
put to rest or should I say it already
is put to rest but bear in mind this
product has been in the market since
October 2013 so yeah it's been a lot
longer than the regular life cycle for
any phone but it is sad news to see
product week retired and no new products
being launched now some positive
official news are happening for HTC as
the company's quarter results are in
they aren't audited yet but the company
has just landed its 1.3 billion in
revenue goal for this quarter so we
could say that things are on track
positively for HTC we're just not really
sure how much of this has to do with HTC
One m9 sales we actually doubt that it
has to do with one of nine sales because
of how close it is to the launch quarter
but we will learn more as we get more
official details now let's move the
spotlight over to rumors and
particularly the galaxy s6 active yes
for those of you that wanted the or
galaxy s6 to be ruggedized and
waterproof apparently there will be an
option and there are some good news here
we don't know about design choices or
what materials are going to be used but
we do know that the specifications are
pretty much the same as the galaxy s6
which is good because in the past those
active units would always get lesser
cameras and different types of displays
it seems that everything is going to
remain the same let's just hope it
doesn't look like a tank and speaking of
other rumor is it seems that Apple's a
senior vice president of retail has
Justin out a memo to the company's
employees with different strategies and
how to avoid crazy lines and pandemonium
for the Apple watch which is odd since
we don't really expect the company to
sell as many products as the company
thinks they will but it seems that
they will try to you know entice
consumers to use apples online store to
get shipping options and to get in store
pickups and not to go crazy in a line
because apparently there will be lots
more units online and not the same case
for brick-and-mortar stores now this is
even more predominant in the UK where
there won't be any options to buy the
Apple watch on Apple stores you actually
only have the option to order online so
let's just see if this is a strategy to
really reduce lines or it's just the
fact that there aren't many lines
expected we'll see and finally for the
very hot news of the day LG has just
sent out presentations for an event to
happen on April twenty-eighth and it
just barely disclosed this is for the g4
and we get two things teas number 1 and
f 1.8 aperture lens which yes would
directly compete with the f 1.9 of the
galaxy s6 so yeah the cameras going to
be a big deal but even more interesting
is the fact that we get leather on this
back we've never seen leather on an LG
product before we've seen plastic we've
seen glass but yeah it seems that
leather is going to be the deal and we
want your these are just replaceable
backs for the g4 but it leads me to the
question of the day would you like an LG
g4 with replaceable backs and if so
which materials because in my case whew
I would love bamboo I would love leather
but I even wouldn't like the option to
be able to replace these even more he
was a comment down below what's your
case friends you know the drill if he
wanted the news earlier before this
video is still make sure you follow us
on outcomes the sharp change
channel as well you'd follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore diva please

what you saw I am high memory there

see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
