jailbreaks to iOS 4.2 point one verizon
iphone 4 pre-orders gone almost as soon
as they started and everything points
out to verizon's network being lame on
the iphone all this and more coming up
right now hello everybody i'm high metal
iveta and welcome to the pocket nail I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
now greenpoison RC 5 is out it'll bring
you onto their jailbreaks the iOS 4.2
point 1 for some compatible iPhones the
iPad and the ipod touch now there have
been issues with the server for
greenpoison so if you don't get to be
able to install city immediately just
give it some time you know a lot of
people are out there trying to get it
and well if you're relying on ultrasnow
to unlock your phone remember that
upgrading to iOS 4.2 point 1 will pretty
much leave you with a new baseband and
not able to unlock your phone so proceed
with caution and just do it if you
really know what you're doing well
verizon iphone 4 pre-orders went live is
scheduled on februari third at 3am and
while they crashed five minutes later
and they pretty much sold out two hours
later these are record sales for verizon
and what's cooler is even having these
devices already shipped to users at
least some of them really the
performance next up would be getting
more coffee and waiting for februari
ninth or making lines on februari 10th
so far so good how many of you stayed up
all night I know I did well rumors have
iOS 4.3 being released somewhere around
februari 10th with the verizon iphone 4
launch other safe every 14th for the
iphone and ipod touch somewhere in April
for the ipad and ipad 2 if it ever comes
out though there aren't really any
compelling reasons to upgrade to iOS 4.3
at least not that we've heard of so if
you've just jailbroken with greenpois0n
bice to you is proceed with caution and
just you know really analyze if you
really need this upgrade because I know
the dev team has been having a lot of
trouble working with the betas well AT&amp;amp;T
is just announced that they will be
adding an additional 2 gigabytes to the
current tethering plans and guess what
though
also be offering wireless hotspot
services for current AT&amp;amp;T customers so
call this great competition this is
announced for februari 13th so this
would be the third day we do assume iOS
4.3 to be released remember wireless
hotspot services allow you to connect up
to five devices to your device using
your device as a wireless hotspot so
really cool services really great
competition and well if you plan to be
part of the group of people that will be
making lines on februari 10th for the
verizon iphone 4 launch just as an FYI
remember they'll also be selling the
device at Best Buy so you might want to
try diluting the lines and going to
bestbuy though we don't know who's going
to have more devices or if they're even
going to meet the man's considering the
current performance for the pre-orders
so let's see what happens well that does
it for the cool that's continued on with
the not so cool Steve Wozniak was
recently in the engadget show talking
about the iphone and mentioning the
white iphone 4 and how Apple had already
figured out how to fix the white iphone
four issues with the camera the paint
job and everything now the uncool part
is having Wozniak eventually pull his
comments back and saying they were just
part of rumors so not really sure if the
white iphone is anything other than part
of our imagination lately anyways well
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have really shown how
much they love each other Verizon ads
are doing a great job at showing you how
much drop calls you get on AT&amp;amp;T and well
AT&amp;amp;T is doing a great job in showing
people how they won't be able to do data
and voice simultaneously on the new
verizon iphone 4 just for the point
think about it I mean it took AT&amp;amp;T
customer six months to either consider
moving away from AT&amp;amp;T because they hated
drop calls or four rise in iphone
customers or call them verizon customers
to move to AT&amp;amp;T just because of the fact
that they wanted the iphone if they
didn't move already it's because they're
happy where they are so i mean just drop
it man and enjoy competition well
continuing on with more verizon iphone
news it seems that things are not going
to be really well for customers
pertaining data it seems that they're
only be able to download up to 1.2 one
point no mega
down and up 2.5 up as opposed to current
AT&amp;amp;T customers that get 3.3 3.5 mega VPS
is down and up to 1.3 up not really sure
what verizon is planning to do with
their network to be able to support
iphone customers and you know just four
point this is verizon without iPhones
already imagine what would happen if
they already had iphones on sale in
comparison to AT&amp;amp;T that already has them
so not really sure what to expect if
every tenth will be that they will know
well the Sony Reader iOS application was
recently pulled from the app store for
selling books within the application
without giving Apple the thirty percent
cut this is totally legal if we go
through the terms of services the
problem is and let's forget about the
sony reader application for now let's
focus on for example the kindle iOS
applications and ebooks i mean lots of
us choose kindle better because you can
read on Android you can read on iOS on a
Mac on a PC just about everywhere even
the web and you can't do that with
ibooks so what would happen with you
know ebooks and other services that gets
sold within applications like for
example senior magazines and everything
even game so we'll see what happens with
Apple these is this is really not good
because obviously ebooks will get more
expensive or they'll probably get pulled
and I'm not going to be able to read
them on my iPad so not really good news
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
