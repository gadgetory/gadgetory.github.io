on a downfall companies like Alcatel
haven't been sitting around with the
concept the tablet should help you get
work done I'm high memory when I was
PocketNow here from MWC 2017 and meet
the Alcatel +12
the Alcatel Idol lineup has shown us two
important things over the last two years
and that's the TCL knows how to make
beautiful hardware and also pack insane
amount of power for users on a budget we
still don't have pricing information for
the Alcatel plus 12 but boy is this
thing cool this is a convertible PC with
a very interesting brushed finish at the
back in the front sports at 11.6 inch
display at Full HD resolution this is
not meant to be a powerhouse with
specifications like an Intel Celeron but
at this sport four gigs of ram 32 gigs
of expandable storage and once you
connect the keyboard you even have LTE
connectivity yes this is more portable
machine and yet there is even a stylus
for creativity the keyboard allows for
you to prop it in various angles and
typing is actually quite pleasant other
reports include full USB with a keyboard
and then onboard we have USB C micro
HDMI the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
even better this tablet supports Windows
hello because this is a full Windows
Phone tablet and this is actually
brought to you by a fingerprint scanner
something that's even hard to find on
more expensive computers for the brief
period of time that we were allowed to
play with the Alcatel plus 12 it is
quite cool and it's clear that the
company is up to something here we'll
have to report back once this device
will rise at the PocketNow lab so for
now make sure you follow us on social
media and hit that subscribe button down
below for more videos like this one you
can also follow me on Twitter
Highlanders quarterly that I run into
the granite high medley data please give
this video thumbs up if you like what
you saw I'm hi Mary thanks so much for
watching we will see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
