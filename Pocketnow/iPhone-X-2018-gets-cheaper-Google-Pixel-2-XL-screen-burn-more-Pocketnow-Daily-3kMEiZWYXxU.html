price tag will drop significantly more
complaints rain in on the Google pixel
to excel in its screen and the essential
phone continues to find some very juicy
discounts I'm Jaime meadow Iveta and
somebody told me yesterday that vader's
would definitely be a good idea for a
restaurant what do you guys think this
is Park announced daily the official
news today begin with deals believe it
or not the essential phone continues to
be one of my favorite Android phones in
the market even with some of the
complaints out there still if you in the
market for a good smartphone that is
still catching up with the whole camera
thing well it's currently $200 off it's
been catching discounts would it be
worth it to get we will report back with
our full review very soon other
interesting news have to do with the
Nokia 3310 and its 3G variant it's
already shipping in Europe and three
orders have begun in the United States
and the pre-order price tag is obviously
crazy just $59 obviously you're buying a
dumb phone it's not a smart phone but
you can play snake and it's just 60
bucks that should all make sense now
about the Huawei watch 2 pro and I'm
like while we watch 2 Pro like really I
really like the Huawei watch 2 classic
and this is pretty much almost the same
design the only change here is that
you're getting an e SIM being built in
because well in the original Huawei
watch 2 you could replace a SIM card but
now we're getting apples technology and
you know being able to connect to LT
without the need of swapping a SIM card
this is not necessarily good right now
this product is launching only in China
the problem is with the case of the
Apple watch series 3 I still can't make
it work because I can't put in whatever
SIM I want and that will forces me to
pay for a carrier plan so let's see how
Huawei handles this one let's cool the
spotlight over to the iPhone 10
something is happening that I was
expecting we've got analysts already
predicting that the next generation
iPhone 10 or whatever that may make be
in 2018 will be significantly less
expensive than the current one and the
reason why I'm saying that this was
expected is because if you remember what
happened with the first generation
iPhone the first iPhone was crazy
expensive but then I believe it was like
500 dollars plus a two-year contract and
then the iPhone 3G which was sick
sniffing Lee a better phone was only
$200 was a tweeter contract and
apparently this is what's going to be
happening with the iPhone 10 obviously
the R&amp;amp;D has already been paid for with
the case of the iPhone 10 so they don't
need to retain that price tag for the
second generation well that happened or
not is so hard to predict but that's the
rumor
and finally the very interesting and
disappointing news is they have to do
with the Google pixel to excel which is
already waiting in my doorstep in New
York for me to pick it up when I get
back it turns out that people are not
only complaining about the dullness of
the OLED panel but now they're
complaining about screen burn issues and
if you didn't know this that's actually
a common thing for OLED this place
that's the reason why they always on
display on the Galaxy S lineup has to be
shifting around and the reason why ever
so slightly pixels are moving around in
OLED displays in order to avoid this
apparently either the Google pixel is
not doing this we're not exactly sure
what the case might be but we do know is
that Google is investigating but we
don't know exactly what investigating
means and you can't really just fix the
screen burn issues once they're there to
my understanding I could be wrong and I
wish you to chime in in the comments let
me know but it leads me to the question
of the day I mean is this going to
hinder your purchase of the Google pixel
to excel or are you even considering
returning the phone in my case I have to
admit it I can't work without a pixel I
need a pixel because of my trips to
China there's just no other way to
connect and pixels are awesome there is
so much coolness in these phones so I'm
gonna be very disappointed for my unit
has this but leave us a comment down
below we can't wait to hear your opinion
