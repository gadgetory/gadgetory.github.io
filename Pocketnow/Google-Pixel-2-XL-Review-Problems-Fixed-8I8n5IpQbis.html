random reboots to screen flashes this
year's punching bag has been the Google
pixel to excel sure it doesn't explode
like last year's victim but the issues
have even pushed Google to extend your
warranty for a second year cases like
these are the reason why we like to take
our time with reviews and it turns out
that Google has done a lot over the past
three weeks to solve these issues I'm
high metally that I'm with pocket now
and it's time for a Google pixel to
excel review brought to you by deep
breath
20-17 is definitely not a good year for
mistakes never have we had so many great
phones and allow me to shark you but the
pixel to excel is nearly at the top of
my list for all those early complaints
the things that were unchangeable were
done right and everything else has been
patched along the way as opposed to last
year's pixel this is actually a
good-looking phone it does retain some
elements like being a phone that I love
to hold and love to use and its main
differentiation for 2017 is that I now
love how it looks the textured aluminum
provides an added grip that's less prone
to fingerprints the glass accent at the
top helps it stand out from the crowd
the curvy shape allows a more futuristic
appeal that's delightful to hold all in
all this is a well crafted phone now if
you came here to hear rants about the
display I am sorry that I can't indulge
Google's recent software update now
includes a saturated mode that leaves
this OLED on par with competitors making
an awesome that you can choose if you
want accurate colors or if you want more
saturation we've already proven that the
bluish shift is a common trait of Oh
lids and yes I do notice a small screen
burnin that's actually not even
noticeable on camera and that's mainly
because it goes away after a few minutes
and everything else I love that the six
inch panel adopts a more modern approach
as competing devices and that content
consumption is enhanced thanks to these
loud front firing speakers as every
phone should have what we don't have
when compared to last year's pixel as a
headphone jack which is definitely a
shame after all the fanfare of it being
a flagship feature according to Google's
marketing and we also don't have newer
specifications but I won't complain
about those as technology hasn't really
evolved over this amount of time yes we
might be missing the trend of six Inca
bytes of RAM but we do have the latest
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and our variant
includes 128 gigabytes of non expandable
storage Bluetooth 5 and the pixel
finally gains ip67 water and dust
resistance something that was long
overdue
now will you be missing out on those
extra two gigabytes of RAM no keep in
mind that this is a pixel and software
is one of the things that it gets right
expect three years of immediate updates
to the latest version of Android and so
far Oreo has proven to be a true delight
I praise little things like the density
of the launcher and the quick access to
the Google feed when you swipe to the
left the quick access to the Google
search from the bottom of the display
where it should have always been and
probably one of my favorites is these
Google Earth wallpapers that have their
own way of being dynamic features like
picture and picture give a logical sense
to using a phablet for productivity
pressing and holding icons with
notification dots also helps you get a
quick glance of what you're missing out
on I'm still not a fan of the new emojis
but they look far better than the Slimer
icons that we had years ago and about
the whole squeezing the phone for the
Google assistant yeah that's a feature
that's nice to have but over time I've
learned that I really don't use it and
then there are all the benefits of
actually using a pixel as your daily
driver first of all it's a purse to
storage
I ordered the hundred and twenty-eight
gigabyte variant simply because it was
quicker to get but I feel you won't need
the extra storage buying a pixel gives
you unlimited storage in google photos
and that allowed me to survive just fine
with a 32 gigabyte variant last year
the second benefit is project Phi
Google's MP NL has a unique way to help
you jump between Sprint t-mobile u.s.
cellular and Wi-Fi and it roams at full
LTE speeds as opposed to other services
so far phone calls have been great and
it doesn't really matter if I use the
earpiece or the speakers this phone is
loud enough regardless the third benefit
is battery life this is one of those
phones that I simply don't worry about
when it comes to it getting through the
end of day and this is all thanks to how
the software is optimized along with the
hardware the fourth is performance I
heard some complaints of slowdowns but
so far I've only experienced that once
three days ago in the morning
and playing graphics-intensive games is
not a pom whatsoever the fifth and most
important benefit at least for me
personally is wow this camera ratings
have called this the best camera of 2017
and I am going to have to agree the
Google pixel to excel has become the
camera I can trust for absolutely every
single scenario that I've thrown at it
whether it's during the day or at night
hdr+ pretty much guarantees that the
phone will take the photo quick and
provide the most optimized results for
every scenario yes this is definitely an
unconventional approach to photography
where software pretty much ensures that
you'll have a delightful photo but then
again that's exactly what I'm looking
for all I want is a delightful photo
even the approach to portrait mode is
unconventional there is no secondary
lens and from the samples that I've
compared between phones Google software
approach has produced far better results
and I love how you get a second copy of
the photo in case you don't want the
software blur this phone is also mainly
believe in selfies with the best
portrait selfie results again all
through the magic of software and that's
even when compared to other devices that
include hardware to pull it off and then
the same can be said about video where
civilization is stopped notch at least
from the primary sensor the story is not
the same with the selfie video but not
to the point of being uncomfortable
about the only thing that I don't like
about video is how aggressive the phone
is about noise cancellation with audio
but that's just me met picking to
conclude I'd like to point out something
very important this is not a review unit
that we received from Google we actually
paid for this review unit I'd like to
make that clear because once again this
is not a fanboy show to praise a phone
that's been panned by others this is
actually just a truly great phone that
got fixed over time it's a great phone
to hold a great phone to use and it's
just shocking how much I love using this
camera about the only thing holding me
back from calling this the best phone of
2017 is definitely the bugs that
has been ironing out but the fact that
Google has been able to fix them as a
good sign the Google pixel to Excel
joins a very crowded list of phones that
we recommend for 2017 this is not the
most affordable option but if you're
looking for the ideal Android experience
with a great camera this is definitely
the best option to choose from and folks
