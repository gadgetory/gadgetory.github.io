detail on what we can expect the final
launch more deals give users other
options for the Google Nexus 6p at a
better price tag and it seems that next
year 3d touch will be on most flagships
I'm hi meri vana and if this were Steve
Harvey I'd gladly say today was friday
and then just take it back this is
sparking a daily as promised last week
let's begin today with deal starting
with the Google Nexus 6p which is now
available on best buy it's sold out
online but you could still pick it up at
a store the only problem is that even
though you're still getting the fifty
dollar discount that Google is providing
you won't get all color options or all
storage options link to the description
for more details on what you're getting
and speaking of Huawei those of you
interested in the company's future
flagships we hear that the mate 8 just
stopped by the FCC meaning that there
are strong possibilities that we will
see it at CES 2016 and then a proper
launch a few days or weeks later but
addition to that if you want something
smaller it seems that the p9 will make
an appearance at mwc and probably
launched somewhere around March which is
rather a good date but this is not the
only product that might make an
appearance at mwc we've got more
credible sources claiming that yes the
Galaxy s7 will be announced at mwc and
that we can expect at sometime March now
you have to remember everything you see
is for the last week of februari meaning
that a March launch would actually be
rather good for the company which is not
exactly sure how many galaxies products
will be getting all we hear is forced
touch technology now we are expecting a
major boom from smart watches and other
wearables happening at these events and
in addition to that growing over the
next few years and the IDC has just
provided some numbers according to their
analysts smartwatches will grow
dramatically almost 80 million units
until 2019 but the problem is this
number one it seems that the apple watch
will dominate and also fitness trackers
like the Fitbit those of you wondering
exactly where Android wear will stand
either with all the options that are
available it seems that they will only
own thirteen percent of the market which
is rather crazy we wonder why
again there's more information on the
lakes downstairs and finally the very
interesting news today come from digit
times because we know how connected this
publication is with sources in Asia
according to them twenty five percent of
smartphones next year will bring some
sort of pressure sensitive display
making 3d touch on the iPhone or that
for such technology that we see on the
huawei mate s which is rather
interesting some versions of operating
systems aren't really optimized for this
but it doesn't necessarily mean that
they won't in the next coming weeks but
it does lead me to the question of the
day do you consider a force touch
technology 3d touch or any of this to be
crucial for your experience with a
smartphone because in my case no not
necessarily it's cool to have but it's
not like if we haven't been able to
press and hold and select something on
Android for years anyways leave us a
comment down below let us know what you
think friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the news
