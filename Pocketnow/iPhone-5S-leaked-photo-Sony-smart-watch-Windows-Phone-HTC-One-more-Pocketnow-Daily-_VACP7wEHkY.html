apparent changes Sony's next event
teases as a new SmartWatch and it seems
like if we might be getting a windows
phone HTC one I'm hi meri beta waiting
for the weekend like there's no tomorrow
and this is out daily let's say
off with some interesting news you know
everybody marked Apple when they came up
with the retail stores and now we've got
microsoft stores and samsung stores
inside of best buy and even though
Google doesn't have their own retail
brick-and-mortar store well they have
been trying to project in Indonesia
called Android nation which is a retail
store for their partner products and
apparently the company is now doing the
same thing with in India the question is
why haven't they brought this the United
States and the question is if you would
like a retail store from google to
promote partner Android products I think
it would be a good idea leave us a
comment down below of you would want one
moving over to HTC new reports have the
company working on a Windows Phone
variants of the HTC One and this is not
new the company has done this before
just pitched to wonder why HTC hasn't
done it before and probably the answer
is because obviously windows phone
hasn't really taken off as many have
expected it but the question is now to
you would you like a windows phone HTC
One I would now let's talk about Apple's
iPhone 5s or whatever apples gonna call
that thing we've got the first leaked
photograph of what the phone is going to
look like and it's got some hardware
differences that you didn't see between
the 4 and 4s or 3g and 3gs this time we
get a dual LED flash and we also get a
bigger battery in comparison to the
current iphone 5 and well obviously you
know Apple does a lot of prototyping
this could be just a tester of what a
dual LED flash would do for the iphone I
think it would do much but anyways let's
see what Apple brings to the table
eventually it'll probably happen in
October LG is up next as the company is
now sending out press invites for an
event to happen on August seventh and
that's not Eva in Berlin efa's happening
on the first week of September so the
question is when are we getting the
reports have it that the company is
launching their LG optimus g2 which
would probably be the first smartphone
out there with a snapdragon 800
processor to launch as it happen with
the s4 pro
Optimus G M obviously we do have a very
interesting design coming with this
phone it's very much expected so stay
tuned for the rumors this would be a
very good phone for many and finally for
the interesting news of the day you know
Sony is not new to smartwatches they're
actually one of the first companies to
come out with a concept years ago and we
all know that crashed and burned now the
company is sending out press invites for
jun 26 events happen in china and
judging by the teasers everything is
about a SmartWatch and the question is
what this new SmartWatch do that the
previous one didn't in order for it to
be interesting so that makes you to the
question of the day what would you want
from a SmartWatch what specific feature
do you think would be the killer feature
that would make you want to use a
SmartWatch in my particular case a watch
for me is more of a fashion statement so
I would really want that thing to be
elegant useful and not necessarily just
a companion for my smartphone I would
love for it to do something that's
better than a smartphone but you know
that would allow me not to need to pull
it out but do it better than the
smartphone but anyways leave us a
comment down below what would be your
killer feature and of course for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tell the
world make sure you follow us on varga
