going on but you were growing this thing
as i recall back in May animal and um
before we get too far into this too
early even tell everyone we only have a
few people watching right now that
number is rapidly going to grow good
every rule but tell everyone who's
watching right now what kind of
questions we need today Steven hot tip
its Lumia questions yeah we've got the
new Lumia 950 on hand here we're gonna
be talking about it yeah just right oh
and what were you remember we're gonna
have a lot to say and I have questions
I'm sure these guys have answers for me
but the rest of you probably have your
own we want to hear these we want to
answer them on the air the only way we
can do that is if you ask them so when
hangouts head on over to that Q&amp;amp;A panel
on the side there type up your answers
the other viewers will rank up the ones
that they like the best maybe we'll just
pick the ones that we like the best
because we're the ones in charge here
will enter those on the air and if you
maybe think of something later on about
the Lumia 950 or anything else we're
talking about shoot us an email
cast at pocketnow.com we'll do our best
to answer it on a future show here so I
the q and A's or podcast pocketnow.com
email we want to hear from you guys we
want to hear from you and my favorite
one right now my favorite Q&amp;amp;A currently
waiting the queue is from Miguel Angel
Rodriguez who says it's his first time
watching live thanks for coming welcome
aboard sir damn I'm ready to talk about
windows which we talk about first we're
gonna sound the bell in a second we got
gadgets in hand coming up so before we
do that let's ask Adam if he can boil
down his experience it with his hands on
with the anthem of the Seas cruise ship
which happened a couple of weeks ago I
understand Adam there were robot
bartenders oh yes it was very cool very
circular cups of nuts and oil and things
or did they like make human drinks human
drinks you get to a tablet on the side
and you you press the buttons and you
choose what exactly you want in a drink
and the robot just reaches up to the
bottles and slices some lemons and now
put some ice in there I didn't know that
was included that's exciting not earlier
though when you talk about the robot
where you said robot bartenders
initially that was the pitch initially
and I was really excited but to be clear
they're not really like we're not
talking about like a face and eyes are
like a BB a troll and up to you it's
like an arm leg into the bar right it's
like this like yeah yeah yeah way better
than I thought it would be I was
expecting like Noah's coca-cola machines
where you type in on the screen and it
mixes the drinks for you like that sort
of thing but your arms is a big step I
like yeah yeah but but I I would I was I
wanted like an Android in a tuxedo with
rudimentary social skills so I could be
like listen Bucky I'm having a rough day
you know what I need and I guess of
course sir you know well there were
human bartenders like that too oh
alright it was good to know all the
human Martin does or not have not been
thrown off a ship what else was feeling
I've had them as a robot yeah yeah what
else was on there you had touch screens
everywhere as I understand it yeah and
sometimes they didn't work but it was
really good to be able to you you know
you're lost in the hallway and
soft touch screen and you could just tap
on it and it which it would say this is
where you are and then you could choose
a different deck and you could find the
restaurant that you were trying to find
and it would show like a roof how to get
there from here that's a pause and
animate line having been on a cruise
ship once in my life I can tell you it
was it's not difficult to get lost on
them even if you're like a ship nerd
like myself I've definitely got got lost
a bit this was royal caribbean right yes
okay adam has a really long right up on
this we actually can't spend much time
talking about it let me just ask you
though Adam would you would you would
you sale with with royal caribbean again
would you sale on this vessel similarly
equipped with this sort of like a yeah
you would I would go on that one again
yeah man that sounds great and meanwhile
if the ferry I take across Long Island
Sound about once a month I can't even be
bothered to put in power outlets in any
place but the bar so we have a long way
to go in maritime tech but the
navigation is beautiful I'm getting os/2
warp or something yeah webos powered by
the way the general services
administration apparently still uses HP
touch pads running webos so uh yeah old
platforms die hard man let's do this
maybe we can reintroduce some cruise
ship talk later on but we got to get
into windows that's what people have
come to see that's what I've come to
talk about sound the damn jingle and
getting together man yes yes I have a
gadget in hand it's the old it's the LG
no i have an LG watch on my wrist but
we're going to talk about that later
this is a microsoft lumia a lumia 950
and as you may notice it has a mozo
custom case on the custom back battery
door this is courtesy Adam Lane who is
on the show with us right now he
overnighted these to me he hasn't even
got his lumia yet but he overnighted his
only two accessory covers healthy
selfless what a wonderful guy uh and it
completely doesn't feel it Adam it feels
like hell I mean I haven't even given it
the smell test yet what kind of freaking
noob am I oh yeah no it smells like
Little League man that was fantastic now
I was about to pop this sucker off but I
realized that
unlike the custom excuse me I'm like the
stock case which has a little notch in
it we taking it off there is no such
notch on this so i guess you put it on
once and then you leave it on forever is
that right i've got i actually actually
having a real problem okay well this is
going to stay on this phone for the
duration of the show i was going to put
on the stock one but as you can see the
stock back cover what everyone has been
saying which by the way is what everyone
who was with Adam and me were saying
when we first went hands-on with this
thing is true it's it's very it's very
three years ago nokia it's it's it's
sort of this like you know it's
polycarbonate it feels okay but it
doesn't have anything fancy colors or
crazy neons that they used to do and
it's thinner now than then a lot of the
older Lumias by a long shot it's lighter
as well but it also lacks any sense of
being like a high-end device so this
leather cover which is by the way again
from mozo they are not a sponsor but we
want everyone to know where to get them
mo zo it really changes everything and
it even makes the sides of the phone
into like a faux metal cuz I think it's
a real ya know it's not real metal but
it looks real doesn't it yeah you don't
even need a crappy webcam in person it
looks real too oh there's the tab it's
on the front I see ok so anyway i'll
click this is the Lumia 950 Adam you
have not ordered yours yet right or you
haven't made your decision whether
you're going to buy the 950 or 950 XL is
that correct no not yet all right I've
only spent about two days with it but
we're gonna try and give you an early
inkling as far as whether you should buy
an atom you've carried a windows phone
since what 2002 yes okay and you were at
it really existed yeah when they first
exists as pocket pcs right and you were
an early adopter of Windows Phone 7
that's correct right yes yep so you are
microsoft target customer and I mean
that really specifically i spoke to
microsoft yesterday before prepping some
of this list
Adams and Hubert yeah yeah she was
number 16 on the low that's was Adams
Elaine for target customer no but
Microsoft specifically when it went on
to say during this during this interview
that there were basically three target
you know groups for the Lumia 950 950 XL
one of them the first one they wanted to
talk about was long time windows phone
fans who've been waiting for a flagship
now for 20 months since the Lumia icon
and 15 20 before that so I think my
question for is going to be did my
question to see if Sir figure out an
answer firstly is whether or not this is
a worthwhile device for a long-term
Windows fan like you Adam and well as
you know i'm excited so i'm not entirely
sure because windows 10 mobile kind of
removes a lot of features there's no
more a glance screen with the weather on
it if there's no more than that there's
no more double tap to answer your double
tap to wake either yeah there's a couple
missing things I'm sorry I didn't mean
to take that long a pause i was just
saying I I think the I think the
question is sort of a cop-out because I
think if you're a Windows Phone fan you
have to get this what else are you going
to do I mean Adam you can't even you
can't sit there and keep using your
10-20 with the Lumia with the Windows 10
you know insider build on it right i
don't know i'll keep 8.1 maybe welcome
for the longest time it felt like
everyone was saying we're waiting for
the flagship are waiting for Windows 10
well you got it now you can waiting for
the surface phone that may or may not be
coming but right this is it so let's
talk about what you get if you decide
not to stick with you Adam if you decide
that the 1020 you're willing to give up
to 41 megapixels for what looks to be a
camera that's damn near as good even
though it has about half the resolution
but let's talk about the good things you
get that you can leave behind you can
leave behind that that older screen
resolution this phone has a 4k dispersed
no it doesn't this one has a quad HD
display which really does windows 10 a
lot of justice many corners of the stock
experience are optimized for it it looks
tremendously good it runs on a
snapdragon 808 processor which
we've seen run several android phones
pretty well it runs windows 10 quite
smoothly some of the stock apps are
absolutely gorgeous I know you can get
those on some of the older phones but
like outlook looks tremendous on this
phone I must look at removable battery
microSD slot you've got it let's plus a
lot thanks and don't forget that
unlocking the phone with a fingerprint
is just so passe when you and you can
just look at it with Windows hello and
it unlocks based on an iris scan which
actually is is pretty quick this is
probably my number one like positive
surprise because while it is that it
like up the nose up to knows what I got
like a waste shot down here yeah yeah
let me uh let me do it i have i've tried
it in many different things apparently
now if you're watching this or listen to
this and you just got a 950 of your own
it is it imperative that you train
windows hello several times in several
different lighting situations because
that makes it much more accurate what's
gonna happen in the summer will work
with your like sunglasses on or
something yeah apparently will work if
you have glasses on oh actually i can
try that right now i have my fake berlin
glasses right in front of me but while
i'm putting these on and trying it out
to sea i just want to say like I found
this I thought this was going to be the
lamest thing ever I thought this was
going to be like I gotta hold it up like
this and wait I'd be like Android faith
unlock I did and you know it's actually
quite fast now it's looking for me with
the glasses move closer hello Michael ya
know it glasses don't bother which is
terrific I'll quick too yeah I know and
it does work sometimes in the dark in
pitch black it has a hard time even
though it has an IR sensor so it's a
little weird but still in beta so lets
you know good stuff can we talk about
the most fun thing do you know what the
most fun thing is going to be Adam what
come on come on that's not continuum yes
dave was gonna say Stephen yeah so maybe
we can get Jules to run the two run my
hands on once again which he was doing
before and will show everybody watching
what they're missing if they haven't
seen that hands-on yet yesterday I put I
plugged this phone into the display
doctor came with it I plugged that
display dock into an HP monitor 27
for something HP monitor and then I
paired the phone via bluetooth with the
folding microsoft keyboard they sent and
an arc mouse that I've been wanting to
buy forever so I'm glad to finally give
me please can do it they're really cool
by the way I like the arc mouse I
haven't it's been so long as I've been
able to kick-out about Microsoft this is
so much fun so I plug the thing in and I
knew it was going to be interesting I
didn't expect it to feel like magic and
maybe I should have expected to be
pretty easily impressed I don't know but
when you plug your smartphone into a
monitor and the monitor comes alive and
it looks like windows and it has a start
menu down at the bottom and it shows
you're running apps down there with it
and has a notification tray like regular
windows but it's all your phone it's
kind of like a in a sous padfone
experience blown up 40 million time like
like way cooler somehow because it's a
desktop and you know you fire up
Microsoft Word and you hammer out a
document which I did I made a stupid for
sale post tricks it was the first thing
I clicked on or you you open up the
browser and it's the full internet I
mean it'sit's Microsoft edge on a
massive 2427 inch screen whatever it is
I mean it and it's all running from your
phone it's really it's a fast it's a
fascinating feeling and impressive it is
um there's downside so we'll get to
those in a second but for the first hour
you're just sitting there as I've shown
you i was watching bob ross for a bit i
was watching netflix uh I even this is a
Productivity device clearly clearly no
well you know when I took a break from
my office binge you know um but I also
did something I never thought I'd be
able to do on a windows phone which was
have a conversation in google hangouts
on my windows phone cuz i was just using
the Microsoft edge browser to do it it
was it was profoundly satisfying in the
geekiest way I know how to express did
you do any gaming on it I tried that was
one of the down points and were gonna
get to know because you gotta remember
it's all coming from the phone so this
is a Snapdragon 808 which is a solid
processor but it's a mobile gaming
processor and the architecture is steps
that you can't like you can't go to
install a pc game cuz it's not you know
even though it's Windows 10 it's not
available run yeah Adam can you explain
that for
did why that is what why what the
processor architecture differences
between a Windows 10 Phone and Windows
10 a high-end Windows 10 computer yeah
the Windows 10 computers are all running
an x86 processor which is the
architecture that's been used on PCs for
you know decades and decades so all the
programs are designed to run on that cpu
architecture and so on the phone you
have ARM processors which are completely
different it's exactly the same problem
with windows RT you know that surface RT
could only run software that was
designed for ARM processors so right so
that's at that special thing yeah that
that's a that's a sort of downside so
you very quickly start to butt up
against the limitations of the continuum
experience you know you somebody was
asking in the chat I think isn't it
weird that the continuum makes for a
version of Windows that doesn't let you
put things into windows and it's true
you can only run apps in full screen
screen oh yeah but then when you minimum
you like when you call up the
multitasking screen it's the same as in
Windows 10 it's all the tiles with all
the you know with all the running apps
inside them and you can close pick and
choose and close them and there's other
stuff that hangouts conversation was
great but I was only able to like go
through two volleys before the phone ran
out of RAM or the browser ran out of
rama thai really the page question about
that are we talking about a voice
conversation or with video and i was
talking that was to just a text
conversation and curious what the
accessory situation is like Emily no can
connect keyboards and mice but could you
hook up like a webcam and have that on
there on your monitor and do a whole
skype chat or something it's a very good
question i mean the phone incorporates
obviously two cameras but could you
write like if it's on your desk could be
weird to be looking into that one right
all right we know android allows that
with like things like the sony QX those
those self-contained cameras you can do
Adam do you do you happen to know if the
time your head whether the windows
mobile apps for that I doubt it I have
it better I feel like if they want to
take continuum to its logical conclusion
they're probably going to enable
something like that if this
so yeah we have to listen okay well with
intel processors cuz I'm Baker part I
think they had to make a phone with it
intel x86 processor so that when you
plug it into a big mater its actual
Windows 10 right suddenly becomes much
more appealing to me sure absolutely
something with an Intel processor maybe
another gig of ram because this has
three gigs of ram which is fine but
another gig of ram wouldn't hurt right
what else is something uh I'm trying to
thinking a faster cooling saluted
charging solution rather because when
you plug this in via type see in the
screen is off a charge is fine but in
continuum the screen is always on on the
phone so it charges at this like glacial
pace part of that is because you can use
the phone as a track pad which is
actually pretty cool you don't have to
go buy a separate mouse the phone can
service your ads nice fat yeah I would
love to see something like with the
surface book where you have like a
dedicated GPU in the UH in the continuum
dog yeah oh yeah that would be
interesting and the surface but proves
that Windows 10 can handle that just
fine you can just plug in plug and play
Wow um I want to leave time for for Adam
to ask questions I'm gonna leave time
for some of the QA but I just want to
touch on a couple of the the negatives
we ran into as well uh I really like
doing my email on this phone I like
Outlook I like the way the calendar
works i like all the stock apps are
really pretty and really beautiful as
always but for the how long Stephen how
long have you been doing this podcast
duh 20 minutes ish no I'm over the
entire thing to hold the whole show the
whole series oh yes I don't know okay
alright so 2012 yeah I've been saying
this about Windows Phone since 2012 all
the stock stuff is beautiful the third
party apps are are not there and not
only are they not there they're
backsliding where we've banks leaving
the hotel tonight one of my favorite
apps of all time just announced that it
is laying people off and as a result
they can't support their windows
development apps anymore anymore the
facebook app i think the beta release
just got a new release and we're gonna
get you one left they don't get around a
building him but um yeah but that's the
Microsoft one the Microsoft one just
left beta facebook is building its own
app suite so we're waiting for
that until then the existing app is
terrible the Twitter app is two versions
behind the instagram app is three
versions behind its it's a wasteland and
it sucks so that sucks so what if your
if you care about any of that this still
isn't the phone for you so I asked
Microsoft I was like well who's then who
is this going to be for and specifically
in terms of continuum who is this going
to be 4 and Microsoft's had this really
cool target customer of these shared
workspaces you know like we were and
stuff like that and their whole thing
was well what if you had instead of a
bunch of computers at these workspaces
with all their associated expenses and
security rationale and so what if you
just had a whole bunch of DisplayPort
docks and monitors and keyboards and
people who had windows phones could come
in and plug in and just work from there
and then take their phones with them
when they go it's a great idea but this
is going to make the kind of capital
investment with the windows market share
being what it is that's the thing I want
I do wonder if Microsoft is going to be
willing to maybe oh you hate some of
that cost up front great like a way to
get it out there kind of a loss leader
but to make that investment people say
oh I could be doing all this if only I
had the right phone right right we're
like the immediate analogy jumps my mind
is the starbucks charging pads the PMA
charging pads they put in everything I
way I always talk about these things
right and people I just watch it almost
everyday people come in they try to put
their iPhone on the hood so cool how
come it doesn't work it's like oh you
got to get a samsung like it just turns
the coffee shop into this massive
marketing cloud for the galaxy line so
it's not a perfect analogy but what do
you think about that Adam do you think
that this would this kind of thing would
work to them or is this a continuum kind
of like a pipe dream I think it's a
repeat of the surface RT and Windows RT
issue just because of the the
compatibility issue with the
architecture if it was like the surface
pro is is becoming pretty popular
because a cam run all those win32
programs that everybody uses in business
but no without that
it's kind of well I can run office and
outlook but what else present situation
going to be getting a lot better going
forward I mean Microsoft has for a while
now been talking about universal apps
and it didn't really happen with Windows
8 you were hoping but now with Windows
10 I mean a year from now are we going
to see this app compatibility issue
become much less of an issue than it is
now or these legacy systems gonna just
refuse to go away and just drag the
whole experiment down that's a really
good question been 30 years right time
we tried to get rid of these legacy
programs yeah protected mode man Adam um
you have written a number of pieces that
I've liked very much at pocket now
because you and I share I think similar
feelings about the current state of
windows r on mobile I think windows
phone 7 was groundbreaking and very bold
windows phone 8 sort of continued some
of that but now we have Windows 10 which
is beautiful and a nice and tight and
everything but I think they've really
abandoned my yourself is really
abandoned a lot of what made Windows
Phone special can you talk about some of
that stuff just briefly like what what
you like and what you don't about the
direction the platform is taken lately
yeah like the it's starting to go with
hamburger buttons at the top which you
know we can't reach those when you're
holding the phone with one hand but
right everybody else designs there are
apps like that even though it's kind of
stupid where's windows phone 7 was
really designed to both look unique and
be readable and useful everything was
type that you could read if you were if
you understood English where's now
everything is going towards cryptic
icons that nobody understands and
there's no way of showing a tooltip
that'll tell you what it is well on some
of the windows 10 you have them at the
bottom and you press the ellipses button
and then then you can read it it's
bright but in a lot of cases these icons
are hidden and not understandable and
it takes a lot of learning to figure out
what what these things are going to do
do you think it's too late to get
microsoft to change some of this i mean
we know that in the edge browser
initially they had moved the address bar
to the top for the windows 10 1 then
there was a massive outcry and now when
you go into the edge browser they've
moved it back down to the bottom where
you can easily access it with a thumb
which makes a lot more sense do you
think that we can change some other UI
elements just in terms just by using
user feedback yeah I think so i think
they've done a lot of changes because of
all that feedback that we've been giving
them ya know i think there is hope i
think that's right here's an example of
what Adam was talking about when i go
into cortana on the phone which is a
little blown out here sorry by the way
really frustrating when you have an
AMOLED screen that you know is capable
of getting weighed more than this but
this is and I have a crappy webcam
everyone watches the show every week
what knows this but this is the dimmest
possible setting criminy for the LCD and
if you're just listening to the show the
video is just I mean I'm just holding up
a white square it's supposed to be black
or gray on the background there that's
supposed to be great because its course
I'm supposed to don't worry it's yeah
the black is real black it's actually
really beautiful display I just wish you
got dimmer but in Cortana if I want to
access the notebook or settings or
anything I have to go to that hamburger
button in the upper left which is this
stupid thing that iOS introduced in 2007
and God knows why everybody copied them
and it's the worst would wait did it it
was a facebook that it what the dinner
first that's why I seem to have heard
wait so Facebook did it what how do i
wait before the iphone existed yeah i'm
pretty sure the early I iphone had all
the buttons at the bottom and in tabs at
the bottom no I mean it had tabs in some
apps but the back button has always been
in the upper left on the on iOS right oh
that's right the backbone yeah yeah the
bag I were talking about the hamburger
I'm sorry we're we're talking it sort of
doesn't matter it seems like whatever
the most useful control is it's going to
be placed in the upper left on average
on how to parse iphone the first iphone
had a screen size that you could
actually reach right with your fingers
right so it wasn't an issue
yeah dr. have giant screens all the
bunch at the top you can't reach that
yeah Stephen did you get logged up by
Google a and D authentication happens to
the best of us friend Adam what is there
is there stuff that you've been sitting
on I know you gotta go soon so I want to
make sure that we get every last
opportunity to to answer some of your
questions here which will be the users
questions as well so while I look at the
Q&amp;amp;A hit me with with what you want to
know broiler um well I have one thing to
mention a good throw back if you're
looking at continuum search pocket now
for the see Leo red fly companion from
2008 that did the same thing on windows
mobile 6 what are you talking about what
are you talking about whatever their
review this was it was a laptop size
device with you know a large cup size
screen full keyboard you plug it into a
stone oh just with a wire like a wire
into it okay and you've had a larger
screen windows phone well windows mobile
at the time actually Wow and we do have
a video review oh my god we had a look
on that splash screen all you got to do
folks if you want to make logo for
yourself all you gotta do just
italicized some block text on a blue
background boom done temple red fly all
one word looking up everybody re DFL why
this thing looks like something that
Stephen shank would have piled up in his
office next to his old speaking of oh
what fun I'm gonna watch a video Thank
You Adam so do you I wonder if content I
hope continuum doesn't go the way of the
red fly cool uh while we have you on the
air I want to say that Sunil I'm just
going to say so Neil has a great great
question here given Microsoft has shown
a lot of interest in making dope android
apps and the general lack of apps for
Windows Phone do you see Microsoft ever
making an android phone or a dual boot
this is a question I've been thinking of
recently Adam what do you think
well there was a time when they had the
nokia X and they were still selling that
as microsomes oh that kind of counts as
an android phone yeah well they kill
they killed that right quick though I
think that was an Elop experiment or you
know just a nokia mutiny he couldn't
couldn't go down uh oh god i still did
sad thinking about that go ahead there
have been rumors about dual boot windows
phone android phones from other
manufacturers so it sounds like it could
be a possibility it's absolutely it's
technically possible i mean we saw the
One m8 did it just fine it didn't dual
boot necessarily but yeah identical
hardware just loaded with different
software I feel like Windows is much
more secure boot system than a lot of
Android can of a very lockdown boot and
certainly we carry carrier editions tend
to go this way but I think it's a lot
harder to put android on a Windows Phone
then it might be vice versa if that code
were available mm-hmm unless it was an
hd2 oh of course i can run everything
Jan strassky Nexus sick I like this math
Nexus 6p + Chromebook 499 + 2 49 versus
lumia 950 + doc bus monitor + keyboard
mouse 5 99 + 99 + let's say two hundred
dollars if continuum is for someone who
does not have a computer why would you
prefer the Microsoft option it's a
compelling question it's the question I
asked I mean do you is there is there a
compelling reason to choose the more
expensive option in this case that you
guys can think of I don't know I feel
like with Microsoft would love it if you
didn't need to go out and buy all this
new hardware to use the continuum doc it
does have hdmi out doesn't it yes it
does so you plug it into your television
in the living room not good and do type
of type it up you don't have to get a
fancy bluetooth keyboard you can plug a
USB one in as a cheap is free just steal
one from work probably a bunch in a
closet somewhere or I should mention
that you can also use it with miracast
as well so if you have a miracast Amy
already there's your monitor boom yeah I
think that's right I think Microsoft is
hoping that this accessory hardware were
either
just in your home already but more
pertinently exists in your office
already or be a compelling enough cell
to your office purchaser that hey we can
build an ecosystem out of this and we
can take this you can take your phone
and there is something deeper to upgrade
phones when yea rather you invest once
in the keyboards mice monitors at all
and then you get a new phone every
couple years everyone can upgrade on
their their own schedule and it's just
it's a lot easier than managing all
these like big model with the computers
and I'm starting I'm hesitant to sound
like a shell here because I'm just sort
of I am admittedly just dreaming up
excuses to make continuum work but there
is something compelling about and i said
this with the ax suzanne phone to know
the ax sous padfone yeah as well there
is something compelling did not having
to do with the cloud not having to deal
with like it was this on this unit or
not to have to move this file it's all
on the phone it's you're just changing
what you used interact with the phone
and there's something really cool about
that in a very like 1997 concept of the
future kind of way which sounds like a
dig but it's not it's like it's it's
actually kind of kind of cool
inconvenient Adam go ahead alright I
gotta take off you gotta go man adamant
people love seeing you come on the show
more please okay well thanks a lot man
not a great time take it easy later see
ya Adam Lane giver of the leatherback
for the phones windows phone expert
since before I was born great beard
holder things all great things all
things to all people yeah great to see
Adam appearing on the pod says I is to
van Oh who's been with us before thank
you is Finn how's that camera asks arjun
pc in our last few minutes of this
segment it seems to be it seems it's a
lot of fun to use i'll tell you that
having a dedicated camera button steven
is it the bee's knees I wouldn't know I
ever had a phone with dedicated camera
button do you harassing on man you are
missing out because yeah I just pressed
and held it and it activated lika no I
take that back my first gen droid did
your first generation droid oh yeah that
did have it yeah i hearing you right you
true but yeah this camera is it seems to
be quite capable not quite the not quite
the what's it called Oh like
annihilating it landscape obliterating
superiority that the Lumia 1020 enjoyed
not just because the 1020 was a massive
sensor in like a 41 megapixel cameras
sucked and the iphone camera was good
but it wasn't like or whatever windows
phone had an opportunity to to go and
make itself the camera platform and it
did do it successfully yeah for a bit
and then well we missed out on a cycle
and now we have this sort of mmm-hmm
this hardware yeah yeah yeah oh gosh now
will but will answer that question more
completely in the full review Thor gleam
do not worry about it Jonas come out
Microsoft should put multi-window
support on windows 10 mobile once it's
more polished yeah would agree with that
I I am a big fan of multi windows and a
matter how small the screen gets bring
them on me too I mean he's my pinky I
poked around that little close icon in
the corner there yeah that's is around
we'll just need a full screen calculator
you know certain things are meant or
smaller windows that's that's exactly
right well you would you like to pop
over things like the lake that LG does
oh absolutely I guess wish it you know
work to eat it was more built in and you
can see this with every app Amanda Lopez
it house battery life and do you think
it's worth it to switch from Android I
don't think the battery life is very
good but not even how big is it long
enough it's 3,000 milliamp hours which
you know huh good times right but my
deal is this I read an article on wired
the other morning on this phone which
was a text only article it took me
twenty one minutes to read it or son or
25 minutes to read it it was an article
about um Star Wars and JJ Abrams from
stuff and it was great article and I
enjoyed myself and then when I was done
I found that
even at half brightness or maybe even
twenty-five percent brightness I can't
recall that 25 minutes of reading a text
only article in the browser cost me
eleven percent of my battery go that
should not be the case now but
girlfriend report similar drain on her
iphone 6 period not success but that's a
much smaller battery and the iphone 6 is
not lauded for its crazy endurance so
that makes sense this is a 3000 milliamp
hour battery pack so i don't know if i
have the OS to blame her if it's
Microsoft edge or if it's the quad HD
display but and it does run hot by the
way I'm cooking up this piece in my head
Stephen I think it's about time somebody
wrote the piece that says the Snapdragon
808 runs feels like it runs hotter than
the 810 or anything else for degree yeah
every phone / I've held powered by the
808 like the the Privy experis this is
how to yeah without your infrared
thermometer there I did did you see I
did that a blackberry prive review I saw
that yeah yeah if they think got up to
119 degrees crazy anyone not to cook
fish other question do you think it's
worth it to switch from Android no not
if you're not if you're built into the
Android ecosystem that if you're baked
into it every periodically I will go
check others other reviewers because a
lot of reviews landed today because some
people had our oh yes all Haslett yeah
some people had the phone for longer
then some people had the phone for just
as long and decided to do a two-day
review I ain't judging but anyway I
loved many of those reviews I actually
don't think I found one that I didn't
like and even the ones who are from like
not not not independent sites but like
you know Windows Windows fan sites yeah
even those basically said the same thing
and which I was which I was not
surprised to see like know if you're if
you're depend on the Android ecosystem
or the iOS ecosystem now you didn't know
this isn't the phone that's gonna that's
that's going to make it worth it for you
to leave like there's a lot of cool
stuff here but it's still the inherent
limitations of windows are still there
once again we're waiting for the long
term play we're waiting for these
universe apps to happen Steven those
context links can you tell me while I'm
looking at the QA can you tell me what
what we haven't gotten to I think that
there was some news
about the bridge the windows the iOS to
Windows apps bridge can you brief us on
that well the iOS the these are the
tools and Microsoft announced back in
the spring to make it easy for
developers to bring existing apps from
other competing mobile platforms to
Windows 10 as a whole not just mobile
but also on desktop as well like I've
mentioned a bunch of ways that
developers could bring apps win32
compatibility with you know layer on
there html5 web based apps would also
iOS and Android stuff and iOS we saw
Microsoft release early tools a few
months back for developers to start
bringing objective c based programs over
to windows 10 and it's coming along well
the company has posted an update
recently about the new versions of the
tool better support for some api's and
things it's coming along strongly expect
to see I don't know how many iOS
developers will take Microsoft up on the
offer to to bring their apps because
it's not a lot of effort to it's
designed not to be a lot of effort to
bring them over to windows 10 but again
there has to be you know the hook there
to make it worth their while if there's
gonna be the users and they're
interested in doing this or if the
people who already are using it they
have it on their iPhone they don't
really want to them Windows 10 that
remains to be seen android though is is
a little bit more of a sticky subject
because it was supposed to be this
Android compatibility layer built in and
astoria yeah that's it and zaps but have
the same easy access to tools to bring
their existing Android apps over to
windows 10 now that sort of sounds like
it's falling apart and if it does happen
it's not going to be nearly out of a
timeline we were hoping for Microsoft's
not developing as many resources this as
it is to the iOS program it's just not
sounding very good that's interesting
because you would think you know not not
knowing more about the the inner
workings of this that Android
compatibility it seems easy we've seen
lots of other platforms do this already
to one extent or another and open source
it feels like it should be really easy
to make
a system like Windows 10 able to run you
know we have BlueStacks and stuff like
this or emulators out there shore but is
this low level and really polished way
of having Apps package for Windows 10
that are initially Android is proving to
be far more difficult than I think a lot
of people gave it credit for yeah people
are asking why it's if we have any idea
why Microsoft has dropped it I don't
even think that they've made that
official yet the middle earth angel
everyone is saying that yeah I hear from
multiple sources that it's just
completely bag it's impossible to see
all the public things they are saying
about the windows for iOS Briggs and and
to realize that because haven't been
making these announcements on Android
tools the silence is telling in and of
itself yeah indeed which you know that's
fine it I OS certainly has a great app
ecosystem so i don't i don't know if
they can entice enough iOS developers to
develop for Windows 10 you know I think
they are going to be relying a lot on
this promise of the combined platform
like your writing it for Windows 10 so
you're writing up for desktop laptop and
tablet on me all I have stuff so uh
we'll have to see how it goes but it is
a little discouraging to to see that I
thought this was gonna launch I thought
windows 10 mobile was going to launch
with that stuff in place you know yeah
there's a lot of stuff we thought they
went long to it thank God that the
windows hello did end up being available
even in Vega I was just gonna say Jenna
again in the chat at what feature
besides continuum do you like the most
about the 950 and windows 10 mobile yeah
I through the windows hello is is
getting up there I think not just a
gimmick I don't know maybe it is but I'm
allowed to like a gimmick right yeah if
it works well I like how it works too it
doesn't like take a photo of your iris
or anything it like correlates positions
of Mark points on our iris if no way
it's different like a hash I'm not doing
a retina scan or anything so elaborate
there right how well it is I mean it
seems very good at recognizing you once
you train it for that have you tried
this with any other people who might it
be of similar bill to see if it's able
if they're able to trick it into
authenticating now
but apparently this is safe against even
twins all right we heard about that yeah
so I and I don't know i'll try it with a
photo of myself and but i don't think
it's going to work i think this thing is
pretty in pink the infrared bit might be
to help distinguish against photos it
could well be yeah because it can't just
be for nighttime soap because it doesn't
do well enough at nighttime arjun pc
both she and PMA for 950 right yes both
wireless chattering standards are
supported fast charging their well it's
USB type-c so it charges relatively
relatively quickly anyway i don't know i
don't know what we're watching on the
media feed but i have a feeling i like
it oh wait yeah I don't hello this is
the video for hello yeah that sculpture
in the control no I get it god that's a
sad song in that hmm anyway we'll get to
a couple of those folks keep on dropping
your knowledge or your questions image
hat we're gonna get to some of those we
got to get to the ol news bit if you
know what I mean Steven I purposely kept
the news count low because i have to go
can I be can I I you know what have to
go do you some truth yeah if it sounds
like like the scent I like the red light
when it's trying to read your face by
the way um it that be infrared LED or
just like a notifications the infrared
then yeah I wish Windows Phone had a
notification light Jules is gonna be so
happy with us now that we've switched
segments and are still talking about the
windows from yeah you know that do you
have to play the song backwards now
reckon we haven't said the trigger word
yet um I have to go unbox the ipad pro
which is such a tech reviewer problem
but I really do feel like a like
burdened to do it to be frank I've been
trying to get out of it all week because
we have the ipad pro in house but we
don't have the keyboard or the pencil so
i don't know why i hate the fact that I
have to like start covering it without
those crucial accessories but yeah oh
it's also yeah but I don't know I i
think that i think that the important
thing to remember for
everyone frankly is that the ipad pro is
just another device and you know
websites websites are a little more
important than devices you ever built a
website Steven uh yeah it's hard like
this is hard it is hard a building

Squarespace for your support of the

build it beautiful Steven there are some
troubling trends in the smartphone space
if you are Microsoft and some great
wonderful trends to celebrate if you are
hallway is not correct
now I feel right Ken all their backing
on who's cheering all right yeah while
we always seeing some really great
market share improvements over the
course the past year now it's up like to
something points globally it's now
looking like a seven nearly an eight
share of the market this is well the
company's been going for for a long
while now it's been building up its its
international stature Nexus 6p is
certainly not hurting at all but that's
still new here and I don't think
affecting these numbers just yet so this
trend is probably only going to continue
but while always doing quite well other
manufacturers are seeing their fortunes
turn a different direction novo Motorola
they not doing so good microsoft also
when those phone users have sort of been
it's doing well in certain markets
around the globe so a third biggest
right well that's not saying a hell of a
lot is it well I'd better than better
than fifth biggest I guess yeah yeah um
but it's been losing some share gonna
get all just today you deal with it all
right I'm just I'm just a Microsoft
apologist for the show you understand
well with Adam left someone has to be
yeah but uh we haven't had the really
strong phones for a while now like we
said it's been 20 months since we got a
real flagship model so maybe this is
gonna be just a dip and not the
beginning of a slide a dip comes back up
beginning and end up there so and I'm
not gonna say the sky is falling just
yet but Microsoft you might want to
start carrying an umbrella around word
mmm yeah they're all kinds of tactical
questions we got answer it nobody though
is having quite the week that LG is this
has been the strangest roller coaster in
a long time so last week if you didn't
tune in to the podcast I was on the air
talking about the watch i'm wearing
right now the LG watch urbane second
additional te super awesome on our time
and what you know i was actually having
a pretty good time with it she had a
little struggles with it right but by
and large it's a nice looking watch as
this next generation android we're here
with cellular connectivity there's a lot
to like about this there isn't it even
looks pretty good i mean it has to be
big to do its job but it actually looks
pretty good for a big ol watch so it's
not surprising you might be interested
in going out and picking one of these
guys up only well good luck with that
now so some people did though right it
was on Zeile from what was I like three
or four days it was on sale for maybe a
little bit more almost a week AT&amp;amp;T
announced it early in the month verizon
followed up I think stale sales started
at the carrier's like yeah like last
week sometime but a Friday or something
yeah yeah and now LG all of a sudden
saying nope we're done with this
something's wrong with it we're not
saying what but uh uh a game over
outright canceling their plans for the
smart one hasn't been like any press
release or anything about this that I've
seen but they sent out these notices do
they let us present yeah I told you yes
I do sorry i meant his pass that on to
you right away and you had to site
another ya know we had this yeah but so
yeah something's wrong something wrong
with a hardware we're taking they
mentioned something with the hardware
with a czy unfixable via software update
but we don't know what i mean you you
had problems with the cellular
connection right we're not drop the
signal and no yeah i think i'd problems
with the without Wi-Fi or it was one of
the connections I don't know oh it jet
yeah it was wonky with cellular you
require to restart at one point but that
I it was like a very easily fixed
problem that I never came back it was
just one of those things that sometimes
happens so it sort of thing that sounds
like the glitch that you might be able
to you patch via the sort of bug fix
update so always come like a month or
two into a new products like right so
what the hell was so very very wrong I
wonder if it's doing something wrong
unlike a on a regulatory level this
sounds like this the very sudden
reaction the you know we're not trying
to fix us we're just stopping this now
to me suggests this might be like an FCC
thing like it's it's broadcasting a tad
too high power or doing something that
would get them in big trouble huh well
actually right yeah there's um there's
so yeah I've got a little something
yeah it wasn't i don't think i can say
any of this but yeah so yeah how about
that sorry so we do have one hold on to
that you gotta collect those like them
on your hands that's the thing like
there was no notice there was no like
please return all units immediately for
immediate destruction and maybe implies
that my theory there is not right at all
pick me I don't know and there was also
like no no like coverage stoppage order
or anything like that not that they
could have done that but they didn't
even try to be like also if you could
just not review it that'd be great
they've just like sorry we're not
selling this anymore sorry have you ever
seen anything like this from a product
we've covered I was trying to recall it
was anybody anything has been canceled
in such a manner where it was out Adonai
like there was that thing with there was
some like huawei phone on t-mobile they
stopped selling because i thought people
were gonna rip the battery out of it do
you remember this oh yeah there's the
zmax there was a ZTA Ozzy team yeah I
just I'm yeah i don't know i mean
there's so many components in these
things that it could be could be any one
of them let's let's let's just move on
and hope that there's a LG watch urbane
third edition on it and what a time it
doesn't happen holiday shopping I know I
know oh Jules Jules is surmising
that the watch band has is a is
poisonous it was actually a dog flea
collar on there and when it turned out
to me move this over here I'm gonna keep
wearing my hand I mean I've already got
a paired to my devices not that I've got
a windows phone now so screw it i don't
i don't get to wear anything but the man
let's move on um what the hell is the
next time of thing what the hell in de
is it the image is that the good morning
america think now it's better pepsico
because i felt this lacking in my life
where we have phones associated with
various brands you can go out get your
Porsche phone get your aurori phone
where's Ben the soft-drink phone man
Ivan
who has got it by the way if you are if
you feel inclined to go watch the Pepsi
man video on youtube if you haven't seen
it yet don't do it at your office it is
not safe for work but it is hilarious so
if there are no children around watch it
on your phone hey watch it on your yet
watch it on your Lumia hook it up to
your big you're big thing anyway this is
not related at Pepsi man this is almost
as ridiculous it's a Pepsi phone vagina
and I like this headline shamelessly
shamelessly Pepsi is seeking
crowdfunding for this because you know
they don't have enough money to just
like I was judgmental when double did
the crowdfunding game for it's a for the
pebble time but this is just that I can
I can rationalize that if there's no
right no making sense understand why pet
what would do a thing like that but this
is Pepsi they made more money than
coca-cola in the last night Cody's nice
interior softer sixty six billion
dollars in income or something I don't
know if that's grows her net that's a
probably indicates that I did you do and
do not have a degree in business and you
know that's my money my complaint about
this thing I mean there's a lot of
reasons to have objections to the
existence of this product to how it's
being sold I just don't think it's Pepsi
enough I mean there's this little tiny
silver Pepsi logo that's barely on the
back there it's smaller than the
fingerprint scanner I wouldn't like a
big blue and red swoop going around I
want it like a Pepsi phone absolutely
the Pepsi phone I completely agree the
jewels makes the point that this is also
yum brands behind this so it could just
as easily like hotel phone taco bell
phone talk about phone they should
rebrand the engage as a time would have
been sweet missed opportunity every one
opportunity marketing people KFC what
would the say the Taco Bell app is
fantastic is it have you used this thing
no I've used the Domino's happened
that's a really good app 20 if you use
and listeners automation things now you
have one week left in this promotion if
you use the Taco Bell app and you pay
with a your visa card half price
damn mm-hmm half-price tacos get on
while they last get them while they are
room temperature mm-hmm speaking of
getting things being given things good
morning america for some reason I
haven't read this story because this is
ridiculous giggles wrote it so maybe
he'll let us know in the chat apparently
there was for some reason good morning
america decided have a 40 hour long
episode this is a 40th anniversary
Madison oh it's like this out of nowhere
okay okay well good for them then that's
all excellent morning would like to
watch TV at some people like you asleep
early hours of the day and I woke up
earlier than usual today and I had like
I had a hangover and I had not done any
drinking last night it was one of those
things Rose like man this is Peabody
decided to hate you I was reading you
know what you know why it was I fell
asleep last night reading about fatal
familial insomnia have you heard of this
I am familiar with it it's not a prion
based it is a prion disease kills you by
not allowing you to sleep and there's no
cure it's it's terrifying read about it
if you want to be terrorists so
definitely read about this before going
to bed before going to bed yeah let's do
some great dreams that way I didn't
sleep very well last night but anyway
good morning america gave away the used
a 40 hour non-stop broadcast that
started at five p.m. eastern time on
november seventeenth and went for 40
hours from there and uh apparently if
you were near abc's times square studios
the COO of blackberry gave away 40 privs
to people which look at times i like
this this is some relatively high
profile promotion for blackberry which I
don't like blackberry it exists in in
the US and these people who are very
strong supporters of it but you don't
really see a lot least I don't see a lot
of blackberry promotional efforts out
there like you know you want it if you
want it you go and get it but in volume
and I don't think they're under any
illusions that these things are gonna
going to to move in Cygnus Microsoft is
very much playing a long game I think I
exact that's that's the what I've been
meaning to say thank you stephen for you
much-needed brevity um what's up with
the hair michael i missed the hair ivan
you run out of prod
what's going on what I said what I felt
I woke up with a hangover I didn't even
get to drink to play trackpad and
keyboard as of right now it's rare to
find monitors mouse and keyboard that
doesn't have a cpu tower with it and i
think this solves it in addition it'll
be so useful for places like public
transit platens or study hall that don't
have computers who wants to the type
stuff on their phone for more than 15
minutes what do you guys think this is
just like that was at Redfin front of
the red red red fly yeah it is but the
red fly had like a cable right like you
couldn't plug it on right away yeah it
is just like the real fight I don't
think it would go very far I'd but we
were just saying before how the PadFone
was such a cool idea just wasn't
executor terribly well I'd like to see
this yeah but there's some big problems
making this I don't think that when
you're building a laptop that the the
big expense is the the processor the RAM
it's the display it's the batteries
other combustible in making the the
shell of the whole thing so they're
still going to be expensive and it's a
be difficult to sell users on this with
yes if you had a doc style thing you can
upgrade your phone you're essentially
upgrading laptop at the whole time it
might be a better long-term investment
but I don't know that it's going to be
that easy to convince shoppers of this
also you know for talking about a doc
and not a cable like that old Windows
Mobile one used all right how is it
going to fit every phone and fit them
well you know we're dealing with
different sizes here the continued on
Doc that connect via cable you have to
worry about the phones shape and size
with a doc it's a lot more complicated
and especially with a mobile device
where you want things to be nice and
snug and secure that's a lot more
difficult to do universally yeah
ultimately and I know we're watching an
old the actual hands-on video this thing
in Brandon looks like he's 14 it's great
um I think that these are the this is a
great example of a product that I would
like and that i think i would actually
use I don't think there are many people
who are who share that opinion though
particularly not for the amount of money
it would probably cost mm but I am that
doesn't change the fact that I think
it's that I would probably buy one if I
were going to go all in with the windows
ecosystem you want to
Ryan's email yeah okay Ryan writes hey
guys had a quick question in regards to
continue on so this new feature is only
for brand new Lumia devices announced
with continuum I'm interested in windows
so him for quite some time this features
definitely a game-changer but why
couldn't the update come to older phones
like the Lumia icon the specs seem fine
if not just a little bit underpowered
and older devices would probably sell
like hotcakes if users girls to take
advantages new feature seems to me
Microsoft shooting themselves in the
foot by turning away interested parties
like myself what are your thoughts do I
expect too much of them thanks guys love
the show as always thanks Ryan ah this
is a very good question and I think a
lot of us were asking this right when
continuous first announced were like a
Microsoft was very clear this is going
to need new hardware have we heard a
good reason for why this is no I was
actually just looking at the microsoft
forums for there are a lot of
discussions about this and a lot of
answers back and forth and it seems like
some of the hardware on some of the
older Lumas would be capable of doing it
I'm sure there's probably a hacky way to
do it these things you know that the new
Lumia is our custom sort of custom build
for this you've got USB type-c which is
a faster you know which offers faster
data through it right and then you've
got the wireless option as well of
course right because remember we're
sending you dealing with a live display
of percival resolution here not to
mention communication with accessories
all simultaneously over that one USBC
port that's a lot of data to be going
through there right and I think that I'm
sure that it could be made to work with
USB 2.0 devices but i think the bottle
like there would come this is i have not
done the research to answer this
question properly but it seems to me
that if this phone struggles to when I
the browser open in continuum i was
using Microsoft edge to browse full on
web pages it was cool it was fun but it
also couldn't handle more than a handful
of tabs at a time and the tabs wouldn't
reload I'd go between you know it's not
like a desktop where you can click
between 85 tabs and it's fine like I'd
go from the fourth one to the first one
and it would sit there and it wouldn't
immediately reload it would sit there
and like fool me into thinking the page
was still there and then it would
finally cave and but I'm just playing I
got to reload it and then it would take
forever to reload it and that's with a
modern you know hexa core processor with
the Lumia icon what are we talking about
on snap
800 there and what was the RAM on there
more importantly yeah I think it was
only i think was on the two gigs so you
know that the i think there is a
hardware bottleneck i'm certain that
it's there's a hacky way to get around
it if you feel like Microsoft is just
being greedy and trying to take your
money but I don't think that's what
they're doing I think they're it really
is a performance thing I think it's
right on the edge even with modern
hardware guys even if it weren't I find
it hard to fall Microsoft for wanting to
use us as a feature to sell new devices
here total is it really been investing
in these lower end models here it can't
be making much money at each individual
device here it's been getting them out
there but we look into the more capable
windows phone devices these are already
old I guess something there's an
interest in being able to move old stock
sure it looks good for us if we can you
know pick some used ones up cheaply but
what good does that do microsoft i mean
yeah i could increase its user base
maybe a little I don't know the people a
lot of people would transition to
Windows Phone Windows 10 mobile just
because of continuum thinking about it
it makes sense to convince him to pick
up some new hardware to devise something
or Microsoft's going to be making more
money off this and with newer hardware
they're going to be more likely to stick
with the operating system for you know a
year or two going forward now so I find
it hard to judge them too harshly you
know it's crazy about about this
experience those like I had a I had a
fundamental moment where my brain
chemistry sort of changed where I
realized when I realized that I could
run almost anything I needed to in the
browser through continuum it was when I
was having that hangouts conversation
and I was sort of just blowing my own
mind having a hangouts conversation on a
windows phone and I think if there was a
way to leverage that in a more portable
form factor like one of these tablets
are like the read of modern version of
the red fly that was affordable enough
and svelte and wasn't didn't do all the
things wrong that the PadFone did on
Android I think that might be it still
wouldn't be huge seller obviously but I
think it would make a lot of Windows
Phone fans happy because there's a big
part of me that still wants to use a
windows phone on a daily basis because
of the interface advantages
really is a very pretty OS but I can't
afford to give up the google stuff but I
wouldn't have to if I could just use a
browser all the time and even if that
meant plugging a windows phone into a
relatively large tablet say like an
8-inch tablet i think i would still deal
with it I don't know it sounds like
someone who's in the other room when
they're thinking up Firefox OS and do we
gonna need you know some native apps
here not enough evidence would be in the
browser it'll be fine yeah it's true I
know Oh apps yeah stupid apps so 2010
finally our last piece of listener mail
comes to us from unicorn workhorse which
i think is and who made a t-shirt oh
yeah commemorate John Chen's beautiful
demo of the print which is this just
mean wasn't a very beautiful demo of the
of the Privy poor John Chen was a little
befuddled import CEO mr. Chen excuse me
was a little befuddled by how Android
ran and you know with this joke has sort
of come and gone but it was it's a
pretty funny t-shirt that has a picture
of a proven it says it runs the Google
and if you want it you should find
unicorn workhorse on redbubble there it
is I was I was hoping Jules would would
be able to display it does run the
google the blackberry prive does nothing
would run the google good times mmm
times great oldies great oldies yeah
we've got it we've got to get moving but
are there any any other q and A's that
are just stacked up in the judge yeah
just everyone commenting on some awful
things are currently going on with our
streaming give me a shot as if you can't
see things going on with the feeders it
just me anyone else with streaming is
there anyone seeing a multi-colored I'm
experienced a discolored involved out
there and God let's switch let's switch
forever to an all windows ecosystem
hangouts how would we do this let's go
back to skype it'll be fun by the way to
skype app on windows phone continues to
be one of the worst apps on the whole
phone leave it not saying I thought it
was so good on Android and it's open
anyway anyway mm-hmm anyway now as a
result we were getting a transparent
light show for some reason Jules is
