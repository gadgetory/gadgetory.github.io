already have a machete oh hey guys you
caught me in the middle of putting
together my shopping list for the
upcoming zombie apocalypse what no I
know what you're saying I'm a little
late to the game well that's because it
really hasn't been a good note-taking
app for Android and well since I'm the
android guy I'm behind schedule a little
bit but luckily for me and for you I
guess if you're in the same situation
that I am you know prepping for the
zombie apocalypse or the Mayan end of
the world whatever now there is a
note-taking app for Android it's really
kind of cool only for jelly bean but
there's a reason for that it's called
note if I think I'm saying that right
but let's go ahead and put together our
shopping list together and I'll show you
what I mean
we're going to have to be kind of quick
because everybody knows that that a
zombie apocalypse is coming up very fast
so the note that I just made my shopping
list it lives up here in my pull down
notification shade and you'll notice
it's not just a one liner like my HD
widgets which has been successfully
updated it's got everything in my list
really kind of cool and you'll also
notice I can't get rid of this I can't
just whoops slide it away and it's gone
reason for that is well I really need to
get those eggs before the zombies get
here so let me show you how to do it
this of course is my nexus 7 it's
running a version of jelly bean in this
case it's a cyanogenmod 10 nightly but
any device running jelly bean will work
why jelly bean you ask well these
expanded notifications are a feature of
jelly bean so to get that feature you're
going to need jelly bean that having
been said let's go ahead and fire it up
the icon is kind of plain and simple
just a cube there we'll open it up and
you'll notice I don't have anything in
here that's my first observation that
the first thing that I'd kind of like
this developer to do is you know can I
go back in and edit any of my existing
notes that'll be kind of nice because
I'm thinking I've misplaced that machete
so I'd like to add that to my list but
to the best of my knowledge I can't
there's no way to do that so what I'm
going to have to do here is pull this
down you see I still have my
notification up there I'm going to clear
those with that button and it says all
ongoing notifications have been cleared
so now I can start over again so let's
type in groceries and i think i spelled
that right whatever and we'll just do
this again we'll have milk will have
eggs will have hollow points they have
better stopping power that that's the
main reason and i don't know how to
spell mache much hit hey uh sure okay
that looks good and you know what while
we're there let's pick up some MREs
meals ready to eat you never know when
you need to eat on the run so I've just
gone ahead and made this in a list
format
let me go ahead and change the DIA icon
here because that lining thing wasn't
all that all that good let's see um hey
you know let's do a shield up here
because this is like for protecting us
against the zombies so there we go now
when I pull it down I don't have it up
there just yet so let's put in an
ongoing notification now this means this
ongoing and notification means that it's
always going to be up here you can't
just dismiss it okay and then we'll add
that using the + button that user
interface could be a little bit better
just in my opinion but you know what
we'll call it good to do a summary pick
this up before the zombies and reduced
content muy I can't spell here typing
with one hand one finger when you're
trying to get you know the zombies all
take care out is not easy so muy
importante we'll do that and then we'll
go ahead and add that and you can see
it's created that list called groceries
and you'll notice there's no icon for it
up here that's because I didn't put an
icon in there I turned it off I'll show
you that in just a minute so now you can
see here I've got my custom icon with my
shield I've got my grocery list with
everything that I need there if I wanted
to you know I could close this up and it
tells me you know what I put in there
it's muy importante when I open it up
now here's my expanded description and
everything in my list really neat really
fast way to get a list right where
you're going to see it and hopefully not
forget it so let's go ahead and go back
into the app again there's my list I
can't go back and edit this frustrating
so if we wanted to put a picture in
there we can do that we can take a
picture or get one from our gallery we
want to put in just a big chunk of text
we can do that too
and if you just want kind of a default
simple note you can also do that so
let's go ahead and look at the settings
in here we can close the app after
creating a notification so you create it
it's going to take you right back to
wherever you were before that's kind of
nice helps you get back to your work
unless you want to create multiple notes
if you want to create multiple notes to
leave that unchecked the default is
unchecked invisible icon now this is if
it's checked there's not going to be an
icon up here we can uncheck that and
then you'll have an icon up there that
it's a notification so it's showing you
that something's there I have that
turned off but you notice it's just just
invisible there's still an icon there
you just can't see it then then of
course notification priorities that's
what order is this going to show up in
you can see I've got some travel time to
work nine minutes that that's good that
means there's not a lot of slowdowns due
to zombie outbreaks along my my path HD
widgets was just updated I've got a
couple new emails and then my my note up
at the top so I can specify the priority
that that appears up in the list if I
don't want to give it quite as much sir
if I want to give it even more this is
the default so I'm leaving it as the
default you can also come in and set the
theme to light or dark some of us like
light screen some of us like dark
screens for various reasons if you're
going to be using this in an active
zombie apocalypse you'll probably want
to go dark so that you're not giving
away your location is readily that does
require a restart of the app though so
just bear that in mind so that's it it's
really kind of nice really kind of cool
now let's talk downsides the first thing
that we talked about you can't go back
in and edit this list number one number
two I've got this on my tablet it
doesn't automatically sync to my phone
so unless i have my tablet handy i'm
kind of out of luck wherever you put
your note that's where it's going to
live would be nice if there was some
cloud base sinking or or something like
that where I'd have the same lists on
all of my devices so really you know
other than this being jellybean only
those are my only major complaints so
that's really really kind of cool and it
finally gets us a to-do list that is
something that I'm going to
use on Android one last thing just came
to me there's no completion date on this
so it's not going to set up reminders in
your calendar and whatnot but that's
because it's up here in your
notification shade so I can live without
that what do you think I really like it
it's available for free there is a paid
version or a pro version that's
relatively cheap let's see how much
they're asking for it today it's 99
cents us so you can afford to do that
gives you lots of more icons and quote
unquote lots more to come so right now
it looks like the only advantages you
have our supporting the developer Eric
Carboni and even more icons in there is
it worth 99 cents man not for me right
now but will it be once once things
mature a little bit and once this lots
more to come arrives absolutely so if
you want to link make sure you head over
to pocketnow.com make sure you give the
video a big thumbs up you know anything
we can do to help each other prepare for
the zombie apocalypse or the Mayan end
of the world or whatever it happens to
be guys it's coming up quick it's
already October you know we've got like
two months and I don't need to tell you
I'm preaching to the choir here so let's
all get together and make sure we do
that if you've got any questions or
comments whether it's about a zombie
apocalypse are about not've head over to
pocketnow.com leave those down at the
bottom of this article and we'll make
sure that everybody can co-op
collaborate cooperate and get all of our
all of our stuff together because we're
our only hope for pocket now showing off
the notif app and preparing for the
zombie apocalypse I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
