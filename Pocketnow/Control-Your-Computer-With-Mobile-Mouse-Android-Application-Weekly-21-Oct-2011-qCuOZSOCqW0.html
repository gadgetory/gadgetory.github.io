another calm and this is another episode
of the Android application weekly in
which review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get to it
Air Penguin is a free game built on the
Android Market the options of game is to
balance from one of these icebergs to
the next iceberg without falling in like
I just did so we'll retry that again and
now we'll continue on and we want to
collect these little goldfish or
whatever they are so I want to collect
those while bouncing prominent iceberg
to iceberg and we use the accelerometer
to go from each iceberg to iceberg so
now we can move on to the next level and
here we want to slide on the ice and
there's other obstacles and stuff to
collect in a to avoid so here when I go
to there and then we've reached the flag
Full HD backgrounds is a free
application veil in the Android Market
what this app allows you to do is to
find backgrounds for your Android device
in which you can scroll across if I go
home so on the home screen I can slide
from one side to the other and you can
view the whole HD wallpaper so we'll
just go back to the application so the
application is pretty simple to use we
can choose recent ranking categories
themes and we can also add things to our
favorites by going up here we can search
for something let's search for autumn
and now if you like one of these images
always you just click on here and from
the image we can go to setup photo warp
is a free application available on
Android Market the last should you
change your photos of whoever you like
and let's say learn time to make this
woman's face look somewhat distorted so
now all I have to do is click on one of
these options and I can begin by
touching the face and if I want to make
her forehead really big or something
like that I can do that and if I want to
stretch out her eyes and make her look
like something from Star Trek we can do
that and let's just pinch her face
together and we'll pinch it right here
or make an electromagnet small so there
we go so really tiny mouth and we can
save that to our device and then share
it with our friend Mobile Mouse is white
and paid for application flush you
control your computer through a wireless
connection using your Android device so
here I can view my computer and I can
that I have my computers in right here
and if it like I can use the mobile
mouse on screen to use the mouse on the
computer and I controlling it from my
device itself and on the device itself I
can either use the accelerometer to hide
the keyboard I can just go down here to
toggle view and it can also change some
of the options on my device jelly
defense is a paper tower defense style
game available in the Android Market the
object of the game if you've never
played a tower defense game is to defend
these crystals over here from these
invading forces that are coming across
and in this particular game you are
controlling a little tiny alien and we
want to build another tower here because
it looks as though they're going to get
into that and collect one of my crystals
and I've collected enough money on the
bottom I can upgrade my weapons so that
they destroy more enemies as they're
coming by so this is been another
episode of the Android application
weekly and if you like our videos make
sure you give a thumbs up and also leave
some comments down below the name that's
live wallpapers called ghost and there
are two versions available on Android
Market a free version which is very
limited in settings and a paid version
which costs $0.99 to get the download
information for all these applications
just follow the link in the descriptions
great to pocketnow.com
where we've stored the QR codes and
Android Market links and if you want to
get more information about Android you
can also watch Jaime's Android
revolution show and I'll post a link
right up here to the latest episode
