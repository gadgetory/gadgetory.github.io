accidentally had you clicked on the chat
so when he was showing off the p30 no
one side
Wow Wow I'm an awesome host nice one
nice speaking of being an awesome host I
am Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and this week we actually have
I decided to change things up a little
bit this week if you have been following
the PocketNow daily based on what Jaime
has been reporting every single day or
have you been following the news all
week it's actually been kind of a slow
news week not too much has actually been
announced compared to the last week of
course but there have been a couple of
leaks we may talk about that a little
bit later but what I do want to talk
about today is about probably the
biggest story that did come out at the
beginning of this week and I had to do
with YouTube now I understand this is a
product centric channel but it is a
channel and it does live on a platform
that we all know and love and that is
YouTube however earlier this week and I
want the live chat everyone in the live
chat I want you all to talk about this
so much like this is this is gonna be
practically a Q&amp;amp;A session because I
definitely want to have this
conversation it's so interesting to me
because okay so you've been on YouTube
for how long ten years alright so ten
years further for e any of my any of my
fellow Asian YouTube fans out there
he's been on YouTube as long as Timothy
DeLaGhetto so that's awesome been on for
quite a while so you've seen YouTube
evolve over the last number of years and
in the very beginning back when they
weren't even really monetizing any of
the videos like what did YouTube look
like back then if you can go down memory
lane it was a hodgepodge back then I
started off with the website in 2007
called bored at work moved on from there
and I remember my buddy warm Bowman from
BtoB want calm gone on YouTube earlier I
got on 2009 I didn't really do much with
YouTube that's kind of like okay I can
upload video but I didn't like I didn't
have a camera you know using your
smartphone was just not the way to go at
that time oh yeah it was such a hot mess
we didn't know in terms of titles or
what to do if anyone can go and stretch
my earliest video it's crap
it is absolutely crap because I was just
playing around work with a smartphone
camera and I was doing some edits with
it or I think a regular kind of a
regular camera that I got from my cousin
was a 720p camera and you know nobody
knew I enjoy those days really the wild
wild west because I have a total of 5050
videos something like that on YouTube
and if you go through if you don't have
to watch your videos just look at the
thumbnails and look at whether
thumbnails changed and custom thumbnails
and even when custom thumbnails change
our YouTube was YouTube was begging
influences to go back and not begging
but they were telling us a lot of times
like make sure you change your
thumbnails and already that time I had a
thousand videos I was like I don't have
the energy to go back and change the
customs them ya know so I have at least
I have these good thousand maybe even
close to 2,000 videos that just don't
have custom thumbnails and then there
was the you know there's the you know
taking SC SEO seriously I remember the
days I miss the days where I would do a
review on a case in just the case and
that video would do well I'll get like
50,000 hits 70,000 hits now I didn't
even try to do a case review or video
like it's pointless but then that's the
maturity of the network but I've also
seen it grow in specialized from being
like you through any wacky thing on
YouTube to it becoming segments right
you know we've got tech we've got
lifestyle vlogging came logging went
vlogging came back you know we we had
fitness people we've got you know
different segments YouTube where and I
found really interesting I went to an
event with Sony for the a 6400 a month
ago and most of the people they were all
like camera youtubers you know did not
tech the camera you know and even the
camera is tech which it was really cool
to see and I'm like I don't know any of
these people the only person I knew
there were I just seen and Armando that
in also you know yes I made I made new
friends and I connected and I'm watching
their content I'm like even though this
is really close to my segment that
YouTube that's a whole different world
has gotten so huge and not only just in
terms of like the content creation
aspect but also just as the company
itself so the the question that I wanted
to pose on this on this podcast has to
do with a huge story a huge deep dive
that Bloomberg put out regarding the
state of YouTube and why there might
actually be a lot of content on YouTube
that is considered for lack of a better
term toxic now you've probably seen if
any of you out there in the live chat or
anybody watching right now are listening
in the podcast applications might know
that YouTube has been in the news a lot
over the last even year maybe two years
for a lot of different pieces of content
that started to either be demonetized
due to guidelines or they were being
flagged by the algorithm because of the
content that they that they provided
because of potentially harmful
information perhaps or in the most
recent case there was actually uh there
was a case where YouTube kids had a lot
of content on there that was actually
preying on children now we're not gonna
get and that the only word that I'll use
in that case is Momo I don't want to get
into the details of the whole thing but
essentially what Bloomberg said is that
the executives over that YouTube
potentially had ignored they had they
had ignored or rather just decided not
to address all of these issues because
in paraphrasing their words essentially
the growth of the platform was more
important to them than curating the
content now the reason why I want to
bring this up is because we've heard
that word a lot recently content
creation content curation was actually a
phrase that was used a lot by Apple in
their event last week that humans were
going to curate the content they were
going to make sure that the content was
actually catered to each user it was not
going to be it was it was it was not
going to be about an algorithm and AI
based software based algorithm actually
trying to control the content because
there are ways of getting around an
algorithm and that's the biggest problem
that YouTube has right now so the
question that I wanted to ask and the
reason why I love have I love the fact
that he is on here is because we are
we have been on this platform for a long
time and we're not trying to start up a
conversation about drama on YouTube
that's not the case here this is on a
system executive level on a platform
that we all use a lot you want to talk
about devices YouTube is the most viewed
network on any on practically any device
especially mobile so the the question
that I have here is that like you know
you don't you don't get into any of the
crazy content out on YouTube right you
ever fall down like a YouTube hole I
mean once in a while I end up in some of
the conspiracy holes yeah it's weird
like I will watch I mean watch like Joe
Rogan and you will talk cover a topic
and and I might either search that topic
I'm like okay would hmm let me see about
this guy this other guy that interviewed
and then from there it's like okay stop
like I'm not trying to go there and the
algorithm has become really aggressive
lately I just noticed it from the type
of content i watch so on my feed I don't
see you guys anymore I do get the
notifications for you guys more promptly
now as long as I have the notification
bell so I get yours
I get laughs I get David's
I can pocket now I get those
notifications quickly but but my feed
you know I'm a big comic book I'm with
anime guy if I watch two anime videos or
watch I you know I usually do this I
like to watch anime fights so once in a
while it would just dawn on me to go and
lately I've been watching a lot of
either my hero academia fights or I will
go back and watch NAR to Sasuke vs.
moment she keyed and after that I get
inundated I get one more suggestion
about like a new anime channel I'm like
oh this is cool this guy's like top 10
anime fights because usually they always
show fights that I don't see so I'm like
I let me check it out and next minute
it's just an American law like after
that and I'm like guys no then I stop
and then you know when it's trending
reaction time I used to do long-term
reactions I've stopped
I have another channel why do some do
for big you know bigger movies Avengers
and game trailer reaction came out I
watched water I know the people that I
yeah they're a couple people I usually
go watch each other reactions
I'm not subscribed to all of them but I
know this channel so I'll just type it
in but once I watch one especially when
it comes to movie serie of stuff it's
over it just gives me a bunch of people
like you know newer youtubers who I
don't know which is cool but I'm like
you're pushing this too much and you
know if if you know the algorithm can do
that then there are ways for you to game
the system I don't know specifically how
but if you know the algorithm can you
know is very aggressive in finding
things that quote-unquote you like so if
you can attach you're very insensitive
video or you know what can what kind of
video it is through SEO to those kind of
videos then you know the algorithm will
push those in anyway or at least some of
that specially if your title this click
bTW and not actually you know to the
fact yeah yeah and that's that's
basically what the whole idea is there
was actually one portion in this story
and I'll have it linked in the
description that way everyone can kind
of see that this is a way for us that's
kind of share with you what kind of life
we have as these content creators in the
background and I always like to do these
kind of deep dives into these sort of
existential questions because YouTube
themselves were actually given a
suggestion where you could create a
third tier of content so if content at
all on YouTube was being flagged by the
algorithm that it is harmful and that
it's not something that they want to
push then they're not going to push it
it's not going to be part of the
recommended tab it's not going to be in
the suggestions in the sidebar and it
still lives on the platform you can
search for that content and find it if
you wanted to but it wouldn't be part of
suggested and what have you pushed at
all but what the what the engineer over
at YouTube said was actually while that
might be a good suggestion it wouldn't
take long for the people to actually
figure out a way to get those videos
past that layer of the algorithm and
it's like that's that's the crazy part
because like we have so we have networks
like YouTube and later we're going to
talk a little bit about social media as
and the health of viewers and people who
are on the on those platforms and of
course there's so much stuff to sift
through that the only way for a company
to even try and control it is through
automatic systems but now we're seeing
that you know such things can be
exploited I know exactly what you're
talking about you where like I would
watch content on YouTube I tend to watch
a lot of their certain channels i watch
like game grumps for gaming and i watch
just getting news and the autoplay is
such a powerful button to have because
once you hit play on any one of those
videos there are so many videos related
to do that that it might be coming from
that channel that are just all over the
suggestion side and it's just gonna be
an endless array of videos from there
I've actually done that with the pocket
not weekly when I was first coming on to
the podcast I started listening to and
watching the pocket not weekly and when
I would turn it on it would always play
yet another video but if you were to do
the same thing here on pocket Mouse
channel what would happen is any video
you click on here it'll always go to a
daily the reason why there's so many
dailies there are so many so many
dailies yeah yeah you're gonna have an
autoplay of just incessant dailies all
day so I'm a credit to you for that but
but that's the way that the autoplay
works in a way and so the question that
I have here and I I do have a few
messages in the live chat that are
pertinent to this question and it's a
question that I was asking you while we
were getting ready for this podcast last
night I was just kind of giving you a
bit of a snapshot as to what I wanted to
talk about today as Apple is having a as
Apple is working to have people actually
curate the content in places like Apple
newsstand Apple News Plus Apple TV Plus
Apple TV Apple channels there's so many
things is the onus on the company itself
to curate the content for the safety of
its own viewers it's a mixed answer
Apple has an easy task whatever they're
talking about is easy and I'll tell you
why they don't have the user base like
YouTube or Facebook one they may have
devices they don't have a user base it's
two different things
number two curating news content is
actually easy because they
set up steps that you have to be in
legitimate news organization which is
what Facebook needs to do as well all
right so that also cuts out a lot of
people in there right and if unless of
course you know for whatever reason you
know the New York Times or The
Washington Post decides to go you know
super crazy and writes crazy editorials
other than that that curation for them
is an easy process because they did a
very good step of saying you know what
you must be a recognized news
organization and must fit this media and
then we also are going to look at your
history for you before you join so
looking at the history they've got 300
magazines that's actually not hard
because they can hire enough people to
do that when it comes to Facebook or
YouTube in particularly in our case it's
very difficult because YouTube has how
many billion videos I mean in hours for
me for a minute yeah exactly
it is insane the amount of hours and
I've I've had this discussion when I
served my own podcast and Sam and I used
to have discussions like this YouTube
fell on the ball because they switch
strategies at some point when they try
to make premium YouTube content and
they've gone away from that YouTube fell
when they didn't realize that they
needed to take care of their creators
that's what happens when you when you
don't take care of your creators you you
tend to have these kind of issues this
is what stems up well Facebook on the
other hand has issues with
live-streaming because they don't have
creators they just have everyone live
streaming so there's no benefit so if
you look at YouTube for instance YouTube
instituted 10,000 you get revenue share
right back Nadine was much harder to be
a YouTube partner it was just difficult
to get in
there was it wasn't necessarily 10,000
threshold it was like it was view count
and then also you know what watch time a
little bit but Buchanon count numbers
consistently a few other things but it
was hard to get to be a partner so that
that level is there but then they
haven't created tiers within that level
for us to make sense so the tiers are
oh you know when you get a hundred
thousand get a youtube silver button
yeah and then you could wait to a
million to get to the next one and then
ten million that is I get it that's too
far between in my mind and also I mean
my look just to be honest and clear I
used to have a YouTube partner partner
manager he left YouTube and I haven't
heard from anyone to say hey we are your
new partner manager so I have no even
though I have a direct access for
YouTube I've got none really
like zero they don't help me you to do
anything to say even if you know they
always tell you ask them they can't tell
us the algorithm because they don't know
but giving you incentives because if
you're looking in this way if if I am
creating videos even if I'm not doing
anything sadistic I'm going but I'm
going 10,000 is where I need to get into
stammering and in revenue and then
100,000 is the first mark where you get
the silver button and then to me you too
should start doing a point system or a
grading system where the things you do
on the platform gain you points whether
you can get assistance in certain things
like a gamification of some of these
services especially when you have free
content creators YouTube ok YouTube can
sit down and say look we provide the
service space for you we've got a ton of
servers out there we pay lots of money
and then where we go we give you the
content and you're taking 45% that's how
much they take from our content in terms
of cards so yeah yeah 45% that's huge
it's not 55 so we're giving you a lot of
money that you can use to actually
incentivize us to make better content
I've said this before if you to burn its
you to go against Hollywood in terms of
producing good content they didn't have
to go the YouTube premium right they
needed to spend time with the tiers of
influences if you develop those tiers
you develop your future movie makers or
YouTube true but like how would that how
would that take into account virality in
terms of a channel that has no record
that just happens to have a video that I
might go viral simply because it does
that system yeah but but see what it
does is that when you okay when you have
tears you have people in the system your
algorithm doesn't spend time watching
them it watches the rest
mmm-hmm I see what you mean because I'm
not gonna put up anything crazy to lose
my money I'm getting from YouTube come
on nuts you won't do that either there
anyone who's making money anyone who's I
mean yes you're making money but like
right now is it still a mini Wild West
what it's a tiered system where you know
like a look I need to do these things
hopefully I can build you know build my
my channel brand get in the audience the
fits and then YouTube will recognize
okay all right I see this guy's doing
all these things even if I'm doing it
and it's not working then they can now
go okay you're doing the right things
but maybe you need to tweak it's easier
for them to now come in and say you need
to help they can help you but because of
that then the algorithm can spend time
look at any video that spikes up
immediately and go what is this video
from where oh this is not I mean like is
it simple spike up video is just from
bored at work okay alright Tech good
yeah you know makes sense I supposed to
spike video this guy has a thousand
subscribers what is this hey Google
pause so so in the case of people who
are actually like consistent creators
specially ones that are making money
it's more it's adding in a certain layer
of meritocracy here so if you have good
merit then like you are like you're good
but we're going to definitely pull like
we're gonna let the the algorithm at
least not we but the algorithm will
police all other content you can see
where that's coming from that's actually
not that's not a bad idea actually
everything is incentivized in this world
look you know it from from grade school
you know I mean look I mean I I don't
know how it is here but when I was
growing up when my kena my even though
it's it's not a good thing to do with
your kids but you used to have
competition with which kids in the
family got the best grades so because of
that because of that like I mean you'll
come from the Asian family I'm African
family they all do that kind of stuff so
I'm like you know what I need to get
that Super Nintendo so
yeah I'm sorry yeah I mean I'm gonna
bust my boss my butt here so that's what
needs to happen I'm not saying the
people don't do that I'm saying that
sometimes it becomes futile but when
there's something tangible to get you
know it makes a lot of sense look at
Samsung pay that's the only service I
can think of in terms of a company right
now that the reason I like to use it
whenever when I first came out was
because Samsung pay had points the
points you used to redeem stuff or enter
into the giveaways and they still have
it going on constantly now they have
cash back before they had cash back the
add point so even if you cared about
cash backing away again cash back you're
like oh but you know with the points I
could get myself a Samsung TV like a
40-inch for my you know my second
bedroom all right cool and it ended it
promotes like I was saying before it
promotes merit performance ie makes you
a good user on the system yeah so that
it's easier to pinpoint the bad users on
the system okay I could see that I'm
saying it's not going to be perfect but
I think that would make a lot of sense
it's at least a suggestion and I think
the main problem was that the main
problem from that Bloomberg article or
deep dive was that while suggestions
were being made to YouTube it wasn't as
if they were actually enacting any of
them so that's the big problem right now
that's the whole that's whole thing
right now and the reason why we're using
YouTube is because we're using YouTube
as the talking point right now is
because that's where the biggest story
came from but we're gonna get into the
other social media in a second but I do
want to get into the live chat a little
bit
Laura's Rae Jepsen I'm sorry I don't
know how someone like YouTube or
Facebook can possibly curate content
it's just not possible people are
responsible for their own content not
the platform
so yes personal responsibility I do
agree with that that there are those
creators who for the most part like be
don't they don't they don't act up there
on the they're on the platform and they
make the platform money but they also
make the platform enjoyable for all of
the viewers there are still a majority
what even though everyone might say that
everyone in their mothers has a YouTube
channel right now and it does feel that
way
I mean Frick I have two channels right
but there are still buying larger
majority of people who don't have
channels who are just the viewers and
it's
it's for them like this these these
services are for those people us
creators like we're here because we love
doing what we do but ultimately our
content is for the people who would come
and view it so I agree with that that
there is some personal responsibility
involved but as a here saying there has
to be a way of incentivizing those
people to remain good on the platform
and then they can weed out the rest but
here's here's a here's here's another
sort of perspective on this YouTube
should be a mess for those who want a
mess
good bad educational and everything now
here's the part that I want you to
respond to e if you can once YouTube
gets all family-friendly it will die
fast I kind of don't think that's the
case here it's not like you're going
down YouTube to watch porn for example
like it like family-friendly can
encompass so many different things you
can curse on YouTube maybe not too much
but you can curse on YouTube for example
it doesn't have to be so PG or even G
there's not gonna be G all the time no I
I think who made that statement Oh
that'll be Victor Victoria's is is is
stating a a fear that the execs are are
probably thinking that is an
executive-level fear the fact that if we
curtail it down because they made Sur
the problems YouTube has always meet
these harsh things when I'd pocalypse
happened the first time they just went
and clamped down and the law couriers
were like what is going on like you're
stifling us and not understanding that
to me you have to build your system to
match as it grows the problem is YouTube
has not done that and they've let it
expand into a monster that now they
created another machine to drive this
monster and the machine is having issues
like literally if you think of it that
way is that YouTube started as this
hodgepodge and then it's it became
something where people had a unifying
area for you to view content but now
they're having a hard time yeah with it
and that's where their problem lies is
that they're having a hard time dealing
with content dealing with the ability to
actually craft stuff like this and
that's giving them this is giving them
issues and I think that's where they
need to make changes is that then
to understand that look we have to craft
a system that is sensible we have to
connect with they don't connect with us
so even if I get it for to me any
platform if you really want people to
fully buy in and curtail them you have
to connect doesn't matter what it is
whether it's a small business or
something as large as YouTube or
Facebook and the other social media is
that you have to connect with them so
that you will none of this none of the
issues will end but when you can curtail
it then it's easier for you to deal with
a lot of things and I think that's where
YouTube is having this issues that
they've not spent time with that you
know sorry I just saw a comment here
from Adi and Nell says I do wanna yeah
but yeah I I do want to switch gears
actually like you know YouTube has been
our main point of contention when it
comes to this we are actually also
talking about you know just sort of in
in a microcosm we're also talking about
digital wellness here because we are
also talking about the fact that viewers
might be on the platform so much and
that's exactly what they want they want
you to stay on the platform and that's
true not only for YouTube but for
Facebook Instagram Twitter we're gonna
get into that in a second we don't have
a mid role for this week so we don't
really have an opportunity for a break
but it's just a discussion that I found
very interesting and and I wanted to
make sure to have this with all of you
so that we can get some of your some of
your thoughts as well on it as far as
actual product and device news that
happened this week there wasn't really a
whole lot there were leaks of the Opel
Reno and I didn't want to get a hot take
from you about that did you see this
leak of the Opel Reno
you mean the Google picks of four okay
yeah that everyone's saying it's gonna
be the that's how the pixel four will be
is that it has a fin is there yeah I
mean basically I mean the marques did a
video almost laughed because they I felt
like it's like my cast so use that as
his basis the Reno looks pretty good no
bezels it's got a 10x zoom according to
the rumors and it's got this fin pop out
I mean the fin pop art is fine it's it's
a different way of doing I forget is it
motorized to make it easy because if you
if you if you pop most users won't pop
it that's the thing yeah I think of me
that way what I also want to add do is
have you seen the renter's for the
galaxy 80 90 no I haven't ah
GSM Arina check it out the 890 has is
from samsung 0 bezels also it has a
slider that slides out and the rear
camera rotates to what's to the front
camera oh this was oh yeah this was just
hours ago - yeah so that's that's also
very interesting that you know Samsung
is going that route with its its
high-end mid tier with a and I think the
A's rumored to have a 700 series
processor which is very close to being
800 honestly it's yeah so they've got a
video on there too as well for some of
the renders it's it's something to just
take a look at but I have to say this
it's quite interesting it is it is for
sure speaking of interesting I do I do
want to start having a couple of
recurring segments on the on the on the
show especially when we have guests on
but we can ask everybody and literally
this is super like this is this is a
very open forum type of question I want
to start a recording segment here during
our mid break of the podcast called
what's in your pocket now and I want to
I want to ask you that but in this case
it's not about what's in his pocket it's
about what's on your face and that has
to do with the commenter in the live
chat that you were laughing at a second
ago yes no the kernel is not getting old
I know the look a little funky these are
the ow by North these are the smart
glasses by falcão it's an engineering
process so I actually get this pair of
glasses
the price drop from 1,000 to 600 you
have to set up an appointment they have
to scan your face and then after
scanning your face they get you fitted
for glasses now it's got clip-ons for
shades as well you can get them you can
get a prescription if you need a
prescription it does have this this
fingering controller right here that's
how actually you control it and usually
you put it either in your index or your
you know this finger here when you
forget when that ring finger well ring
finger on the right hand side and that's
how you control it then when you go to
pet you when when they are ready they
say it takes three to four weeks
actually took mine two weeks when you
get them ready you have to get an
appointment to get it fitted again
because it only has a very small area
here on your screen where you can
actually see so if my glass is a little
lower it's not that clear I have to
actually place them correctly and I can
see it so as I'm looking at the screen I
can see my date and time I can scroll
through and a couple of using the ring
to scroll through that having seen the
ring discloses so sometimes like I use
it on the subway today and I'm just
staring straight ahead and I'm lucky
that stuff it's cool though because if
you just look slightly off you can't see
it oh if I'm looking down now at the
laptop I'm using my laptop here I can't
see it but I look up I can see my
messages I have to set up over where I
can actually order an uber directly from
here I can control my Spotify so they're
adding new applications as it goes on
and you know it's that kind of thing
where we just see how how well it works
but it's interesting it's actually easy
to use with this because I'm just
looking directly at the camera you know
it's funny that little display it shows
up in it shows up like to viewers and
also to me as I'm looking at you it
shows up as a little like red area so
nice you can see the red area right yeah
so it's like it looks like your pink
eyes up there so yeah it's it's got this
I'm gonna take them off here so usually
I don't wear glasses this is know me
yeah this is such a this such a new look
for you yeah so this is how it looks
this is it here you've got to the and if
you guys can see that is the the camera
projector that basically bounces on the
screen there's an LED here this is a
little speaker that you can get chime
messages on the side there and yeah
that's pretty much I need to get it
cleaned out but it's nice
so battery life is 16 to 18 18 hours
okay
some people said they've got and he said
some people have gotten in it longer it
lasts them like an extra day it all
depends on how much messages you use I
turned off my units YouTube notification
on there because if now you just keep
going the ring
battery life is three days for the ring
it's comes in a massive case I mean so
this is the case oh boy yeah and then
there's like a charging pin in the case
the case also does three days on its own
and then your clip-on for your
sunglasses are also in here as well I
know a lot of the viewers were probably
thinking like what the heck is the price
of that thing so the price is $600 if
you add a few if you're getting
prescriptions a little bit more but
since I don't have a prescription for me
it's 600 bucks yeah I wouldn't need that
only a prescription for mine yeah I just
use these ones so this is it with the
clip ons here there you go and that
would that would actually mask the red
area so you know yeah but I think you
can only see the red area if you're this
close where my camera is and because
you're looking at on a camera okay
so my camera is literally here where my
finger is I'm almost touching it okay so
only so so only for us here on the
YouTube side and II does not have
pinkeye just saying you know okay guy so
as the host obviously I'm going to have
to be part of this as well and it's
gonna be interesting because I have to
pick a new item basically every week to
show what is in my pocket now there's
some things you can't talk about either
exactly exactly though I will admit that
ones in my backpack but what I have here
would be the Xiaomi me9 which I've been
using as my daily for the last couple of
weeks I did actually just post up a
video this week it's probably the only
video that's going up yeah that was that
fit
was pretty nice though the quality was
good it wasn't bad but the mics on here
are like they're they're laughably bad
in in when it comes to when it comes to
recording video when I have it this
close for like voice messages and for
calling in all that it's super clear but
it just doesn't have a good pickup from
a distance so that's that's actually bit
of a disappointment so I would say that
this is not for vloggers if you know me
from my from my channel I talk about how
I talk about who what what type of users
these phones are for this may not
necessarily be for vloggers because the
audio pickup it's just not that great
but otherwise the phone has been pretty
fantastic I have to admit everyone
always has something to say about the
Android operating systems on phones like
LG's UI for example everyone has
something to say by emui this is me UI
me why it's gotten so good honestly it's
it's fast it's easy to use I really
enjoy it a lot me UI is I could use one
on the daily and I have been recently so
let me just give a just give a shout-out
to Xiaomi
so far the me 9 pretty good review
coming out pretty soon all right
so speaking of the stuff that is on our
phones we do have I want to spend a
little bit of time getting into the
other the other sides of this discussion
we're having about content curation but
also about our attention where our
attention is and obviously the buzzword
that everybody is using these days is
called digital wellness and you see a
bunch of phones like the iPhone and
Android on a system-level now has a
digital wellness layer where you can see
what apps you're using all the time
where your attention is at all times in
my case is usually on YouTube of course
as we were talking but I also play a lot
of games so it's like YouTube games
camera and then music those are the four
I would say Instagram is actually a
fairly distant fifth and I'm gonna ask
you where yours might be you don't have
to look right now but just off the top
of your head but there have been a
couple of videos over the last couple of
weeks that we're on YouTube obviously
he's he Nystedt was talking about how he
wanted to uninstall the applications on
his smartphone because he is sick of
having his attention dedicated to places
like Twitter and Instagram
and I don't know if anyone out there saw
his video I mean millions did he's it's
Casey Knight said after all but he
talked about how he called it the
attention loop and I thought it was a
hilarious way for him to put it where he
he wants to pay attention to one story
so he goes on Twitter and he finds the
tweet about it but I think it's curious
about all of the follow ups that are
happening on Twitter for so he reads all
of that and then he finds himself using
even more of his attention even though
he only wanted to have two minutes of it
taken out by the fact that he wanted to
check on one news story and it's just
this endless loop it's this absolute
endless loop of attention being given to
Instagram and Twitter and that one was
Twitter but he also said Instagram has
the same issue as well he talked a
little bit about the algorithm on
Instagram basically making it so that
every post that you see is based upon
the accounts that you frequent the most
and that's why the discover tab in my
case is all wrestling like it's
WrestleMania week is WrestleMania
weekend this weekend I've been I've been
following WWE and my discover tab is
literally all just wrestlers and
wrestling clips and there are in just
like on YouTube you have all of these
users who are getting onto the platform
and just creating content for Instagram
that has to do with wrestling and these
are not even official accounts for
wrestlers or wrestling promotions these
are just random like you've probably
seen these right with your enemies stuff
on Instagram there's like my Instagram
is no mine's not a tomato mine is mine
is all martial arts you know I put a lot
of fitness and mootai stuff for my
Instagram yeah so I'm looking at mine
right here is I've got a lot of karate
kumite there's some fitness individuals
here I won't call it compensates fitness
models and there's a lot but there's a
lot of karate I follow
jean-claude Van Damme I follow what's
his name again
I would Dolph Lundgren but yeah I'm
looking some more Taekwondo there's this
kick right there but even then if you
look at home I just I did it did I oh
okay I thought it was just a feed thing
but yeah it looks I guess I did but like
if you look at if you look at the
discover tab in here
you'll know you'll notice that while all
of the content is geared towards the
interest that you have told Instagram
hey show me more of this and that's
really how all these algorithms work a
lot of those accounts are not even
actual like official accounts for that
kind of stuff
oh no no they're not I mean that's
that's the thing it's like it would be
like jean-claude van Damme fans yeah
yeah no go ahead he doesn't post that
much you know like when they pose when
he posed it comes up on my feed but my
discovery tab is all the fan stuff from
jean-claude van Damme oh yeah this isn't
a kick
wow that was that's too bright I just
realize it's trying to show you an image
and oh nice yeah so it's stuff like that
that shows up on my feet yeah but this
is this is exactly the kind of stuff
that this is an it's just the law sorry
gotta mess up my thought there this is
exactly where algorithms can be
exploited and this is if you want a
great example of how algorithms can be
exploited it's right there is the fact
that you can create an account that just
is a little bit in the realm of people's
interests and then it can be anything
else it could be whatever you want it to
be and it could it could end up being
very harmful in a way
Kwame Coles they were supposed to make
Instagram in chronological order and
that never happened I hate seeing things
from four days ago exactly the algorithm
is trying to show you things that it
thinks you or that it thinks are
relevant to you and nothing is
chronological anymore like a pretty much
you we should we should have eye
trackers to show how many times we look
at the bottom of a post to see how long
ago it was because like that's like the
most common thing I do on Instagram is
like when was that but you know so it's
okay see nice dad we had this discussion
yesterday II you to that Casey nice that
was trying to uninstall these
applications and to take his attention
back but you were telling me yesterday
that you think that that's actually a
half measure it's okay it's a bit of a
half measure I think it's one of those
things where you know like I've this
discussions and discussions I've had for
a while I mean when I stopped my podcast
we should talk about this a lot and like
Sam is one of those people where
he is not on Facebook that much anymore
and he didn't dinner and and I think
that's even a better approach if you're
gonna cut off a piece of social media
you might cut it off sure but you have
to remind yourself why did you get there
in the first place right what's the main
reason there and then you decide how you
want to use it so once I started
spending time as an influencer I realize
how is good to use social media and I
decided anything I put up there is what
I change everybody doesn't matter even
if you Facebook sells it or whatever
right
that's just I've accepted that fact and
I think that's 1/2 or 1/4 of what
everybody needs to understand even if
you're not an influencer instead
whatever you put up with social media is
not yours anymore it's for the world and
the company itself
it's freemium right then there's also
the aspect of you can't dwell on those
aspects oh there's one thing that we
used to do and we still kind of do is
that Sam was send me a story from he
likes it he uses read it a lot so he was
sending from reddit or whatever Soares
and I used to send stories from Facebook
like I was here on Facebook and then our
really incentive but what we did what we
did subscrie would share stories and I'd
be like I don't think that's correct I
saw the same article from here and this
is missing or this is not there and we
used to cross check ourselves and say
hey look that's old I don't think that's
correct news I don't think is factual
because anytime we see something like
now anytime we see something I look for
for sources I just have to look for
sources it's annoying as hell but that's
just the way it is because without
forget social media it's also it's it's
something this has been happening over
time it's not social media cause the
social media is that asked access this
is something we've been doing constant
number how I spoke to you about what we
are what we're experiencing is what
celebrities have experienced forever
it's just now the average man is
experiencing it what I mean here is that
your celebrities have oh you know people
complain about social medias like you
know I'm getting inundated with a lot of
information people bugging me all this
kind of stuff as a celebrity they've
been doing this for a long time where
people bug them
about them paparazzi bug them the they
are always the center of attention so
when we get some famous Sochi you don't
have to be influenced it to be actually
famous you could just have a very rabid
falling because of something you do
right now and you become an e doesn't
have to be super big you can have 45,000
and people are like on Instagram you're
like oh my god man I love whenever he
post pictures of this and blah blah blah
blah and this is that we experience in
some of that and now we realized that
we're not a continent not exactly that
experience is not built for the mass
audience yeah
thanks me it was always a certain set of
people because we know whatever you
share the story of a celebrity getting
pissed and like I don't want to sign
your autograph and pushes people away
and stuff that you're like oh how I'm
grateful in that person is like you know
we're the ones who helped you get to
this position now you're in that
position and you're complaining about
Facebook Instagram Twitter or the I mean
the one thing I would say everybody
should do or can't do is you step away
you spend less so you do less on that
platform because when you come back it
also feels fresh you know like whatever
I miss it sometimes it's not that fresh
sometimes it is you know face couldn't
remember
I'm trying member a study that was done
where they added a timer they'd like
they gave they gave a time limit to I
want to say teenagers or preteens about
how long they could be on any one
application and obviously this had to do
with Twitter Instagram and social media
and whatnot it incited anger so much
from them because they wanted to stay on
those platforms and like going back to
the whole idea of or is the onus on the
company like they their number one goal
is to keep you on their platform and you
know so yes there is personal
responsibility involved I just want to
bring up that I remember reading that
that that I should I got to try to find
that study again but it was it was one
of those like small sample size stories
but like basically it showed that they
were upset anytime the timer went off
and they couldn't use that app anymore
and instead of like moving on to
something that was more productive they
were just upset that they couldn't use
Facebook anymore who was in the study
teens I think it was teens I want to say
this younger younger folk look that's
what parenting is all about I'm not
prepared but I don't know
my mom that I could tell me from playing
my Super Nintendo it's the same thing I
mean I didn't play during school year
I'm not saying you have to stop kids no
using social media during school year
but you have to provide that sense of
balance in their heads I mean I have to
have younger cousins and I don't curtail
their social media because I know their
parents don't but they've you know
they've spent time teaching them that
look you can't spend time here because
you still have to do certain things you
have to make money you have to be able
to get a career you have to be able to
grow as an individual and those are the
kind of things that are missing and
again that's personal responsibility
whether it's from the parents what is
the individual or child whatever the
case may be and I think understanding
that aspect of social media that not no
one is your friend let's just be honest
everyone who follows me everyone who
follows PocketNow everyone who follows
Joshua you guys are not my friends and
I'm not your friend
and not in a bad way the fact that we
don't know anything about each other to
actually come into that true experience
of what a friend is we are at the very
most acquaintances that have a certain
interest at hand and we work on that
interest now once people realize that
they know K fine yeah the people that
connected you can build a friendship
online there's nothing wrong with that
it's very possible but we need we need
to understand that there is that gap and
yes there's also responsibility on the
companies as well like they need to
understand how the audience is once it
could tell you know we talked about
Facebook and and live-streaming and the
fact that I mean I believe that that's
something that they should only hand to
creators and they should have added a
level of meritocracy also Facebook also
wasted a huge opportunity are not paying
their their users but actually giving
people on Facebook points you report
something erroneous you get points you
know if you see you know it when
Facebook went public soon after they
should have had a point system on
Facebook well yeah you are you can enjoy
Facebook the way it is but if you help
the platform you get points which you
can cash in four different things hey
maybe an
this headset maybe you know there are
web you know they are the camera system
maybe a game you know a lot of you know
Facebook games like then used in your
your dedicated time there makes a lot of
sense again you you gamify it way makes
sense for the user and then now when
you're using their content and suddenly
their content they also know that
they've benefited from this yeah for
sure at some point so I mean everyone in
the live chats talking about those
headphones behind you but I wanted to
ask the live chat as we wind down the
last five to ten minutes of this podcast
I just wanted to see I want to I want to
do a temperature check with all of our
viewers and our listeners also let us
know at hashtag pn weekly how much do
you curate your own attention how much
do you curate your own social media use
I mean I know for myself I I only really
find myself on social media platforms a
whole lot really at night
honestly it's basically after everything
else is done but the problem that I have
there is that since I'm scrolling
through Instagram and watching IG
stories incessantly it keeps me from
sleeping so that's my number one problem
with it
but I want to really say like like I
said in the YouTube section as far as
like harmful content on all these
platforms I don't engage in any of that
stuff that's why it's hard for me to
actually talk about it at length because
I don't actually watch it I don't
actually engage in it whatsoever
I I fell on one prank channel on April
Fool's Day because of Twitter and I want
to unsee that
I want those I want those five minutes
back from my life because I can't
believe I actually watched what I
watched I don't even want to talk about
it but that's what I mean it's like it
doesn't it doesn't do anything from you
but apparently those videos do
definitely go viral they have millions
of views and that's the problem we have
here's whether or not these companies
should be curating the content for the
safety of their viewers so I guess as we
wind down this podcast I guess I would
ask you what what tips would you have
for people to sort of get make
themselves even safer on the Internet
like we could talk about digital
wellness but also talking about content
on the internet what they can do to
ensure that they're not either using of
all their attention or putting their
attention into things that might be
ultimately harmful
go out I mean I have to attest to this
this is true I actually have spent more
time in this office and in my home over
the last two weeks working granted but
it will but that also means that I'm
susceptible to being on YouTube for
hours and hours on end consuming content
rather than creating it that's for
people like me and Yui that's the big
that's the big thing if we're consuming
more than we're creating we have a big
problem
oh yeah we do I mean they have their
bouts where I've consumed like a lot of
entertainment anime you know comic book
movie stuff and I'm like okay I need to
make my video man God you know but
sometimes it's just good to step out
it's good to explore the the idea of or
or listen I had a good period last week
where I finished one of the audiobooks I
was listening to
which is the fifth book in the expanse
series if you want a book series to read
go read that is absolutely amazing and I
just and it's been a while since I've
done that I sat down on my couch here
I've got a big TV I have shows I have to
watch I spent two hours listening just
just listening and it was a really good
experience too and in let me step out
away from what I into sometimes you need
to the thing about any any form of
entertainment is that too much again
angel saying too much you know too much
of any good thing is bad
so find other avenues whether it's go
out you know the weather's getting
better it's time to you know head to the
beach or the park or you play sports you
play some basketball some football
soccer or whatever it is hang out with
friends get to know your neighborhood
it's even may sound silly you know there
are things that happen find out what
happens around you if you're gonna use
it I love that one like when's the last
time you actually knew your neighbors
like you know I'm after you actually my
building your building yeah so she's
associated with the place that you have
but like I know me like living in a home
with my family I don't know anybody on
my street like yeah by Mia but all these
get to know your neighborhood right find
out what's happening
in the city right events some festivals
the thing that's happening now in our
culture is that it's something that's
always been happening in New York
it's spired around the country and it
happens on the west coast is that a lot
of cities are trying to do things to get
people you know so there's a lot of
festivals this might be like crappy
craft beer festival there might be you
know a convention there might be a small
anime convention that it's like 20 bucks
or ticket you go check it out I and
remember hold you see a TV after that
you from a show you're like oh wow I
didn't know you guys came here you know
like I thought you only went to the big
cities but they do all this convention
so there's a lot to see and do and for
some places it's smaller than the others
but just try and do something else
because when you do that then you
realize that oh and then you think that
when you go back and check your timeline
and you now speed through you're like oh
 I'm already back to where I was and
it was only like 10 that's I have to say
that is a depressing thing like I
whenever I'm on Instagram and I see a
photo I've seen already I'm like what am
I doing here
like I I've literally gone through
everything everyone else has done since
the last time I've been here from our
live chat a few people talking Peter
Aaden I think it's important to not get
too distracted with some of the other
content and be sure to step away if you
ever feel like you end up spending time
watching videos just as I described
there was also a lot of people saying
you know go ahead and get active we did
get a one dollar super chat from Richard
s I wish she added like a quick comment
or a question on there so that way we
could have like talked about that a
little bit that's okay just in text says
I spend more time on YouTube then
Instagram then Facebook I'm kind of the
same except I don't spend time on
Facebook they're the reason why I wanted
to bring this up and if Jaime was here
he would tell you I don't know to what
extent but he doesn't he's not on
Facebook anymore like I don't know if he
completely deleted as a counter anything
like that but he's definitely not on
Facebook anymore if he or I tried to
talk to him on facebook Messenger we
would never get a response let me
actually see if his on Facebook yeah he
might still have his account but what
I'm saying is he definitely does not
engage any more on unfazed accounts is
still here okay so he doesn't engage
here's the thing and I mean how do you
know
yeah his account is here his last cross
post was from Instagram hmm oh so he's
just it's just Auto posting from there
yeah he's here okay um
to add to what you were saying is I
gonna go eat before we head out of here
to anybody out there who might be going
out to like there are there are a few
people on the live chat also like go go
date go exercise go to events all that
stuff just like it you was saying there
are those people who would be like yeah
I gotta go there because I've got a
great idea out of it but like here's the
layer that I'll add to it if you're
going to do other things other than be
on your social media platforms
especially if your creator this is
something that I try to instill in my
entire life I used to be a daily vlogger
so I know what it's like to try and do
stuff just so you have content it sucks
to live that way so what I would say is
in like go to something or do something
because you enjoy it the content that
you could get out of it comes second
like you just happen to be at a thing
you're enjoying that's when you take the
photo you don't go there to take the
photo because we've actually had that
problem here you might have seen news
stories about how we have a super bloom
right now because it's springtime but
they actually banned people from going
to this large hilly area where all of
these flowers were blooming because a
lot of flowers got trampled because
people were trying to take pictures like
cool pictures off the path and in the
flowers and they were just walking
stepping all over that it was terrible
Wow but yeah okay let's see anything
else in there okay well okay I guess on
this note we're gonna go ahead and it on
here Eric Poojari says I'm half drunk
already
alright well on that note I hope
everyone's enjoying their Friday's EMI
should going to be seeing you in the
flesh tomorrow so we're gonna be hanging
out for the next few days yeah yeah
we've got a we've got a video coming up
at least a joint video in the sense
