an awesome product comes with the fair
amount of disappointment we've all been
victims of Pennywise pound-foolish
thinking at least once and we've usually
paid the price in terms of quality so
when a company rolls out a mobile phone
that's incredibly cheap you might expect
that it's also pretty bare-bones
or at least load it down with compromise
that was arguably the case with last
year's Nexus 4 but does it remain true
on Google's newest pure Android flagship
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is our video
review of the LG Nexus 5 for Google the
first thing you lay eyes on after taking
the Nexus 5 out of its box is the
phone's stark industrial design the
chassis bears a slight tumblehome
configuration with sharp laser cut
corners ceramic side keys and glossy
edges that contrasts pleasantly with the
matte finish back on our white version
the tiny earpiece port is also white
counterbalancing the single notification
LED below the screen but that and the
oversized camera lens around back are
the lone concessions to aesthetic
boldness otherwise the Nexus 5's modern
look is thoroughly understated that
looks great lying on a table but picking
up the phone gives you the first
indication that it's not the highest end
device around the Nexus 5 doesn't feel
cheap per se the casing is solid and the
gorilla glass 3 around front feels nice
but the lightweight conspires with the
glossy side rails to remind you that
this is a phone designed in part to be
inexpensive and that savings has to come
from somewhere
that impression vanishes when you take a
look at the spec sheet up with a
Snapdragon 800 processor 16 or 32 gigs
of storage an 8 megapixel optically
stabilized camera and a nearly 5 inch
1080p display the Nexus 5 can hold its
own with its cutting-edge flagship
competitors the display isn't the best
we've seen but it's certainly far from
the worst the phone's two major
variations support enough LTE bands to
cover the
orgy needs of the masses and little
details like qi wireless charging then
the Hall effect sensor for accessories
are bound to impress the sticklers for
detail out there while the story of the
nexus family as a whole has changed over
time one thing hasn't this phone is
still all about the software it's not
just android 4.4 kitkat we're talking
about either the nexus 5 packs a
launcher that is for now exclusive to
this hardware that means it's got nice
touches you'll only find here like
swiping to the left to jump into google
now Android purists might object to
their leftmost home screen being
replaced as they did with the HTC One S
blinkfeed but Google now is much more
visible than it was in older versions
that required you to pull it up from the
bottom and we think visibility is the
point here there's also the ability to
jump into Google now via a voice command
right on the home screen which lets you
do everything from launching an app to
running a search to calling a number
vocally it's not as handy in concept as
the touchless control found on the Moto
X but it actually works better in
execution because it's very sensitive
and almost never fails to activate which
makes it quite handy
other features like the dialers
yellowbook like internet search and the
bundling of SMS into the hangouts app
are nice but listing the phone's added
features misses the point it's the way
those features work together with the
interface that's important the total
experience of using KitKat on the nexus
5 and that experience is the best we've
ever had on an Android phone
it's been a while since Android was
considered the ugly duckling platform
but still Google refuses to rest on its
laurels each new iteration brings even
further refinement and 4.4 is no
exception
using Android on this device isn't just
fluid and efficient more importantly
it's tasteful and reserved in quite a
beautiful way
testing the Nexus 5 on AT&amp;amp;T over the
course of five days in the Greater
Boston area showed us that it's still
possible for LG to surprise us sometimes
that surprise is pleasant as with phone
calls the Nexus 5 delivered solid voice
quality on our end and callers said we
sounded quite nice with the dual
microphones doing a good job at noise
cancellation sometimes the surprise is
less pleasant LG learned that mounting a
speaker on the bottom is smarter than
doing so on the back as was the case
with the Nexus 4 but it didn't improve
the speaker itself all that much which
is a shame and between the extremes of
the Nexus 5's good and bad points lies
the camera while it is a significant
improvement on its predecessor and
capable of some very nice output given
the right conditions it's also pretty
inconsistent in day-to-day usage indoor
shots in particular waffle between noisy
and under saturated and the camera
doesn't do as well as you'd expect in
low-light conditions given its Hardware
stabilization the camera is perfectly
serviceable for social media needs and
might even pull through for a printable
photo every now and then given the right
lighting and judicious use of Google's
new HDR plus shooting mode but this
camera still wouldn't be our first
recommendation if you're looking for
truly excellent images fortunately it
performs a bit better in terms of video
recording as you can see here
in my other pocket as it were
Union Square Somerville and there's our
autofocus time pretty quick come back
out to distance here and there we are
not a whole lot of sound on the top of
the hill here in Somerville how long
you'll be able to roll that video and
use the phone in general will vary from
person to person but here we think the
Nexus 5 is decidedly average on a
standard usage test which included a
large amount of Wi-Fi and LTE browsing
several voice calls a near-constant
social media SMS and hangout usage we
were able to make it about 23 hours
before the Nexus 5 gave up the ghost
chirp
eight of those hours were in standby as
we slept but that's still not too shabby
given a four hour screen on time the
Nexus 5 is no Galaxy Note 3 or RAZR MAXX
but you should feel free to plug in some
headphones and listen to Spotify on your
way to work the acoustic quality through
the headphone jack is quite nice by the
way because the Nexus 5 is not likely to
die on you by lunchtime and the buzz
surrounding the Nexus 5 won't die out
for a while either that's partially
because of the geek glamour of the Nexus
name but let's be honest it's do first
and foremost to pricing despite its few
shortcomings there's no way a smart
phone with this kind of feature set
should be selling for 349 off contract
while it'll be interesting to see what
effect this pricing model has on the
rest of the industry
let's leave talk of the future for
another day right now in the u.s. at
least this is the best deal in mobile so
while this device would ordinarily
average out a bit lower on the pocket
now review scale it's insane value
combined with an excellent overall user
experience boosts its score to a solid
8.4 and that's what we're giving the
Nexus 5
folks if you want some more perspectives
on the Nexus 5 Tanner Martin and I
discussed the device within gadgets Brad
Mullin on the latest episode of the
PocketNow weekly podcast so tune in for
that
