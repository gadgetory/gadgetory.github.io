hydrogen one it finally has an official
release date and a price tag
it seems that Apple finally found out
that their phones are too expensive and
are developing a new strategy for it and
Verizon is offering a buy one get one
free deal for the Galaxy Note 9 already
I'm high metal Iveta thank you so much
for 1.6 million subscribers for all your
support it means a lot to us this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals that we weren't
expecting I mean usually BOGO deals come
until much later after a product gets
announced but the Galaxy Note 9 is not
going to be announced until 2 days from
now and we already have Verizon teasing
buy-one-get-one-free deals if you
preorder it on the carrier you can learn
more in the description definitely worth
it but there's no price tag yet now
let's talk about HCC as some concerning
news are coming definitely the you 12
plus has proven to not be the phone the
company needed 56% down in revenue we
hear profits are already plummeting as
well definitely the company needs
another strategy but I'm concerned that
they're talking about cutting another
1,500 jobs whatever the case might be
we'll keep you posted we're hoping the
company figures us out I mean this whole
industry owes itself mostly to HTC so I
definitely want them to figure it out
now let's talk about the Oppo r17 I mean
we already saw the ar-15 Pro which was
barely announced a few months ago in
China we were there but now we have a
Tina certification for the r17 and
apparently this is the phone that brings
the 10 gigs of RAM in addition to also
the Gorilla Glass 6 we also have a
teaser for the f9 pro and it's the first
time that we see the pro being used on
the F lineup
I can't wait to see what we get here now
let's talk about iPhones as it seems a
Cupertino has just figured out that
their pricing is just too crazy for the
smart phones up to the point where we
hear that the strategy for the iPhone in
the future is that the LCD iPhone is
always going to be sold and the reason
being is that the company wants to sell
a product that's not so crazy expensive
and they're so focused on the Chinese
market that we even hear rumors that
there will be an exclusive dual SIM
variants of this LCD iPhone again at a
price tag that's the
to be more aggressive let's just see
what aggressive means because Apple has
only proven that once and that was with
the iPad and that was it and finally the
hot news today have to do with a product
we didn't think was going to launch the
red hydrogen one is apparently going to
be available for those that pre-ordered
and that became part of the whole scheme
of this product as of October 9 for
everybody else apparently November 2nd
is going to be the date price tag twelve
fifty twelve hundred and fifty dollars
for the starting variant for those of
you that want the titanium one that's
not going to launch until next year
we're not exactly sure on what dates but
yeah this is the red hydrogen one and
the comments let us know what do you
think would you be willing to buy this
phone because in my case I'm just
concerned that right now it already has
last year specs so what are we getting
next year for the titanium variant are
we getting two year old specifications
on this phone whatever the case may be
let us know in the comments
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on talking out
comments descriptive both our channels
English and Spanish for more videos like
this one and follow me on twitter i'm
not recording it on instagram at high
metal data please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw i'm
hey my data thanks so much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
