Galaxy F and we wonder when will it be
released
cool pixel phones are having some
problems once again now with speakers
that are acting up and sharp just
announced the phone with two notches
because one definitely wasn't enough I'm
Jaime Rivera and for those of you asking
where is our Thunder purple 1 plus 60
coverage I am waiting for it as soon as
I land from here this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with deals
we've been covering Black Friday deals
already and some of the Samsung ones
were already discussed like for example
the $70 off the Galaxy watch that I'm
currently using or the case of the $200
off the Galaxy S nine or galaxy note 9
but it keeps extending itself and now it
seems that we've got bundles accessory
kits where you can get up to $300 off
accessory kits depending on what product
you go for learn more about the full
list in the description that's its kind
of large now let's talk about Samsung
and their Android PI beta believe it or
not samsung is terrible at software
updates but it seems that this new one
UI is changing things as the beta is now
available in korea for Galaxy S and I
know Galaxy S 9 plus and well that's
great it means that this new UI makes
software updates not so complicated
thank you finally Sammy let's just hope
that the beta extends to other countries
very soon now let's talk about sharp for
those of you that you probably don't
remember but the sharp aquos was
probably the first device ever to
support that whole concept of very small
bezels on a display and then everything
snowballed after that and well the
company has just launched there are two
compact which it follows on that idea
but now innovates quote-on-quote with
two notches one at the top of the camera
one at the bottom for the home button
which if you ask me I'm not saying that
I like it I'm just saying I prefer that
over chins like the one on the Google
pixel 3 but that's just me and speaking
of the Google pixel 3 there are two
issues that are right now becoming quite
controversial the first one being text
messages disappearing which I haven't
really noticed on my unit
and I think that's has to do with the
fact that I use Google Voice but then in
the other cases of people complaining
about the speaker quality where if you
remember the first pixel had those
problems and now people are complaining
about the Google pixel 3 with clicks and
clacks I'm not having issues yet the
people that are with me at this trip are
not either and we're mostly all using
Google pixel threes so yeah let's see
and finally the hot news they have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy F or galaxy X
whatever that final name is going to be
for the foldable smartphone aka slash
tablets for those of you that wonder how
it's gonna look because of Samsung
barely showed us a screen and that was
it
there are obviously concepts I don't
usually cover concepts here but this one
looks really good looks possible so yeah
we see the display we see it being
extended we see if closing and then we
notice what Sammy showed us which was
that the display on the product has
closed this smaller it doesn't go fully
from every edge of the chassis let us
know in the comments I mean if this were
the final design of the galaxy after you
like it or not
in my case I like it when it's open I
don't like it would expose it and
definitely I feel that they have to work
on those borders that's just me leave us
