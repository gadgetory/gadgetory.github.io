the beefiest we've laid hands on but
just how durable is it when stacked up
against some of its rugged competitors
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is the cat b15
let's put it to the test our cat b15
demo unit comes to us from our friends
at clove code UK which means two things
one you should pay them a visit
if you want to be fifteen of your very
own and two we can't test this phone to
destruction because we do have to return
it that's right there's going to be no
drop test from two hundred feet or a
blowtorch taken to this phone so if
that's what you were tuning in for we're
sorry what we will do instead is put the
b15 up against some other rugged devices
in the pocket now labs to see what it's
rated to take and yes we'll give it a
bath as well though the b15 is
officially on the market it's not being
sold through any carriers in the US
buyers will spend $349 for an unlocked
unit capable of running on AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile USA though it's limited to 3G
with no LTE support onboard as such it's
likely to do some battle from mindshare
with samsung's galaxy s4 active and AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive which Trump's the b15 in
almost every standard smartphone
category if you watched our full review
of the active you'll recall that it's
essentially a galaxy s4 in a beefed-up
shell with most of the hallmark features
of that flagship so this is no surprise
if you're looking for a top-of-the-line
Android phone that can handle some abuse
the galaxy s4 active is the hands-down
winner especially considering the
subsidized price on contract but hold on
specs aren't everything what if you need
an Android smartphone but you're more
worried about the durability than the
feature set the b15 actually brings some
heat here and caterpillars webpage for
the phone makes that plain if this were
home improvement in the mid-90s Tim
Allen would call this a man's phone both
it and the galaxy s4 active are rated to
the ip67 standard for dust proving and
immersion and water up to a meter deep
for up to 30 minutes
neither one offers any additional
safeguards against impacts like milspec
durability rating but the b15
offer something pretty sweet that the
active doesn't wet finger tracking on
the display that means when it's soaked
it should still respond to touch inputs
in a reasonably accurate fashion
something we definitely can't say about
the s4 active before we move on it needs
to be said the B 15 s added bulk over
the active it paired with its slightly
recessed screen and aluminum side rails
makes it less pocketable and less
attractive yes but it also makes us less
apprehensive about dropping it again
there's no milspec rating of any sort to
back that up but the B 15 just feels
hearty err that all changes when we come
around to the Kyocera torque sprints
bear grylls endorsed android phone that
we reviewed a few months back in
addition to the ip67 immersion and dust
resistance rating the torque is rated to
military standard 810g for shock
vibration temperature extremes blowing
rain low pressure solar radiation salt
fog and humidity as the spiritual
successor to sprint solder nextel phones
the torque ain't playing around now the
B 15s wet finger tracking means it's
screen should work a little better when
covered in water but overall the torques
cools the cat phone and durability as a
mid-range phone it's also more directly
comparable to the feature set of the B
15 each has a dual core processor and
each runs a fairly skinless build of
Android the displays are the same size
and the cameras bear the same 5
megapixel resolution it's mainly the
torques milspec durability rating LTE
radio and fancy transducer earpiece that
works through hearing protection that
set it apart we took a look at the
Samsung rugby pro back in December in
the context of a tour of a TTS
push-to-talk service we've since
returned our demo units to AT&amp;amp;T but as
the rugby is the carrier's closest
analogue to the bee 15 we thought it
worth a mention at $449 off contract the
rugby pro is still $100 more expensive
than the B 15 but there's a reason for
that like all the others the rugby pro
offers LTE and like the torque it's
certified to mil spec in this case
standard 810 F for dust humidity
rain and shock and like all the others
waterproof based on the ip67 rating the
rugby pro also obviously offers out of
box support for ATS push-to-talk service
which is worth mentioning for you walkie
talkie users out there finally we come
to the most fragile rugged phone around
the Xperia Z from Sony in fairness we
need to make the point that Sony doesn't
market the Z as a quote unquote rugged
device because it isn't like its tablet
sibling it's just waterproof those
ratings are ip57 and IP 5x with the Z
protected against low pressure Jets of
water from all practicable directions
and against immersion in once again one
meter of fresh water for up to 30
minutes that moisture resistance is an
excellent thing to have but the Z's all
glass construction means it's nowhere
near is resistant to impact as the v15
or really any of the other devices on
this list we just included here for the
sake of completeness given that t-mobile
USA has just started offering the Xperia
Z for sale there are many more rugged
devices on the US market including some
Verizon branded Casio handsets we'll be
taking a look at soon this is by no
means a comprehensive look at how the
b15 fits into the landscape or even how
well it performs remember this is not a
review but at just under $350 unlocked
bearing a brand recognized and respected
the world over the B 15 is significant
enough to consider for those who need a
rugged smartphone on either AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile and don't need fancy features
4G or constraining contracts if that
sounds like you the cat b15 is at least
worth a look even if it's just to gawk
at the novelty of a smart phone carrying
the brand of an industrial equipment
manufacturer
that's going to do it for now folks hope
you enjoyed the quick look if you have
something to say drop it in the comments
but before you do that like us if you
enjoyed the video after you're done with
all that
