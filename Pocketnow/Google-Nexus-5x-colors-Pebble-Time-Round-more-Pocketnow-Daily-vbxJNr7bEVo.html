color options to expect LG teases its
v10 smartphone with a very interesting
ad and make way for the new pebble time
round I'm hiya Metro iveta wondering
exactly what company would use a haircut
in an ad to tease a phone but hey this
is parking out daily the official news
today start with Samsung and the gear s2
it seems to the device is off to a very
interesting start in Korea because uh
well the units that were set out for
pre-orders were depleted the question is
exactly how many pre-order units were
there because we've got some sources
claiming that Samsung only put a
thousand units out there and we do know
that apple sold a couple of million
units on the first couple of days so
yeah the gear s2 is coming to the United
States very soon let's see how it goes
and for those of you wondering exactly
what the final name of the blackberry
Venice would be well we've got up in
blast already claiming that apparently
the name is blackberry print or prive it
could be pride because it probably hints
privacy but then again it's only priv
there's no e at the end so it's really
hard to understand exactly what the
purpose would be for print or whatever
but apparently this is the final name we
just don't know exactly when we'll get
the product for those of you to join
this with the disappointment of the LG
class the company kind of got the hint
and now they are teasing the lgb 10 for
an October first event now this is very
interesting because the ad on the video
and the links of the description shows
you a girl getting sort of a haircut a
really quick haircut not really
understanding what the whole purpose of
this teaser would be but October first
will be the time for us to know about
that super premium phone from LG and
those of you interested in the LG google
nexus 5x we've got some trusted sources
already providing us renders of the
color options it seems that you will
have it in black white and some sort of
a teal blue green or whatever that color
made beef it's great to have color
options just not sure exactly why this
particular color and not something more
I don't know gold or something that's a
little more popular right now
but again we should be getting these a
new Nexus devices probably September's
29 stay tuned and finally for the very
hot news of the day pebble has just
announced its pebble time round this is
a very interesting new SmartWatch
because it's a pebble time in a round
design with insane bezels yes you do
have different color options different
size band options though at the moment
there won't be any metallic bands
available product is already available
for pre-order and apparently people are
going crazy over it because uh yeah for
some people it does look like a
classical timepiece and you do get the
benefits of the average pebble now
pebble is advertising this product as
the thinnest and lightest SmartWatch in
the market which is not necessarily
something that people are looking for
people want chef but then again we can't
deny that there are some positive things
about this product design so it does
lead me to the question of the day what
do you think about the new pebble time
round is this a product something you're
considering in my case no I find the
bezels to be just insanely huge just too
much for a watch like this I do love
devices like the Moto 360 without bezels
almost but then again that's just my
taste leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know what you think about this
product friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the news

comments trade tube channel as well and
