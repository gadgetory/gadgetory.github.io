now calm and this is the unboxing video
for the mobi Nova ice now if you've
never heard of moby nova before that's
because this is their first windows
mobile device what's unique about this
device is that it has two screens one
which is the main screen the same
resolution as the samsung omnia and then
it has another OLED screen that is used
as the d-pad and programs specific
function so we're looking forward to
taking a look at this device now this
box or the contents of this box isn't
what you would get if you were to buy
this device this is just the review
version so let's get to the unboxing
alright there we go a little difficult
to get the tape off there and let's see
what we got inside again this is not the
final packaging that you will get if you
buy the device and here's the device
itself in some bubble wrap let's take it
out it feels very interesting feels like
a slate smaller than I would have
expected actually and it's got a piece
of film on the front so let's take that
off it's a very slick device it's got a
whole shiny covering right on the front
and it's hard to tell but there's
actually the secondary screen right here
it feels much like a slate very similar
to the samsung omnia in fact here is the
omnia and they have a very similar form
factor very minimalist buttons on the
front and probably the same with 2 i'd
say okay so let's take a look at this
against the touch HD a device with a
much larger screen of course much wider
to I'd imagine that this would feel good
as a phone in the hand because kind of
has the iphone form factor where it's
very narrow and let's take a look at the
HTC touch pro and of course it is much
thinner than that so we'll have more on
pocketnow.com coming up soon that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
