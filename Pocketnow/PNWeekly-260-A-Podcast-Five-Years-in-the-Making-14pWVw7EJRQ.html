the new episode of Keeping Up with the
Kardashians last night I happened with
that Kourtney you know she's uh she's
pregnant and she's she's a little bit on
edge and you know Scott's opening as a
restaurant you know I just this is so
fun to see all that come together but I
guess I'll have to catch it on DVR or I
think we should give out your personal
email address and the people should just
start sending you emails and start
sending you spoilers about the next step
so they're keeping up with the
kardashians yeah I think that's a good
recurring idea fine I just thought open
them we uh this is an entirely new
endeavor for us at at pocket now the
podcast
five years in the making we're all a
little older you know um I think we
probably just need a little bit more
horsepower on this intro Michael would
you would you be so kind would you lend
an assist here it would be my pleasure
one excellent a podcast five years in
the making a few more wrinkles a little
more girth around the midsection the
stories continue this week we'll be
discussing LG's week sales Apple's 3d
face and Samsung's slow AI progress plus
we'll take a trip down memory lane with
a group of people that have worked on
this show since its inception
make sure your phaser banks are charged
and ready for episode two six zero over

these moment
occasions this podcast that we're
putting together this week these these
announcements tend to happen in cycles
I'm going back and listening to the very
first episode of this podcast and you
guys had a very special announcement to
make on Episode one of the pocket high
weekly and we have another similar
announcement to make on the fifth year
anniversary of the pocket now weekly
Tony would you like to jump in and let
our viewers know what's going on with
pocket now developments my pleasure but
first of all I have to say if these
sponsorships these as wouldn't pay some
bills they're don't they're awesome we
have not invented the time machine even
though I wish we would have and I'm not
really sure if I would have would have
gone back in time or or in the future
but this is a format in which I really
feel at home I have no speech I'm just
rambling because this is the format
where I'm joined by not only colleagues
ex colleagues but also friends and we've
been doing this for quite a long time
and regardless if we are pocket now or
mr. mobile or no longer in the business
or or new colleagues what binds us is
the friendship even though we're meeting
probably once or twice per year in
strange locations for like five or ten
minutes I really feel that I'm I'm at
home here and before I go any more
sentimental on this we have a huge
announcement we've been working like
crazy for I cannot tell you how long
because I lost track of time on trying
to come with a solution to the audience
out there which is speaking Spanish and
Spanish is a language which is spoken by
27 countries more than 500 million
people speak Spanish and if you are one
of those people who speak Spanish and
you want the latest news reviews
editorial everything you've been
accustomed to from PocketNow but in your
language in espanol now we have
PocketNow Spanish for you you can find
it at es dot pocketnow.com no ahead we
got content already and we're working on
getting social media up to speed and
everything so if you
in Spanish that's where you have to go
we're just posed to say that in Spanish
because the people that speak Spanish
don't know what you just said I wish I
wish I could but my other colleague who
speaks Spanish
is probably jail bull ashamed of the
polishing up the last the last minute
changes so back to you Juan thank you
very much for this you know we're gonna
have Jaime on next week on the pocket
out weekly to explain that better
Brandon because unfortunately the guy
with the most Spanish name in this
podcast can barely order the burger and
fries so yes definitely check that out
yes dot pocketnow.com for all of the
latest tech news and reviews in espanol
and so without like I said I can usually
get through about two or three words at
a time um without further ado let's
let's jump into some news so we can get
everyone talking on this thing I didn't
know if we would have a new stab or not
we haven't been on a live hangout for a
while and I'm hoping that I can even
make it through the show because I have
three different pieces of audio Hardware
just getting me audible on this without
turning into robot voice but I want to
kick things off one of the biggest
controversies of the of this last week
the oneplus 5 has had a number of sort
of critical commentary regarding various
aspects of the phone different reviewers
have been finding different things to
pick out but I think the biggie this
week has been the jelly scrolling uh
because and we don't know exactly why
this has been taking place where as
you're flicking through a vertical
column
it seems text and pieces will start to
compress and look a little wobbly let me
let me start off with Brandon I because
you've been in this game for a while
these types of issues seem to echo
chamber and resonate in tech communities
but it's been my experience that over
these last couple years the influence
for this kind of tech chatter doesn't
seem to impact the consumer impression
of these gadgets nearly as as
aggressively as it used to
yeah I think you're exactly right I mean
the the 1+5 is such a good phone and
even II
in the rare cases where you have that
jello effect it's it's kind of tough to
pick up
unless you're really looking at it the
story behind the display cable is funny
though you guys know that the the
display cable for the displays in the
upper right corner and that's where all
the kind of camera hang up the camera
sensors live if you kind of turn over
the phone that's where they are in the
upper left corner of the phone and so
they couldn't put the display cable up
there anymore because they had the dual
camera sensors so they just they flipped
it upside down and in the kernel they
have the display inverted with software
which in most cases is perfectly fine
and it really doesn't take that much
processing for the phone to do and and
thus there's no impact but in some cases
it causes this jello effect but from the
people that I've talked to that have
this phone none of them have the effect
what about you guys no I didn't tell him
I review device I didn't know what
people are so I can I can simulate it i
I can if and again it seems to be most
it's not as pervasive UI it seems to be
certain apps time or scroll depending on
some piece of code which is affected by
this potentially effect I mean this is
all still speculation right we don't
know exactly what might be causing this
on certain review units but we're
pointing more towards the one change
that is affecting the one plus five
being this screen inversion where we had
to fit this cable link we had to flip
the the display upside down um Michael
when we look at the perception of a
brand like the perception of a company
like oneplus they're trying to sell this
you know we're this tiny little upstart
we're fighting the big players is this a
bigger deal than say benchmark rigging
you know in our communities with our fan
base we're always looking for something
to criticize we're always looking for
something to attack it seems
and it seems like oneplus has kind of a
couple points where our our respective
audiences are sort of you know pulling
out the pitchforks in the torches yeah
and the oneplus audience is certainly
you know the target consumer for a
oneplus device is certainly going to be
or fastidious about trying to figure out
whether there is anything wrong with the
device at all I don't know the benchmark
rating is a totally separate thing I
think that that's you know that's that's
old for other ball of wax but whether
it's that or the the jelly scroll effect
which by the way their response to it I
think is all kinds of wrong which is
that it's intended behavior or something
like that I think people if they want a
one plus five we're gonna buy one and
take their chances and see you know if
it has the problem that it has the
problem maybe I'll get sorted out
because it's it's still a pretty good
value but I don't know you know it's
like I didn't have the problem because I
haven't encountered the problem
firsthand it's not something that I'm
that that is on my mind all the time we
have to remember that Samsung came back
from phones that literally ikonn fire
right
and we're like they're not doing
terribly worse for wear this but despite
missing partial part of a cycle for it
so I'm not concerned about one plusses
reputation in the long run especially
considering what is it it's four years
that they've been around and
it messaging has not despite all of us
talking about it all the time it's not
yet been widely accepted that this whole
like we're a feisty upstart and we're
gonna make some mistakes is really not
at all accurate because they anytime
that they're in trouble they can just go
across the street to to their corporate
parent and get a bag of money and keep
on going you know their main well and
and Tony I mean like you know to
Michael's point me they don't even have
to go across the street I mean their
offices are in the same building I think
I am the least qualified in talking
about the 1 + 5 because touch the foam
yet but I think I can talk to what I
feel if I take a step back and how I
perceive the market nowadays I see a
shift in paradigm I don't see companies
pushing the envelope like they did a
couple of years back I think now the
entire business is about cutting corners
is about trying to keep the price as low
as possible opposed to if you're trying
to push the envelope your price goes so
high that probably people won't afford
to buy your phone so in walking that
very
line between keeping the costs down
keeping the phone thing keeping the
specs as high as possible it is I think
acceptable to make some air quotes
mistakes or design decisions which in
the end help your product and if that
particular flaw is not a deal-breaker I
think that we are just picking on a
company or on a product just because we
have to do it as media in order for our
audiences to be as well informed as
possible well yeah okay i branded please
yeah I was gonna say I think that the
biggest perception issue with the 1+5 is
this expectation they they created
around the camera I mean when you take
the box out it says on both sides dual
camera clear photos and my in my
experience one plus five camera is like
the most hidden miss camera I've ever
used like literally fifty percent of the
shots I try to take come out terribly
and so you know when you when you kind
of play up the bonus but they're the
camera aspect of a phone and then that
does not deliver I think that does more
damage than a scrolling issue that most
people aren't even seeing well and
especially because I thought that was
also gonna be something really important
to talk about was this perception of the
company they're making I think in
obvious homage to another smartphone
manufacturer and some of the options
that they're about is very well aware of
my recent comparisons between some other
manufacturer uh but yeah no I agree I
think this is this is what's this is
what's gonna be curious to me because I
think people who have been following
this major company look at a brand like
oboe which I think tried to compete by
pushing the envelope and really trying
to deliver some techie enthusiastic
enthusiasts fun features and then made a
significant pivot towards a more
mass-market approach and I wonder if
maybe this might be a transition point
for one plus I I don't know can
can a brand like this survive only
courting enthusiasts and trying to win a
price war that can't really be won
is it is it time for them to kind of
pack that in and start looking at other
ways that they can kind of keep margins
higher and appeal to a more of a more
broad consumer base well making the
price increasingly higher so yeah well
that's that's I mean that's the problem
right if you keep playing it like the
tiniest of margins then your company
can't really make money off the same
group of consumers and I think in that
way one plus was quite smart to come in
to the game with a $2.99 smartphone when
most of its contemporaries were selling
for like twice the price because they
had a lot of room above that price here
to expand upward and yeah every year
it's been sort of mentioned that yeah
the new oneplus is great but it's more
expensive so but it's still a great deal
they still have another generation where
they can do that again
and before you know I was just recently
finishing up my review of the Moto Z to
play and it's unlocked it's gonna be
$4.99 and at that price point it's like
well um you know this is debatable but
either one plus five is very much in the
conversation at that price point so you
know they're playing the game right and
I still I think they have another years
worth of room to play there that is very
true well and also I just think the
increased competition around that sub
$500 price has just gotten so brutal
that carry the same novelty but I want
to switch gears here I'm talking moving
from a company which is sort of you know
flattering Apple design to a company
that is Apple one of the worst
transitions I've ever pulled off in the
other podcast I so we've been getting
various reports again a little bit of
the controversy of what might be
surrounding this this company this year
you know we we might be looking at Apple
dropping the the fingerprint sensor on
this next generation of iPhone it looks
like Apple is running into some of the
same issues that phase that Samsung
faced with the Galaxy s8 and they are
maybe going to opt for
and only face unlock I'm gonna start off
with you Tony and looking at security
and looking at how we produce consumer
friendly products will this be too
significant of a change you know we're
not only getting rid of the home button
but then also this fingerprint security
that Apple helped popularize that really
made people comfortable about using
their phone for things other than just
email if if I would have to predict
again as objectively as possible I would
say that that will or might not happen
in the near future because Apple has
been pushing the fingerprint scanner
touch baby so hard since three or four
years when it was first introduced
you've got fingerprint scanner for
security reasons on your phone you've
got it implemented with iOS 11 and its
beta it's got it's been interconnected
with the App Store with Apple pay with
your Mac's with your with your Apple
watch so I don't think that they will
get rid of it the button maybe maybe
they can find a solution in trying to
keep the touch ID somewhere on the back
or behind the screen but I think that
the face scanner or whatever its name
will be will come to compliment touch ID
which has been proven to work very well
for Apple it's fast it's reliable and a
lot of people are invested in it
yeah like so many other things about
Apple it wasn't the first to use this
kind of tech but they kind of set a
standard for it Brandon can can they can
they succeed with so many changes you
know we this is probably the the most
aggressive refresh of the iPhone line
we've ever seen on the iPhone has been
very consistently evolving since the
original and now it looks like they've
saved up a number of tech changes all
for one phone we're always a little wary
of a first gen product does this feel
like Apple is is gonna bite off more
than they can chew I feel like they've
been working on this for so long and I
feel like so many people have been
waiting for this for so long I mean I'm
thinking about my mother and my father
and like my aunt and uncle and my
brother is my sister they're all waiting
for a big iPhone upgrade they want
something that gives them that same
feeling the
years ago when they took out the 5s or
their the five for the first time was a
four for the first enticement Cohen's
that actually looked different um so
there's a lot of pent-up demand for
something dramatic and I think it'll be
very successful and Tony you were
talking about how you know Apple has
invested so much in the fingerprint
sensor and I agree and if you think
about the authentic authentication
methods what's the right word for that
where you you got it no I was gonna say
authentication thank you guys are like
dictionary if you look at all the
authentication methods face unlock iris
scanning fingerprint scanning toe
scanning whatever else there is the most
convenient by far is fingerprint
scanning because you don't have to look
at your phone you could be in any
circumstance you could be in your pocket
while you do it you could be paying for
something face unlock if it's an it's
the only authentication method is so
inconvenient
I can't imagine I'm Apple putting all
their weight behind something imagine
checking out it at a store and you have
to sit there and go like that even if
it's really fast its it's not like a
fingerprint so um I can't see them
leaving a fingerprint before we head
back to Michael or we had to Michael
just one note on what you said I have
the complete opposite experience with my
friends and family and everybody who's
using an iPhone for the life in them
they wouldn't want the iPhone to change
because they're so used to it
nobody would ever consider using an
Android even though I've got examples
from my personal inner circle the Galaxy
s8 looks a lot better than the iPhone
but they just wouldn't switch because
they're so used to those icons being
there they're so used to those buttons
being there they're so used to that
phone doing what they know how to make
that phone to do that they just are I
don't know hesitancy you accept the
change if that makes sense well and
actually that's the question I wanted to
throw to Michael is we have an
established understanding of how an
iPhone works I mean even for adding
things like force pressing into the
screen if you were to take someone with
an original iPhone and give them an
iPhone 7 plus there wouldn't be much
relearning for them to navigate that
phone with with
these potential changes coming down for
the iPhone 8 will Apple be able to move
the needle on some of these new
technologies I think yes but I think
only if they're able to introduce it in
a supplementary way I agree with Tony
and Brandon both there's it seems highly
improbable to me that Apple would ditch
the fingerprint scanner entirely because
of what Tony is talking about like
people are used to this paradigm and
what Brandon's talking about it's a much
more convenient way to unlock your phone
than face unlock even when face unlock
works very swiftly as it has on the s8
and in most conditions yeah I mean so I
think that 3d touch is a good example
one because I don't think a lot of
people use it still to this day but
Apple continues to hone it and right I'm
you know there's we're gonna probably
see some some more developments there I
think it has to be able why is it doing
that just too long so that's been my
biggest problem is is when you look at a
tech like 3d touch there's a problem of
conveyance yeah right there's very
little to alert the user that there is
an additional function on this icon if
they force press it versus just sort of
a standard long press but when a major
marketing point on something like 3d
face unlock is put through the
juggernaut of Apple marketing I feel
like there's the potential here for them
to do better with this than what Samsung
was able to do to raise awareness on
something like iris scanning yeah I
think that's certainly true but I still
think though that there's you know what
did you say before I mean I'd the apples
apples main aim main strategy is to take
an existing technology and implement it
better right and I just I think it's a
it would be uncharacteristically bold
and rather risky of Apple to discontinue
the fingerprint scanner on a device with
this new authentication technology I
don't I would be very surprised no I I
agree there I I worry that with so many
different changes the change in the
display the change in not having sort of
that circle home button location down at
the bottom that they do stand to
alienate a few customers like I look at
grandmother in her iPad and she
understands how everything and ecosystem
works based on this home button so I
definitely share some concerns now a
company that has been very conservative
in tech updates switching gears to a
company that's very aggressive in tech
updates we have some noise you know some
some some rumors or some discussion that
Samsung might also be trying to join the
AI speaker game positioning bixby for a
different kind of usage or audience but
at the same time that development on
bixby communicating with Westerners who
speak English that that voice
translation is taking its time Michael
you're already rubbing your temples I
feel like you have something to say like
I I remember sitting there and when when
Samsung was talking about the essay that
Bixby at the s8 announcement and there
literally said it's gonna replace
everything that you need to touch your
phone for you'll be able to use your
voice for and I remember sitting there
being like this is a massive
over-promised and they cannot help but
under deliver on this but the degree to
which Samsung has under delivered with
victory in the West is rather staggering
and I think if the s8 were not such a
great phone in every other respect
almost yeah they begin a lot more heat
for it because they'd certainly deserve
it and now they're gonna they're gonna
expand the product line with more
hardware that running software that
cannot help but be it will fit
ill-suited to to the purpose because it
doesn't have a lot of data because it
doesn't work that well because it's not
in many markets because a lot of people
are not using generative nonsense no no
I wish this would never I wish this
wouldn't come out well and Brandon it's
been my hypothesis that I don't feel
like any companies really noise nailed
the Star Trek style voice Butler
assistant or anything like that so I
feel there's still room for a player to
come in and really shake things up but I
kind of feel like Samsung on a number of
their first-party in-house solutions
that they're more often likely to
reinvent the wheel as opposed to really
push the boundaries on what this tech
can do yeah I mean they have to go they
have to follow everyone that's
before them because like Michael said
they don't have access to the data I am
so excited about you know it's so funny
because if you were to go back in time
yeah the 90s and you would say like
what's the new tech thing coming no one
could predict the internet would take
over like it did and then if you went to
like the year 2000 no one could predict
that the phone would would be as
pervasive as it is and then if you went
to like 2010 mean no one could predict
this idea of ambient computing and how
like you don't need to stare at a screen
all the time to perform so many
computing tasks and so I've got an
Amazon echo in almost every room and and
and you know I'm really that echo thing
like I I kind of wish I could get a
Google insistent but I just couldn't
justify it my wife would yell at me and
then to have a home pod plus a Bigsby
speaker plus Microsoft still hasn't come
out with their thing yet I mean you know
they're coming out with a tremendous
competitor to all worse is their
competitor the Xbox like is that they're
their living room assault on on this
type of product you know we have
basically you know it's hilarious
so we have a PlayStation 4 because my
wife did not want to connect listening
to everything in the living room and
we're surrounded by always-on
microphones right that's just sort of
like from our phones tablets everything
like that actually let me let me shift
that over to Tony who do you think could
potentially shake up this market right
now it seems like the current fight is
between Alexa and Google assistant you
know my feelings like I would love to
see IBM deliver a consumer facing
solution for Watson you know I guess a
company that could really push the
boundaries on what we can do with voice
control but it seems really unlikely
that they're interested in that part of
the market why my friend you've managed
to find the only person in the room who
has never used any of these because
they're not available in my region
though on a theoretical note Google home
is not available here Amazon Alexa is
not available here nothing is available
here I'm not even the the Apple whatever
home pod will not be available here I do
have a Western first world problem that
we're complaining about bixby not being
translated no but I think at the
theoretical level there's no way for a
company to win under the current
circumstances because all of these
products basically do everything that
the other product is doing so if I were
to pick a winner I would say that the
winner company will be the company who
will make things either differently or
will make new things and I don't know
what that new thing - because you can
order a cab order a pizza go to the
movies shop online you can basically
talk to a personal home assistant like
you would be talking to a normal person
so I think that since they all do the
same it will come down to the cost and
who does it a little bit better because
I don't see these products doing
anything new or anything that they don't
already do well and I feel like there
are so many of these baby steps
I think smartwatches were a perfect
example of a tech that wasn't going to
ever be super long-lived
kind of like Bluetooth headsets back in
the day you know everyone had a
bluetooth now very few people I mean you
see more cabled headphones in my neck of
the woods which is really disconcerting
when you see people driving with their
headphones but we keep getting these
little glimpses Tony holds up his
Plantronics yeah I had one of those too
and I forget what they were not like the
Flamingo or something like that
sorry just lost my train of thought uh
but we keep getting these little
glimpses you know Google totally
flopping with Google glass rumors of
Apple pushing back some kind of heads up
display till potentially 2019 if it's
ever delivered and yet we kind of keep
all then circling on something that
shows some minor consumer success in the
short term and then that tech burns
itself out smartwatches make a little
bit of a blip the Apple watch comes out
sales spiked and now they're kind of
done do
do we think that that's maybe where the
opportunity lies the the company that's
willing to take a bigger risk on being
first potentially losing the market to
other companies that follow but then we
actually do get something truly new or
are we kind of done is this we're not
going to stay for a while it's not
enough for it to be new it also has to
be useful because you can come up with a
lot of features like Bixby on the Galaxy
s8 if it doesn't work it's not useful
for me I'm not going to use it even if
it would be available so let's say if
Amazon Google or Apple or Microsoft or
you name it we'll probably come up with
something who would I don't know rub
your feet if it's not useful for me
it'll not be a winning product yeah
Brandon oh sorry Brooke real quick I
want to throw this one done Brandon
because I kind of cut him off before he
was finishing up his point there but
Brandon do you think that this is maybe
evidence that were quickly approaching
the post smartphone world like we now
currently live in the post desktop and
laptop world where we're trying to find
these other market segments that expand
on data and services beyond just the
glowing rectangle that fits in our
pocket okay can I make a little bit of a
prediction of where this is all going
yes please and I'm gonna put money on it
hold on okay I gotta call my bookie so
this might not come out right but but
okay so and this probably only makes
sense if you actually use these products
in your life these ambient computing
devices so the first stage of these
ambient computing devices is to say it's
the audio response you ask it a question
it answers or you ask it to do something
digital right so we can play a song or
it can unlock your front door if you
have to connect it or turn on your
lights or whatever the next step of that
is what we're seeing now with the echo
show where it can actually show you
things so you could say like you know
show me the front door camera or like
show me all the different variations of
the color red or whatever like that what
comes after that I this is a this is a
question that I think I have the answer
to but and Tony you kind of hinted at it
what what is like the ultimate
manifestation of ambient computing after
it can say things to you and show you
things then it can do things for you do
things for you and that and that will
manifest itself in a robotic form and I
really believe that the way that this is
going is that imagine Amazon in the
future open sourcing their Alexa
platforms so that you could create a
robot that would interface with all of
their ability to understand language and
to show you things so developers could
make a robot that could make your bed or
create as you said Tony rub your feet or
could do the dishes it's not that hard
to have a robot do the dishes in fact
you know you guys might remember hearing
yes exactly and and like if you have the
physical manifestation of Alexa and it
can hear you and it can move its limbs
and it can act like a human being
then it can do things for you and I
think in not too far into the future it
might start with very limited use case
robots but in the future we'll have
these programmable rep robots where
developers can add skills to it like
real skills to make your bed or take out
your trash or do whatever you want
you guys ever watch to show humans on
AMC yes I knew you would have a good
media reference you wouldn't let me down
there so is this is this kind of where
we're arriving Michael is the this the
confluence of expanding on services and
data better interoperability
I think what's kind of funny is watching
Google come full circle around to where
the original iPhone was with web apps
now we have these sort of persistent web
plugins that developers can kind of put
into web browsers for us instead of
downloading the full app is the next
step literally taking these things out
of our hands as you know walking meat
bags and handing them over to robots and
Butler's and androids are basically I
want to know in my lifetime will I have
a command their data that can do all my
chores for me well if you do I certainly
hope you don't go the Bruce Maddox
rude and try to try to strip them in his
voice you know I think it's important to
understand that he won't be yours no I
it's quite an interesting picture of our
eminent robot future I hadn't thought I
really hadn't thought about that and I
but I can't see any other way that it
was that it would develop and that
immensely exciting to me I just hope I
get to see you to my life and we'll have
to create a whole other podcast to talk
about the ethical concerns of having
artificially intelligent potentially
self-aware systems that are basically
are still practicing law I want to
switch gears to something that I
actually find to be this was this was
actually sort of a disappointing news
story for me this this year I feel a
number of smartphone companies are are
finding some really great traction in
revamping their product lines fresh new
takes on design on aesthetics without
necessarily walking away from some of
the core techy audience and we've got
some sales numbers here now for phones
like the LG G 6 the the iPhone found a
little bit more of a resurgence the
iPhone 7 Galaxy s8 is selling well
though Samsung's numbers are still lower
because of the note 7 but it was the LG
G 6 that really did disappoint me that
it seemed like it was just too early
that consumers played the waiting game
the Galaxy s8 was right around the
corner
LG didn't make enough of being first for
2017 in many markets and that seems to
be affecting their overall sales that
they're they're sort of produced under
under producing right now Tony I mean
especially because I finally think I
found a phone that you can talk about
because you have spent some time with it
um what are your thoughts did consumers
miss out on an underrated phone or were
they right to hold off I think I look at
other options I think that them there
are two mistakes and both our mistakes
have LG did the first mistake is it's
not about who's first or who's second
because if it was about that HTC would
be the top of the charts because they're
all
the last large something with the you 11
no I think that the first mistake LG did
was not invest enough dollars in
marketing the LBG six which is a great
phone now I'm not sure about the US but
here in my region the most ads I see are
about the Galaxy s8 and second comes the
huawei p10
the second biggest mistake or the second
mistake I think that made people hold
off on the g6 is again that particular
fragmentation who only talked about in
one of your videos where the Korean LG
g6 with the 64 Giga storage with the
wireless charging with the Wi-Fi that is
available in Korea and it's not
available in Europe or in the US so if
I'm in Europe or in the u.s. of course
I'm not gonna buy something which is so
much lower than its own sibling not to
mention the competition so I think these
two combined led to a story which
doesn't surprise me at all LG's got a
great phone but I think that they failed
at at giving it its full potential well
and Michael you and I both recently went
back to putting our personal Sims into
LG G sixes for a period of time I don't
know if you're still using the g6 I I
took mine for a zoo trip and it was
actually the perfect camera phone for
chasing around a toddler I got this
amazing like her meeting a baby
chimpanzee between the glass and it was
this photo burst that I don't know I
could have pulled off with another phone
I just like right time right place
camera app actually fired up quickly
from the first time so what what are
your thoughts just like you know kind of
coming back revisiting it we've gotten
over the initial sort of honeymoon
period of S eights and you Elevens does
this still have a place in the
conversation or did LG stumble too much
in diversifying the g6 and under
advertising it I feel like I've been
asked a lot about the g6 on Twitter from
from people who know to ask about the g6
because their phone phone geeks right
and a lot of those questions are in the
context of should I buy the 1 + 5 or the
or the
six cuz that seems to be the question a
lot of phone geeks trash themselves by
contrast I was just at a 4th of July
barbecue where I was asked by a couple
normal people what phone to get net next
and the g6 entered the conversation with
those people who I knew were interested
in photography they had never heard of
it and it took me showing them some of
my Instagram feed because I I think I'm
like you wanna I've actually always kept
it since its release it's always been on
a second pocket because I can't get away
from that wide-angle camera I think it's
just yeah oh my god for a for an
untrained photographer such as myself I
mean that's the shortcut to make it a
dramatic awesome looking photo that
makes it look like you know what you're
doing you know it's like yeah totally
it's really cool so it deserves a place
in the conversation I think is the way I
would put it you couple that with I mean
listen it's not a sexy as a essayed it's
you know the hardware sort of looks like
a reference design a little bit but it's
it's rugged it's it's more rugged and
then the essay it is the software you
you know a custom launcher fixes a lot
of the software problems and other and
it's got in my market
it's got wireless charging rhino it's
it's got some stuff going for it and
it's freakin cheap now at 500 bucks on
t-mobile so it deserves to be in the
conversation without advertising it's it
has as much chance as any other phone
that doesn't get advertised you know
it'll disappear and LG will move on to
the next thing and unless they advertise
that that'll disappear too it's very
frustrating because I think with what
you said that it has as much chance as
any other phone without advertising and
I think that this is where we the media
or the consumers somehow had too big of
an expectation for this phone mm-hmm
wasn't wanted I'm sorry one no no no
please please please we wanted to be
caught up in this you know what would it
with the resurrection stud not the
resurrection story different things we
we were I think we're speaking
personally I was caught up in this
redemption story of a company that made
an OK phone last year that was just it
sold so poorly that it damaged the
company and in a lot of ways to see them
come back and really make something
quite compelling on a lot of levels was
encouraging but but if you remember we
we we've been wishing for LG to find its
place since the G flex of course yeah
well and and Brandon did I kind of feel
like LG's strategy places way too much
pressure on those of us who talk about
gadgets online to pick up a huge part of
the education for consumers again at the
top of the show we were talking about
like our you know we don't have quite
the same influence over the market as we
once did whereas you take a look at a
company like Samsung and not only are
they plastering advertising everywhere
they're also bringing YouTube reviews to
television commercials alright where LG
can't even get a carrier deal that will
feature their phone for a 15-second spot
that no one's gonna watch anyway do you
think that there's a way for them
recover in this market when the problem
doesn't seem to be the quality of the
phone it seems to be a problem of
Education yeah it's a problem of
Education and we used to talk about how
you know HTC would have yeah they had
some bad years but they had some good
years really really good years like the
the original and seven with the bottom
speakers of anyone ever or maybe back
then in the day was and like they just
didn't advertise it at all and I think I
think a big problem that LG has is that
they've decided that they are going to
be the first to release a phone in the
beginning of the year you know after the
laws the holidays all the phones are out
in January February and then the
springtime comes then there's LG with
their phone and it's really cool for
like a month or two and especially this
year because it assured in the first
wave of these bezel-less phones that
we're seeing this year or bezel lists
all renessa phones but like right away
you get the s8 boom and then you get the
the new HTC boom and then the 1+5 boom
and then right around the corners then
the no date and it's just like it's over
it's over before it began one or two
months of exclusive newness is just not
enough especially if you're not going to
advertise it do you think it would have
stood a chance or or things would have
played out differently if say LG g6 came
after the s8 I think they would even
lower
I think it would be yeah I think history
teaches that makes no difference because
the g3 and g4 launched in that window
now they didn't I mean they may have
done better comparatively but they
didn't do very well yeah I think the g4
was probably the closest LG has been to
really executing a foam launch well and
working with a couple carriers just to
show the phone that it existed to other
consumers and they had a talking point
about leatherbacks and I had questions
from family and friends like oh that's
kind of cool that's something unique in
the same way that Motorola's Moto maker
there was a little spark of interest but
then pretty much everyone went back to
iPhones as always but again I feel like
without the pervasive awareness at the
consumer level your brand cannot
transition into being a lifestyle
element like an iPhone is something you
leave the house with with your wallet
and keys like it's that important it's a
fashion accessory and and it helps
inform what your style is and I think LG
finally delivered a phone that could
compliment someone's style if that's the
right fit for you the g6 is a stunning
phone but no one knows about it so no
one's gonna buy it
I want to blitz through we've got three
more quick talking points which I just
thought were kind of funny that these
are companies popping back up in the
news since we were you know we're
talking about like looking back at you
know sort of PocketNow classic we got a
confirmation it was in my Twitter feed
this morning that Zeiss is confirmed to
be working with hmd for new Nokia
flagships do you think we're gonna get
another super 41 megapixel shooter is
this all gonna be smaller dual cameras
and zooms and stuff like that can I ask
a question about that yes you can
Zeiss so you're the expert here it is
ice only did the the lens technology
right they didn't do anything with
regard to the sensor or the OAS or any
of that stuff the sensor I had an
interview I think it was the 2014 or
2013 MWC it was I think back in the day
of the pure view one the initial peer
review and they had at the Nokia booth
back then they had people from size
actually
talking about the technology and I
specifically asked them whether it's
only about the lens and the story is
pretty much the same as it is with with
Huawei and like they are also invested
in fine tuning that particular algorithm
of outputting the final product
so it's not just the lens it's not the
sensor and its entirety but it's the
processing of the image that's exciting
to me I think my only my only piece of
maybe worthwhile input is that we will
have to wait and see what the results
are from this whatever this mystery
device will will be or family of devices
because as we know as we saw from the
Hasselblad moto Z collaboration yeah a
name does not make a great picture yeah
have your name on that as we've learned
in 2016
software is the future of cameras you
can take a phone without oh I yes and
the results are just unbelievably
spectacular and maybe only the best tech
companies in the world can do this talk
about the peers now but well until you
shoot video with the pixel intimate
light and then you get those shaky long
shutter speed Jaggi blurry halo ring
flash so I just want to briefly hit on
this one because I think this is
hilarious and we don't need to spend a
lot of time on it but just not even I'm
not even gonna comment on this one so uh
sailfish OS is currently in development
on the sony xperia x and the headline
for that i could not be less excited
about anything happening with the xperia
x and I could even less excited about
anything happening with sailfish OS is
this any way for a company to apologize
for that terrible crowdfunding tablet
debacle nothing not even that because
correct me if I'm wrong Michael but you
and I were among the biggest fans and
advocates for Yola since its
announcement do you still have your Yolo
t-shirt I still do I still have both of
them
so I think that this is just a textbook
example on how to screw things up you
know and to be out to be fair to Yola I
think the deck was stacked against
sailfish to begin with there it was too
late for a new for a new platform at
that point even when blackberry launched
after that it was too late for that you
know they came into the game too late
they had some great ideas I would love
to use this I have no reason to use this
and it's it's a shame I miss new
platforms and new exciting platforms but
and and and and it looks to me that you
are speaking about Yola but while you
were talking about Yola my mind just ran
off and I thought about next bit yeah
but they succeeded they like they
Silicon Valley succeeded because they
got acquired so investors are happy
because at least money exchanged hands
lassally me just wrap this one up we've
got a a mais you pro 7 which is reviving
an idea of having a rear display a tiny
little this display that sits below the
camera module again I thought this one
was quirky fun to bring up with you guys
because for the years that we've been
covering technology we flirted with
these gimmicky Hardware concepts you
know again the second phone display is
that the ticker display at the top of a
v20 is it the ticker display at the
bottom of I forget what Samsung it was
that had that do you have to lead
something on the back of your phone
someone was criticizing my 1+5 coverage
because I don't ever look at the back of
my own phone so I don't care if it looks
like an iPhone and I go okay fair play
that's actually a really well argued
counterpoint plus you have a Yoda phone
yeah this pro 7 and it's got like this
tiny little LED or LCD display under
these cameras is this what smartphone
fans have been missing that they didn't
even know they needed no I haven't used
the yotaphone but I have to there's so
many situations where like you want to
put a list on the on your phone you
don't have to pound display and just to
have it very readable form
or just just be nice to have the back of
the phone be used for something I mean I
agree
no and yotaphone does it elegantly I
think in that it uses a ink which is a
different display technology optimized
for different use cases and we could go
on about that for a long time this seems
to me to be something fun and I'm glad
manufacturers are still playing with
alternate concepts but I know I don't
think this is bound to catch on anytime
soon the pictures of the phone and the
actual display is just a small part of
the phone's back it looks like you're
placing a very small phone on the back
of a bigger phone and it's offset to the
left and it even from a design
perspective I don't think it has any
chance of standing tall and in this
market the only thing that could be kind
nice about having an active display back
there is how how much I hate trying to
review selfie cameras the front-facing
cameras on phones because I think
they're all at best may be adequate but
usually terrible I've gotten really good
at the rear camera blind selfie just
holding up a phone and kind of clicking
a few shots we we had a Phillipe Kahn
the inventor of the smartphone the the
not the smartphone of the phone the
camera phone and from those early days
we used to put mirrors on the back of a
phone and then I reviewed the you 11 and
the you 11 is the easiest time I've ever
had in taking a rear camera blind selfie
it could be kind of nice right reviewed
chrome mirror back to z5 premium from
Sony and that is the ultimate selfie
phone with the back camera oh yeah what
what about the or the UM the oh the Z
say what that is it's prettier in its
this is the black one it's very
reflective so yeah a lot of phones are
like unintentionally doing that I guess
well one if you if you wouldn't crap all
over smart watches all the time you can
use smart watches of you under the time
it was
because I love smart watches but that's
one of my least favorite uses is because
then it goes over Bluetooth and I have
to use a custom camera app and I know
it's total garbage no it's so bad we're
like you know for people that like got
really good at shooting with GoPros
right you know someone who's like really
good at vlogging on a GoPro you just
sort of get a feel for where's the
camera sensor right about there yep good
knuckle GoPro shoots everything I mean
you can you could be well fair enough I
may be a so I'm against Riv a little
spoiled by that LGG six wide camera um
we're gonna shift gears here I I have a
couple tweets that Jules has been
sending in using the p-n weekly hashtag
on Twitter let me scroll down just kind
of circling back to that LG conversation
from bench Arian 90 is it a good idea to
keep the V 20 around for another year do
you think that last year's tank of an LG
can still compete towards the end of
this calendar year that's a good
question I didn't play with the b20 so I
will recuse myself from commentary I
thought not in from Tony you seem to
think like it can still hold up yes I
would definitely think that the b20 is
still a phone to keep and to use until
full 2018 when the v40 is gonna come out
unless they kill the V lineup altogether
because not only it's a tank and it's
indestructible don't drop it you're
gonna break some tiles but it's it's
really it's really what what the g5
should have been and yeah blocks TLDR I
think of me 20 is still a phone to
consider if you can't afford it and if
you like big thumbs your brain in any
thoughts did not use it so I'm not sure
you're nervous I'm blonde no I'm a big
fan boy so the V 20 and the mate 9 are
the two phones that I think have found
the most rotation which is shocking for
me because I hate phablets and the two
biggest phones of last year the phones
that I keep coming back to but for me I
think 2016 phones are aging so much
better than
20:15 phones were that if you're rocking
the qualcomm 820 I don't see a lot of
software on the horizon that's really
gonna tax that phone and make it
unusable I don't see many companies
really trying to push the boundaries on
things like AR or VR or anything like
that that's gonna make you feel like
that phone can't hang so really it's
just gonna come down to software support
we know LG's a little lame there but the
hardware is so good that it kind of
makes up for some of those issues we
have a comment here from at official AWS
if Apple takes away touch ID I don't
think people will buy the new iPhone
they've got it in the MacBook they can't
drop it now I think the new iPhone is
gonna sell like crazy just because it's
so fresh I don't think it'll matter I
mean like I think Apple could take away
touch ID and the phone is still gonna
set records for sales but then people
will grumble after the fact and then
just sort of get used to use their
following I don't think that one feature
is really gonna impact sales but I think
adding to what you just said I think
it's it's not comparable to when Apple
just simply decided to ditch the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack because in
that particular case there was not an
ecosystem built upon it and there was
not and the bank wasn't so big now in
terms of the touch ID aside from the
fact that the Macs have it and basically
everything security related which
matters on the ecosystem in the
ecosystem is based on it
a lot of developers will be also
affected by such a decision and I don't
think Apple will shoot themselves in the
foot because yes they might sell the
same amount number of iPhone eights or
whatever its name will be but in terms
of revenue from other sources from the
App Store from everything else will drop
and I don't think that that's gonna be a
smart business decision now we know
Apple's big growth recently has been in
moving services over that they're
showing consistent growth on Apple music
and payment transactions that's gotta be
a growing business for them especially
now that with iOS 11 you'll be able to
just send money through the messages
application with just a type touch of
the touch ID again like man
I'm shocked that that's a big deal but
then I realize like oh no iPhone users
really haven't been playing what stuff
that natively on iOS I just want to wrap
this up this is one for everybody here
from at fat produce hashtag PN weekly
what devices are you looking forward to
the most this year so wrapping up 2017
what what's what's striking your fancy
what phones are you most looking for let
me start first
it's gonna be a short answer for me I
was actually going to start off with
Tony accident yes the iPhone 8 is
exciting the no 8 is exciting yes 8 is
an exceptional device they're all
exciting to use to own to wait for their
launch but fast forward today would be
December 31st I think I am personally
the most excited about the BlackBerry
key one I think that that's bone just
made my ear wow I've been using it for
like a month or so and I just can't go
anywhere without it why might over over
on the side I can't reach it I love it
why because back memories from from you
know that muscle memory that that just
when I started off this podcast it feels
like coming home I was in my early years
of being a sales manager for a
corporation which equipped us with
BlackBerry's for me it's getting back
there and and in the particular case of
the key one I just I know I can go away
for the weekend without taking my
charger with me because that thing is
solid for me for three days
totally I just randon I I feel we should
go to you next cuz it didn't seem like
you were loving the key one and WTF why
the face no well so the phone I'm most
looking forward to is the new iPhone and
for one reason mainly and that's have
you guys played with 120 Hertz refresh
rate on the new iPad pros yeah it's I
have not it's um it's something you have
crazy mutant eyeballs I can see those
eyeballs has to do with responsiveness
and do you guys remember when we went
from 30 Hertz to 6
he hurts in you know iPhones been
60-hertz are very long time but Android
before project butter was not sixty
Hertz and dramatically changed the way
that you use her phone because
everything was so fluid and smooth and
to go to 120 Hertz I don't think there's
any returns after that but I think when
we see 120 Hertz on the new iPhone
Android is gonna be coming out you know
maybe the next version of Android cuz
it's got to come from the operating
system presumably yeah I think we're in
for a soft word yeah definitely yeah I
think that's gonna be awesome and that's
gonna make our devices feel like they're
just gonna be so smooth it's gonna be
bullet we're gonna finally play well its
imprimatur life yes yes it will you
don't know Tony
what what what phone are you because you
know I think you're joining me and Tony
on our appreciation for the key one this
year what phone are you are you looking
forward to what do you see coming down
the pipe that's really gonna strike your
fancy um it's a question I hadn't
actually considered this here which is
crazy because it's late in the year but
I'm always excited to see what the next
note is going to be but I I have to say
the the v30 holds holds a high place up
there this year I've never liked the
veal I'm frankly I thought the v10 was
an ugly monstrosity and the v20 was sort
of dull which was a greater sin I'm
talking about aesthetically but having
used the g6 for long enough now to see
what what LG can do in terms of a of the
camera was particularly with a
wide-angle camera I would be very
excited to see what an improved version
of that optics package looks like and
Michael Eve you've used the Priven
you've used the Dell Venue Pro the
slider phones would you back to sliding
up just to unveil a secondary screen I
totally would I wish that be 35 I would
but of course it's not gonna be that
it's gonna be another boring brick and
whatever but I just wanna see what they
do with the cameras that's that's what
I'm most apprehensive about is for me
the V Series has always meant
survivability bringing sort of like
almost galaxy active specs which we
haven't heard any word that those are
always my favorite campsite phones yeah
an s8 active I would be very curious to
see what Samsung would do there because
I don't know that you can make a rugged
phone with that much of a curve to the
zoom Ford Tony that's never gonna happen
um so I'm most apprehensive about the V
30 if they introduced a slider because I
feel like that's gonna complicate the
hardware enough to reduce the
certifications on water and drop
resistance but for me the phone I'm I'm
kind of most curious to see how they
might follow it up is Huawei with the
next mate again the main tonight
completely took me by surprise last year
in how much I ended up using that phone
there do a processor refresh and the
ki-rin I don't think gets enough
conversation here in the states where it
was well ahead of the Qualcomm curve if
you bought the mate in in Europe at
launch you were a good six months ahead
of Qualcomm 8:35 performance so I'm
really curious to see what they can do
because they keep I think they keep
finding these spikes of interest and
then they sort of settle into a lull and
then honor sort of takes away some of
the conversation from the P series and I
don't know that they've really nailed
down their strategy for what phone is
supposed to occupy which niche but the
mate has sort of consistently delivered
what it promises it can do and so I'd be
curious to see if they can keep that
that consistency going with that line
the most interesting promise I think
they made that I that I would like to
see if it's delivered is that born fast
remain fast thing where they did those
optimizations supposedly to the kernel
into the software to make sure it
doesn't bog down over time and I think
that's like I'd like to see one in two
years and see how it's running there's
one that's actively used for two years
I can say the the launch device I got
nine months ago is faring very well
again this is a phone that I use almost
every day
mostly again which kind of silly is it's
sort of my campaign platform
it's the phone that was running marvel
future fight the best so I've got it
currently right here grinding missions
in the background as we're doing this
podcast so I don't have to do all the
grindy stuff um but I don't know how
techie how real like what real
technology is actually working back
there but it does seem to be doing
something better than some of the
experiences like I've had with like a
one year old galaxy my wife's f7 is a
mess and has been for a while but she
kind of refuses to wipe it out because
it's a pain to move files around and
back up photos that weren't up on Google
photos and all that I I don't foresee
the same kinds of issues with my mate
but again I can't speak to whether or
not that's the placebo effect they said
they're doing better garbage collection
and maybe it's just some software patch
to dump the cache every week or
something like that
but I have been impressed so far so
we'll see if that continues um guys I
want to spend a little time uh sort of
just taking a quick look back since I
have you all in the same hangout here
and and I know we're already running a
little long in this podcast but I kind
of feel like this is the appropriate
conversation to jump into since this is
the fifth anniversary of the weekly
episode two six zero five years of potty
so crazy um Jules has a little audio
clip here too which is kind of which is
kind of crazy because I don't think many
in our current audience will remember
that there was a podcast before the
PocketNow weekly called the pocket cast
and he wants to play a little bit of it
so that you guys can hear just you know
where where we've come from terrible we
were yes come to the first-ever
PocketNow podcast we're calling this the
pocket cast we've never done a podcast
before even though we've gotten a lot of
requests for them over the years we
wanted to do a podcast and a little bit
of a different way than what you see out
there so the format this will take is
sort of a raw unedited conversation
between two smart phone geeks and it
will vary from week to week
probably in the form of one PocketNow
editor to another PocketNow editor this
week we're gonna start out with Evan
glass he's the managing editor now and
Evan say hi
January 30th 2011
that's hilarious cuz I someone who is
absolutely terrible in introducing
people and wrapping up podcasts I know
that pain so well so this guest is on a
hello guest you know this this format
and and I have some appreciation for
what Michael you do and want when you
read these these shows it's it's very
difficult to get the cadence right to
get the feel right and it gives you a
real appreciation for like interviewers
like the people you see on TV like
Charlie Rose or or like even the late
night guys and how how good they are at
asking the right questions waiting the
right amount of time it's very nuanced
very difficult I think for me for me
because all of us have at one point
hosted at least one podcast
half of the success of a good host is
the co-host and it all comes down to the
chemistry those people have and the
thoughts they're just throwing at each
other and if that manages or turns out
to be a natural conversation just like
chemistry then then that's the recipe
for success yeah I did completely agree
that that that is like the one crucial
component that has to be there with if
that's there you can stumble on other
stuff you can deal with dumb technical
crap that pops up every freaking week
because you use Google Hangouts but like
if the core chemistry of the host is
there it's it can be a magical thing now
I love you Jules you've been keeping me
from completely nuking my PC because of
all of the crap we've been going through
so I kind of wanted to get sort of a
look back a little reminiscing if you
will when we when you guys moved from
the pocket cast to the pocket now weekly
how did that come about what makes our
let me start to let Michael finish
because in between in between the pocket
cast and the pocket now weekly read
which was I got notes on July 12 2012
PocketNow has hired michael fisher i got
an email from brandon or maybe it was
the other way around that hey there's
this guy here who sent in a resume who
would like to work for us so long story
short we hired him and Michael and I
were talking about the podcast and I
told him that we failed miserably at our
first iteration and he said he would
love to reboot the podcast to bring it
in a new format with a new paradigm and
I told him that I care so little about
the podcast that if he wants to handle
it from A to Z whatever he wants with it
I just don't want to hear about it
anymore
and here's where Michael comes in you
know that's that's exactly right I got a
name I remember I was on a train and I
got an email from Tony in in typical
Anton fashion which was out of the blue
I didn't know it was coming we had
talked about the podcast weeks before
and he says okay this is this is what
will happen we will do a podcast you
will host it it will be called the
pocket that we click we will have the
first episode soon there's no fluff at
all it just and it was you know we've
figured out a platform we got things
together Brandon had rather copious
notes I think with regard to like format
and suggestions which were very helpful
because if it were me I would just be
rapping back and forth but Brandon
wanted to do a segment I guess I'll let
you two talk about talk about your
particular segments Brandon but I was
just so happy to kind of spearhead this
initiative because for me podcast
listening to tech people talk about
podcasts listening to talk on a podcast
listen to listening to phone nerds geek
out and be free outside the confines of
a written format or a video format just
rapping a little bit I mean that's what
hooked me I would listen to podcast for
years before I even got into this
business and so it was very exciting to
actually start one even if Brandon made
me do stuff that I hated
well and what kind of stuff was at
Brandon so you know we had this um you
know we even get so frustrated about
certain things in the smartphone world
like HTC making a camera with 4
megapixels and saying that it was ok
megapixels don't matter
and yet 4 megapixels is not even enough
resolution to really zoom in at all let
alone look at the picture on like a iPad
Retina display just it's just not full
resolution and so we would like do these
these things where we pretend or HTC
executives and like a boardroom or
something and we'd have this like
asinine conversation about like how
we're going to screw over people that
want megapixel and everybody everybody
loved this this role-playing so much
that we we actually did in this format
of the three of us Michael Brandon and
myself for for almost a season until I
received a email from Michael which
sounded just like the email I sent him
we're in the interim brandon has left
pocket now I took over as
editor-in-chief and Michael informed me
that as of I don't know the next episode
we're gonna go live with video and I
said absolutely not he said it's my baby
we're doing it that's right right that
was the hundredth episode when we had
that switch over well and actually I
think jobs before hangouts was HD yeah
well I mean it's still like 720p um but
Jules I think you've got a clip of from
episode 101 talking about that
transition oh god I'm your host Michael
Fisher editorial director of PocketNow
from Boston Massachusetts your first
officer today hailing from the one and
only super Carolina is senior editor
Taylor Martin hey man what's up I have
to say before we go any further I'm not
gonna like this video video podcast
because it means that I have to pay
attention I have to be present and here
and look at the screen now don't worry
you you don't have to do that because
right now you're hidden behind my intro
script which
everyone can see I'm reading which is
another reason I don't like videos I'm
with you but let's we'll talk about that
in a second we also have other people on
the air and the music's running out even
though you can't hear it right now chief
news editors Stephen shank from New
Jersey the pocket mountain news desk
head hey man welcome aboard
I had to share jealous frustrations I'd
like to spend the weekly basically
staring on my window watching chipmunks
play and you've taken that away from me
yeah most of the audio weekly the last
hundred episodes kind of like oh god
yeah that was a rocky transition wasn't
it you'd hear that distortion because we
were you we had like 10 episodes of
technical broth it's a wonder anyone
came with us for those two months where
we were struggling with stuff well you
know you guys managed to land our
viewers have heard me complain about
this so much you guys managed to at
least land a system because when I came
on it was a pretty well-oiled machine
and it seemed like a couple months after
I joined that Google changed something
almost every week on us after that which
was throwing a new wrench in the gears
here or breaking something that we used
to count on there to the point where
we've we've gone pre-recorded for the
last couple months this is the first
time we wanted we wanted to have
everything in place so that we could
bring you guys back on live so this is
the first live broadcast we've done in
months just to sort out all of them
ridiculous problems that we've been that
we've been facing but not not to again
for our audience with with my technical
issues the only thing I wanted to bring
up is that the the PocketNow weekly
under under this tutelage was also an
award-winning podcast that the stitcher
awards back in the day actually did
feature and oh right here with me this
2013 stitch rewards best I'm not even
sure why why that isn't at the company
headquarters because I'm getting it off
the shelf in there and I'm like I bet
you Tony's gonna tell me to say
sitting right next dear to my Glenn but
you know I decided when I was sending
one of my many boxes to Tony I was like
I'm gonna keep this and see if he knows
it keep it managed it's it's it's only
work but it's mostly your baby so well
thank you but also in keeping the the
memory train rolling I think you also
have something for the stitcher Awards
to Rachel alongside great great great
podcasts like like twits this week in
tech The Verge casts and how stuff works
tech stuff we we won we won best tech
podcast of 2013 and it is all thanks to
you
thank you everyone applause gentlemen an
old fashioned this is for you listeners
not for us we really really really do
appreciate it we were what was it the
same day we did the podcast last week it
was we had ran last week and then like
that night the award ceremony happened
right yeah I think so yeah so I wish I
could have announced the last week this
is like week old news at this point but
it's great stuff we made a post about it
so we just wanted to say on the air here
thank you to everyone who voted for us
and I promise as soon as we our trophy
comes in I will put it on the Instagram
I can see I think this fire truck was
here for a cat nut tree or something no
idea it was probably some sirens he
thought we could hear but we couldn't
but yeah that was that was quite a
surprise I remember I remember talking
to the stitcher folks who at that time
we're in San Francisco they probably
still are and I was like they were like
will you come to our awards dinner I'm
like I don't know if I can Francisco
just for the reward hey Tony can we like
no and the people replied from stitcher
and they were like we really think you
should come out it would be worth it to
you and I'm like Tony I don't know if
this means it yes so it was it was great
I like that it was um based on audience
voting that felt really nice it felt
like we achieved something good times
now I certainly think something
definitely has been achieved that I
gotta say it's been it's
my privilege it's been my honor to kind
of continue these discussions and and
hopefully return these discussions to
the real time this question that you
guys started years and years ago I get
to say that because it is five years ago
that that all of this is that this was
put up and and to hear the intro I feel
from that very first episode talking
about the history that PocketNow had
before the podcast that this is this is
a story that was a decade in the making
as the internet evolved to produce this
kind of streaming media Brandon just to
kind of take it back to you you know in
in looking at where where all this stuff
is gone the popularity of podcasts today
a stand-up comedian can like draw in
millions of listeners in a way that even
a radio can't touch now in reaching out
to a specific audience I mean you guys
were on the bleeding edge of that you
guys were were well ahead of the curve
for people producing their own content
like that it's got to be really exciting
to see where this this this media
monster has gone since then
democratizing the ability to share a
story with your audience and to know
that you were a part of helping to
produce that you're talking about
podcasting or videos well I mean the
podcasting I mean you know so I mean
video streaming is definitely something
that's kind of fun but I you know it's
someone who lives in Southern California
you for us for me to drive around and
not want to you know road rage and every
person who cuts me off in traffic it's
been podcasting I don't even use the
satellite radio in my car I don't listen
to much music anymore
my unfortunately my toddler daughter is
just inundated with tech and politics
driving around she's gonna be very well
informed I think I think we were
actually a little later than we should
have been I mean there's so many years
of discussion and back and forth until
Tony decided that it was just gonna make
it happen and Michael was gonna make it
happen and you know there you know I
think well before that we were talking
about doing some sort of podcast and and
you know that that was around the time
when we started to do
video as well which was new and totally
different and weird and really no one
was doing it and the quality was awful
and YouTube was in HD and to upload a
video would take forever but um it's
just it's been cool it's especially cool
for the guys that aren't associated with
big sites or don't have a lot of money
that they can fire up a camera or fire
up a microphone for super cheap and they
can create and get distribution far
beyond what could have been possible
just just not too long ago and so like
so so my favorite part of that is that
the quality everybody's quality keeps
going up because of that and that's just
really nice to see yeah definitely the
approachability of that is is kind of
incredible to have witnessed like you
know I I came into tech and discussion
on message boards on ARPANET like if you
would if you would ask me about like
what the internet would have been I
never in a million years have predicted
that this is where we would have ended
up you know from sort of military hosted
servers with message boards to the
ability to have this real-time
conversation with you guys which i think
is only fitting to to maybe wrap up this
discussion is uh what is the future hold
for you fine gentlemen Brandon what what
are you working on what where do you see
this taking you you're obviously still
very passionate about technology and the
consumer experience and and relating
that to people telling that story to
people yeah well for the last I guess
almost six or seven years I've worked in
eckstein developers and you know over
there we've been doing you know the
technical stuff and the enthusiast stuff
and one of the things we're always
trying to figure out is sort of what
happens after that because what used to
be an enthusiast market is now a mass
market everyone has a smartphone and and
so that begs the question like what
new cool things can we do with our
phones like we have access to all these
apps and you know at the end of the day
it's kind of like you know I I use my
Twitter client it's my facebook you know
I you know you snapchat and dialer and
all that stuff but there's there hasn't
been anything new and even if you create
software from the very beginning and you
create a customer um
innovation is also stagnated there and
so we're trying to figure out how we can
use something a little different and so
that's kind of what I've been working on
but actually I had a question for you
guys
that is someone relate to this so you
know phones have come a really long way
you know in 2017 I think all of us have
phones in our pocket that can take
incredible pictures better pictures then
you know we would ever thought possible
I think possible except for a DSLR we've
got batteries that last the entire day
morning till night in almost every case
we've got screens so crisp and clear
that we cannot see pixels even I cannot
see pixels but what's the but right what
what is missing like if you were to
rewind five years ago and saying mm
something would have all these phones
taken but what what's what's missing
what is leaving you to what more do you
want out of your phone what's the
missing piece can I start yes well these
Tony jump in I'm not sure whether this
answer is coming from me as a consumer
ultimately because I am also a consumer
or it's coming from me being in this
business for too long I'm not saying I'm
burnt out I'm just saying that I've been
doing this for so long so my answer is
what's missing for me in in a smartphone
in in this particular area is the
feeling the sentiment the
chicken bumps I got when I bought my
first fell I'm unboxing phones a lot
less than you guys and it's just another
phone I'm missing that that sentiment
when it meant something for me when that
was my phone and my phone alone and I
loved it I think it's what I'm missing
is that these pieces of tech which are
already in the hands of everybody are
not making me feel the way I felt back
then and I think that that's for me it
comes down to that that's good you know
a lot of agreement there Michael yeah
that's I don't think you and I have ever
agreed as heartily on something that's
I'm completely with you and some of it
is because of the the you know
broadening and the the commoditization
of the the smartphone as something that
everyone has and they're just bound to
be less special over time but for me to
sort of build on that idea we had it we
had that special feeling we had that
customization it not to be the Moto
fanboy that you all know I am but like
in 2014 when moto maker came out and the
Moto X was like you can have a wood back
you can have a fabric back you can have
a leather back you can have a plastic
back you can have it in any color you
can put your name on it you can put your
name on the splash screen you can all of
that I missed that so keenly and it has
not been recaptured by the Moto Z which
with its slap on mods because that feels
like putting on a case when you ordered
the phone from the factory made to your
specifications and every time you picked
it up it not only looked the way you
wanted it to but it felt in my case with
that leather back just felt like your
phone I mean that that was the height
the zenith at the peak for me and I
don't I I would like to get back there
somehow so I I'm for mine and I'm gonna
be really careful in how I try and
express this idea because it's it's an
idea that I think is very easily
misunderstood do not through to because
of the audience but because of my
inability to articulate it and my
inability to say the word inability for
me because I agree with you guys you
know that that's feeling of something
special or that feeling of something new
when geek became chic when geeks won
and in these products became more
consumer-oriented
it's the same feeling I had back in the
early days of me using Apple that those
companies start walking away from me
not that I'm suddenly less interested in
their products that these devices are
less focused for me I kind of hope that
what comes next for phones will be the
ability to use our phones less but more
effectively this for us to start solving
some of the social etiquette problems of
using our phones not just in the company
of other human beings but then also to
help reduce the issues of problems with
things like distracted driving coming
back to see exactly you know like all
those gimmicks that we have to do to to
still incorporate data we're not gonna
put that genie back in its bottle where
we're all just gonna put our phones away
and everyone's just gonna be happy 1950s
eating at a restaurant and and only
interacting with each other but the
company that will win the the post
smartphone world is the company that can
help us more organically transition into
being data aware but also socially aware
and socially conscious um I don't feel
it's gonna be truly solved until we have
self-driving cars but to say that we
can't address those problems along the
way I feel is reductive I feel as an
insult to the tech community and there
are so many amazing companies that are
starting to work on this problem in
earnest that I hope that's the next
phase that we see our phones are crazy
powerful we're starting to dip our toe
into augmented reality better audio
communication better Auto audio services
it would be nice if I could realize the
vision of something like Bixby or IBM
Watson or Google assistant where I could
do even more of this without occupying
all of my senses - taste in operating
this device that I really hope is the
next phase and what we will walk into
that that will make me excited
really
truly excited to be talking about mobile
technology again have you uh have you
seen the movie her it's just absolutely
yes yes I mean that that's that's not
even like that
you know everybody having their own
operating system that that knows more
about you than you know about yourself
because it has read every one of your
emails every one of your texts it knows
what's in every one of your pictures it
knows what your your your spouse's
favorite kind of ice cream is when your
anniversary is and you just you just
exist with this all-knowing thing and
it's entirely personalized for you and
every time Google says we want to make a
Google for everyone that's what I think
about and that's what I hope we'll have
with the robots because the robots have
to but I don't want to live in a future
without robots I'm with you okay yes but
I was gonna say not to answer I guess my
own question the the but for me is that
I still buy like all the phones because
it's in my blood and and I get so
excited I always happens to me is that
you know there's the first 24 hours or
oh this is cool oh this phone has a 4k
screen wow I can watch 4k video is in
the phone's battery life goes to zero in
my hand game gets burn but then after
that I am staring at a phone screen that
has exactly the same icons in exactly
the same place as the phone when I had
last year and the phone the year before
that and the way that I am you I use my
phone with the exception of things like
Google photos which lets me finally
search all my photos with English or
like you know like well case should be
services like uber and all that so I
used my phone almost exactly the way I
used two years ago and this the
hardware's changing a little bit battery
left a little bit better in it they're
faster everything but like you just feel
there's too much sameness and I I don't
know if it's just me do you guys feel
that way not just you it's every time I
set up a new phone and I put the social
folder in the Google folder and my
calendar widget all in the same spot I'm
like there's there's probably a better
way to do this I'm just falling back
into the habitual cycle of you know of
lock-in taking that even further I start
getting paranoid and acting out if
a particular icon or folder on my new
phone is not exactly where I left it on
the old phone cuz I'm browsing like
crazy for it that I can't find it
I had to reshoot for one of our recent
comparison videos because my Chrome and
Gmail icons were reversed on the bottom
and I couldn't let it go that's
dedication
I was like it wouldn't have mattered to
the audience it was like this this is
killing me I need to reshoot these it
was pretty rough so no I definitely feel
that because there's a part of it to
where we face concerns that the general
consumer doesn't when they get a new
phone and maybe it's been a year or
maybe it's been three years as we're
seeing the industry trend towards
holding on to our phones longer they're
probably consumers out there are
probably more willing to take risks than
we are we have to get through a review
so efficiently now and with such high
production value that if I can't operate
the phone through muscle memory on day
one it takes me a lot longer to get into
the vibe of what it is I'm gonna talk
about with that phone so again my setup
process again like you guys - it's like
it's got to be exact it's got to be the
same and I never really give things like
edgesense a fair shake because that
doesn't change that that actually gets
in the way of how I normally use a phone
just so I can get through like the
camera review process or something which
is so funny but you know it's a fun
exercise go ahead run okay I was gonna
say a fun exercise I recently did this
you know third-party launchers like you
save your setup and restore it to
exactly how it looks before a fun
exercise is to think about exactly how
you use your phone and to say okay I use
the Amazon app a lot but it's on the
second page I wish I could put it on the
first page but I can't put on the first
page because that would make it look
cluttered what if I change the
homescreen grid what if I made the icons
a little bit smaller what if I use some
folders or use some of you know action
launcher or Nova launchers you know
press and hold functionality gestures
there's so much stuff you can do and to
sit there for like an hour one day and
rethink how you use your phone and the
stuff you want to access quickly you can
come out with a pretty compelling new
homescreen experience and they you can
carry that from phone to phone if you're
just gonna backup and restore your
settings so that's why you buy the
BlackBerry key one you just map an app
to it to every each everybody yeah
actually it was the BlackBerry key line
that helped me so so over the course of
reviewing these products I've gone from
being that guy who had all seven Galaxy
home screens full of widgets oh my god
to the BlackBerry key one got me down to
two home screens and now that's the home
screen setup that I'm gonna be moving
for people and for next year is I want
one home screen oh yeah I don't want to
I put home and I don't want to have to
swipe left or right I want everything
right there whenever it went Anton
showed me his Android setup for the
first time I was not like a Nexus 7 and
I was like Tony where's all your apps I
don't even think you had a clock widget
on there it was great yeah minimalistic
like that liked it so I'm gonna try and
join you by next year Tony but Michael I
so what what what is the future hold for
not just for you but I mean also for the
kind of coverage that you're hoping to
produce and we can kind of attack that
you hope to see and you know where do we
go from here
it's been fun where do we go for the
next five years of podcasts yeah right
well you know doing this and guesting on
other podcasts has reminded me how much
I missed actual podcast and I'm really
glad I will I will forget to say this at
the end of the show so I'll just say now
like I'm really glad that this show has
gone on you know in my absence and thank
you for your excellent stewardship Quan
and Jules and Tony and everybody because
it's really awesome that it's still here
and you guys are still doing in many
ways better work than than I was doing
analytically at least and like I I would
like to do podcasting again I would like
to do other forms again but I have to
say it has been really nice to just
focus on video Brandon you were talking
about getting and getting an early start
on video and it seems like every every
week I get three or four emails from new
aspiring YouTube tech vloggers who want
to do this kind of thing and now it's so
crowded it's unbelievably difficult I
feel to break in and the only people
have seen start in the past year and
actually sort of make start to make a
name for themselves have done it really
really unconventionally and I want to
drop any specifics but there's yeah
there's some funny funny stuff ethic so
so III don't know I've not ever been
terribly good at predicting the future I
sort of like getting what's here now
evaluating it in the context of what has
come before but it has been an awful lot
of fun to broaden into other aspects of
mobility I will tell you it's a lot of
fun to drive an electric car that's
something I never thought I really was
in that test drive oh my god yeah and
and also I you know we gave smartwatches
a little bit of shade I don't think the
idea of a personal area network is
totally dead I think that we will right
now I think every day I wear I wear
three different pieces of tech I've got
the Smart Watch usually Fitness band and
my public transit pass ring and I think
that will be light going forward I think
we're gonna start seeing more of the
smart shoes stuff and probably a smart
belt if any of the Kickstarter project
you know what I mean like III think that
the smart phone will continue to be the
hub but we will have increasingly
specialized accessories until you know
we are Borg I really hope we don't have
Lucas belts because can you imagine
saying oh jeez I forgot to charge my
belt no I want it I want it bring it
there was a Kickstarter that didn't that
didn't go through that was just a
compass belly oh all it did was like oh
we're north wise and I just like you
know the idea of geolocation
always be aware of directional cardinal
directions like that's kind of cool I
want that I guess so potential there's
always know what direction I'm facing
I'm very magnets it's a little tricky in
the valley like you start getting into
some of those neighborhoods and like
Google Maps says like you know and so
many miles go east and you're like what
landmark is supposed to point me towards
east on a road that runs diagonal just
okay far from the ocean that's the
answer
just live close to the ocean entirely
and and Tony I mean we kind of plugged
the future of pocket now especially sort
of broadening broadening out to other to
another language pocket now Spanish but
what do you see I'm hoping a part of
that answer is remaining keeping me
employed let me start off with with the
general I think that we are heading
towards an era era where as much as I
fight it and as much as a lot of people
fight it out there our lives will be
completely completely connected from
your home gear appliances to your car to
your everything whether we like it or
not it's going to happen what I can do
is that I'm going to probably be the
last person who will be driving a car
which actually makes noise when you will
probably all be floating or driving
electrics I'm gonna Rev my flat-six
9,000 rpms but no seriously this is
where we like that one smoker in the
non-smoking restaurant yes this is where
we're headed at and all of the efforts
the companies are putting into their
products and services are going that are
pointing in that direction now
correlating that with all the things
which are happening around the world
with people doing bad things to other
people and other people controlling all
of the other people to save other people
I think that that's also inevitable and
at one point we'll have to learn to deal
with it and live with it whether we like
it or not so that's the future I'm
seeing for the industry as far as
PocketNow is concerned I think I took a
couple of steps back from creating
content when I took over from from
Brendan as the editor-in-chief because
I've got so many things to handle that
it left me no time for creating content
I occasionally jump in when the help is
needed but I prefer staying in in the
background and trying to create the
conditions for you guys whether it was
for you might go back in the past or
it's for you
or for Haman to shine to speak to talk
to educate I'm the kind of person who
creates the the right set up for you
guys to do your jobs and I think that
I'm good at that and that's where I see
myself and that's what I see myself
doing in the future and yes you'll still
be employed one Oh excellent good like
[Laughter]
jewels just piped in in our chat asimov
Dinesh I like that I like azimoff that's
good um I like people says funny stuff
funny nobody knows it's just just for us
see that's that's why you always need a
everyone should have a jewels copilot
everything you've been keeping the show
running like that but folks there you
have it the fifth year anniversary of
the pocket Met Wheatley has come and
gone this show is over but the
conversation continues on Twitter where
Brandon is at Brandon minimun Michael is
at V mr. Mobile Tony is Anton Dinesh
Jules is at Point Jules and I'm humbly
at some gadget guy pocket now is around
the web on Twitter Instagram Facebook
Google+ YouTube and our home site
pocketnow.com were basically everywhere
shows like this cannot exist without
your support me taking just a brief
moment to say a huge thank you for the
audience that has supported the show
prior to me and then with me and then
also through some of our teething pains
and trying to get this back up and
running especially for the live
broadcast we wanted to make sure
everything was working as seamlessly as
we could for this anniversary show
but since the show can't exist without
your support sharing the weekly with
your friends who love mobile technology
and dropping reviews on iTunes stitcher
Google Play and wherever podcast reviews
can be left once again we want to thank
this week's sponsor hellofresh they're
helping us keep the lights on and our
stomachs full but ultimately there
wouldn't be a show if it weren't for our
listeners and subscribers who have kept
us on the air since 2000
the PocketNow weekly we'll be back next
week with all kinds of delicious
technology goodness so make sure you
know we really wanted to use what we
learned in schools so we moved out to LA
it's work in the entertainment industry
and I started at a talent agency a
voice-over talent agency and then over
into casting so I've been a voiceover
casting director for the last four or
five years which leads me like a
critical question one why does not know
you five years ago we've been talking
