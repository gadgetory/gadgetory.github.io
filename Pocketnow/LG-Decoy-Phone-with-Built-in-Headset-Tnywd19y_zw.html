we're going to take a look at the LG
decoy now if you remember back in 2003 I
wrote about an article called the
ultimate digital assistant which
mentioned in the future having a
detachable headset I did pitch this idea
to a couple companies like HDC in next
link but never got a response so today
we have the first phone that has
actually implemented this idea you see a
detachable bluetooth headset here now
the nice thing is that up here you can
see
there's a Bluetooth battery strength and
a regular phone battery strength so it
knows both ways this is a slider with a
new are capable keyboard and it just
pops off like that and you can instantly
put in your ear to talk you do have to
press the button to activate the call it
would have been smarter if when the
phone was ringing that just removing the
headset would answer it but that doesn't
happen that's what it should have been
now you can see it adds a little bit of
weight there is
this is included if you don't want to
use the headset you can put this on to
cover up that hole but it's not that bad
this part is springy so it collapses and
it's quite thin now the headset does
charge when you charge the phone so
that's excellent and it stays attached
in your pocket so it's not fumbling
around if you look at what I'm carrying
now even this is small set side and I
have phone and have a charger for the
headset it's a lot of stuff to carry I
see even that is pretty thick don't look
how how much thinner it is with the
decoy now there's other smart things
about this
when the headset is detached in your
play music or V CAST video through the
phone and actually plays through the
headset so it assumes that you have it
you have it in your ear and it plays
audio through that so that is quite an
excellent feature there's other things
like voice recognition I press the
button you see it's
recognize my voice not going to make
calls or do other things here so quite
an excellent addition the detachable
Bluetooth headset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
