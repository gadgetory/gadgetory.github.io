throwin all I could think of is that
specific scene in Clash of the Titans
when Zeus says please release the Beast
that's about to simply destroy
everything in its path I'm he metal even
with pocket now reporting from London
let's talk about the huawei mate 20 Pro
May 2000 way watch GT and ban three pro
I honestly can't remember the last time
that I was truly impressed by a
presentation for those of you that claim
that smartphones have gotten boring this
one is not while we claims that the made
20 and made 20 Pro are here to welcome
you into a higher intelligence and we'll
have a good review period to prove that
the design philosophy of the made series
is focused on the center of the device
which opposes the site approach of the P
series that intends to resemble a camera
that made 20 and may 20 Pro instead have
one of the coolest distinctive design
elements that I've seen this year in
this camera arrangement the company
calls it its thinking lens tuned by
Leica we have a triple camera
arrangement with a whopping 40 megapixel
primary out of 1.8 aperture the return
of a telephoto at 8 megapixels and have
2.4 aperture with capabilities of 3x
optical zoom a new addition a 20
megapixel wide-angle camera at F 2.2
replacing the monochrome as the company
claims that the new primary doesn't need
assistance the fourth element a dual
tone flash placed in a symmetrical spot
the difference is what the may 20 is
that we have a 12 megapixel primary
instead of 40 the super wide angle is of
16 megapixels instead of 20 and the
arrangement of the cameras is also
slightly different if you look closely
it's called a thinking lens because
we're now jumping into master AI 2.0 the
camera is smart enough to detect if you
need a wide scene and then recommends if
you want to switch lenses and this white
sensor is fit for macro photography
allowing you to get up to 2.5
centimeters close to your subject we
also have features like AI 4d predictive
focus object recognition active tracing
by real-time motion detection that's
smart enough to avoid distractions once
you select the subject Huawei also
claims improvements in video with a new
AI cinema mode bringing a classic movie
feel in addition to a new colored tone
you've seen in movies like Sin City were
only a specific area as colored and then
the rest is black and white really cool
and when it comes to the bill the May 20
Pro is precision curved resembling the
sleek design of the Oppo find X the back
now uses a new hyper optical display
pattern technology that creates a
distinct feather-light design on the
back on turn color option
it's more resistant to fingerprints and
which feels like vinyl when you try to
scratch it making it grippier in the
hand color options range from pink gold
Twilight black midnight blue and admiral
green which have that type or optical
finish on the front we have a six point
three nine inch curved OLED display a 2k
plus resolution and nineteen point five
by nine aspect ratio and HDR
capabilities yes there is a notch but
this one actually serves a purpose it
brings a full 3d sensing camera array at
the top pretty much like what we have on
face ID but now on Android this means a
full dot projector flood illuminator IR
camera proximity sensor and a 24
megapixel RGB camera both devices have
dual firing speakers but there is no
grill at the bottom of the pro it
actually uses the USB C port to house
the speaker which I hope still works
whenever you connect it to a charger and
then there's the totally unconventional
placement of the fingerprint scanner on
the screen this is being dubbed the DPS
or dynamic pressure sensing sensor that
works as the name describes even when
the screen is off though at the moment
it doesn't seem as reliable as we'd
expect the Huawei made twenty on the
other hand is more conventional so
there's a simple teardrop notch housing
the 24 megapixel camera Huawei dubs the
6.3 inch full HD plus LCD panel as its
new dewdrop display at a wider eighteen
point seven by nine aspect ratio and HDR
capabilities the back house is the same
color options as the pro again a similar
camera arrangement and with a regular
fingerprint scanner at the back detect
inside we have the new Karin 1987
nanometer processor now with 2 MP use 1
for object recognition and the other for
more complex tasks like natural language
processing video editing etc according
to Wahl way this makes it 20% faster 40%
more power efficient and capable of 1.6
times more logic tasks than its
predecessor the GPU performance is also
45% faster and 105 % more power
efficient and we also have cat 21 1.4
gigabit LTE and 4x4 MIMO and then
there's ranges of 4 and 6 gigabytes of
RAM and 128 gigs of storage on the mate
2000 or 6 and 8 gigabytes of RAM and 102
or 256 gigs of storage on the May 20 Pro
they both have duals send capabilities
that are expandable but not through
microSD and said Huawei has a new nano
SD card that fits on the same nano SIM
slot the May 20 pro bringing a larger
4200 milliamp hour battery versus four
thousand milliamp hours on the May 20
there's a faster 40 watt supercharger in
the box of the pro bringing 70% battery
charge in just 30 minutes there's also
support for faster 15 watt wireless
charging and get this you can even use
the May 20 Pro to reverse charge another
Qi enabled product I know that's crazy
and then the regular mate 20 doesn't
have wireless charging only supports 22
watts of the supercharger and is only IP
53 rated but if you do want a headphone
jack this is your device emui 9 is now
Android Pi based the company has reduced
the amount of settings by 10% to make
this less complex it's also now nature
based meaning more natural elements
wallpapers and sounds the menus have
also been moved from the top to the
bottom to improve one-handed usability
and there's also full screen gesture
based navigation options but you're more
like what we see from Xiaomi instead of
what we've seen from other devices while
we claims that its UI is now 47 percent
faster when tapping on an app 51 percent
faster at launching one and 42 percent
faster in usage the company also claims
that this device guarantees no lag for
18 months sadly even though the desktop
mode is now wireless we weren't able to
show it off to you on video during the
demo time we also got to see a new
Huawei watch GT it's not based on where
OS oddly but instead it brings its new
light OS platform that Huawei claims
brings longer battery life even though I
know it looks pretty much like where OS
regardless still the company claims two
weeks of battery life for heart rate
monitoring 30 days if you switched to
only using this watch for notifications
and 22 hours of you turn off all sensors
meaning GPS heart rate etc it's got a
ton of sport modes and is even enhanced
for sleep tracking that was built in
conjunction with the Harvard Medical
School
CBD it brings a double chip technology
one with low-speed capabilities for
basic tasks and the other for high
intensity tasks it sports a more classic
design with a stainless steel chassis a
ceramic bezel and a diamond light
coating to avoid scratches and finally
there is also the band 3 Pro which
brings similar capabilities to the watch
but it's more like a regular fitness
tracker there's a CEO of 0.9 5 inch
AMOLED touch display along with a touch
key and this device is certified for 20
days of usage and Bluetooth 4.2 Low
Energy so yes this is all we were
briefed on when it comes to Huawei I
hear that there might be even other
devices announced that the event and in
huawei style we don't have pricing this
was also announced at the event later
what I will say is that I am really
really excited for the May 20 Pro if all
the company claims works as mentioned
this is definitely a true beast of a
phone an overview period has just begun
so there's only one way to find out let
us know in the comments what you would
like for us to compare and prove and
while you're at it make sure you follow
