unpacked event to happen in New York
City on August 23rd but the company was
clear this event is to announce the
future Galaxy Note and after a very
explosive time last year obviously a lot
of people have set their eyes on this
phone so it's time to consolidate these
rumors I'm hanging that me I will pocket
now and let's go through what we expect
to get from the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
when it comes to design we really don't
expect many changes when compared to the
Galaxy s8 that's probably a little more
of a square design like we saw with the
Galaxy Note 7 compared to the galaxy s7
edge last year we also have some CAD
leaks and renders on video that showed
us glass on glass aluminum in addition
to the port's being of the same
placement USBC in addition to the s-pen
silo the headphone jack and a speaker at
the bottom yes we do expect that oddly
placed fingerprint scanner to be beside
the camera or cameras and for those of
you worried about that we also expect
the iris scanner to make a comeback as
well when it comes to the display we are
expecting the same infinity display to
make a comeback slight bump to 6.3
inches diagonal we do expect the same 18
point 5 by 9 aspect ratio curves on the
Border's the change might be a probable
bump into 4k capable resolution
currently Samsung wants to do something
with VR and it has to do with bringing a
slightly better resolution to the
display even though the device will ship
with 1080p out of the box the whole
purpose of saving battery life because
you are getting a slightly smaller 3300
milliamp hour battery in order to fit
the s-pen silo so yeah let's say that
what happens
and speaking of s-pen we are expecting
some slight improvements just like we
saw with the s-pen options that we got
back at MWC Ford's have it line up
supporting tilt now remember this tilt
feature depends on certain applications
we are expecting a boost in software
Android 7.1.2 finally Samsung making the
jump to this new version of Android
which should also allow us to get better
battery efficiency as well so yeah s-pen
better battery these are also options on
the table and when it comes to
specifications we are expecting the
to bring the same Snapdragon 835
processor we saw with its best eight
lineup what we do see it changes in the
probability of six gigabytes of RAM now
not being only a Korean option we expect
this to be part of the galaxy note in
addition to options for storage 64 128
gigabytes a 5-megapixel selfie camera
but we do expect dual cameras finally
coming to Samsung but this question that
nobody has been able to answer is what
these dual cameras will do some are
assuming that these will be the same
telephoto options that we get with the
iPhone or the one plus five we are
hoping that this is not the case as
we've seen this is really a feature that
nobody uses we would love to see either
the wide-angle option that we see from
LG or the monochrome option that we see
from Huawei hopefully this comes to the
table as well last but not least
probably the most controversial rumor is
the price tag of this phone apparently
it'll be costing nearly $1000 or
probably more depending on whatever
option you get whether you go for 64 128
gigabytes of storage that is a lot of
money particularly for a phone that had
a really rough time last year and oddly
there came a point back in the s6 and
note 5 stage where the s6 edge+ was
actually more expensive than the note 5
so we don't really understand why this
phone will be more expensive still it is
a probability and then the other
question that we've been asking
ourselves is what will this phone be
made because if you remember there was
already a Galaxy Note 8 years ago in the
form of a tablet it leads me to the
question of this video number one do you
like all the rumours what we're
expecting with the Galaxy Note 8 and
number two what do you think the name
will be do you think it will be Galaxy
Note 8 and the company will just start
over here or do you think that we should
expect a new name in my case I love
everything that I hear in the rumors I
don't like the price tag and I think
it'll just be called Galaxy Note I think
that will just reboot the name but
anyways leave us a comment down below we
would love to know your opinion folks
