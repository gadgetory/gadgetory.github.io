yeah yeah basically okay and there he
goes all right so let's start off this
episode of the PocketNow weekly is
brought to you by ops genie if you've
been listening for the past several
episodes you know by now that if you're
running a business and problems arise
you need to have your devs and op teams
ready so why don't you already have ops
genie because with herbs genie your next
incident doesn't stand a chance maybe
you need to try it in which case you
should visit ops genie comm to sign up
for a free company account for up to
five team members no credit card
required did you hear that no credit
card required that's Oh PS GE and I
e.com never miss an alert again with ops
genie from Atlassian it's a good thing I
did that ad read before we started this
because welcome hello everybody and
welcome to our last show of 2018 episode
338 of the weekly brought to you by
pocket now and xda-developers
recorded on this day Friday the 28th of
November technically well for a lot of
people this is the last work day of the
year so kind of the same for us
should acquaintance be forgot swell we
think it should be I said November
December Jules is just let me redo the
intro alright hello everybody and
welcome to our last show of 2018 episode
338 of the weekly brought to you by
pocket now and xda-developers recorded
on today Friday the 28th of December
should acquaintance be forgot we think
it shouldn't we should be making this a
December to remember and we're not
talking about car ads we're digging into
the past 12 months of local tech
milestones I'm checking up on where we
are as we head into 2019 I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and as
you can see since this is a year-end
celebration we decided to break out some
of the libations as it were we're using
this as an excuse to day drink the end
of the year and technically this was my
idea but I have to admit this is
probably a bad idea because for the rest
of the guys it's about 2 p.m. from all
of you right
for me it's one oh it's one ok so at
least it's after lunch for you
it's 11 a.m. so this is breakfast
I'll see you guys at the AAA meetings
okay authority meetings that too but the
alcoholic anonymous III did have
breakfast so I'm not gonna get too crazy
on this so it's fine
but I am having a McKellen 12:00 a
little mini bar Edition I wasn't gonna
bring a full bottle to my office I'm
back in my office by the way after being
home a number of times from the past few
episodes because I was sick but I'm
finally back in my office with a mini
bottle of Macallan 12 joining us for the
moment is hi mate Aveda who's drinking
from a half empty bottle of what's
called an Glen Grant which I actually
genuinely like even if there's no year
here cheers everybody
mmm all right and Brendan minimun is
also on board what are you drinking over
there isn't like makers 46 or something
or what yeah so maker's mark which makes
bourbon came out with a like a longer
aged more premium product called makers
46 they only had it for like a year and
I have no rocks here so I'm drinking it
neat and let's just say it's hard to
drink Hardy drink bourbon
I'm not what do you expect when you
touch it I apologize for the rocks
everybody this is Latin America it is 95
degrees outside so I mean eat chill for
any of our West Coast people especially
in Southern California it is like 70
degrees outside and the Santa Ana winds
have come through so you might hear some
whistling in the background because it's
really really windy outside kind of came
out of nowhere and finally in case you
cared to wonder our producer
extraordinaire Jules Wong is in the
booth today is sipping a bright and
crisp
Bantam wunderkind cider so whatever that
is very refreshing on on Jules is part
and speaking of which I like I said I
ate before this I'm gonna be fine it's
not gonna be a drunk cast I just thought
we should drink for our final episode of
the year as we move into 2019 there's a
lot to look forward to in 2019 but let's
look back a little bit by going through
stories each and every month and just
sort of recount all of the stuff that
happened to 2018 give a few of our
reactions so we're gonna start
with a rumor that started way back in
January of this year that finally came
to fruition very very recently and it
looks like it's going to be something
going into 2019 the foldable smartphone
if you remember that the this particular
photo that we have inside of the story
looks really awesome that's not quite
what we got at the Samsung developer
conference but it's it's the foldable
display the foldable phone as it were
any reactions to Samsung's rumors from
January finally coming to fruition near
the end of this year but now we're
probably gonna see it I think I hope
we're gonna see it at CES in a couple in
like a week or so the thing about it is
they we've been covering foldable rumors
for four years man or years like that
image I think is around four years old
from aquire it's not from where us from
like the galaxy s3 that's and it's from
a concept video that they came up with
at some point I believe and so I'm just
you know it's not that I like what they
came up with I'm just glad we're done
with it like I'm glad that they finally
just here here just here it is it's true
it's real I honestly like it's hilarious
every time like we would sit down with
Sam and Diego talking about the scripts
of the daily and the Indian to the Yeti
owner and I was like I don't want to
talk about foldable stuff anymore like
Ã«god man like I'm tired of it that you
know so it's like finally it's just
there I honestly still don't care about
it I think it's a solution in search of
a problem but only the only companies
can prove us right or wrong you know
true oh go ahead Brendan I was gonna say
Jaime said um you know when they took it
out they were like here it is here's
what it looks like but what you didn't
hear them say is we have no idea how
this is going to work we don't know how
we can mass-produce this and it's going
to be $2,000 we don't know how to get
the price down so it's it's super early
but I think like I said before I think
this is a super compelling idea that you
can have a pocketable device that is
phone sized and yet if you want a larger
screen for many different use cases
watching video sharing photos or just
having a better content viewing
experience this is going to be v4
factor if they can figure out the price
and the technology but I think this is
gonna commemorate the return of the
holster cuz there's no way you're gonna
pocket that thing I think that's the go
in your belt or something like that yeah
I agree
the way that they showed it even though
it was under dim lights it was clear
that thing is gonna be thick so we're
gonna see what what the actual thickness
of that phone is but like we have said
on a number of different episodes before
the we're okay with the phones being
thicker if it means we get more out of
them so this might be the case with
foldable smartphone by the way we are
looking at the live chat I am looking at
it as well I understand that there's a
bit of an audio lag in my video I
finally found a workaround to get my
full camera working as a webcam by
something I didn't account for when we
got into this episode is that the three
puts a little bit lagged so please bear
with me I can't really fix it for this
episode but it's something I want to fix
for 2019 obviously because I want this
to be what it looks like every time I
come on the show well the video quality
is great so yeah that's what I really
wanted I don't want to rely on the Lord
knows I don't want to rely on the camera
from this laptop so the nose cam exactly
you've been looking alright so onto our
next story now in this one in particular
has to do with smart watches now um
something do you guys even remember what
what this particular product was because
this is something that I didn't even
catch catch wind of like back in the
auditory so it's an it's an Android wear
concept that's part adapter in part case
with like funky wings it's just kind of
like another Kickstarter story that
tried to make something out of maybe
whatever you didn't need to make
something out of kick starters are not
only like par for the course but they
are something that's so common that we
see I get really mad when I go to like
my gear websites and I see a product I
think is really cool but then at the
bottom of it instead of saying bye it
says pledge it's like super annoying
some Kickstarter's from 2018 did you
guys ever like pledge to any Kickstarter
this year nope really you're not a
kickstarter guy at all not really man I
mean there have been great stories just
as much as they've been there been bad
ones you know people don't and the
anything I feel like Brandon you may
have you done a Kickstarter before like
you've pledged you know I've done a
couple of things my most recent one that
I can remember was a product called the
lift light and what it was this
beautiful piece of mahogany with a
levitating light on top and the cool
thing was that it used magnets to
levitate but it uses induction to send a
little bit of electricity to the light
bulb so that when you tap the base this
floating light bulb turns on it's so
cool
that's the last thing I can read well
this one is like I totally get it if you
have a really if what you think is a
great idea you have the means to
actually create a prototype of it and
see if it actually work in the real
world
but this particular concept is shell so
these wings are supposed to have a
speaker of receiver radio antennas for
LTE and Wi-Fi but it just adds all this
bulk to what is already considered kind
of a bulky piece of equipment which is
an Android wear SmartWatch and the thing
about it is it's not like if battery
life is great on wearables right now as
it is I mean like like and the other
thing is like my dad's been wearing the
Huawei watch too recently and he has
defaulted to making phone calls from the
watch and he actually loves it just the
way it is with the spiel out yeah that's
interesting I think I've only ever done
that on a SmartWatch one time and it was
for a review just to see what it was
like and I think it was the gear what
was the gear that like wrapped around it
was like a oh my god the gear the gear s
the first year and the first gear s
right yeah that was I still have that I
still have that watch by the way well I
mean we'll see what uh what 2019 has in
store for smartwatches but I do think
that as far as smartwatches ago and that
necessarily Kickstarter's because
they're always going to be massively
weird Kickstarter's out there that you
may or may not pledge for and you might
I pledge for something at the beginning
of the year still haven't gotten it yeah
pair of smart glasses Jules you're right
Jules just for the man in the comments
isn't the new B alpha a thing I've seen
it I don't care about it that's right
because they they're calling it a phone
but it's not and it's just again and
since the solution in search of a
problem what does it solve how is this
better than a phone is the question yeah
it's cool it's just it's just bragging
rights like all these companies need
this like Vanguard product this product
that just totally defies thing and it's
like a marketing stunt where all they do
is get attention through the product but
then what they sell you is cheaper
phones you know and stuff like that and
so it's it's just the way to get good
publicity it was like our best video
from Aoife it was the video that
performed the best but it was really
literally the product that I found the
least future on I mean it wasn't it
supposed to launch now in q4 and it
hasn't launched I think so but then
again the foldable Samsung phone was
supposed to be November clearly that
wasn't the case right you know it's it's
not that easy yeah okay so as we are
drinking a little bit on this episode
not that we would actually do it but
there gonna be a lot of stories on
today's episode where we're gonna kind
of pour one out for a lost soldier in
the world of Android and this is one of
the first ones who used to swipe back in
the day oh no I didn't really
so good at swipe it was ridiculous like
I got so good at swipe I could type
paragraphs without even looking at the
keyboard and now that all the keyboards
out there like G board and really every
single keyboard that matters has that
swipe functionality built in swipe just
a swipe with the Y doesn't even need to
exist anymore because it's built in
every keyboard but if you if you devote
time to learning how to do gesture
typing on a keyboard it's just so fast
and it's all one-handed with your thumb
so for me the problem with swipe was
that it was originally not multilingual
and so the only keyboard back in the day
that was multilingual was SwiftKey that
was the first one they did the best job
at it and ever since then I've been a
SwiftKey user mainly because I literally
speak to people in two different
languages every day all the time and so
I can't just the fall to one I just
couldn't commit to that well oh I just
realized I should probably be saying
when these stories were coming out so
this one in particular we went from
January an hour in February this one is
about how nuanced ended development of
swipe and dragging keyboard which I
remember correctly dragging keyboard was
the voice dictation one and the
so nuance was just like both of our
keyboards for Android sorry we're not
gonna be able to do it anymore
and it was just like it was really odd
you know to see that okay it almost made
perfect sense right because when you
have a keyboard that brings
functionality like swipe typing it only
became a matter of time before other
keyboards took that same function out
you made it their own
I mean clearly after all they're
probably a lot of Android users out
there who just use G board as it's
already in the phone and you know they
just swipe using that I can't really
talk too much I do miss swipe don't get
me wrong but I was one of those weirdos
that used other keyboards there was one
where you did two finger swiping so like
you could type really fast with that
thing but it required both fingers and
and then clearly I'm the biggest fan of
like I'm one of the biggest fans of like
the BlackBerry phones right now so
clearly I'm not by the way if you ever
use swipe or do swipe typing on the on
the BlackBerry key one and Ketu you're
in for a bad time let me just say wait
wait so swipe typing works on the key
key to nearly no you got to get the
virtual keyboard to come up and then you
do that stupid I know you lose so much
screen by doing that thanks remember
this kind of goes back a little bit you
know new nuance makes the Dragon
products back back in the day there's a
product called Dragon Dictation did you
guys have an experience it was one of
the first voice to speech engines way
before Google and Siri could do it and
in order to train it you had to spend
hours reading sentences for it to pick
up what you say and it's just it's
amazing because now you don't need to do
that you just speak to Google assistant
or your keyboard with a little
microphone and it's just remarkably
accurate with no training it's amazing
yeah
pouring one out for swipe I still liked
the design of swipe like it's gray it's
dark and then the sexual swipe line was
yellow yeah or do you remember fiddly no
one said back in the Pocket PC days
there was this there was a special
keyboard layout that they came up with
called fiddly which is that accurate e
it's our core it is you
me to say it's fiddly and so it was just
a way for your stylist did not have to
move like the the word the letters that
you would use the lease were on the
outer portion and then it was just the
word the letters that you would type the
most for in the middle that was a I
think I didn't remember that we've come
a long way do you guys remember anything
any other apps over the course of 2018
that were relics no for me for me the
app that has been relic for years and I
wish somebody bought it I wish I had the
money to buy it was mailbox no I missed
mailbox from the Dropbox came up with
and they just killed the a P because I
guess didn't get any funding for it
that's hilarious for me the best mail
app ever period wasn't that previously a
company or was that that journey to Ella
no so a company turned into outlook
which I hate I do I for me it's like the
worst it's it's a good it's a good mail
it tries to be a mailbox ripoff and it
just didn't do a good job well now we
have inbox which is not quite the same
thing but a child'
inbox is dead they killed it remember
they okay so fine that's one thing that
died this year the Gmail which has a
terrible iPad application it's not so
good on iOS it's like whatever
whereas mailbox was started as an iOS
first step and then involved to Android
and it work just as well on the phone as
it did on the computer as it did on the
tablet but it's another it's another
example of functionality making it onto
let's say the the big guns of of the app
ecosystem because like the whole idea of
mailbox was you swipe to delete that way
you get to inbox zero but you can do the
same thing in Gmail now you can swipe
over and it archives all your emails and
whatnot so you can get to inbox zero in
much the same way you can it's just like
in mailbox you think it was I don't I
don't know what it is what it was about
mailbox it was the simplicity where
Gmail like for example for me the
problem with Gmail is not is not that
you can't do the swiping for me the
problem with Gmail is the way that it
orders email where the first email that
you get is not the it's not the last one
it's actually the first one it's like if
you've got like a 20 emails conversation
it is a freak
nightmare to find which is the latest
one yeah I remember one more thing real
quick um one of the reasons I think you
like mailbox Jaime is because when it
first came out there was a waitlist you
couldn't use it until like what there's
like a hundred thousand people in front
of you and Jaime he likes what he can't
have on it we don't have to go into
detail about it I wanted to put one more
like pour out for another app that died
and I don't remember if it was 2018 or
2017 you mentioned Outlook I miss
sunrise calendar let me just say that
that was a good one
speaking of things that never actually
came to fruition there were a lot of
rumors in the end of February saying
that we would get an iPhone se - clearly
not the case oh not yet not yet with the
way numbers are for Apple right now I
think that se - is what they made well
they were saying that this was going to
have even older specifications like ones
that would not be in line with what WWDC
would bring in 2018 even like an old 810
processor only two gigabytes of RAM it
would have touch ID which I think might
be the biggest thing that people miss
like if an se came out maybe I would
have had touch ID and we would have had
at least one version of it but they went
all in with the design of the ten for
the X of 810 s 10 or whatever what was
it the flop you mean yeah well there
does that does that sound like a good
trade-off that we didn't get an se but
instead we got a 10 R was that even
enough or did you want to see an se you
want to Brandon it's durable affordable
phone come back Brandon you review the
10r what are your thoughts on that thing
um it's overpriced
and I don't really like it that much but
I did use the SE because back then and
it's still true today you can't get a
premium small phone and the SE has like
what a four-point xperia eggsy whatever
a prima coffee compact yeah yeah
so so the SE had a really smells like a
4.5 inch screen but it had you know the
a9 processor really good camera system
and I had a lot of fun with it for a
while because it's like a toy but
inevitably you realize like this screen
is so small that I'm missing out on so
many things so then I went back to my
you know 5.56 inch phone but I think an
SE two could be awesome especially since
there's a lot of people like my dad and
grandma that want touch ID back because
it was so simple and so easy yeah I know
a lot of people that don't like face ID
they just don't they prefer to go back
to the pin password than use face ID
well yeah that's true that's true
the was the size of the SE screen was
below four right orange oranges for I
think an ST - with like 4.7 yeah like if
they would use the same chassis I mean
pretty much they would follow on they
pretty much use that design for the iPad
pro right now so it's like just keep
that design in a way to mimic the iPad
pro the design end and just you know go
screen on screen in which were the
rumors in the end that's that was the
way the the rumors pointed that it was
gonna be mmm well speaking of screens
one trend that happened in 2018 well
okay it was it was coming for a long
time clearly there is a bit of an
advantage to having something like an
AMOLED display on the phone I mean a lot
of manufacturers that are not Samsung or
even using Emma LEDs in their particular
displays Huawei being one of them LG on
the other hand what they're g7 earlier
in the year this this story comes out
from March they decided to stick with an
LCD display despite the fact that they
even had an always-on display on it so
potentially you're using the entire
screen rather than just the specific
pixels in order to get that always-on
display the question here is LCD now
being more considered a medium tier a
mid tier feature is OLED really the
premium feature in terms of smart screen
a smartphone displays the thing about
LCDs is they are still less expensive to
produce they're actually still more
capable in certain things like refresh
rate so I'm not saying I'm a fan of LCDs
like I like there's nothing wrong with
the LCD on this razor phone - for
example it's just and
the refresh rate it's I just I I get so
pissed off the moment the phone turns on
for whatever reason at night and I get
to see that like white screen at night
for the always-on display it's just God
that looks so bad ya know so
aesthetically I don't find else used to
be superior that's the problem yeah yeah
indeed how about how about you Brandon
every time I use an LCD unless it's an
Apple LCD I really miss having an an
OLED display and I should say that
AMOLED is a Samsung thing OLED is not
yeah oh that's true yeah that's a good
distinction to make but LED displays
let's say no so yeah but so LED would be
pretty much else LCD displays is
literally an LED there's an LED
backlight for yeah mo that is and it's
it's it's literally it's OLED technology
that whole and that's the terminal yeah
that would there would be the correct
term where every individual pixel lights
itself there we go yeah which is the
distinction right so you can you can
activate certain pixels if you want them
to beat so that's the reason why I
always on display is kind of became a
thing and that's why OLED or AMOLED
displays became sort of sort of a hot
commodity for all of that but clearly
goes like literally you can have an
always-on display with an LCD there's
just gonna be a trade-off there and
whether or not it actually means lower
battery life is I don't know if anyone's
actually fully corroborated that no but
that's the thing that's that's the point
that I was getting right now I want you
to think about what phones had the best
battery life of the year one of them
being the razor phone to which you have
like literally the whatever it is that
they did with it with LCD displays late
lately I don't know what it is man but
they are they're the ones that bring out
the best battery life even with their
always-on displays you know if they
figured out something and it started it
started ever since LG came up with that
quantum dot technology and they brought
it on the g4 then I don't know what they
did with the g5 I hated the screen on
the g5 but it's evolved into a point
where I feel that LCD displays are more
power efficient than then oh the no LEDs
hmm okay
fair enough we'll see where that trend
goes in the new year so yeah I mean if
you're in the if you're in the live chat
or in the comment sections or if you are
on Twitter let us know what you think
about the battle between OLED and LCD
displays and whatnot let's move on to
our next story which would be about the
iPhone Kim
now here's another rumor that was a that
was sort of circling around the new
iPhones was the whole idea that with the
new iPhones that were coming out in 2018
that the iPhone 10 would be dead and
buried when in reality at at the
announcement for the iPhone 10s and the
10s max as it turned out the iPhone 10
was still going to be very much in the
lexicon it was going to be considered
the lower tier device that you could
still buy if you didn't want to upgrade
all the way to the 10s but the thing is
that up until this point the reason why
people were thinking the iPhone 10 was
sort of dead or even buried
especially when the new phones were
going to come out is because they
actually didn't sell as well that again
was a trend that started to go upward
because with the with the announcement
of the new phones people were like well
maybe I'll just go for last year's phone
because there's not too much that's
different
the battle between iPhone 10 and 10s is
that as does the iPhone 10 deserve to
still be around
now that we've used the 10s and the 10s
max like how do we feel about the iPhone
tenant self still being in the lexicon
so I hate it
no it was just like the 10s is
everything the iPhone son should have
been at the time of the 10 every
flagship Android phone had a great
camera if not most of them and if you
would grab the iPhone 10 for whatever
reason that was not making a video oh my
god like the photography on the iPhone
10 was trashed compared to every Android
flagship I think that the Year where I
like totally can my iPhone like totally
for the first time ever was last year
because of that iPhone 10 because it was
incredibly expensive and you just
weren't getting your money's worth sure
it looked different and it was new and
everything you want for me things like
photography were important things like
battery life are important and none of
these things were nailed by the iPhone
time and another consideration about
that that time when the iPhone 10 came
out
hi man this happened to me - is that the
pixel - was out and you know for the
price yeah for the ten you thought this
has to do something really well at least
the camera should be great but it wasn't
that great especially compared to the
pixel - exactly that then that was again
that was the major problem it's not that
the iPhone 10 was a bad phone it's just
it was really bad compared to everything
else that was the problem would you
recommend the iPhone 10 to users who may
not have the same amount of money to get
the iPhone 10 asked for though I would I
would highly recommend paying the extra
$400 or the extra whatever to pay the I
to buy the iPhone 10s like I would be
like no no no like there's there's a
thing about whatever it is that Apple
did with dynamic range on photography
gets its correlation you know like the
smart HDR is like my god I'm doing into
the ground stories and I'm like it's
probably a little too warm for my taste
but I can't deny how visually pleasing
it is like I'm like this is the perfect
candy for consumers it doesn't matter
what I'm doing in the dynamic range on
this phone it's like insane like stupid
insane like you'd like right now I've
done a couple of videos where people
can't really tell that I'm using an
iPhone 10s as my B camera for a lot of
puerile intern videos they just can't
tell but it's not a professional camera
it is that good for video and for
photography as well like again too long
for my taste but it doesn't matter it
doesn't change the fact that it's great
mmm I do think it's interesting that the
smart HDR actually does work in video as
well which is something that yeah like I
wasn't I wasn't really that big on it
and I still think that for people out
there who prefer a little bit more
contrast in their videos and photos that
maybe it smart HDR you're gonna turn
that thing off but at the very least I
can make sure that the dynamic range is
good and just add in the contrast later
in my editing software so that's why I
usually end up doing the thing about it
is I wish that a company whichever
company and I recently did a not the
word it's not consulting but I recently
we had this conversation with a company
where you know I was like you know what
the problem the biggest problem right
now because they would they asked me
about the the feature of cameras for
example and I was like you know if
somebody like back in the day with
Samsung experiments and with the Galaxy
camera and with all
concepts there was not enough technology
this was just the camera with a
smartphone sensor
whereas now you've got a lot of
development when it comes to
computational photography can you
imagine a Panasonic gh2 with
computational photography even if it's
not powered by Android I've had so many
cases where I'm like I'm not gonna say
that this photo is better than if I use
the DSLR but it's really damn close and
so what is the point of carrying like I
I couldn't say that two years ago like
the pixel two was the first phone to
achieve that and I just I wish that a
company would be like let's do this with
a camera with a real camera with a big
sensor with a big lens and just bring
this computational photography and bring
dynamic range the way smartphones are
doing right now because smartphones are
killing it so why can't they bring
computational photography to a DSLR by
software that's the thing like have you
seen software on your Panasonic it's
terrible well I mean yeah the software
is terrible but it's just software why
can't they
you know spend I would agree I would
agree about putting computational I
would agree about computational
photography on like a point-and-shoot
camera but on a full DSLR where it's
literally made to be a manual a manual
shooters dream they would take the
photos themselves they will go into the
applications they would make the HDR
happen and all that would be cheap
they'll be cheating if they put on idea
so think about it so professional
cameras have had an auto mode for a bit
like I think it's been ten years since
auto mode has existed I just I wish that
we had true intelligent auto that
because he only uses that term
intelligent auto and it just doesn't
deliver like I've had cases where the
other day
well not the other day but a couple of
months ago I was in the Vatican I was
carrying my the p20 Pro and I was
carrying my Panasonic g85 and I took a
couple of photos with the g85 and a
couple of photos with the p20 Pro and
I'm like shoot man I'm like I'm carrying
$2,000 with a camera between the lens I
was carrying an f1 point for a 12
millimeter f1 point 4 plus the body and
the p20 Pro and it's that I'm not saying
the photos of the p20 Pro were better
but what do I use my photos for
Instagram you know that's the thing like
what do we use photography for lately we
use it mostly for social media and so
I'm not saying that a professional
photographer should stay away from their
ten thousand dollar camera not saying
that I'm saying that there are consumers
that want to buy a camera still they
want to get into that niche and I feel
that the technology is there which I'm
saying that probably now is a good time
to get a good standard dragon 845 Hornet
camera and have because of the thing
about it Brandon to answer your question
a lot of this HDR fits a lot of us HDR
capability comes from the processor and
these cameras just don't have good chips
they're old but you would think that
like a very resource-rich company like
Nikon or Panasonic would say let's put
better chips and better software into
these cameras well we-we-well we have to
move on to our next story but I will say
this there's also an infrastructure
issue here because the whole idea behind
having HDR smart HDR all of that stuff
is the fact that it can take so many
photos at once digitally inside of the
processor that's not the case with an
actual camera that has a shutter so when
you hit that button on an actual DSLR
it's gonna go 10 frames yeah it has to
do that but you don't have that problem
on a mirrorless there is no physical
movement like it has to be done it has
to be done digitally is what I'm saying
so if there would be a mode on these
cameras a few mirrorless cameras that do
things digitally without having to use
the actual shutter which it does still
use in regular photography there is
still a shutter there's no mirror but
there's a shutter so it depends on the
mode maybe it can be a mode but I don't
think it's going to replace what
photography has in DSLRs anytime soon oh
yeah all right so we should definitely
go to our next one and speaking of
things that we were going to pour one
out for let's talk a little bit about
Windows Phone guys
I will admit there's one thing about
Windows Phone that I really liked
instead it's just a general design of
the home screens it was definitely clean
it may not have been fully polished but
it's never going to be the operating
system that we look back on and say that
we absolutely hated but it is definitely
one that just
was not able to fight the powers that be
Apple and Google of course and there
were a couple of there was a there was a
series of tweets that went out by
someone that talked about Windows Phone
potentially dying because it was the
fault of the carriers for not actually
embracing Windows Phone as much as they
should have we agree or not agree in
terms of it wasn't the carrier's fault
no the biggest problem of Microsoft was
continuing to be Microsoft I feel that
if Windows Phone would have come out of
the time of Satya Nadella things would
have changed like I'll give you an idea
when don't think is it a free upgrade it
is they that that was selling point for
Windows 10 we're gonna make it a free
upgrade ever at least they did it
temporarily the biggest problem with
Windows Phone is why am I going to grab
why am I going to pay a license for
Windows Phone I was like $30 or I have
to pay nothing for Android mm-hmm and
you have to understand joy Android was
not designed to compete against iOS
there was no iOS at the time that
Android was developed it was designed to
compete with Windows Phone and a
operating system that would be that
would provide a developer as an option
and OEM is an option where they didn't
have to pay in the V and if you remember
like Android originally looked a lot
like Windows Phone the mobile version
the the one that was that didn't have it
didn't have a touchscreen and so that
was the problem like Android literally
came to fill the shoes of Windows Phone
that's what it did and there was just a
way when when when they decided to come
back with a new idea first they were
like yeah sure it was cool but your OEM
s you cannot customize it the OEMs you
can't do anything with it and guess what
dearÃ¶ liam's because we fail with
strategy number one let's do strategy
number two one that's fine no Kia oh
you're gonna buy a competitor you're
gonna put a competitor now so that like
everybody jump ship everybody jumps ship
with Windows for him because of that it
just none of all there were so many
mistakes in the way was handled
originally I'm saying it was a great
operating system it was pair efficient
it was in mic if it was visually
pleasing for me even though a lot of
people didn't like it but just this
there were so many shifts and strategy
to just kill
everything and then the Microsoft when
those phones are just terrible hmm well
I'd like the story because it gives us a
chance to give a quick shout out to one
of our old friends Jeff Gordon we miss
you though he actually responded to this
tweet saying that you know if carriers
and manufacturers were not embracing
Windows Phone enough this is what Jeff
said I loved my HTC Titan on 18t my
windows my HTC Phone 8x in flame-red on
Verizon and the one m8 for Windows with
dual cameras on Verizon true flagships
all of them in on different carriers so
what is this whole thing about
second-string devices and almost no
carrier support clearly Windows one was
found on many of the major carriers if
you were to compare it one to one to all
of the Android phones that were coming
out sure there might be a bit of a skew
there but that doesn't mean it wasn't
being represented at all yeah and one of
our live track one of our live chat
viewers is saying that the main problem
that it came down to at least from the
consumer end was that it was just not
supporting as many apps
so Android obviously had all of
different applications I remember way
back in the day I reviewed a Windows
Phone and I was happy that at the time
of reviewing it Spotify had come to
Windows Phone when years but then when
you use these apps like the then there
was the problem of this whole aesthetic
concept where like people didn't like
Windows 8 people didn't like the the
approach people didn't like Windows
Phone like it
I remember that I gave my I gave my dad
and I gave my grandfather a Windows
Phone and they made me change to France
here are two people that get a free
phone that don't like it and want a
change because they just didn't like the
whole concept of the black and the life
tiles they didn't like a lot of them
didn't understand this idea like right
now Instagram made a change yesterday
that you notice a Josh that they made
this like a horizontal swipe like they
did this temporary change and people
went ballistic if you remember the
Windows Phone original paradigm of
design was horizontal people did not
like it
they just didn't it just didn't it's I
feel that Windows Phone is like this
idea where this design firm came over
and showed them this really cool
on something they liked it but they
didn't show it to enough consumers
before they launched into the market and
then there was the problem of timing
they would announce a new version of
Windows Phone and they would take ten
months to put it out to consumers by
those ten months iOS was already updated
Android was already updated and whatever
cool ideas they brought they just
brought him in and then the third thing
was this whole black screen on white
text which makes sense at night but it
doesn't make sense during that they just
the user interface just did not was
visually pleasing but didn't make sense
that was my my perspective on it alright
so we're gonna get into more design
especially when it comes to the outer
form of the phone when we talk about how
back in May Oh Jules is one of your
articles the hall we made RS had no
notch because the Porsche design
director called it disturbing now what I
love about this is that now clearly
things have changed we have a notch on
at least one of the Huawei phones that
are occurring or both of the Huawei
phones rather that are currently out and
the what I find funny is that though the
design director for Porsche design there
was an update at the bottom of this
article that said update wow he has
reached out to clarify that the opinions
of said director or his alone and not of
course design clearly they knew what
they were going to do because that's
what we got now do how now that we've
had a whole year of notches like so so
many of them have come out we all have
our opinions on them the pixel 3 Excel
or even the while we made 20 that came
out teardrop designs full notch designs
iPhone 10s iPhone 10s max all of that
what is your opinion at the end of 2018
in regards to this design choice like
what how do you actually feel after a
whole year of seeing this as um as Jaime
will say I know what he's gonna say the
notch is a means to an end that you know
at some point in the future we will have
devices without any notches or holes or
even sliders I think that in the
not-too-distant future they'll figure
out how to put the camera proximity
sensor in the earpiece behind the glass
I mean there's already some there are
already some technologies that do that
like the piezoelectric thing on which
phone has it
where it vibrates the screen against
your ear that actually works really well
and to be able to put a camera behind
the screen without a hole punch is going
to be possible so I think eventually we
will have you know full screen devices
without cutouts and notches and you know
this year was about display
experimentation and getting to that
point by using notches and holes and
sliders and things like that I mean I
know so I thought it was your connection
because everybody's but I don't know man
I I'm not saying that I like notches I'm
saying I like matches more than bezels
so if this is the step towards no bezels
and this is like the stepping point I'll
take it so long as not so long as it's
not the pixel 3xl which is actually a
phone I use every day but it just pisses
me off because the whole purpose of
having a notch is to not have bezels if
you've got this huge chin at the bottom
so it's like come on Google you had one
job like if you were gonna lead a chin
might as well lift the top bezel man
like it seriously I feel it was the bad
it was a bad design choice
I still hate looking at it I just I love
my pixel for everything it does right I
am but I hate it's just not visually
pleasing that's just the way I feel
about it you know
well III will say I said this one time
before and it was a bit controversial
that I said it was almost clique meeting
in a way I love the notch dot dot dot
because it led us to all these other
things so like I have to say that in
2019 I'm gonna get really sad because
we're already at the point where we have
hole-punch cameras on the on the front
display obviously and that's going to
eclipse the knotch but it's also going
to eclipse what I felt like was gonna be
a great addition which was the slider
phone finally returning and I think that
was a great elegant solution to the
notch and I feel bad because we were
only gonna get a few of them and then
everyone's gonna go for this hole punch
after that so it's kind of we only knew
we knew you so we hardly knew you slider
phones of 2018
shoot value hold onto your Oppo find X's
and you mix threes they're gonna be
worth triple in like five years because
Joshua's gonna go on eBay and buy all of
them yeah sorry about that I have yet to
use a slider phone except for the find X
for me like the problem with the the
slider design is is the fact that you
lose a lot of resistance that for me if
a company would figure that out then
probably slider phone she would mate oh
yeah that's true
all right so looking ahead we're gonna
kind of blast through the last two
stories here we're going into June and I
believe let's see if it's June or July
in this case well just June stories so
we're going through the first half of
the year and ending it with a couple of
quick questions Siri yay or nay hasn't
even gotten any better in 2018 for
either of you do you use Siri at all
next topic
all right Wow the whole pod was I think
that the worst product of the year the
biggest flop of the year was the hot rod
that is my perspective okay and then we
had a bit of an early rumor leading into
Samsung on packs for 2018 that perhaps
there was going to be a Samsung Galaxy
watch that was going to rock where OS
instead of Tizen clearly not the case
and Tizen is still alive and well and
the Galaxy watch itself was it made a
little bit of a splash at the time but
maybe not everyone remembers it any more
would wear OS I've been a good idea or
for Samsung smart watches this year I
don't think so I think Tizen on the same
level which is in a lot of ways is
superior to where alice is where how do
you feel about where a little what I'm
very how's that you have any idea where
OS well now on the drawer and I'm using
a Garmin Phoenix 5 I mean it's as they
need so much work as update they III may
I made a I made a commitment that I'm
gonna use one force CES just to give it
a good shot it's just even the where OS
is running the snapdragon 830 100 with
the hole there even their battery life
is bad like come on
the new the latest
fossils have terrible like the the their
experience is choppy like they really
need to go back to the drawing board
with everything it tries to do too much
and it yeah I think I agree there the
I'm the one who talks about the hybrid
smartwatches and I also use a me band 3
in this case it's just one of my go-to s
as Jaime kind of tapers off a little bit
there hopefully what Kyle come back
pretty quickly we're gonna go ahead and
go into our first break after all that
alright here we go
the bucket no weakly comes to you with
support of caseta by Lutron and today I
want to talk to you about casita by
Lutron smart lighting control brought to
you by Lutron pioneers in smart home
technology with casita you can schedule
your lights to come on at dusk so your
family always comes back to a will at
home it's quite easy to make every light
in your house a smart light just take
out your switches installing casita
dimmers takes a screwdriver in just
about 15 minutes after that you won't
have to buy racks of smart bulbs or deal
with bulky smart plugs all over the
place just connect the switches up to
Alexa Siri or Google assistant in a way
you go
our producer Jules has them he's been
able to program his life's to start/end
and his day setting them to turn on with
his alarm and to turn off at his command
he doesn't have to flick a switch
because he's smarter than that
get smart lighting the smart way with
caseta by Lutron search for cas ETA or
hit up Lutron comm casita by Lutron
welcome home to peace of mind alright
here we go
so brandon as as almost per usual he has
a bit of a there's a bit of a heart out
for today meaning that he has to leave
in about five minutes so for our little
check-in for this for this week since it
is our year-end celebration we had a
thought of talking about maybe our fate
we're only halfway through all the
stories of the year we're gonna kind of
blast through the last half but now that
we're half way through even though tech
tober is still one of the stories we're
going to talk about a little bit later
do you have a favorite device like I
want to say smart
smartphone but it's very possible that
some of our favorite devices might not
be smartphones so do you have a favorite
device of 2018
I do and I feel like I talk about it too
much so I'm going to talk about my
favorite phone in two seconds favorite
device is the continued a continued
improvement of the smart home speakers
this morning I put a Google home mini
next to my nightstand and just for the
heck of it this morning I was like good
morning hey Google good morning and oh
my god it was like it said hello branded
your commute to work is 12 minutes it's
2 minutes longer than usual today you
have the podcast and you're going to
your in-laws tonight for dinner and
don't and don't remember to pick up the
milk on your way home it was and then oh
and then it proceeded to say today the
weather is going to be 44 degrees with a
30% chance of rain and I'm sitting in
bed like I don't need I don't even need
to like do anything else I just know
everything alright would you are you
going to I know the holidays I've
already passed but I still have my
family party that's happening tomorrow
so we're gonna do like gift exchanges
and stuff tomorrow
did you give like a like a Google home
Mini or something of the sort for like a
gift this year or is it like how much is
it does it work for like a 30 or 20
dollar white elephant cuz I would love
to put one of those in yeah they're
super cheap like 30 bucks I gave several
ways gifts and every one that I gave it
to after you know a little bit of a
learning process love it okay great I
think in my case gosh I have I have a
number of them to be honest because you
know despite the fact that I made a
transition from from from my previous my
previous occupation my previous place of
work I I started to jump into so many
new product categories and one of them
is actually this ring that I'm using
right now it's called the aura ring now
I'm not going to recommend this to
everybody mainly because it cost 399
dollars but but I will admit that for
someone like me that is a
self-proclaimed biohacker I like to I
like to know as much information as
possible about my health about my sleep
about my fitness and be able to do
things because of that one thing I want
to talk about in 2019 at some point is
how people don't use their smart
trackers to their fullest potential yes
get the info but you need to know what
to do with that information and this is
one of the few products that tries to
coach you on what to do about it it's
mostly a sleep tracker and if it notices
via its sensors that you're not sleeping
as well as you should it gives you some
real actionable steps on actual things
you should do for the next night in
order to get a better night's sleep and
hopefully you see an upward trend with
all of the sleep that you're tracking
with this okay so I did want Jules to
kind of pop in because it seems Jaime is
having a little bit of connection
troubles but I mean in our little break
right now or rather our I would thought
that I'd hear now that we're halfway
through the stories of 2018 I wanted to
see what your favorite device might have
been over the year it doesn't have to be
a smartphone because I know it might be
different like I said I had my smart
ring but also Brandon said the Google
home me well Google home here this is my
favorite product mm-hmm it's beautiful
it really is this is my favorite product
the foldable see Apple beat everybody to
the punch with a foldable product that
reached the market first it's right here
I'm not saying I'm not saying this is
iPad pro yes Thank You Jules I forget
that there's audio to this type at the
11 inch model I'm not saying it's the
perfect computer it's not it's not for
me it doesn't replace my computer it
doesn't replace anything it's just there
are things that I like about this tablet
that I can't do with a computer I don't
like to sit down in bed when I want to
watch a video I don't like like I can't
I like using Mac's for video editing but
I can't there's no touch interface on a
Mac so I'm forced to use this and it's
just I've been experimenting with
editing video on this thing like there
are some really good apps on this tablet
like I had no idea like luma fusion and
stuff like that so it's it's a really
good tablet that doesn't want to be a
computer and I don't care because I
don't want it to be a computer for me
it's more of a notepad I use it a lot to
assist everything that I do so it's like
an it's like an accessory to me it's not
a product to get real word
and there is so much performance
overhead just to add to that tablet like
using you know but it's just like like
what I didn't hear you oh yeah I just I
was filling in while you froze I was
gonna say the iPad pro has so much
performance overhead that you you use a
fraction of its power when you're using
OneNote or like email or the web it's
just so powerful yeah indeed Jules I
don't know if you have your set up over
there if you want to kind of jump in and
say what your favorite product might
have been Brendan you're gonna have to
finish that before you leave this
episode I can't I gotta try okay fair
enough
I was speaking of which I should
probably get to my I did finish the

okay I am because I'm in a whole new
place in my career obviously like much
much thanks to all of you guys for
giving me a home a place to call home so
it's anybody out there who might be
wondering I am gonna be going to CES as
JV but I'm also going as pocket now as
well so I'm kind of double dipping in
that way and it's because of my
association with pocket now that I'm
even able to get a press
so it's awesome dude it's it's such a
pleasure to have you man are you kidding
mmm cheers to that Jules no
unfortunately can't really hear you so
we're gonna go to move into our next
next stories okay so do you remember I
may and Jules a few if you want to chime
in via the chat all I'll make sure to
let your opinions be known do you
remember back in the day when we used to
look at any phone out of China and just
immediately think it's not a great phone
oh it's yeah same it's like the same
paradigm of of Japan 30 years ago any
product that was Japanese would be
considered cheap same thing well I mean
granted there are some issues from 2018
regarding mainly ZTE because clearly
China as a whole is not really feeling
the crunch politically as it were
especially when it comes to selling
smartphones because oneplus clearly has
a phone out and t-mobile and they got a
carrier to help them out but ZT was the
one that had most of the problems and
now recently we're seeing a little bit
from Huawei but this particular story is
about ZTE use with the US authorities
I'm not sure if you have any hot takes
about this one I don't really want to
get into the politics of it obviously
but ZTE was the one to feel the crunch
the most granted Huawei wasn't able to
bring their stuff to the US I remember
at CES they were hoping to bring it to
18 t but that didn't happen but any
thoughts on the general China market
trying to penetrate the US market ah all
right so all of these issues have to do
with privacy concerns I want to ask you
how many times have you said something
any particular thing like I want to go
buy a glass of Glenfiddich I did it in
Taipei recently I said oh my god I would
love to have some then Finnick right now
and then my phone was full of
Glenfiddich ads now is that is that
China or is that because I know it
happened that happened to me in Taiwan
it's happened to me in the United States
using not an iPhone I will have to
clarify that has never happened to me
while using an iPhone but I have been
using certain Android phones were apps
like Facebook can target what you're
looking for through whatever it is that
you say it happens to me with Amazon all
the time
all the time so you know when you ask me
about what my perspective is on Chinese
companies I would I'm you know the
question is is the concern is privacy
how sure are we that other companies
from the United States are not doing the
same thing man I mean come on like it's
just this level of cynicism when it
comes to getting Amazon ads yeah Amazon
a fully US company using my phone and
then people are gonna be like yes but
you gave the phone permission to use
your microphone the problem is if I want
to use Amazon that's the only way it
works like in vital like the problem is
they kind of force you to say yes to
these things so I feel that the topic of
privacy is much broader it is much
bigger it is more than just our and I I
don't want to get political because I
hate talking about politics um but you
know it's it's just one of those things
where I feel that the we should just not
I hate playing the blame game where I'm
like these companies that this batter
these company I think the government's
need to do a better job of telling us
the why except you know that I do
understands that I do understand the
concerns and the legalities it's just
God when we're in a country like the
United States where we profess free
market and we start blocking companies
from other comes from other countries
it's kind of the complete opposite of
what these company what the country is
saying it's a free market so I don't
know man yeah I think it's easy to pick
okay now granted again without getting
political I do think that China is kind
of an easy target but granted we already
using that as a scapegoat one really we
should be looking at everything you're
right this is a much broader issue like
for example again not to get too into
detail about it but you know even if
Huawei is I don't want to say guilty but
even if there are concerns about Huawei
in terms of privacy and all that there's
one thing that the consumer will always
keep in mind is that they make quality
products and clearly those products are
out in places that are not China like in
Europe and they don't care that America
will always huge right now yeah
it's funny cuz everybody's like ever
since the Pete and everybody's like oh
that's a new P like they've gained a lot
of mindshare and I don't know man I'm
not trying to defend anybody I'm not
trying to defend the US government I'm
not trying to friend China all I'm
saying is I think that there is more to
discuss when it comes to the political
aspect and I feel that there are certain
countries that are not doing a better
job then there are a lot of US companies
that are not doing a better job I will
say this right now the first US company
that I have chosen to abandon this
year's Facebook I mean come on then
Facebook is a US company and we've we
had all the cameras analytic azuz this
year yeah I mean come on man like if
anything let's talk about an election
that was like like you can't even
consider it legal anymore like I used to
make the point that if our information
is being oh sorry oh there you go what's
up Jules ah I was going to make the
point earlier that if if our data and
our information is actually being
collected this goes back to like the
varieties and 18t like you know data
breaches and whatnot or even just data
collecting that you said that happened I
think it was 2015 2016 if our
information is actually being collected
what I want to know is how is it being
used if it's not go further over it I'm
gonna give you an example I was gonna
say I think I think if it's not being
used for anything truly nefarious if
it's being used for targeted ads and
fine but then Cambridge oolitic of the
analytical became of thing so that's a
whole different layer but if it's not
being used for anything truly malicious
I could almost I can almost give it a
pass because I do feel like we live in
an age where everything that we do is in
one way or no they're being tracked or
at least being paid attention to I'm
gonna give you the perfect example the
other day my dad my dad is a lawyer and
he focuses mainly on the how do you call
it crime well would that be in English
criminal law criminal law he focuses
mostly on criminal law he was like if
you say he was working with
case and the customer came in and he was
like he looks at the case and he's like
um I can't do this I can't follow this
case and he's like and then the
customers like but why I mean he's like
you guys have no case like the you
you're telling me that there is evidence
through phone calls so I was not aware
that in my country it is completely
legal to record your calls fully a
hundred percent that cut like a lawyer
can ask carriers with a judge with a
judicial warrant they can ask for your
phone calls either transcribed or full
recordings of calls for the past two
years man yeah that's warranted
information and I would have to figure
out how to talk about this Genki said
we're glad to have you man it's just
like let's do like privacy oh my god man
I what kind of privacy is that yeah
there are one-party consent
it's a two-party consent I said
according stay at school so it's like
we're one agent beside the points so I'm
not trying to defend anybody it's just
come on man how much do we actually know
about privacy is the question exactly
there's nothing that 20:18 taught us not
and and granted like I said China just
happens to be an easy target
well because late setting up their law
so that it's impossible for without a
joint agreement that there's all this
trade that's being that's a lot of
thought of the concern about what West
companies are going into they want to
get into the Chinese business because
they have to surrender so much that's or
the trade agreement but then but then
it's
let let's talk about the biggest China
benefactor which is the United States
how many products are manufactured in
China you know it's such a multi-layered
issue is privacy and I think what 20:18
taught us is that we really don't truly
know anything as consumers when it comes
to privacy like we don't actually know
where the laws lie in terms of what our
data is supposed to be able to do for us
and even on top of that like the other
thing that we learned in 2018 and again
we don't have to get into this because I
do want to go to our next story is that
the people who are in charge don't
understand tech that's the most oh my
god oh my god that that the Facebook
yeah oh my god the laws of the United
States I mean I was like no no no like
the questions I'm like these guys filter
their questions before they ask them
like could they like call an expert to
actually look at their questions before
they look stupid you know in public like
I don't know man not to be fair we're
talking bunch of old people that you
know yes but they working for them I
mean can't they hire somebody to be like
yes you know the this is kind of stupid
to ask about Facebook like you know even
though they have all these sub
communities about science and whatnot
down they rely a lot on what the arts
thing that hey this is a danger this is
a risk and kind of evidence I'm part of
it and again that is all kind of what
lets us be a little skeptical of this we
don't have access as to what they know
but I think I think it has taught us
something Jules I think it has taught us
how how Adelaide is the word delayed how
how old our law our laws are in general
country wise
every country how how laws are not fit
to regulate how much the Internet has
evolved you want to go someplace where
they know good be an e citizen of
Estonia that is a all right well we can
go on to our next one thank you you know
what that was probably my favorite part
of this episode so far I love that kind
of talk and it's so funny how we can run
right up to the political line and just
be like no Jules can tell you like we
came to a point with certain stories
where you know we publish the stories
and I was you know Brandon and I were
like dude let's just pull this like we
don't want to get into the political
topic because like it exceeds our
understanding yeah we understand tech
but we're not experts in politics nor
are we experts in what is legal and what
is not so I don't think it should be
it's a good idea for us to get into this
are we are facing that kind of scary
crossroads because exactly that's we're
gonna have to talk about it there is no
like if some different easy
besides this like yeah it's just the
thing about it is like you have no idea
how many pictures I've gotten from
companies about like PR companies being
like would you like to interview John
Sculley about the recent announcements
of Apple and I'm like no we we review
products that's what we do right you
know or or would you like to interview
this expert of whatever I'm like it's
not that I wouldn't love to and it's not
that I wouldn't like the insights it's
just what we do is read products that's
what we the whole idea of like I just
know that I won't do it justice the
people who are really into those topics
that are really in that world are not
gonna be happy with the way it goes
I do so the problem is like I got a lot
of backlash on certain reviews about
like why didn't you talk about the iPad
like the iPad bending or something like
that I'm like I can invent mine and I
don't know enough people and so I you
know and that's easily you do with your
tablet you know and so but the
think about it is it's not that I'm
trying to defend the product that's just
that's not what I do my job is not to
bend things that's why we have Zack Zack
your are a hero man yeah we talked about
that also yeah at the point you know
there are just I think we don't do we
review products from a usability
standpoint Matt from what you can do
with them I'm sure that if I grab the
screen of this laptop and did this I
could totally bend it but that's not
what it was designed for yeah exactly
you know I'm sure I'm sure that if I
grab my car and I go crash it to the
wall it'll literally destroy itself see
Joel just did the Segway for me now we
were talking about the hardware side but
there's a bit of a software thing
there's influencing hardware as well as
Apple it became kind of clear that Apple
is actually meek okay this is
speculation this is something that I was
thinking about when all this was
happening
Apple clearly wants you to buy more of
their newer devices because with the new
operating systems of 2018 they were
actually actively making the battery
drain even faster on the 6s plus in the
iPhone se you only have three days left
for that battery placement 829 so it's
it's okay granted we used to be in a
place where you could get a smartphone
it would last you for up to two maybe
three years but now the companies are
like you know what cash grabs all over
the place and I don't mean that in a
super nefarious way I just know that
that's just the way business is so Apple
making an operating system that
literally that that basically just sort
of cuts your phone at the knees your 6s
you might be such a 6s fan that you
don't want to give it up you gotta
because the battery drain is going to be
there you're not going to be able to use
it anymore
because the operating system literally
cuts it at the knees so like is it how
do you feel how did you feel about this
practice when I was first happening at
the time
Am I can I say that at least they solved
it with iOS 12 yeah
okay fair like the but it was so here's
the thing I mean think about it iOS
pretty much made old iPhones work better
I hated the whole concept of planned
obsolescence and like this is the this
is what I like about the internet this
became so viral this became such a mess
that Apple had to do something about it
yep and I love it I love because for me
that pissed me off like I gave my son an
iPhone 7 and the last time that I tried
to play with it it was terrible grab go
grab an iPhone 7 right now it works just
as well as a 10s years for them to a
minute it is crazy that it has no it
pisses me off you know what pisses me
off it pisses me off when you have OEMs
like Samsung saying we don't throttle
your phone that's BS have you ever tried
to use a galaxy from last year try to
use the galaxy from the last couple of
months
like that's BS like this year yes for
the thing about it is Apple was the
first company to get caught but this has
been a practice of every company even if
they don't want to admit it yeah there's
a wide-reaching issue and I love that I
love how that turned out this is what
happens when we drink on the podcast
guys let's be honest I mean Jules how
many of your old phones are performing
well right now from last year Josh is it
okay
I should her to say that it would be
because of the software updates because
that's at the heart of the issue here
it's more about just the longevity of
the device itself clearly Mikey one is
crap right now that is just supposed to
be the case because its specifications
are not meant to be future proof but if
I were to take out let's say let me
think of a pump let me think of a phone
that I wanted to use
okay but let me ask you this we you
you've been part of every single Google
i/o every single every time Android has
become more efficient more efficient if
anything you would assume that Android
would work better on older specs because
of how better it's done and it's been
the other way around okay I can I can
see that being the case in that regard
what I would have loved Google to do is
say hey if you have a much older phone
here is a ROM of Android one you can
flash exactly
that should have been what did that was
but what was it
Android what's it supposed to be Oreos
yeah this has to be it was just the Oreo
or what was the trouble yeah yeah
trouble supposed to be Oreo or the one
before it that was supposed to be good
to go on older devices or or devices
that had lower specs that was the
battery - that was Android go okay like
that strip indicator first of all the
naming convention be damned but that
should have been the case like okay if
you have like a Galaxy Nexus for
whatever reason here's here's a ROM and
Rigo or Android one that will work
beautifully on your phone even if it's
not necessarily the full Android Pi that
should've been what they did but of
course does know what they did it's like
oh my god we have so many transitions
and we have power efficiency is like two
times better and it's all supposed to
last the same amount of time it supposed
to be two years or whatever the heck and
before the amount of power efficiency
that they tout every single year like
it's two times three times four times
but what is where are we talking about
it yeah it's no longer to the point
where technology is meant to last it's
actually being built to fail at some
point and this kind of software update
that that was supposed to throttle the
general daily usage of us
iPhone 6s on iphone se is kind of
perfect it's perfect for its but it's
perfect example of that so I'm just
happy internet like all of you guys in
the comments thank you so much like the
pointing things out obviously we live in
a bubble as reviewers because we've got
phones galore that we have to test and
so we can fall back to anything but for
us it's extremely important like I love
that I get I get a comment like I don't
remember your name but I get a comment
on every video that I do asking for the
after the bus series to come back it'll
actually come back the next phone that's
coming in after the buzz is the galaxy s
9 plus which I've been actually working
on arm which is right here I've actually
been using um because yes like these
series are designed to tell people how
phones age and for me that's that's it's
it's extremely important that people
point out it's the only reason why this
whole battery replacement program began
it's the only reason why companies are
doing things like iOS 12 why I feel that
Google's been working on it as well
because I mean come on man you're not
paying five bucks for that phone you
you're paying a lot of money and in the
case right now iPhones are worth the
price of a computer of a high-end
computer so it's it's it's it's it is
not fair for consumers to pay that
amount of money for a disposable product
I mean my gosh
we can skip the next day for August
because it's basically I meant it's a
it's like Joey
Jules what's the minimum wage right now
in Boston in a month $11 per month a
that's per hour excuse me I'm going into
12 so it's like $1,200 a month right you
know on a typical late hour or whatever
we're talking about what $1500 I mean
come on 18 18 18
okay $1,800 I mean you're charging
almost half minimum wage for phone like
seriously
more than if you're getting a flagship
yeah exactly exactly so come on Matt
company should take consumers seriously
that's what I feel yeah 100% okay so
yeah Jules was saying a second ago we're
going to be skipping this particular
story now some of you in the chat we're
asking though where's all the Sony talk
well this was gonna be one of them let's
just say that you there will be an exit
3 review I've also been using it well in
this case Sony was trying to explain why
Android updates take so long and if the
interface sucks well from Sony's
standpoint perhaps but what they were
saying in this case they even made an
infographic saying that software rollout
is about you know trying to create that
features trying to build the foundation
of the actual operating system
implementing their own features in the
operating system and then there's an
extra phase where it has to get
certified and approved by all of the
right people and that in and of itself
could take a long long time in the u.s.
we have an even other layer that goes on
top of it and that's the carriers they
have to approve it as well so yes look
at this does this make sense to you it
took me a day to figure out how to
enable the swipe for the app train it
took me a day and once I figured out how
to enable the swipe you don't continue
swiping up it's it's left to right right
and you can't switch that off I'm like
and then there was this like edge
feature here which would always activate
it so I'm like Sony why like what's the
point yeah they're always it's it's it's
one half trying to add their own flavor
to Android but also the other half
trying to get it approved so that's one
of the reasons why Android updates take
so long and I think that's a big
frustration that a lot of people have
but I also come from the side of it of
if the phone is working just fine do you
actually need the absolute latest
version of Android to like work with it
pretty well like it may not be truly the
case don't even get me started about
this camera user interface like you can
only enable HDR in manual mode I'm like
say what what and then they've got this
portrait mode where are you it's not
until after you take the photo that the
phone tells you oh I wasn't able to
create the bouquet modes
what Sony is this is why I said last
week Sony is the reference design of
Android it is it is the only
manufacturer that turns every feature on
on the new Snapdragon processors and the
contributes so much to a USP chip
yes and they mean they may be the only
ones who do it and they are like the
starting point so all the other
manufacturers are like did that work
really well on the Sony maybe we can do
that too
so like super slow-mo worked pretty well
on the Sony and then Samsung brought it
out
HDR playback worked really well on the
Sony not the 4k display but the HDR
worked pretty well and then other
manufacturers started to adopt it
depending on what content you have so
Sony is kind of where the the new
Snapdragon of the ear gets put like
everything gets turned on and then all
the other manufacturers just try to
figure out if they can do it too
okay so we're on software talk even more
so what we have here is yet another
Android versions story where there was
never night watch none I watched sorry
not I watch was name of this one well
basically there was a security there was
a security vulnerability that affected
all versions of Android except for
Android Pi and if you needed any reason
to be mad about Android versions not
getting updated all the time this might
be one of them but weren't there a
couple of other scares in 2018 I'm
tremble what the other what the names of
the other ones what ghost in the branch
or something into yeah and this story in
particular is because Google said that
it would only issue a fix for Android
and okay great job on taking care of
plate what 99.9 percent so of course
there were a lot of users out there who
aren't even upgrade to PI and it's I
don't know it's it's uh is this like is
this like Google's way of trying to
force everybody to upgrade as much as
possible or is it just laziness on their
part is
80% option rates yeah yeah
and that better team in that doesn't
even get us into the whole idea of
fragmentation in the Android space like
that's that's a topic we've been talking
about for years but is it a consumer
problem it's not a consumer problem it's
not that people don't want to update to
the latest version of Android it's that
OEM suck at it yeah well okay it that is
true
like what Wyatt why haven't I done my
after the buzz on the s9 plus because
I'm still waiting for you 1u i I'm like
I want to have something to talk about
here one UI is gonna be it when am I
getting it on my phone I don't know
anything - we would have articles that
say Samsung is pushing out the OTAs for
these kinds of things and then our
specific devices don't get it at the
time of that publishing it takes even
more time yeah I mean come on alright so
moving into Oh actually you know what
this is this this next one is not the
next story actually all right one we
were getting a little long in the tooth
in this episode but it is the year-end
celebration so clearly we're all pretty
riled up after the 50 cups no no I'm
still going strong
how that we're all pretty not really
riled up but we got a little bit of that
liquid courage in us okay how did we
really feel about tech Tober so I was
doing my expense report recently you
have any idea how much I spent an uber
just ubering two different man I know
you have any idea how much I spent an
uber in October
just ubering two different meetings
every day New York
I spent $1,000 on oh my god $1000 and
this is in ten dollar segments of uber
ten dollars segments uber I have
products I haven't been able to review
galaxy watch Apple watch series for I'm
currently on the Sony I have the razor
phone too
yes we have Anna soos ROG phone no
thanks to a soos I got it I got in a
different way because these guys I've
got the Nokia 7.1 which is really good I
have so many products I have not they
don't even get me started about
accessories I feel so bad because like
it's not that we don't want to review
these things it's just tech Tober was
not just about devices it was also about
to travel to see this devices and we had
cases like for example in the case of
the razor phone where they were like if
you want a unit you have to make the
trip and I couldn't make the trip yeah I
just I didn't have the time and and and
they were like well you want to get a
unit oh my god
by the way that you get my controller
okay I was about to say you don't have
to feel pressured about the ride you
mobile controller it's still buggy it's
still buggy but when it works it works
well which is kind of par for the course
for a razor product so you know like not
really a review but you'll get it at
some point it's just that for now they
need to fix the kinks let's say god it's
just I am honestly I have slept more in
the last week than I have in the last
year mmm
like I remember Tex over being one of
those like okay just from a personal
standpoint and clearly I'm here with
pocket now I'm the host of the podcast
but I also did do work in October for
myself as well that was gonna work dude
I mean come on you give me a good boost
and it was it was really crazy but you
know what like I will say leading up to
October there was this whole talk from
so many people so many outlets and so
many youtubers were talking about it the
YouTube burnout yeah you have no idea
like you have no idea what it's like
until you go through it that's exactly
what I went through all of November was
me recovering from just how much
craziness October was and I'll apologize
across the board for not being better
about like being honest with myself
about how much work I could do and how
much I could do one of my things in 2019
actually if I can say my new year's
resolution for 2019 I'm actually gonna
be I my brother corrected me I wanted to
say that I'm gonna be antisocial in 2019
just sort of focus on the work like take
care of myself and not that I'm gonna
work 24/7 but I'm gonna focus on myself
24 24 7 to make sure that I'm healthy
mentally and physically so it's a good
thing right
my brother was like nah you're gonna be
selectively social clearly but that's
the thing man I mean I feel that apps
have only gotten more aggressive about
keeping us in games have gotten more
aggressive about keeping us locked into
their services and it's just very
difficult when you do our line of work
and to remain focused on creating
content when you've got so many other
distractions and you know all these
companies want your attention all these
companies want you to see their product
I've made a couple of resolutions for
2019 and I'm gonna say them right now
the first one is we're no longer gonna
cover trade shows with fully elaborate
video we're not it's impossible it takes
too long to create I think that it takes
us too long to create a compelling video
um and by the time we do like the buzz
is already gone unless we've been
briefed and we've we've been working
hard like 20 and 20 18 was a lot about
briefings and a lot about having all the
information ahead of time but then the
problem was I mean Jules can tell you
man us working at 11 p.m. midnight it
was the worst midnight it's just just
putting videos together and I you know
I'm sorry it just it doesn't it it it we
don't have any parties I skipped out and
that's the other problem Jules like
everybody wants us to go party let's go
party let's go get drunk and so I can't
if not then you are on the blacklist I
am NOT Jules's age I can't learn every
day I can't drink every day I had a time
when I couldn't I was better than Jules
at it but I can't do it anymore and so
like I like 2018 was just a lot of
excess a lot of excess it was I think
that's the best way to describe 2018 it
was a lot of excess every company want
and I you know it's not that I I it's I
thank companies for it I love it I just
I feel that companies would have had
better exposure if they would have
if they would have been like you know
what you know what Sammy you take over
January and LG you've got February oh
yeah plus you've got March man like come
on let's let's create a product launch
consortium where all these companies
with the grab a month for them to launch
their stuff and because I you know Josh
I remember when you told me about you
know going solo and everything and I was
like dude I would love to be a single
youtuber but I don't know how people do
it I don't I do not I think that staff
has got like the best formula where sap
is like you know what man reviews them
do really good for me I'm just gonna do
unboxings and doing unboxings is a lot
easier and so like for example for us
comparisons do a lot better than
anything but making a good comparison
take so you have to have the right
resources like you have to just so I
would love to do more comparisons I mean
come on each of them gets a million
views and they're great and everything
but there's so much work it's like we
need to talk to Brandon after well you
know what I do have to say that there
were a couple people in the chat saying
so you need more reviewers and we're
like okay it's actually yes we do guys
if you guys want in I'd love to have
more people on board but seriously
that's it's no BS it's it's we do need
more talent we do well and we would love
to have more people so you know what
this is the thing like this is this is
this is a reality that I think we all
have had to wrestle with in 2018 I don't
even know if we're gonna get to the
final stories in the side what will
blast through them but this is this is a
really good way of sort of ending the
full 2018 talk is like okay this is
something we've all had to wrestle with
in 2018 was the whole idea that the way
that we were living for the past five to
six years of being in this industry now
remember that number five to six years
that's a long time it's longer since
2007 what are you talking about all
right so
in Jaime's case it's like ancient times
it's 22,000 sex like the fact that we've
all been here for as long as we have for
me it was five to six even that is a
long time and now in 2018 we're learning
that the way that we got to where we are
now in that time it's not quite as
sustainable as it used to go and and by
sustainable we don't mean in terms of
like holding up the company having money
or anything like that we're talking
about as ourselves and that's a very
very different layer to all of this and
that's a layer that is a part of the
entire the entire being the entire
spectrum so even I had to make that
decision which is the reason why I made
the choice that I made and now I have a
home here a pocket now obviously which
is great and I'm always gonna be
grateful for that but we also still need
to remember that taking care of
ourselves means that we can make better
stuff for you at the end of it all so
taking care of ourselves as always
should always come first and that's kind
of where my resolution comes in it's
like what I always say capitalism's
could be on the vs again because it
doesn't care about whether it's January
March or April and you get five felons
this week good luck yeah who might be
thinking like what kind of content this
this is behind me was talking about
comparisons that's a whole different
beast but even a regular review or even
just like a general video it takes more
it could take a day but that's when
you're really forcing it it doesn't take
me it it takes me more than a day and so
I don't know if you've noticed but like
recently my videos have been more a role
and b-roll why because it takes me a lot
less to make a video like that then if I
make a full b-roll video I love making
full b-roll videos and I'm more proud of
those it's just okay guys you want the
damn content now or not I don't want to
I don't want to do something I just I
don't have the time like for example
there was a video that we did with
jewels of Snapdragon 835 the HP Envy x2
video yeah you know how many takes Jules
and I had to do for that video and 22
takes 22 clips that's how long that
video took and I was just so
disappointed at the amount of views that
it got it so was this
me like you you want to know how many
videos we've done for the Spanish
Channel we've done a hundred and
forty-three videos for the Spanish
Channel and we've barely been able to
break seven thousand subscribers and so
you know it comes to a point where it's
just I'm not gonna lie I we're gonna
continue because I believe I believe in
the Spanish market I believe in my
native tongue and I believe in our users
but it's sometimes it's kind of
discouraging like you know sometimes you
wish that something would perform better
than it doesn't like for example like I
think that the review that I'm most
proud of is my iPhone 10s review and it
didn't perform well you know but I just
it took me I I remember how inspired I
got and how psyched up I got and I'm
like oh my god I found the perfect song
the perfect intro everything than just
putting all that together take so much
time and then for it to not perform well
it's kind of discouraging and so I'm not
gonna lie you just went through through
burnout I went through I told you man
when we were in Shanghai I you know when
Wan was like I want to do my own thing
and we're like lon dude you're our
friend do it dude I reached burnout I
for me that first I even told Anton I
told everybody like after how much work
I put him in 2016 and 2017 by early 2018
Jules can tell you we did we did see yes
and I didn't want to see the computer I
just I just I didn't want to see the
computer man I've been doing the video
and day since 2012 I you know it came a
point and so it's funny when when you
get all these commenters like and
they're like yeah but you should have
tried harder I'm like seriously did you
have any idea what it's like to make a
video like to make a really good video
do you have any idea how much work it
takes and can you really be creative
three times a week four times a week
it's not easy
can I do a few things because our chat
has been really going on here so over it
I'd love to hear I think I know one of
the first things that you want to talk
about if you wouldn't mind I'd love to
be able to say it like I don't want it I
don't want it to sound like none of us
want it to sound like we're just like
straight up
we're getting old but like it's just the
whole idea is I am and that's something
that I was saying like we all are coming
to terms with the fact that we're not
able to work at a clip that we used to I
used to do a video every other day and
it wasn't just a regular video of me
sitting here talking about a random
thing and putting it all together it
looks full comparisons those full
reviews it was all that stuff and those
are not easy to do like we said but we
don't want it to sound like we're just
sort of like a vision about all of this
we do understand that a lot of you out
there are really appreciative of the
work that we do and we want to continue
doing it it's just us this is us sort of
musing about how we can find better ways
of doing it that are not only good for
that are not really good for you but are
even better for us because if we but if
we burn out you get nothing so I like
yeah I think that the YouTube burnout
topic I mean has been the topic of 2018
and I love that it has because now I
don't feel weird about it but for me
probably the most important thing like
the other day we were talking with
Brandon and we had recently hired
somebody in it didn't turn out well it
didn't end up turning out well but the
point being is I was like all right I do
understand that it's a lot of work but
we have to understand we've got the
coolest job in the world oh yeah of
course like let's let's why do I keep
doing this why I could like shoot I've
got different companies that I could
work for and different industries where
I'm actually better at what I do there
that what I do here the only reason why
I don't want to leave this is because
number one we don't know how long it's
gonna last I mean we don't know how long
that YouTube bubble is gonna last and it
kind of burst this year when it came to
ad pocalypse and everything uh it's just
the contribution to burnout has a lot to
do with not just it's not just the
amount of work it's how much you get for
the work yeah well like three years ago
we were making three times the amount of
revenue through ads now we've had to
make a shift in focus to sponsors
because we've got a team that we need to
sustain it's not that easy we're not
just the single youtuber which one
salary it's a team of people that are
able to keep this work going like City
to keep the pocket out daily going we
need the website and
the website going there's a team and so
many things and so it's not that easy
for us and so we've had to make a shift
but then you know I again I'm glad that
I'm not the only person that burned out
I am I'm very grateful for what we do
but we don't know if YouTube is going to
continue being the medium going for we
don't know
I mean Instagram is grabbing a lot of
traction and so it's there's this level
of uncertainty right now
yeah what's what 2019 gonna be like you
know and a few more things doing you Oh
from the break to eat $5 at the secret
oh my god thank you thank you thank you
honey
you're an inspiration for my channel so
there we go with that and also I was
just gonna say like the the level of
gratitude that we that we do see from a
lot of commenters out there despite us
kvetching the way that we do like it
that's not ever going to we're not ever
going to overlook that so that's what I
wanted Thank You Jules for mentioning
that like someone did donate in the
super chat which might be a first for me
but you know it's just about that I need
speaking up like I am grateful for this
platform because the thing is is that
ever since you know I mean we've gone
through our ups and downs here but with
you know I do post with Josh coming on
here like we've experienced a
renaissance like more people are going
in and more people are kind of adjusting
to the attitude it's just like we've
been doing pretty well since then and
we've been able to experiment more with
the format because audio as well as
YouTube so different the CES podcast
because it's the it's just explore and
especially because you know I I know
that you don't want to be so let
everyone eat early to add remedy models
of what you know that's like that
beginning on board
so like this is something that if we
want to be able to be creative you might
have to think things a little
differently and that's always been the
case in media I think I've always said
that the media industry is has to be the
quickest a professor where the
communications of each are the
communications industry it's vital it's
yeah and there's a there's one before we
get into like the last couple of topics
for this show it's gonna be a two-hour
show screw another so like thank you so
much right there
we're we're we obviously don't have we
don't have any delusions of grandeur in
the sense that we wouldn't be here if it
weren't for all of you guys watching and
tuning in and being there with us so
it's just us sort of talking about our
own mental health our own well-being
that's that's what a lot of this
conversation comes from I think YouTube
viewers are the greatest that being
therapists but yeah mm-hmm well like I
see there's even one person in the chat
saying like the mental burnout and the
whole work burnout and all that stuff it
transcends just YouTube clearly because
there are a lot of people who are even
in academia who are going through that
as well like you can burn out with
anything that you have a passion for and
I think if you burn out with something
it's clear that you do have a passion
for it yeah exactly because you like for
example for me I made this like
transition into boosting video quality
significantly I think it would be over
the past year and a half I just you know
I have a lot I have even more respect
now for you know the youtubers that you
know spend a lot of time creating their
content because of how much work goes
into it now I god man it's it's just
funny when people complain about every
little thing and I you know what I do is
I laugh at it and I just I respond
something stupid just to be funny about
it because it's very easy like the other
day it's I'm gonna make of this this
like funny thingy so my
my ex-wife my ex-wife reached out the
other day because she wanted to learn
how to do green screen video and so when
I told her everything that she needed to
do and to buy to be able to do a chroma
key she flipped she was like now and I'm
like and I'm like so you remember how
many times we used to fight about the
amount of time that I spent doing the
daily this is why it's not easy if you
require a team of five people you
require a camera guy a scripter is
somebody that edits the host and the
lights guy and this was just me doing
everything and I hate that it's not that
I hate but I I proved that you can do it
with just one person but people don't
know how much work goes behind the scene
just for the video to look like that
yeah you know also sounding terrible
so this mic even with the like like
somehow hangouts is being stupid and
this for as long as we have held this
podcast Google needs to do something but
a seriously it's like blank like
computer is able to take in my viewports
I think this would be stunning very
crisp and fresh but instead I find
myself having to put in another I have
to join the call via and use that as my
audio and then I've had to like switch
around and mute different sources it's
like this is stupid why is this so hard
to do it can't be this hard to do I've
got lovely I think my router is more
drunk than I am right now
well you know what okay if anyone's
keeping score in 2018 there was an
announcement that hangouts is going to
go by the wayside so we're not too sure
what a streaming version of the podcast
will look like
once hangout is no more hangouts is no
more so we'll see what happens I do have
a few ideas on how to evolve the podcast
a little bit it may not necessarily be a
full live episode every single Friday or
rather it might be but it just might be
a release of a video every Friday but
how we do a multi-person podcast for a
video version is something that I'm kind
of I'm kind of mulling it about 20:19 is
going to have a lot to it that I think
is gonna prove to be a good evolution
not only for myself or PocketNow for the
podcast but for everything in general so
we're looking forward to what 2019 has
to has to offer us and I know that like
some people have been saying in the chat
effort equals quali and that's exactly
what we want to do in 2019 there's a lot
of effort that's gonna be put into a lot
of what we do and yeah I mean this is
just the beginning
I mean um let's listen let's let's go
through just a few things real quick we
did talk about the hole punch design
clip single notch we really talked about
that earlier I don't want to get into
yet another discussion where we get
superheated but let's just do like a
quick one sentence reaction to the red
hydrogen one oh my god I am so glad I
didn't review that phone best in 2018 oh
oh my god alright
not the razor not the hydrogen one I'll
tell you that much I only played with
that phone for a couple of minutes I I
play with Michael's Michael Fisher's
unit and I'm like oh my god
I'm not even gonna reach out to their PR
thank you let's just leave and they
should have read if you haven't read
Adam lanes oh my god yeah I know so at
but the problem I feel so sad for Adam
because he actually bought the phone
yeah you know it would like it wasn't a
reviewers perspective it's somebody that
bought the phone that put $1,200 down a
year prior I feel so sad for Adam about
that you know well he was eventually
able to get a refund yeah he did and but
like that was like pulling teeth out
yeah that was just stupid
poorly from hardware to customer service
and just it just wasn't a great
experience for the two years all right
but but you said editors choice like why
don't we start with you with you Jules
like if you had to say age age before
beauty so loaded baby when it comes to
like your preferred either product or
products of 2018 it we've got if we had
to say honestly Nokia 71 it's like this
is coming from a great family of
products that's right there I'm sad have
to return this I'm like really you want
it back all right fine all right cool
they did pretty decent at the camera
control the way you want and then the
fast update their time I don't do it but
if I um okay so I said earlier that I
love like the smart tracking and all
that stuff I have to say that okay my my
personal review of this phone is not
gonna come out until probably after the
new year right before CES because that's
just how timing went as we were talking
about earlier um I have to say that I
have to get I have to tip my hat to take
my hat off I don't even just tip my hat
I just take the whole hat off to one
plus for being able to bring the 60 to
the mass market I'm just like it may not
it may not exactly be the absolute best
phone of the year that's a very
debatable thing yeah well I I just love
what it was but what they've been able
to do with it it's a great phone at us
at a lower price than most that is
available on a carrier that they've been
fighting to get in the US for a long
time
it's literally I do I do with my review
format is like who is this phone for
it's one of the only phones this year
that I could actually say this one's for
everybody because everybody can actually
it's a it's a fantastic thing to say
about a device you can't say that about
Huawei you can't really you can't really
say that about the pixel if you look at
other markets on the other side of the
world now but yeah I think that it's I
think that it's a it's a spectacular
device because of what it brings to the
table because I can bring it to
everybody when it comes to smartphones
for me but but that's your only product
you have anything else that you'd like
to shout out oh um from earlier in the
year as the as one of the gamers I will
say that there's a there's a controller
that I just use all the time not only on
my Android phones but on my PC and on
this laptop as well for for gaming the
8-bit do SF 30 Pro it looks like a
supernova
I need to get that I've heard so many
stories about that yeah it's uh it looks
like a Super Nintendo controller but it
has analog sticks and extra buttons made
for like current games it's a fantastic
product I use it for pretty much any
game that I play at this point - ps4 but
even on the switch it works oh my god
alright so for me before you say
anything that uh Dom Blanco $5 at
superjet you're going to have to look at
this I can't spit yep I'm gonna I'm
gonna butcher this was gonna it says I
made it a little better
give me a rocks thank you for meeting
its own shoot I have so many I think
that 2018 has been the best year for a
lot of things phones being one of them I
can't choose a favorite phone it's the
main reason why we didn't do a series of
favorite products because I would have
to give the the shout out to every like
for example for me favourite phones is a
tie between the Galaxy Note 9 and the
mate 20 Pro those are my favorite
totally perfect totally fair makes
perfect sense
those are like this is like the no holds
bar phone for things I care about like
photography and then this is another
phone that gets photography almost just
as good but it's the note it's the it's
the note that should have always been
since generation 3
finally a refine Galaxy Note that fixes
and just becomes that Vanguard phone
that should have always been um favorite
like it's just funny but if when you
asked me about the oneplus succeed I'm
not gonna say that I don't like it this
is the McLaren I just I really like the
1 plus 6
it had the headphone jack it had like it
was slimmer it was lighter the battery
life was great and so for me like the 1
plus 6 was I liked the 6 more than the
16 that's just but that's a perfect
first that's a personal preference I'm
not saying that it's a for me I would
actually give the crown more to the
sixth in the 60 it's just when I help
when I hold the sticks and I noticed
that it was heavier I'm like God I'm the
guy that will will always complain about
phones getting thinner and lighter and
then this is the first example where I'm
like the six was fine
like you should have just brought the
same design and come up with something
cooler I don't know or do the 10 gigs of
ram or whatever so fine from e26
but then my favorite budget phone would
be the Nokia 7.1 I I think that's like
the best value I already told you that
my favorite gadget was the iPad pro and
then for people that asked me what was
my favorite SmartWatch I hate to admit
it Apple watch series for this is this
it took four generations for Apple to
finally figure it out what the with this
watch should have always been and I feel
that don't buy the aluminum chassis this
would be the first time that I would be
like by the stainless steel this is
actually a watch you want to hold on to
for a bit and sadly the aluminum does an
age well it oxidized over time um you'll
you'll notice it in every single after
the buds that I've done for the Apple
watch right don't recommend the aluminum
for a variant but that's that's been me
like those have been my favorite
products honestly now I get cool you
know what on I feel like on that know we
can go in and call it on there's almost
to our episode of the pocket now weekly
holding two different like things that
one cent
you know what Jules thank you so much
for John
in by the way that was really awesome
that it's great to hear from you so she
hung on our last 2018 episode now one
thing that I did want to say like I am
mr. gratitude and all that like I did
just want to say I mentioned it earlier
on that in 2019 we're looking to evolve
certain things I have some ideas for the
podcast especially just in preparation
for when Hangouts dies because Google
wants to kind of put it aside we'll see
what happens in terms of the streaming
capabilities on YouTube I would love to
still have a live episode every week and
if that's possible we're still gonna do
that I just want to see what options we
have in store but with that in mind I
just want to give a big thanks to just
pocket now XD everybody in particular
that you know after after a big
transition that I made at the be kept
the middle portion of this past year I
found a home here at the pocket not
weekly I just want to thank all of you
guys for having me and I'm very very I
feel very lucky and very privileged to
even be hosting this show and to even be
a part of this team so thank you sorry
are you I'm gonna I'm gonna repeat the
same words that I told you when we were
discussing this I'm like are you kidding
me you're telling me that I get to
recommend Joshua Vergara are you serious
that's gonna be like the coolest thing
ever and so it's funny when when Josh is
like alright I'm totally willing to do
it but if you give me the podcast and
I'm like oh my god it's like it's like
angels triumphs from this all I really
hope is that that recommendation I'm
doing justice to it and getting my feet
wet right now in this new place that I
call home and it's only gonna get better
from here 2019 is gonna be a really
hustle year because partially because
like I said earlier my resolution is to
be selectively social so I'm gonna take
my feet into the sand and actually get
into the Nitty Gritty of everything so
again thank you and look forward to more
and on that note we're gonna say one
more thing from Eddie visalo who has
given us five pounds not five dollars
five pounds what do you guys think is
the best basalis phone this year up
we'll find out new mix three next s from
Viva Linda non-emergent team go for it
find ex
it's such a beautiful phone you can
complain about it all you want that it
bends and whatever I I i thank these
companies I have to thank Chinese
companies like Oppo and and vivo for
just the level of experimentation that
they went through I mean I think that it
was a genius solution the phone feels so
great in the hand that would be me what
about you Josh I wasn't able to use the
slider French by the way yeah i'ma leave
been able to use two of the four phones
that's right here and even though I
agree the find X is a beautiful device I
gotta give it to the throwback the me
makes three that slide is just so much
fun to use and to be able to come up to
somebody and be like I don't know what's
better to say let's take a selfie and
then you hear the whoring and then that
motor happens or you just go snap and
take that picture I don't know what's
cooler I'm kind of gonna give it to the
Munich's three though x-ray is cool like
you could do that with it faster and
it's like mm-hmm I speaking of which I
did just get my me mix three so I'm
looking forward to doing the review on
that I'm actually gonna use that
throughout CES that's my plan
so as long as I get through all the
other phones before that I'll be able to
use that during CES speaking of which
you won't mind look forward to
everything we have coming at CES
including the podcast we have a couple
of things going on actually Jaime and I
might be doing a bit of a road trip from
together yes we should actually do the
next podcast on the road and that canyon
trip that we're doing we could there's a
little bit of a long trip so that
wouldn't make a lot of sense well I have
to we have to so it beat that podcast
