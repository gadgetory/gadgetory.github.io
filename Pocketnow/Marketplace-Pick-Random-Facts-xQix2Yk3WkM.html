partner com and if you're like me you're
the type of person that is always the
one that has the random facts whether it
be about science the world whatever
you're always the type of guy that
people come to for a random factor or
some little gag or something like that
so anyways this program is called random
facts and it's pretty simple all you do
is tap on the little icon here this is
random facts and will actually load a
random fact Vince Lombardi coined the
term game plan ok close that one click
another random fact the first product
Motorola starters develop was a record
player for automobiles at that time the
most known player on the market was the
Victrola so they called themselves
Motorola most likely of course I don't
see how a record player would really
work in a vehicle I mean if you're
moving with the needle bump up and down
anyways click Next go to the next one
Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine our
brothers and sisters I don't know that
well go next I of course as you can see
you will learn a lot from this program
the cool thing about this program is
also does automatically update through
marketplace so if you've gone through
the hundreds of random facts that this
program has already installed in it it
will automatically update itself so just
click another in fact Johnny Carson
Michael Douglas and Clint Eastwood were
all once gas station attendants hmm
never knew that so anyways this program
is pretty simple as you can tell it is
also very cheap it's only 99 cents on
marketplace so random facts is another
marketplace pick where we choose some of
the best and most useful programs on
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
