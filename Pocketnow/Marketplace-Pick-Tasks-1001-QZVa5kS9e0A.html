packing.com and if you're the type of
person that likes to keep an organized
list of your events or chores coming up
then this may be the program for you and
if you're not that type of person then
this program might also be for you
because it will help you keep your life
a little bit more organized so the perm
is called task 1001 and as you can see i
have a list of events here that i need
to get done so i've already done a few
of these ones in the red and they've
already passed so if I want to clear one
of them all i have to do is click on
here and it will either open it up so i
can view all the details and make sure
that i got it all correct hit cancel and
then I just hit complete and the chore
is done so right here it says lunch with
Kate so a cool thing about this program
is you can actually integrate your
contacts in with it so I want to call my
contact all i have to do is click on
this contact button and it will actually
call her so I'm just going to complete
this task because I've already done it
and let's see i already did the work so
i'm just going to go to cancel and
complete that task okay so as you saw i
deleted the task but it actually came
back up and that's because this is a
revolving task so you can actually
assign things to occur every certain day
of the month or any specific day of the
week so i can also have done this task
I'll clear this one complete and I need
to go to the library today so I'm not
going to clear that but I can also go
into some pretty good sorting features
so if we want to sort all my task I can
sort it by priority and as you see work
is the most critical so that went to the
top I can sort it by subject and it will
sort it by the alphabet can sort it by
begin date sort of by end date I can
also sort it in groups so if I have a
specific category I can sort it by that
and as you can see I have different
categories here cleaning friends library
and work so I can also expand them if
I'd like and I can also go to filter and
this allows me to see my active tasks
and completed tasks so I can also go
here and go back to sort because I like
to see the normal list and now I have
all
my other tasks that I've seen that I've
already completed so if I want to create
a new task I just click here on this new
button and a test subject let's see what
do I want to do I need to write an email
to someone okay so click OK and it's
pretty big it's pretty important so I'm
going to click hi and makeba active the
start date will be today click OK and to
link I'm actually going to link it to
one of my contacts and let's see who do
I want to send an email to I'm going to
send it to let's send it to Jeff so
there now I've linked my contact now if
I want to set a reminder just in case I
do forget I could set the hour let's see
I'm going to make it for around eight
o'clock tonight perfect click OK and now
if i want i can add a note so if i
wanted to i can type in his email
address but it's already linked up with
the contact and click ok I need to go
back to filter because I'm already on my
completed test I'm gonna go back to my
active tasks and as you can see it says
right email and it has a little ! next
to it and I can also click on my contact
and as you can see it will show up as
Jeff and this is another marketplace
pick and the program is called task 1001
and the full version does cost six
dollars and ninety-nine cents but you
can download a 15-day trial version and
this is another marketplace pink where
we take some fun and interesting
applications on windows mobile
