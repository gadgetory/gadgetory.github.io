pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to talk about the software on the
AT&amp;amp;T motorola backflip we've already
talked about the motoblur interface and
if you want to see that I'll put a link
up at the end of this video in this
video we're going to talk about the web
browsing experience the settings the
camera performance call quality and
battery life so we're going to go
through all those things now let's start
on by turning on the device and we're
also going to talk about by the way the
keyboard on the back of the touchpad I'm
going to unlock the screen now I'm going
to open up the keyboard and you're going
to see the widgets reflow when I do that
so here goes takes a minute but one of
the great things about the backflip is
that when you reflow the widgets when
you slide out the keyboard the widgets
actually move on the screen and not
become all jumbled and sort of
disorderly other Android devices have a
big problem with this it's really hard
to go from portrait to landscape without
the widget sort of bumping into one
another but here on the backflip they
reflow very nicely ok so let's open the
application tray and we can navigate the
application tray by the way you saw the
little lag of it coming out several ways
obviously we can tap on the icon we want
we can use the d-pad to select or we can
use this touchpad on the back of the
screen to sort of move right left up and
down it's a little bit awkward
especially if you have sort of short
fingers to have to reach around behind
the screen very uncomfortable in some
cases but you get used to it and you can
also select so let's see if I tap in
words sometimes it works sometimes it
doesn't there it goes it will select the
item kind of like a traditional trackpad
on a laptop computer so let's go back
here and open up a program let's go into
the web browser and it looks like I've
already have a page loaded here let's go
to pocket now calm we're over a fast
Wi-Fi network right now so I'm gonna
click go and a note on the keyboard the
keyboard feels a bit awkward to me I
think it's because everything is
everything is spread out so much I'm
going to go back into the key into the
browser
the keys are very spread out and they
also don't have a good bit of tactile
feel it almost feels kind of artificial
not like a real keyboard like you would
get on say the HTC touch pro2 or even
the palm pixi it's not really designed
for ergonomics it's designed for well
designed and to look good and I really
don't like that about it so let me go
back to pocket now calm here we go and
let's see how long that takes over this
Wi-Fi network
okay we're watching the progress bar up
there to see when it's done and take
some more time so i can actually move
around on the screen now a little bit
laggy it doesn't have pinch-to-zoom of
course so you have to use the manual
zoom controls which is a bit annoying
you can also press these arrows here
which will give you this magnifier like
glass but again it's a little bit laggy
not the best browsing experience but
here we can really see how the touchpad
can come in handy you can reach around
the back and sort of just swipe down the
page like so the idea behind the
touchpad is that you don't have to put
your fingers on the screen to scroll but
I think that's kind of silly because
when I'm scrolling I'm not reading
anything on the screen i don't care if i
cover anything up its when it stops that
i want to read the text on the screen so
i don't think it really makes sense to
have the trackpad and even after getting
used to it and using it a lot it just
it's not something that i use i much
rather you know use the d-pad here or
even flip it into portrait which takes a
little too long and just manually swipe
with my finger like you would do on any
other smartphone so let's click on a
link and sort of drill into this website
see how long things take
overall it's a capable web browser it's
just a little bit slow and to give you
an idea of how slow it is and maybe this
is an unfair comparison let's take out
the google nexus one which of course has
a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon processor a lot
more RAM and it's an overall much better
tune device with a newer version of
Android but just for comparative
purposes just for fun let's let's do
this so here we are with these browsers
side by side they have different browser
layouts because they're different
versions of android and let's go to say
let's go to engadget's homepage so we'll
type en and we're going use the
on-screen keyboard this time here they
are and one two three okay and this came
up extremely fast almost instantly
although it seemed like it was cashed so
let's go to a page Sony's ultra concept
camera ultra-compact concept camera and
you can really tell the difference in
screen resolution here the the backflip
has 480 down and 320 across whereas the
nexus one is 800 down and 480 across so
you get to see a lot more on the screen
at one time so let's click on this one
down here okay that loaded almost
instantly this wasn't too far behind so
we can flick down we can flick down it
seems that the scrolling of the google
nexus one is obviously faster and you've
probably noticed by now how much more
clear the nexus one looks then the the
backflip and that's of course because
the nexus one has an AMOLED screen but
let's not do that comparison any longer
it doesn't really make sense to compare
apples to oranges here okay so let's get
out of this browser and by the way just
like with any other Android browser you
can click on new window you can see
multiple windows open at one time but
you saw how cruddy that a man that
animation was it doesn't really handle
multitasking of browser windows very
well so I'm going to get out of this and
let's go into some other things so let's
go into the settings menu and see what
we have there there's actually a CPU
throttling feature and I'm going to zoom
in on the screen save a better view okay
so we can weave standard android stuff
here like managed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and call settings ringtones display and
security let's go in there and see what
we have
so if screen timeout orientation so we
can have the accelerometer automatically
switched the the screen rotation show
anime animation when opening and closing
windows definitely want to keep that off
it helps to increase the performance
just a little bit backtrack I'm not sure
what that is I think it's probably
pressing the back button will go into
the previous applications that you are
working in we have brightness and it
does have automatic brightness although
right now for some reason it was down
all the way very strange I think that's
because I changed the power mode visible
passwords kind of standard stuff let's
get into the the battery settings this
is where you can do a little bit of CPU
throttling so battery profile that's not
what I wanted here we go we in a
performance mode smart mode and battery
saver mode I've tested all of these
modes I can't tell much of the
difference between these two modes but
when i go from battery battery saver
mode to performance mode the battery
life goes down a lot and the performance
doesn't really increase that much which
doesn't really make sense overall
keeping this on performance mode you get
about a day and a half of battery life
out of this which is quite good for a
smartphone especially smartphone with a
lot of back lights especially for the
keyboard and these buttons down here so
pretty good with with battery life in
terms of quality I found call quality to
be fantastic the speakerphone was very
loud and very clear in fact probably
more loud and clear than some of the
higher-end HTC devices that we've tested
at maximum volume the speaker phone did
not distort which is really refreshing
to see let's take a look to see if we
have any other noteworthy applications
here one of the theories on why this
device doesn't have Android to point our
2.1 whichever one has the google
navigation is because 18t wants to
continue to push their AT&amp;amp;T Navigator
service the word on the street is that
this suit will soon get an upgrade to
the newest version of Android so if
you're considering the back foot know
that you will be able to get an upgrade
in the near future and let's go into the
photo gallery application I've taken a
few photos here and of course we can
flip into a landscape hopefully it'll go
there we go there's always a lag and
going into
scape so we can swipe to the right
pretty smooth zooming isn't so smooth so
if we tap slow it's choppy doesn't look
too good of course we can't do
multi-touch because it doesn't have
multi touch capability so you get the
idea there you can swipe and swipe and
go through all the pictures and
sometimes you get that throw animation I
think when you go all the way to the
left side you get a little funky
animation there so that was just a quick
look at the software on the motorola
backflip overall it's pretty much a
basic android install with some motorola
and AT&amp;amp;T stuff slapped on top in terms
of performance and web browsing it's not
so great it's not up there with some of
the other higher-end android phones but
i don't think that the backflip is
intended to be a high-end android phone
that set it has great call quality in as
good battery life and it's only 99 bucks
on AT&amp;amp;T if you are getting a new
two-year contract so it's an affordable
device that works generally well unless
you're looking for something that's
really high performing and really has
the wow factor so that was a look at the
software on the motorola backflip that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
