pocket now calm and this is a usability
speed test of the Apple iPhone Adam Lane
did a similar speed test with the treo
800w and found everything to be quite
fest so I'm going to do the same test on
the iphone and see how long the same
exact tasks that he did take on this
device so the first thing that we're
going to do is switch between the email
calendar and contacts application from
the off position using any means
possible so I'm going to do that now I'm
going to turn it on I'm going to switch
between mail contacts and calendar ready
set go slide unlock mail contacts
calendar stop and of course there's a
screen animation on everything that you
do on the iphone so that takes seconds
to show up on the screen now the next
test is to launch an application that is
buried somewhere in the interface and on
the iPhone applications really aren't
buried anywhere I mean they're all
placed on the home screen and sometimes
they're just a flick away on the other
pain but you know if we were to do that
test let's let's do it now I'm going to
launch Google Maps BAM it's there well
you got to wait for the screen animation
and everything to render on the screen
but it's pretty much instant I mean
there's no digging through menus the
next thing we're going to do is open up
a favorite from the home screen and
again this is somewhere that the iphone
really excels since a software update
that allows you to place an icon for a
website right on your home screen it
made it very easy to make a whole page
full of favorites so that one of your
home screen panels actually becomes your
favorites list so if I'm on the home
screen and I want to launch
pocketnow.com i click on pocketnow.com
and you know depending on what kind of
connection you're on it's it's going to
be loaded on the screen so the iphone
definitely excels there ok the next test
that Adam did was to launch the media
player and play a playlist now I've set
my home screen if i do a double tap for
it to go right to the ipod i don't think
that's cheating I mean this is part of
the usability test but I
think it's going to be a little faster I
want to play the coldplay CD the new one
vie de la vida so let me get the screen
brightness back on here okay ready set
go here we are there we go that was
pretty fast ok now I'm going to try to
add a new contact and what you'll find
is that the iphone keyboard works really
well with day-to-day text entry but when
it comes down to writing names that that
aren't built into the dictionary you're
slow down a little bit because the
iphone can't guess what you're trying to
say and kind of you know put the word in
there for you so to add this contact i
am going to use this specified
information so we have you know John Doe
1 2 3 4 anywhere street and so on and so
forth just so that I'm not entering any
old information something that's
actually prescribed here let's ready go
+ button sometimes is not responsive for
some reason there goes
John Doe save now we're going to have
three phone numbers I'm going to set
this to the work number add another
phone number it's very easy to add phone
numbers on the iphone set this to the
main number and one more leave is the
mobile number okay that's good when we
go down at email address so we are at
example at test.com good go down to add
new address so we are at one two three
four any where street city is nowhere
California zip code is 99 999 save okay
and we are done press the state done now
and now for the final test I want to go
back in and email John Doe who I've just
created a new contact for so I'm going
to start by I'll say go in a second I'll
go into the mail application start
typing his name and then I'll tell him
the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
brown dog Ready Set get in position here
go john2 ando subject tests and then
let's go the quick brown fox jumped over
the lazy brown dog and the accuracy is
fantastic dog and send and it's sent
there we go so the iphone is really
great at doing one test quickly it's
when you're multitasking that you run
into problems so if you're trying to go
from writing an email to going to the
internet and checking you know stock
price and going back to the maps and
checking where the nearest pizza parlor
is that takes a lot of time because
these screen animations are just so
time-consuming
and often times when you click on an
application you get a blank screen for a
few seconds until anything comes up and
that applies to you know really even the
settings menu the animation occurs and
then things show up on the screen and
that's just many seconds of delay
whereas in Windows Mobile everything's
just so much faster so i will look up
the numbers of how long each of these
tasks took i'll compare them to adams
results and if you think your smartphone
can do it faster or if you have a treo
800w or an iphone or any other device
and you think you can do things faster
than you've seen then post a video
response or let us know in the comments
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
