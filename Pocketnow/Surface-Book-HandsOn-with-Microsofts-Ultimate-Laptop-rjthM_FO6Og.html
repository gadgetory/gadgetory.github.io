PocketNow
but when Microsoft says it's built the
ultimate laptop and then repeats the
claim about 15 times
we're duty-bound to take a look for
pocket now I'm Michael Fisher with Adam
Lane behind the camera this is the
Microsoft Surface book what if we could
do for laptops what we did for tablets
that's the question Microsoft asked
itself and the answer is the surface
book it's the surface as a laptop but
it's still a surface what the hell does
that mean well you can still separate
the display from the keyboard to get a
self-contained 7.7 millimeter Windows
tablet and most of the surface
capabilities we've seen both today and
up till now remain intact but with the
surface book the lower half plays a
crucial part in providing power it's not
just a keyboard it provides a boatload
of patter ease good for 12 hours of
usage and it also brings a dedicated
NVIDIA GeForce graphics processor backed
up by gddr5 Ram an awful lot of
engineering went into the surface book
keeping it together in its docked
configuration is a tether known as
muscle wire which changes elasticity
when you introduce a charge to it
locking the whole assembly in place or
releasing it so you can separate the
units between the modules is a really
funky looking piece of hardware called
the dynamic foe Crum hinge meant to
offer more space between the top of the
keyboard and the display the keyboard
itself was engineered for extreme
comfort microsoft says it spent the past
15 years making keyboard switches so it
knows a thing or two about delivering a
quiet comfortable typing experience
these keys are backlit and offer one
point six millimeters of travel if
you're curious and the five point
multi-touch trackpad is all glass up top
the display uses the same pixel Sense
technology we talked about in the
surface pro for hands on on a larger
scale it's a 13.5 inch touch panel
optically bonded to a sheet of Gorilla
Glass 4 less than half a millimeter
thick and delivering 267 PPI most of the
user experience from Windows 10 to the
various pen and touch input methods is
vintage surface but here it's been
kicked up a few notches
Microsoft was demoing 3d design software
here on stage in New York and high-end
video editing the surface book is a
laptop for the power iasts of power
users a device Microsoft calls ounce for
ounce the fastest 13-inch laptop ever
made it's a direct competitor to Apple's
MacBook Pro and Microsoft says it's two
times faster or more powerful the
thinnest most powerful PC ever created
those are some bold claims for a company
that's never built a laptop before but
given the success of the surface line
since last year you'd be a fool to count
them out right at the start you'll be
able to pre-order a surface book as of
October 7th and buy them outright
October 26th with prices starting at
1499 dollars will save one get a hold of
one to give it a full review no promises
though this is just an early hands-on
from the Windows 10 devices event in New
York City folks stay tuned to pocket now
for further coverage and other surface
products the new Lumias the new band and
everything else
Microsoft is showing off today until
next time this has been Michael Fisher
with Adam Lane behind the camera thanks
for watching and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
