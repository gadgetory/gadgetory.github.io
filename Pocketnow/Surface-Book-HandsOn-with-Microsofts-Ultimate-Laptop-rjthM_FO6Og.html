now but when microsoft says it's built
the ultimate laptop and then repeats the
claim about 15 times we're duty-bound to
take a look for pocket now i'm michael
fisher with adam lane behind the camera
this is the Microsoft Surface book what
if we could do for laptops what we did
for tablets that's the question
Microsoft asked itself and the answer is
the surface book it's the surface as a
laptop but it's still a surface what the
hell does that mean well you can still
separate the display from the keyboard
to get a self-contained 7.7 millimeter
Windows tablet and most of the surface
capabilities we've seen both today and
up till now remain intact but with the
surface book the lower half plays a
crucial part in providing power it's not
just a keyboard it provides a boatload
of patter is good for 12 hours of usage
and it also brings a dedicated nvidia
geforce graphics processor backed up by
gddr5 ram an awful lot of engineering
went into the surface book keeping it
together in its docked configuration is
a tether known as muscle wire which
changes elasticity when you introduce a
charge to it locking the whole assembly
in place or releasing it so you can
separate the units between the modules
is a really funky looking piece of
hardware called the dynamic volcra minge
meant to offer more space between the
top of the keyboard and the display the
keyboard itself was engineered for
extreme comfort microsoft says it spent
the past 15 years making keyboard
switches so it knows a thing or two
about delivering a quiet comfortable
typing experience these keys are backlit
and offer one point six millimeters of
travel if you're curious and the 5-point
multi-touch trackpad is all glass up top
the display uses the same pixel Sense
technology we talked about in the
surface pro 4 hands on on a larger scale
it's a 13.5 inch touch panel optically
bonded to a sheet of Gorilla Glass 4
less than half a millimeter thick and
delivering 267 ppi most of the user
experience from Windows 10 to the
various pen and touch input methods is
vintage surface but here it's been
kicked up a few notches Microsoft was
demo
3d design software here on stage in New
York and high-end video editing the
surface book is a laptop for the power
east of power users a device Microsoft
calls ounce for ounce the fastest
13-inch laptop ever made it's a direct
competitor to Apple's MacBook Pro and
microsoft says it's two times faster or
more powerful the thinnest most powerful
PC ever created those are some bold
claims for a company that's never built
a laptop before but given the success of
the surface line since last year you'd
be a fool to count them out right at the
start you'll be able to pre-order a
surface book as of October 7th and buy
them outright October 26th with prices
starting at 14 hundred ninety-nine
dollars will save when get a hold of one
to give it a full review no promises
though this is just an early hands-on
from the windows 10 devices event in new
york city folks stay tuned to pocket now
for further coverage and other surface
products the new lumias the new band and
everything else microsoft is showing off
today until next time this has been
michael fisher with adam lane behind the
camera thanks for watching and we'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
