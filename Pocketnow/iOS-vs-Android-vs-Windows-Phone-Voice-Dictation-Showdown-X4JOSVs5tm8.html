for some a novelty for others and some
people don't even know it's built into
their phone but it's an important enough
feature that Google Microsoft and Apple
have each built a version of it into
their platforms so today we're gonna do
an informal head ed comparison to see
how they measure up I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow and this is voice
dictation showdown between iOS Android
and Windows Phone now we're not talking
about virtual assistants like Google now
Siri or s voice here with this video
we're just comparing how the different
platforms deal with translating voice
input to text like if you're dictating
an email or a text message for this test
we're using an early 2012 iPad running
the latest version of iOS a Google Nexus
7 running the latest version of Android
jelly bean and a Nokia Lumia 920 running
the latest version of Windows Phone 8
all three are running on the same
wireless network of the three only
androids offering can run without a
network connection both iOS and Windows
Phone need connectivity for voice
dictation to work all three of these
platforms feature a key toggle on the
keyboard to activate voice dictation
down here on Android it is next to the
space bar it's also located next to the
space bar on iOS and on Windows Phone
once you enter a text field the voice
dictation button becomes illuminated
down in the bottom row under the
keyboard so we've got three blank emails
ready here let's just try and hit these
devices with a common sentence and see
how it goes
the PocketNow weekly podcast is the best
podcast ever I think it often features
brandon anton and me this is a shameless
plug see how this goes as you can see
i'm good and stop the dictation there
sorry as you can see Android dictates is
the only one which dictates live the
other two devices need to talk to the
network and let's see how they did
first with Android no it's got some
interesting capitalization on Pocket now
for the record the N has not capitalized
the way we do it but it's interesting
that it recognized it as one word I
think it often features Brendan Anton
and main this is a shameless plug
tailors ghost as you can see yes indeed
all right well that's fine and what
about this in iOS the pocket now weekly
podcast is the best podcast ever I think
it often features Brennan antenori this
is a shameless plug it was good as you
can see compared to Android a much more
accurate result from iOS and on Windows
Phone the pocket now weekly podcast is
the best podcast ever I think it I think
it often features Brendan Anton and me
this is a shameless plug pretty good you
get the idea with all three of these
devices but as you can see not a lot
going on in punctuation these are just
kind of solid blocks of text so from a
punctuation standpoint these platforms
all handle it relatively similarly
Windows Android and iOS do not add any
punctuation Windows Phone tries to add a
little bit of punctuation where it
thinks it might be appropriate putting a
period at the end of that sentence there
so let's see what happens when we try to
add some punctuation manually the pocket
now weekly podcast is the best podcast
ever , I think period it often features
Brandon comma Anton comma and me period
this is a shameless plug exclamation
point
as you can see Windows Phone opted not
to let us finish a point which I'm going
to address in a second but let's bring
up Android Android here the pocket no
offense Rebecca ever comma I think
period and it doesn't get often really
but there's the commas between Brennan
and town on me and it didn't really get
the end of the sentence there but the
exclamation point is present
how about iOS doc in our weekly podcast
is the best podcast ever I think it
often features Brennan and on me this is
a plug our nice exclamation point is
press
so is the rest of it and windows found
not exactly bringing the heat with the
punctuation just putting in the words
for commas and of irritating so since it
is the punctuation problem child here
let's ask Windows Phone a question
it adds question marks in the simplest
of scenarios but fails with anything
more complex what do you want it's added
a question mark automatically there but
let's say we do this one wouldn't you
rather go to the store no question mark
on the end of that very obvious sentence
so from a punctuation standpoint Windows
Phone gets points for trying to
interpret it organically but it fails in
the execution iOS and Android are much
more useful for punctuation Laden
sentences even though inputting
punctuation this way is pretty awkward
still it's nice to have the option now
let's test hang time or how long the app
will allow you to wait in between
phrases we saw this with Windows Phone
just a second ago
but let's try a sentence here where
we're thinking about what to say make
sure to buy a nexus 7 and iPad Mini and
oh I don't know an HP ZD 8000 may be a
less suitable example than the real
world example we just showed but as you
can see Windows Phone make sure to buy
an extra 7 and I've had many and I'll I
don't know not the best translation
there as Android even got the HP brand
name correct for that very old computer
I'm telling somebody to buy and iOS well
not quite as good at divining what I was
trying to say but it definitely waited
for me to complete this sentence so as
you can see you better know what you
want to say to
does phone before you say it it has no
patience for your dithering Apple and
iOS give you much longer listening times
comparatively on the radio it's noisy as
heck in here I sure wish I were in a
quiet country home with only cats for
company
wait that's not true at all
Android well Android wants to curse
that's interesting
fairly accurate iOS says well iOS has a
really hard time dealing with any kind
of background noise apparently and
Windows Phone
yeah Windows Phone didn't wait for us to
finish I'm not surprised
had enough of this me too that's enough
of that calamity of course noise
cancellation depends as much on your
hardware's noise cancellation features
as on the software so of course your
mileage will vary in that respect next
what we want to do is a quick context
and syntax test with various forms of
words in the same sentence we're talking
about there there your your things like
that so whether the weather be cold or
whether the weather be hot will be
together whatever the weather whether we
like it or not
well Android thought that maybe some of
those weathers might be applicable in
some circumstances it didn't get them
all right but it definitely tried its
best with that difficult tongue twister
what about iOS iOS got the grammar
perfectly on the weather weather test
and Windows Phone which surprisingly let
us finish Windows Phone also scoring
perfectly on that interpretive test
let's try another if you're going to
bring your umbrella there your clothes
will be better protected than their
clothes will there's that first year the
second your third your and they're the
only thing you got wrong was the then
and their confusion and can we correct
that and yes it gives us the option to
correct it very good job Android how
about iOS well very nice it didn't get
clubs and it didn't get there but we can
do the tap to autocorrect and we can
change it to them that's very
pretty good performance they're not
quite as nice but acceptable with a few
Corrections and windows phone windows
phone also mistaking my them then for
them and we can very quickly do an
autocorrect there and also asking a
question at the end but overall not too
bad all these devices do know a little
bit better than some humans about the
importance of then then your your there
there etc and finally we'd like to see
what happens when I slur my words a bit
dropping the careful diction that some
of you like and some detest will also
mix in a proper name again to mess
things up so first with proper diction
Jaime Rivera hosts the PocketNow daily a
once a day program about technology you
should watch well let's see if Android
got high mais name it did not I mean hi
Matt Rivera host the pocket not daily
once the day program about technology
you should watch alright so not too bad
hi may being a difficult name to
pronounce apparently for voice dictation
but it's an easy fix
hi i OS however knows who Jaime Rivera
is no wonder it's his favorite platform
host the pocket now daily a once a day a
program about technology you should
watch very nice
and what about Windows Phone Windows
Phone turning our friend Jaime into an
Australian hi mate Rivera hosts the
pocket na daily I wanted a program about
technology you should watch ok so there
that is let's see what happens when we
put in a whole lot less effort
Jaime Rivera hosts the pocket now daily
a once a day program about technology
you should watch hi Mara there's a hosta
talk about daily I wanted a program
about technology you should watch
obviously less accuracy there as I
slurred just a little bit and sounded
like a dejected teenager
I mean Rivera posts the pocket now delay
one said one today program okay so iOS
also losing some accuracy there but not
too much and Windows Phone hi am I right
how is the packing now Delia wanted a
program about technology you should
watch all three platforms having some
difficulty with that slurred speech so
the moral of the story speak clearly
when you are dictating so as always
which platforms are best at a specific
task depends on the task here though the
differences are pretty stark if you know
what you want to say and you can make it
brief Windows Phone is just okay it
doesn't get punctuation well at all even
though it tries harder at interpreting
your punctuation without you having to
come right out and say it
and it will cut you off if you stop for
a breath which is very frustrating it's
easily the most frustrating and least
capable of the bunch but it does do a
couple things well Android and iOS are
the clear winners here they're smart
adaptable and useful with very little
functionality differences between them
the biggest difference is androids
ability to function off network that
won't matter for some but if you're a
frequent flyer who likes to annoy his
seat mates by dictating long letters on
an airplane or if you like verbally
composing email drafts while waiting for
a train in the subway Android is
definitely the way to go and in terms of
raw ability it comes out on top
in this informal head-to-head that's
going to do it for our informal voice
dictation showdown if you liked the
video throw us a thumbs up here if you
have a comment you want to leave some
feedback do so on the post at

pocket now tweet is the official account
you can follow me on twitter i'm at
captain two phones it's captain the
number two phones make sure and stay
tuned for a lot more video and editorial
content on iOS Android Windows Phone
every mobile device there is in the days
and weeks ahead once again thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you next
