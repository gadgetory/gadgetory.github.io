pocketnow.com
and this is the hardware tour of the HP
mini netbook the 1151 n are to be exact
that's running on Verizon Wireless is a
video network and this is among the
first batch of netbooks that are being
subsidized by carriers in this case
Verizon so that you can use wireless
internet whether you're in the back of a
taxicab or at the park or anything like
that so let's take a look at the
hardware on the HP Mini it's a good
thing that they include this cleaning
cloth in the HP mini box because the
front cover is a fingerprint magnet I
think it helps a bit that it has a nice
little texture to it or this this swirly
design but it does pick up a lot of
fingerprints but it also makes it look
quite nice and Sheen when it's sitting
on the tabletop so let's go around the
device here on the front we have the
power button which lights up but
unfortunately it's awkwardly placed down
here it's a little difficult to push
over it takes a lot of pressure and it
would have been it would have been much
nicer if they put the power button
inside the netbook when you open it so
that you didn't have to reach your thumb
down here here we have two status lights
to the right of that is the Wi-Fi switch
and it also will turn on and off the all
of the wireless connections so if you
want to save some battery life or you're
going on an airplane you would use that
going over to the other side we have the
SD port or SD card reader so you can
take that out and put in some memory to
the right of that is the USB port and it
is one of two there are two USB ports on
the HP Mini and to the right of that
there is a port for the HP Mini mobile
drive bay I don't think I'll be using
that but if you use their proprietary
product you can use that port for that
go over to the back we can see the hinge
which is kind of in an aluminum like
color to the other side we have the
power port to the right of that is the
USB port there's a little vent there's a
fan inside that goes on the red of that
is for the video out and you need a
special adapter to do this to convert it
to a standard VGA cable but it's good
that it has a video out to the right of
that is the microphone although it has
an integrate
microphone as you'll see in a second and
the headphone jack to the right of that
is a standard Ethernet port if you're
not using wireless covered by a rubber
cover so let's open up the mini and the
mini isn't secured by anything except
its own weight so there's no magnet that
I can tell or there's no latch you just
lift it up and there it is now one of
the best parts of the HP Mini netbooks
is the use of of the space to make the
keyboard as big as possible it goes from
edge to edge the keys are a nice size it
takes a little bit of getting used to
and they also have a little Ridge on
them if you can see so that it's easy to
kind of feel them with your fingers the
touch pad is a pretty good size it's
kind of small naturally for a netbook
you can turn on and off the touchpad
with this button and the buttons being
on the left and on the right isn't too
difficult you get used to it pretty fast
and of course you can easily scroll if
you slide your finger along these dotted
lines here now the screen is 10.1 inches
diagonal and it's got a nice flush look
to it other netbooks do not have a flush
screen so it's much appreciated to have
that up here's the webcam and there's a
little light next to it and a microphone
next to it so that if you want to do a
Skype call or something like that you
can use the built-in webcam the
resolution is 1024 across by 576 down
which is quite low I recommend you use
Google Chrome as your browser because
that takes advantage of as much screen
space as possible by taking away the
status bar on the bottom some other
netbooks out there such as the dell mini
10 v has much higher resolution 13 36 by
I think 768 which really makes a
difference but the most standard
resolution is what this netbook has so
you have to expect that with a netbook
that you're not gonna have a super high
res screen and so that's pretty much it
for the hardware tour of the HP Mini
1151 and are on the Verizon Wireless
Network wish it didn't pick up so many
finger prints
coming up next we're going to do speed
tests we're going to talk about what
it's like to use the e video connection
how long it takes to connect and how
fast the speeds are and then we're going
to compare this to the red fly which is
a Windows Mobile companion that has been
around for a while and people are
starting to say why would you spend you
know two hundred dollars on a red fly
when you could spend two hundred three
hundred dollars on a netbook well we'll
try to answer that question in that
video so that's it for now for more on
Windows Mobile and other mobile
