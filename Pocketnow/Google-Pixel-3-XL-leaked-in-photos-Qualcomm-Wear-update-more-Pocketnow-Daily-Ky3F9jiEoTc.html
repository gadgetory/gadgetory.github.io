Excel along with the accessories that
might come in the box
snapchat doesn't seem to be having a
good time with users but it is with
revenue and save-the-date Qualcomm is
having an event all about smartwatches
on September 10th I'm Jaime Rivera and
that prepare set your calendars set your
alarms tomorrow is Galaxy unpacked and
we've got a lot of coverage coming this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals of definitely
finding these for Apple products is
difficult but back-to-school just
reached Best Buy
depending on what product you're looking
for either Macs or iPads or anything you
currently can get up to $200 off but
obviously the list includes some
conditions so you can learn more about
everything in the description now let's
talk about Qualcomm as the company has
just sent out press invitations for an
event to happen on September 10th where
we seem to be getting new SmartWatch
updates I guess we have been waiting for
updates and upgrades to the current
processors and just not everything that
has to do with the internals of
smartwatches I think for two years I
mean until the point where we haven't
really even seen new smartwatches in
that amount of time that we care about
when it comes to Android wear would be
where OS now etc stay tuned I'm
definitely living forward to this
now let's not the spotlight over to
Samsung one thing that I do have to
admire from this company is how much it
invests when it comes to R&amp;amp;D and just
development of products so the company
has just made it official it's investing
22 billion dollars when it comes to
things like chips displays obviously we
hear everything about foldable this
place coming and everything but probably
one of the most interesting investments
is AI we hear that there's a probability
of updates to its smartphone lineup that
will include a heavy push when it comes
to AI so hopefully we get to see
something and unpacked we'll see now
let's move the spotlight over to my
least favorite app which would be
snapchat but I know my son loves it and
I know that it is very famous when it
comes to people that are a lot younger
than me think about it is the company is
not celebrating the fact that it's lost
3 million users in 3 months and it's
attributing this to the fact that it had
a recent redesign which I still don't
understand
but yeah these are changes that
apparently are affecting that amount of
users now what it's not complaining
about is revenue apparently it's 44% up
when it comes to that so for those of
you didn't know you're the product you
now know and finally the hot news today
have to do with the Google pixel 3
Excellus we've got it leaked in photos
apparently in a box where this box
includes the pixel 3 Excel what that
huge knotch looks horrible in addition
to the asymmetrical chin at the bottom
that includes a speaker that doesn't
match the earpiece then we also see the
back that's beautifully in glass that's
also nice but then the accessories in
the box are interesting there's an
alternative to the pixel buds it seems
that's the reason why it looks credible
we also see the typical dongle and
everything but the reason why I'm saying
credible or not is because there are
rumors on Twitter that all this is a
fake and Google is using this to just
you know move us away from the real deal
let us know in the comments what do you
think do you think that this is the real
deal or not in my case it looks real to
me but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends

earlier follow us on pocketnow.com and
subscribe to our channels both English
and Spanish for more videos like this
one you can follow me on twitter honey
underscore that are on instagram at high
metal data please give this video a
