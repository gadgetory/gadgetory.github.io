you want to get your hands on a 1 plus
60 now is the time it is finally on sale
this is probably now dot-com / 1 + 60
for more information the link is in the
description we have more teasers of the
Samsung Galaxy F or X which we are
expecting to see this week it looks like
the iPhone 10 R is outperforming even
the iPhone 10 s antennas max in certain
benchmarks and if you have a 1 + 6 and
you want to get your hands on the new
features of the 60 the next update is
just arrived I'm high memory data from
Studio number 2 it is Monday and I
actually started this morning recording
a video my god so productive
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals up to a
certain degree if you want to get your
hands on an iPhone 8 or an iPhone 8 plus
which are actually the iPhones that
we're currently recommending most given
the bang for a buck if you call it that
way what Apple is now offering these for
$100 off but obviously there's a catch
these are refurbished so yeah you end up
paying like 500 bucks for the 8 600
bucks for the 8 plus I still find them
overpriced but I would pay this instead
of what you get for the 10s for example
now let's talk about oneplus the company
has proven that they can do software
updates right if you currently hold the
1 + 6 and you rather should I mean I
feel that this phone is still phenomenal
still greats a little better than some
other phones out there well there is
oxygen OS 9 point 0.2 which brings
pretty much most of the things that we
see on the oneplus 60 like for example
the new gesture navigation the new
nightscape and photography and a lot of
the things that we're teased in the
event are now available so again just
hit software up they didn't enjoy and
speaking of software updates let's talk
about Apple those of you that ended up
breaking your Apple watch with watch OS
5.1 version 5.1.1 is now out to fix the
problem but bear in mind it's not that
it'll fix your current bricked Apple
watch now those of you that didn't
update like in my case you can now
update and avoid the bricking and for
those of you that ended up having issues
you sadly have to go to an Apple store
and get a new watch
so yeah getting a new watch is great but
pretty much consider that what you're
currently holding is a dud now let's
talk about Apple one more time
particularly when it comes to the iPhone
10 are I have barely touched that phone
once and I could care less about it but
according to benchmarks you should
consider this phone more than even the
10s in the 10s max speeds are the same
but when it comes to battery life the
iPhone 10 are ended up outperforming the
iPhone 10 by like 20 minutes when it
comes to battery life the 10s re and
then in the case of the tennis max 30 to
45 minutes more battery life than the
tennis max so yeah you get those
benefits think about it as Apple has a
really not been selling as many iPhone
10 ours as well predictions were and so
the company is no longer even a
trillion-dollar company valuation is
down because of that low performance so
yeah and finally the hot news today have
to do with foldable phones we don't know
if we should call the galaxy X or galaxy
F whatever the case may be the company
has just published a little teaser where
we see the Samsung logo completely
folded as if it were a book and I'm not
gonna lie I am really excited for what I
see the developer conference is just
about to happen stay tuned we're
definitely gonna be covering it but let
us know the questions I mean what do you
think are you excited about this
foldable whatever its gonna be or not
cuz I know a lot of people are skeptical
I am to a certain degree because uh
first generation products are never
great but man we've been hearing about
this foldable Samsung whatever thingy
for the past half decade something like
let's just get it over with I just want
to see that now leave us a comment down
