pocketnow.com and this is a comparison
video between upper mobile 9.5 and the
new version of skyfire that works on vga
and qvga windows mobile touchscreen
devices before skyfire only worked on
non touch screen windows mobile devices
now for those that don't know skyfire
renders the website server side at
skyfire servers then sends it down to
your device whereas the opera mobile 9.5
renders the webpage right on your device
so I'm going to first launch both of
them and see how long they take and they
are both out of program memory as you
can see here so I'm going to go into
programs and let's do upper browser
first
okay pretty fast that was about five
seconds and let's get out of here and do
skyfire
now scoff I was going to take a little
bit longer because it has to connect to
the server first and there it is at
about 11 seconds so it's about two times
slower in getting launched but as you're
going to see it's it's much faster in
coming up with web pages so let's do
cnet com pretty complex web page has
some flash content and skyfire can
display flash whereas upper mobile
cannot
and boom there it is instantly almost
ten seconds and sky fire you can move
around the page just like you do an
opera mobile and to zoom in you
DoubleTap sounds familiar that's how
opera mobile works and you can zoom out
just by doing that let's take a look at
YouTube and as I mentioned we can see
youtube videos right on the screen
because it has flash support youtube com
+ reset start that
and it's done that was 10 seconds again
and let's go to a video and i'm going to
show you video playing right in the
browser so i press play
well there it is you get the point with
sound and all now let me show you up or
a mobile 9.5 doing the same things ok so
we had cnet com
and we're done that was 30 seconds if
you remember skyfire did it in ten
seconds so much lower there and then
let's do youtube com clear that hope
that didn't work
and there comes it's almost done and
it's pretty much done by now what we'll
call it done so that was about 24
seconds again skyfire did it in about 10
seconds and opera mobile did it much
slower so if you are running with a
windows mobile touchscreen device i
highly recommend that you go on and
download skyfire it's a free download as
is opera mobile 9.5 beta you can get it
by going to get that skyfire calm on
your windows mobile device and I think
you'll really enjoy the speedy internet
