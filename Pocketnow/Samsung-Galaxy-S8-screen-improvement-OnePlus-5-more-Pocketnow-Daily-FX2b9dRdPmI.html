with major display improvements and iPad
without vessels could be in the works
according to some new reports and we
already begin to hear about the
successors of the one plus three I'm hi
Natalie vana and even though I
constantly complain about Mondays this
is probably one of those that I won't
complain about this is pocket out daily
the official news today began with deals
if you are in the market for a new
computer or a tablet that can replace
your laptop more specifically Microsoft
is currently dropping the price tag on
the surface lineup for black friday in
an insane way we're talking about four
and a dollar discount for the surface
pro 4 430 bucks for the surface book
that is a crazy price tag and I love my
surface pro 4 and for those of you that
are in the market for a phone that is a
constantly updated in android HTC takes
the cake with that after LG the company
does a great job and we've got some
trusted sources claiming that HTC will
be updating the HTC 10 2 nougat as of
this month so if you already have an HTC
10 or you're in the market for a good
smartphone that is as good as it gets
actually now sorry about 1 plus we've
heard the rumors of the oneplus 3p that
the company might launch soon but even
more interesting is what's going to
happen next year as a we've got sources
claiming that the company is going to
skip on the one plus 4 moniker mainly
because of the bad luck that's provided
by number 4 in certain cultures
apparently we're going to be getting the
one plus 5 snapdragon 830 processor or
another variant with up to 8 gigabytes
of ram and other crazy stuff that you
learn more on the link in the
description now its will to spotlight
over to Apple as we've got some other
rumors that talk about what to expect
for the iPad it seems that we have a 9.7
inch iPad coming in in addition to an
iPad Mini Pro and apparently the
interesting part of that 9.7 inch iPad
is that this place going to change into
a ten point nine inch display now one of
these tablets going to be announced is
really hard to predict we're expecting
that to be around March April as for
every iPad lineup we will keep you
posted as soon as we learn more and
finally the very interesting news they
have to do with the samsung galaxy s 8
believe it or not we hear that samsung
is working on providing as a
pressure-sensitive display and that we
know
sit on the pixel we've got a launcher
that now allows you to press and hold on
any of the icons and you get new
contextual icons and things you can do
with things apparently that's something
that Samsung is bringing obviously with
the hardware but you know it leads me to
the question of the day do you think
that the pressure sensitive display is
something that should happen or do you
think that it's a gimmick because to be
honest with you I've been using it on
the iphone success on the iphone 7 I
don't find much of a benefit to it
sometimes it's actually a little
annoying but we would love to know what
you think in the comments down below
