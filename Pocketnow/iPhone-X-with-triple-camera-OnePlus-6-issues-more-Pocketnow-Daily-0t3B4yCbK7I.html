cameras and we don't even want to know
what this is gonna cost
so I'm singers are primarily working at
its own VR and bringing new strengths to
the table and it looks like if we'll
have to wait for the olette iPhones to
make it until next year I guess I'm high
metal iveta and look at yesterday's
comments if I had to count a dollar for
every time people complain about the
knotch
oh my god I'd be making lots of money
this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for the LGV 30s
thank you I didn't say thank you don't
worry well it was 930 bucks on B&amp;amp;H it
was crazy
now it's 630 that is a huge discount
it's a good phone for content consult
our content creation I would say you can
learn more about it in the description
now for those of you that have noticed
that the ambient always-on display of
the oneplus 6 has disappeared it has
everything to do with a software update
that was recently pushed over battery
issues which I'm still trying to figure
out as I actually don't have any issues
with my unit so far but yeah let us know
in the comments have you've had any
problems so far battery life on the
oneplus X for me has been great now
let's talk about iPhones and OLED
screens most of the rumors have claimed
that those three iPhones that we should
expect later this year are all going to
be OLED but according to some trusted
sources now we are getting an LCD iphone
in the middle when it comes to the price
range apparently the whole concept is
going OLED will happen but until next
year why we'll see now even though a lot
of people want a gear VR I'm one of
those people that actually doesn't
really use it over the cumbersome
experience of putting the phone on and
then you know everything that goes
afterwards we feel that the biggest
issue with VR has been that just the
cumbersome experience to get it to work
Samsung apparently is joining LG and
Google's efforts and bringing as a crazy
amount of PPI on a display to go full
steam ahead with VR 1200 PPI is
apparently the display that Samsung has
been showing off it seems that there are
up to three displays of the company who
wants to work on to get this off the
ground is this the future of the gear VR
we hope we just hope that also like the
process of setting it up it gets better
as well and finally the most interesting
news that they have to do with the
iPhone of 2019 as well we don't know
what it's going to be called but we've
been hearing rumors that we're getting
three cameras on this phone and this
time we hear it from a more trusted
source why would we want three cameras
apparently Apple wants to work on a few
things
bringing 3x optical zoom which we
currently already have on
a p20 Pro from Huawei apparently there
will be this new 3d approach to
photography which will enable certain
benefits which we're hoping are not
going to be gimmicks because as much as
I like portrait mode on the iPhone 10 I
don't like having to stand back to take
a photo I feel that to be the most
cumbersome experience ever
so in today's question let us know I
mean three cameras the Huawei p20 Pro
probably the iPhone 11 or whatever it's
going to be called do you prefer that
approach or do you prefer Google's
approach with the pixel to where you
just get one camera that's able to do
everything in my case I honestly I
prefer Google's have heard so far I love
what the p20 can do but not because it
has three cameras it's mainly because of
that 40 megapixel sensor on one of the
cameras but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
