has been one of the most requested
videos for me to do hi I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is how I set
up my Android homescreen since I started
here at pocket now I've received a ton
of feedback asking where I get my
wallpapers what widgets and launchers I
use and how I make my homescreen set up
the fact of the matter is these are
things I rarely give any thought to I
throw something together and use it for
a while when I get bored I add subtract
or replace an element and move on a few
months back I finally gave action
launcher ago and have exclusively
switched to it and the latest update
developer Chris lacy added support for
custom icon packs something I've never
cared for in the past but to show off
the new feature lacy used the stark icon
pack and I immediately fell in love I
copied his setup action launcher the
stark icon pack and the awesome purple
wallpaper that comes packaged with the
icon pack I use this for a few hours
before I started making my own
modifications and after a weekend of
tweaking I finally ended up with my
current setup a home screen setup I've
never been more happy with it's a truly
different experience and it looks
awesome sleek clean I started by
flashing paranoid android to the nexus 4
the stock 4.2.2 build had been acting up
and I was ready for something new
so I flashed the ROM and transitioned to
PI controls to squeeze out some extra
display real estate and I started my
home screen setup from scratch a
downloaded action launcher restored all
existing apps from iphone from there
it's much more simple than it may seem
purchase and install stark from the Play
Store it costs just 179 once that's
installed from action launcher press the
action overflow button and select
settings choose display then icon pack
and select stark I also adjust the
screen margins a bit to make the edges
of the home screen as close to the edge
of the display as possible and narrow
down my home screen page to just one I
up the grid size to 5 by 6 and I make
the doc 5 icons wide return to the home
screen and long press in a blank area
when asked where to choose the wallpaper
from select stark there are several
great wallpapers available from stark
put my personal favourites or the
gradient purple and blue next form the
covers which are simply folders hidden
behind a single app icon hence the name
a cover I
sort my applications into five sections
communication productivity camera and
pictures media and news and information
dragged all the communication style
applications into the communication
folder open the folder press the action
overflow button within the folder and
select make cover and set the most
commonly used application as the cover
by long pressing and dragging it to the
first position repeat this process for
the remaining four covers all that's
left is adding widgets which is the most
difficult part my clock widget is -
clock with which I use nine extensions
in order from top to bottom missed calls
battery Klout score calendar appointment
Gmail weather
neck's alarm sunrise and sunset and data
usage I use ultimate clock widget or you
see CW and play bars from Google Play
unfortunately the most recent version of
UC CW has a bug that is messed up the
layout so we referred it to an old
version of the application thanks to the
help of a Twitter follower by the name
of Jacob Engelmann I use play bars to
set for play style widgets for my social
apps on the home screen drag the quick
drawer open with a swipe from the left
edge of the display to the right and
swipe left within the drawer to unveil
widgets scroll for the use and select
you see CW widget size three by one I do
this 4 times and choose Google+ Twitter
Facebook and hangouts when you tap the
widget it will open you see CW where you
can edit the color and select the
application you want the widget to load
this is helpful if you use a third-party
Twitter client like Falcon pro once you
have this set to your desires press the
action overflow button select lock
widgets and press on lastly the icing on
the cake is rounder an application that
does one thing and one thing only around
the corners of your display
I love webOS download the free app open
it and select which corners you want
rounded and set the corner radius and
press back and that's the extent of my
home screen setup that wraps up this
video so if you enjoyed it and found it
