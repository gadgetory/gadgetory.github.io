what the company software approach will
be for the next 12 or so once even
though we may criticize the company for
its conservative approach we have to
remember that Apple sees itself
primarily is its software company so
it's clearly doing something right in
this department to drive so much loyalty
I'm hanging out at what pocket now and
this is our quick look at iOS 11 and
watch OS for the Apple watch surge to be
the most popular wearable of 2017 and
changes to watch OS 4 are minor but no
less significant we've got a new set of
watch faces from Disney this time ala
Toy Story and there's also a new
kaleidoscope face where you can tailor
what's portrayed even with a photo
probably my favorite new addition is
this new Siri watch phase if that's the
time of day providing useful information
like the current temperature Stefan that
is your appointments all stacked up in a
timeline view free to check how your day
is going to be X of 80 includes some new
additions like monthly challenges and
Apple has finally revamped its workout
application with a new user interface
this includes new workout modes like AI
intensity interval training and if you
want to train various things at once you
can now add these on the go
music just received the new revamp as
well and now sync the music that you
listen to the most and it finally allows
you to sync multiple playlists at a time
something it couldn't do in the past
though remember this is all Apple music
by the way and finally there is a new
doc user interface that reminds us more
of iOS where you can still keep
applications active permanently or you
can be removing them as you go but again
this is also a way to multitask
i OS 11 is Apple's new major update to
the iPhone and iPad but changes on the
iPhone are actually less significant
there's a redesign app drawer in
messaging and I messages now allow you
to sync them through iCloud across all
your iOS devices Siri has got new voices
that are now more natural and it now
supports translating languages there are
new on device learning capabilities to
proactively suggest things depending on
your user behavior or what applications
you use most the cameras user interface
is visually the same but that one
supports h.265 video and brings the same
enhancements to photos in order to save
up some storage space and there are some
storage saving features that are
actually deployed silently where Apple
actually graze out applications that you
don't constantly use even though you
actually have to set this up on settings
I'm still having a hard time getting
used to the new lockscreen being
consolidated to your Notification Center
what I do fraises the update to control
center giving you more access to
different settings 3d touch allows you
to access each of these settings
individually and about the only thing
that I would change is that I wish that
these would be customizable though again
this is just nitpicking and then there
are other features that we'll test later
like the detailed airport and mall floor
plans on maps and the Do Not Disturb
feature while driving now where iOS 11
shines the mostess with the iPad the
dock is now fully customizable allowing
you to add more applications and the
right side of the dock populates the
recent applications that you've launched
and this even supports features like
continuity where it knows if Safari is
open on your iPhone for example
multitasking now works differently
instead of sliding from the left to call
on an application you select from the
bottom to call on the dock and drag your
application to the side and also move
these applications from one side to the
next which is really cool I actually
find this more intuitive than sliding
from the side but it has the caveat that
if your application is not on the dock
well I haven't really figured out how to
pull the application into the
multitasking pane now bear in mind if
you notice on settings there is the
option to slide from the right or left
to call on the rest of the apps that are
not on the dock but as of the time of
iOS 11 beta 1 this is not available one
thing that I do find the coolest is that
whatever combinations have split view
you do you can actually keep active on
the multitasking shade with my only
complaint being honestly the fact that
if you want to close an application
currently you have to press and hold and
then press the X button which is kind of
annoying I prefer the swiping there's
also a new file explorer feature as well
that will allow you to connect services
like Dropbox in addition to other cloud
storage services so at the time of this
video the functionality seems to
currently only work for iCloud the notes
application has also found a major
revamp in conjunction to the Apple
pencil DoubleTap on the display with the
pencil and you can immediately use it to
take notes similar to what we saw with
the Galaxy Note 7 there are even new
document scanning features also built
into notes the pencil also allows this
new instant markup tool where you simply
touch on the screen with it it will
allow you to start doodling on whatever
was on the screen pretty much like
taking a screenshot overall all the
updates brought to iOS 11 and watch OS 4
are welcome just remember that this is a
very early data I will admit that these
updates were surprisingly stable for
their stage but they should get better
over time what about you what do you
think of iOS 11 and watch OS 4 let us
know in the comments down below and
while you're at it make sure you
subscribe to our youtube channel and
follow us on social media and also
follow me on Twitter Hind underscore
trees that are on instagram and finally
better please give this video thumbs up
if you like what you saw I am hi Natalie
that I thanks so much for watching we'll
see you on the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
