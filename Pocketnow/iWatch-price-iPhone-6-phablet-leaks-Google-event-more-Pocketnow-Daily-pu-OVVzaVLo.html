priced at around four hundred dollars
over below Google sends out press
invitations for an event to happen in
two weeks and rumors emerge and Best Buy
makes the LG G watch more interesting as
of today I'm hi Mary vitta and exactly
how are you celebrating your labor day
without me how dare you this is parking
out daily let's begin today with what's
official as LG and Best Buy have decided
to drop the price of the g watch before
Aoife obviously you've got the g watch
are coming very soon and so both
companies are now selling the g watch
479 bucks if you're in the market to get
an android wear SmartWatch this is
probably not the one that we'd most
recommend but if you're on a tight
budget it's probably a good way to start
I'll talk about Google as the company
has just sent out press invitations for
an event to happen on sep tember 15 and
given the fact that we were assuming
that Android one would be announced at
some point soon you know hardware and
stuff some of us believe that this is
Android one but then again we are in the
fall and this is probably the best time
to announce other products that have to
do with the Nexus family and with all
the rumors that we've been hearing it
could be that we are getting some Nexus
products on September 15 so stay tuned
Microsoft is next as the company has
already begun teasing what to expect for
its Aoife 2014 events it's happening on
September 4th and the company has just
sent out this invitation card with a
selfie photo so yeah this is the selfie
phone time we've been hearing that this
is the Lumia 730 and even though we
don't know the 830 that's also being
rumoured will include the selfie
capability in today's age that's really
the only way to do it so hopefully
Microsoft does get the memo and they do
make this a standard from Windows Phone
going forward up next let's talk about
Apple and the 5.5 inch iphone air or
iphone 6 phablet or whatever they're
going to call this thing it's hard to
predict the name but it's been hard to
find rumors of this phone because uh
apparently Apple has a man entered mass
production it's only ready for the 4.7
inch model but rumors claim that both
iphones will be announced on September
ninth and we get the first leaked video
of the iphone 6 shell and it's
reportedly of the phablet though we
can't really confirm because we can't
compare that size to anything else
hopefully we are getting both products
though we're not sure if it will be
launched until December and finally for
the both hot and disappointing news of
the day it seems that the iWatch will be
priced at around four hundred dollars
recoat is reporting that this is
probably the price tag and apparently
there will be a lot of models and these
will be priced below four hundred
dollars so apparently the most expensive
one would be this one of dollars is
definitely steep compared to every other
smart watch in the market but we know
how the Apple text works though again
there apparently will be other options
though the biggest problem with these
rumors is that apparently these will not
be launched until early 2015 even if
they are announced on sep tember night
which is a one-time only thing that
Apple has ever done except for the
iphones launched back in two thousand
seven but that leads me to the question
of the day what would the iWatch need to
bring for you to pay four hundred
dollars for it because in my case it
would have to be far superior to every
other smart watch in the market and not
just because of the hardware the
hardware alone would not be enough I
mean if that's what I wanted I would
just buy a real watch and not worry
about a SmartWatch but leave us a
comment down below what would it require
for you frenzy know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video is filming follow us i'm talking
out common scripture youtube channel as
well it also follow me on twitter hi my
underscore any better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hein that'll be better thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
