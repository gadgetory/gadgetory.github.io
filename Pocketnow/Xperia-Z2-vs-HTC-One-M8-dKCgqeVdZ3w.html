metal against plastic easy again premium
materials have a huge effect on a
smartphone's day to day look and feel
but what happens when you're called on
to compare glass against metal and more
broadly products specifically engineered
to catch your eye with their designs and
catch your ear with their front facing
speakers well things get tough and tough
tasks take a ton of time so let's get to
talking I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Sony Xperia z2
versus HTC One m8 right up front we
would not have an expiry is a - were it
not for the good folks at GSM nation one
of the first US retailers to stock this
device if you want one of your own click
the link to GSM nation in the
description below and tell them
PocketNow sent you now assumptions are
dangerous things but will go out on a
limb and say that if you're a fan of one
of these brands it probably has
something to do with their precision
hardware these are both gorgeous devices
made of premium materials brushed
aluminum in the case of our HTC One m8
and shatter resistant glass with a
metallic frame on the Xperia z2 that
means they're not as adventure proof as
their polycarbonate competition in from
a durability standpoint they're both
rather susceptible to scratching from
even minor incidents but they sure are
pleasing to the eye
neither is particularly easy to hold the
One m8 is rounded but slippery while the
Xperia is squared off and slippery their
mass is about equal but the sony product
is over a millimeter thinner and while
its sheer sided construction isn't as
soothing to the palm as the m8 s gentle
curve that does mean the xperia doesn't
wiggle on a tabletop when tapped and by
the way you can double tap to unlock it
in a stationary state the One m8 needs
to be jostled or picked up first before
that gesture works waking them up brings
those big 1080p screens to life Sony's
triluminos LCD is slightly larger than
HTC's s LCD 3 and there's a very slight
dip in pixel density as a result but
nothing you'd notice while Sony's come
along
and screen technology it's still beat
just slightly by HTC here the m8 whites
are cleaner its backlight is brighter
and its side visibility is better if
those differences are tough to see
looking under the hood gets even more
hazy at least at first
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 provides the
power for each of these devices with
microSD expansion to 128 gigs if you're
a media pack rat and each phones got a
sealed in battery as well look a little
deeper and the variations start to show
Sony's battery is significantly larger
and the Xperia also packs 50% more ram
while in onboard storage HTC offers a 32
gig option while Sony is stuck at 16 and
while the One m8 has been shown to
survive an underwater trip or two the
Xperia z2 is actually rated for it as
well as for dust exposure so if you're
the type who likes to swim with your
phone or walk around with pockets full
of sawdust the z2 is your better option
let's talk software for a second Android
4.4.2 underpins each of these but it's
pretty far down buried underneath Sense
6 on the One m8 and Sony's custom UI on
the Xperia in some ways these skins are
quite similar each is predominantly dark
and minimalistic in tone each offers a
distilled social feed and an array of
manufacturer specific features for HTC
these tend to be enhancements to stock
features like the gallery while Sony
tends to go the route of lots of
pre-installed apps Sony's approach is
definitely the less subtle of the two
and offerings like small apps and the
what's new hub are far too visible for
the amount of functionality they return
sony skin also feels dated in places
like the unnecessary badges on
homescreen folders and the oddly clunky
settings panel in the notification shape
changing screen brightness for example
takes twice as many taps on the Xperia
as it does on the One m8 on the flipside
the Xperia offers more customizability
drill down into the settings menu and
you'll find a wealth of options to fine
tune almost every part of the experience
also the media suite is very polished
from the Walkman music player to the
pictures album to the
movies hub and beyond and it all looks
quite nice plus you're not subjected to
the bizarre pseudo pastels of HTC's
Sense palette we like what each of these
companies has done to try to simplify
the shooting experience in the camera
app but it's Sony that goes the extra
mile here HTC's volume key shortcut to
launch the camera is a clever idea but
it's inconsistent Sony's simpler
dedicated key is far more reliable and
it allows for half press to focus as
well Sony's also kept a feature
pioneered by HTC the persistent
camcorder button as you might expect
that superiority carries through to the
photos produced some of Sony's victory
is predictable a 20 megapixel camera
going up against a 4 megapixel shooter
well you've got all the obvious benefits
of added sharpness and zoom ability but
that being said keeping them to the same
size as we've done here most folks would
be fine with either cameras photos as we
said in our One m8 review yes the camera
is low on resolution but it's far from
the worst camera on the market the
surprise comes in low-light shots a
category HTC has done very well in since
the m7 launch while the Xperia does it
better it's typically able to pull much
more light from a scene with its
superior auto mode which adjusts
automatically you don't have to toggle a
night shooting mode as you do on the One
m8 and the results here well speak for
themselves and how about the duo camera
that added sensor that gives the one I
made it's fancy you focus feature
well the Xperia z2 is able to use
multiple shots to achieve basically the
same effect without that weird second
eyeball factor in the added dynamic
range of Sony's camera the superior HDR
results the better stabilization and the
easier to grasp viewfinder along with 4k
recording and video and it's basically a
runaway win for the Xperia in the camera
department
it's not every day you get two
smartphones with front firing speakers
in the house in every significant sense
this has been HTC's playground for over
a year the company's oversized grills
and headline-grabbing brand name have
served it well but with the z2 sony's
competing by going to the other extreme
with probably the most unobtrusive
speakers ever seriously you have to
squint to see them this is a good
implementation considered by itself in a
quiet room but against the one m8
there's no contest HTC is the hands-down
winner yes even when using Sony's
software enhancements like clear Audio
plus X loud and even manually boosting
the bass and it's not necessarily
amplitude we're talking about here we
only see a decibel or two difference in
peak levels it's the fullness the
richness of the sound there's almost no
base to the Xperia Z output so it's 10
EUR and more shallow than the throaty
tones of the One m8 we tested it in
YouTube
in Netflix
and in local audio there's a baseline
here that's totally lost on the Xperia
but obvious on the One m8 and all that
goes for speaker phone calls as well
which are much louder and just better on
the one I made but on regular voice
calls over 18 T's Network callers said
they either couldn't tell the difference
in audio quality between these two or
that they preferred the Sony device
which they said made us sound cleaner
and which also better muffled background
noise and once you break out Sony's
fancy noise cancelling earbuds which
came in the box with our unit here well
the effect of the noise cancellation is
stunning it's almost like magic wiping
out everything from a loud subway car to
a loud subway musician
it's amazing that Sony packs these in
the box for no charge and combined with
the robust customizations available in
the software
it makes listening to music on the z2
substantially more enjoyable than on the
HTC One even if you spring for the fancy
harman kardon edition of the latter the
Walkman brand continues to do Sony proud
after only a few days testing we don't
have all the data we need for some
points in this comparison like battery
life and hard core performance testing
hold out for our full review of the
Xperia z2 for more on all that as always
a pocket now picking an overall winner
in this contest is beside the point if
you think that's a cop-out well you're
in the wrong place because the HTC One
m8 is one of our best reviewed devices
ever and spoiler alert the Xperia z2 is
destined not to fall far behind
finally True Excellence is showing its
face in the Android world and these
handsets are but two sides of that
excellence so if you want the best
camera experience you can find on
Android you're a fan of listening to
your media in private and the only time
you drop your phone is in the swimming
pool get the Xperia z2 if on the other
hand you frequently share media or don't
like headphones and you favor a modern
fun useful interface and a more polished
feel overall go for the One m8 stick to
those guidelines and we've got a feeling
you're going to be quite happy either
