smartphone emerged now in renders
analysts predict that the jet black
iphone 7 is to blame for delivery delays
and Lenovo is not playing nicely with
its acquisition of Motorola I'm hi
Marilee Vanna and yeah I also do want to
believe that the day would be Friday
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals I know that
the LG g5 was a very controversial film
but that didn't mean at the phone was
bad it could have just been better
manufactured i guess but anyways if you
are in the market for g5 and I know a
few people that actually do love that
phone me included you can pay four
hundred seventy nine dollars right now
at B&amp;amp;H and that actually includes 178
dollars in accessories and freebies so
you might want to learn more link in the
description Alice will the spotlight
over to the sad news from Lenovo acid a
we hear the company has laid off 1,100
employees most of these from the
motorola division and this is extremely
sad according to lenovo it's the same
exclusively provided last year the fact
that the integration will motorola
wasn't really that good it wasn't
successful according to them and the
rumors claim that there are other 700
people that might lose their jobs over
the course of the next year which is
terrible I'll some about Google and the
future of Andromeda for those of you
that are wondering how popular this name
has become it was even more popular than
the presidential debate yesterday and
for those of you that want to know
progress we do know that you can install
android applications on turning
Chromebooks there is progress in that
direction but we hear that a recent
update now allows us to be a lot less
painful this is still a work in progress
it's still not going to happen and we
cannot wait to see what happens on
october for and speaking of the products
that we are waiting for on october for
we get some leaked renders of the google
pixel in its 5-inch very and apparently
both those are going to be pretty much
the same just one larger than the other
and so far as expected from nexus
devices design is really blah there's
really nothing hard to see at the front
but we do hear that these products might
still be called nexus smartphones to a
certain degree will keep you posted and
finally for the very interesting news
today for those of you that are
wondering exactly why it's taking so
long for your
phone 7 to arrive that might be because
you ordered jet-black according to
analyst yield rates for this jet black
iphone and pretty much the rest of the
production line or sixty seventy percent
down because of how complicated it is to
produce that design and you even wonder
exactly how worth it is that design
given all the complaints that people now
say that this phone scratches like crazy
but hey it leads me to the question of
the day do you order the jet black
iphone if you did and you already
received your product let us know in the
comments if you're satisfied with it and
if not are you still waiting for it are
you just going to swap it for something
else it was a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friend you
