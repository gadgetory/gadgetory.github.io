to come with the iPhone 8 LG g6 rumors
now point to a more powerful audio
experience to come and don't get your
hopes up with the Samsung Galaxy as a
digital assistant I'm Jaime Rivera
complaining about Mondays since the dawn
of the show in 2012 this is probably now
daily the official news today begin with
deals for those of you that already
started fighting with your partners
because it's Valentine's Day tomorrow
well happy you but for those of you that
didn't fit bit has got this crazy deal
right now 25% off pretty much every
single one of its products on amazon.com
you can learn more on the link in the
description as well the spotlight over
to Samsung those of you that were
believing or not believing on the
possibility of an S 8 plus variant
famous tipster Evan Blass has just
revealed the official branding there's a
lot of blue being used than yes there is
an S 8 plus being mentioned in the
branding so this product is coming let's
hope it's not just a larger galaxy s 8
and since we are talking about Samsung
we've got a very interesting article in
The Wall Street Journal that's talking
about the company's digital assistant
and for those of you that we're waiting
for something amazing
apparently the company is going to
recycle its s voice and this new bixby
or samsung hello or whatever that adele
service is going to be called is
apparently going to be based on s voice
which we hate it from day one which we
deactivated on every single galaxy we've
ever reviewed from day one so oh well
and how about if we talk about the LG g
6 the company has been giving us a lot
of teasers of what to expect and today's
new one is that we should expect a
better quad DAC on this phone or a
better deck than the quad deck on the V
20 and this is a tall order one of our
biggest complaints with the LG g5 was
the terrible audio experience that it
had unless you bought the company's
friend with bag of all of sins so
apparently it's going to be better than
the V 20 that is a big statement we
cannot wait to hear more about it and
finally the very hot nurses they have to
do with the iPhone 8 mainly because of a
couple of rumors
the rumors are sketchy but the source is
trusted it's digit times apparently we
are hearing three things number one that
Apple is going to start production early
number two that apparently there is a
5-inch variant in addition to the 4.7
inch and the 5.5 inch and third which is
even more interesting we heard about
that facial recognition but really
that's only going to be an iris scanner
it's really not going to be anything out
of the ordinary which leads me to the
question of the day how important is it
for you to get an iris scanner on your
next Mart phone in my case honestly if
Apple figures out a way to implemented
the way Samsung did with the note 7 I am
sold but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion

to get the news earlier before the video
