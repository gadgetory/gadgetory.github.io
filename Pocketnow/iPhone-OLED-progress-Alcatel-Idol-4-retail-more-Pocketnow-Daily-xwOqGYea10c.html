know that future coming very soon leaks
of a samsung galaxy olympic edition have
just emerged and get ready for the
alcatel idol for reaching retail stores
very soon I'm high Meadow iveta and the
I know coffee is the last thing I should
be drinking on a Friday but man if
Thursday could talk this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you were not able to take
advantage of the Nexus 5x deals recently
on ebay for 269 well daily steals now
has it for the same price tag and if you
follow a link in the description there's
an extra ten dollar discount code you
could probably take advantage of yeah
it's definitely worth it for 259 and the
hottest news today are actually the UK
departing the European Union it's all
over twitter today everybody's got an
opinion on that except for me but if
you're wondering exactly how this can
affect smartphone manufacturers samsung
LG and even if suz have already come
clear as to the fact that they will be
affected mainly because of the import
taxes for supplies and for smartphones
within the UK and obviously this process
will take around two years it's not
going to happen immediately but stay
tuned as if phones weren't already more
expensive in the UK and speaking of the
UK one very interesting surprise that we
received today was news from clothe
technology telling us that they already
have supplies for the alcatel idle for
this was probably one of the coolest
phones that we saw at mwc an amazing
price tag right now for 229 pounds
supplies are already available and
you're pretty much getting one of the
best premium made rangers of this year
and we had been waiting for the longest
time to see when we were getting the
phone after mwc learn more than likely
description and if we weren't able to
take advantage of that 1200 dollar
Batman edition of the galaxy s7 edge and
if I rolled my eyes that was actually
intentional there were only a thousand
units for crazy price tag ever blessed
just discovered that there is another
phone the olympic edition of the galaxy
s7 edge and even though we don't know
exactly when we're getting it this is
the year of the Rio Olympics s of which
i'm sure you guys want to remember that
year by buying an expensive phone right
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with a future iphone and the
probability of an oled display it's
already been discarded that we should
expect this phone to happen within this
year because apparently Apple is not
ready and even though the rumors were
that Samsung would be the only supplier
it seems that the reason why Foxconn
bought Sharpe was to invest 200 billion
yen in the company in order for it to be
able to build oh let panels for Apple
and even though it's not really official
yet apparently sharp will be that second
supplier of OLED this place for the
iphone via the iphone 8 whatever a
number of apple plans to give to this
next-generation iphone that will include
elect enology and pay it leads me to the
question of the day whenever buying a
phone is the display technology a deal
breaker for you meaning if it's not
AMOLED you won't buy it in my case it
really depends i've seen amazing
beautiful super lcds from HTC some IPS
LCD is from LG but i do prefer AMOLED
technology leave us a comment down below
