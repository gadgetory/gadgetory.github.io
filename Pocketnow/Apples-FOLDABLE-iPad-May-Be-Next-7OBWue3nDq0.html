different foldable product next year
after all got some information on the
new camera systems for the Google pixel
for in pixel for Excel and Nokia is back
at it again with leaks of a phone with a
48 megapixel camera I'm hi melody Vera
it is Friday I'm sure you celebrate it
like crazy yesterday and I'm sure you
will again today so join me
this is Fargo now daily the official
news today begin with deals if you are
in the market for Apple watch again
Series 3 is not my favorite but it's a
good alternative just remember that the
back is not ceramic so it's not as
durable as series 4 but the thing about
it for 199 right now on Amazon for the
38 millimeter and then 229 if you want
to get yourself the larger variant I
mean that makes for a good gift at that
price tag again not necessarily my
favorite you're gonna have to take care
of that back but still it's an option
now for those of you that we're having
issues with Instagram Facebook and
whatsapp you were not alone apparently
in addition to that Apple was also
having issues with their connected
services it seems that iCloud find my
friends and a lot of services were
having issues but it wasn't everywhere I
didn't have any problems that is know in
the comments if you did but yeah if you
were noticing that your services weren't
working yesterday apparently that's it
and I wondered exactly why maybe they're
sharing the same server it could be now
let's move the spotlight over to wall
way and the future of the May 30 pro the
rumors that we covered yesterday in the
leaks of the design we're really how we
had a lot of commentary from you guys
thank you so much we've got some more
leaks on patents for what this phone
could look like from the front now we
had speculation the front wasn't really
gonna change much but now we have
patents of an under display camera
that's not visible it's apparently going
to be on one side instead of the middle
and well that's an interesting change I
wonder if it's going to happen for this
generation it could just be that it'll
happen for the next one thing about it
is if it were to happen miss your man
that would be one very hot May 30 Pro
and how about if we also discuss the
feature of Nokia obviously getting a 48
megapixel camera on a phone right now is
not a novelty it's been happening for a
couple of flagships but apparently Nokia
is jumping back into the game with a 48
megapixel phone of its own and
just got leaked in Weibo from the front
that's got a notch smaller chin but from
the back we see a triple camera ray that
looks a lot like moto it looks a lot
like the Oreo design of the Nokia what
was the 1020 the Lumia whatever the case
may be again there's nothing special
about the sensor it's probably the same
one that we've seen from Sony but we
hope that this time they figure it out
is there's a reason why we didn't do
that review of the Nokia 9p review and
since we're talking about multiple
cameras let's also talk Google as we've
been hearing that we're gonna get a
stove camera the company has pretty much
confirmed that the question is exactly
what we are getting in these camera
systems and now it finally got leaked in
an apk recovered by xda-developers on
Google's new camera application they
found a super resolution zoom codename
saber that has a lot of reference to a
telephoto on the sensors available we
see the main front-facing a wide
front-facing which is great a main
rear-facing and then we also see two new
ones of front IR in a rear telephoto the
dimensions on the APK were mentioned for
the telephoto being 16 megapixels and we
also see a new mode called McFly for
reversed video and selfie tips think
about it it is I wish that we didn't
just get a wet angle at the front I mean
if we're getting a stove - we'll get the
whole thing but yeah these are rumors
let's see what we get and finally the
hottest issue said I have to do with
Apple and the possibility for a foldable
mainly because we've been waiting for
Huawei to launch they're made X we've
been waiting for Samsung to launch their
Galaxy fold but if there's one company
that we've noticed figures things out is
Apple one of the biggest problems with
iPads and the whole concept of using
them is that you need a case for you to
be able to prop them up as a different
product that's just the tablet sometimes
you want to type on it and the keyboard
case that comes with iPads is honestly
terrible not worth 200 bucks so we've
got analysts already predicting that yes
the company is working on it and usually
these analysts have inside sources I
mean makes you quote famous for always
getting leaks right whatever the case
the whole idea is to have this product
and fold in a way for you to be able to
use one side as I keep it on the other
side as if you were using the screen
which is usually the way you use iPads
only
have to pretty much prop them on a table
or whatever the case well there's no in
the comments down below I mean with
everything that's happened with tablets
foldables this year should I say I mean
are you excited for another foldable to
come to the market because in my case
I'm just I love the idea of Apple
working on something like this because
it means that it'll probably get done or
it'll probably get ditched like in the
case of air power let us know in the
comments down below what you think I
really want Apple to figure it out I
really want this market to work but then
again I'm only excited for those
foldable flip phones which are also a
concept right now there's no e thing in
the comments down below
