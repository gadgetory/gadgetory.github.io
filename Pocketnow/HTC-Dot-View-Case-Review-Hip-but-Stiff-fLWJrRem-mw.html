from 1989 but it's actually a case for
one of the world's most advanced
smartphones is the HTC One m8 snoo dot
view case worth the 50 bucks the company
wants for it i'm michael fisher from
pocket now let's find out as cases go
this one is pretty typical around back
rigid plastic available in a variety of
colors with a display cover around front
that opens on a side mounted hinge if
that were all there was to it we'd end
the review here with a half-hearted
matte but of course this case is called
dot view for a reason over 1500
perforations in the front cover work
with a dedicated screen mode and a
magnetic sensor to display the time the
weather waiting notifications and other
information when the flap is closed the
dot view case allows limited touch input
when it's closed as well you can double
tap to wake the device swipe down to
activate voice tiling and swipe up to
take an incoming call if there are no
notifications waiting the device will
display the current weather beneath the
time the notifications are fun if a
little limited they're confined to HTC
apps
so while phone calls SMS calendar
reminders and such will be displayed
other common alerts like hangouts
Facebook Gmail won't that's
understandable but it's still
unfortunate on the bright side the phone
automatically wakes from standby when
the case is open which is very handy and
media continues playing even when the
case is closed
all that is very smart not so smart the
hinge design well it's very good-looking
it's also quite rigid and it's
inflexibility means the front flap
doesn't sit flush against the cases back
surface that makes using it kind of a
pain
the constant hinge tension makes the
phone very springy in both one and two
handed use which makes typing almost
impossible unless you're really
squeezing on the thing to keep it open
it's easier in landscape but overall
it's pretty uncomfortable that's a shame
given the case as other high points
we've never seen anything quite as retro
chic as the dot view approach and the
case is well built low profile and
attractive on the whole we've reached
out to HTC for comment on a possible
fix and will edit below if the company
replies it's also quite possible this
problem will solve itself over time as
the hinge becomes broken in with use
until we get a better sense of how it
ages our impression of the dot view case
is that of a form over function
accessory but then again form is at the
top of HTC's priority list with the new
one m8 the cases limitations will
doubtless bother some especially given
its $50 price point but you're also
getting quite a bit of retro style and
not a little protection for that ulysses
s grant note and for some buyers that's
reason enough to splurge our full review
