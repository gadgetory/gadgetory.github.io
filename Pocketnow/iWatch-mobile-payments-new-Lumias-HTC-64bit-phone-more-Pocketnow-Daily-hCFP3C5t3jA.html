along with cool changes to windows phone
HTC takes the 64-bit plunge with a new
desire 820 and Apple seems to think
you'll want to make payments with the
iWatch I'm high memory that I and
remember the first link in the
description leads to all our full fifa
2014 coverage which is a lot this is
pocket out daily going forward almost
everything is official news Microsoft's
have been happen at Aoife today we were
there covering it live our hands on
videos are already live as well we've
got the Lumia seven thirty and seven
thirty five in the Lumia 830 the 737 35
are pretty much the same phone only 730
is dual SIM the 735 is pretty much mid
to your cell phone by megapixel shooter
at the front 6.7 megapixel shooter at
the back not very hot but then again the
830 is the Affordable flagship design
its cool 10 megapixel camera and it
resembles the Lumia 920 a lot again
linked to this trisha for our hands-on
videos hot phones coming up and speaking
of microsoft let's talk about Windows
Phone as the company has just announced
that they will be launching the Lumia
denim update and this is the way
Microsoft is going to differentiate
lumias first of all once this launches
you won't have to launch Cortana just
say hey Cortana and it'll launch just
like you can with the Moto X which is
awesome and then in addition to that you
will also be getting some camera
enhancements parently going to take as
much as 3 photos in a blink of an eye
which is great in addition to other
performance enhancements and you can
even have location-aware reminders from
Cortana really need updates coming up
and we will keep you posted once those
launched HTC also had its event at Aoife
2014 our team was there and well we've
got the HTC Desire 820 and if you
thought this phone was not hot well
think again this is actually the first
64-bit smartphone built by HTC which is
great it's rocking the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 615 processor and even though
the specifications are not that hot we
really cannot wait to test this phone
out design is neat and the finish is
actually quite cool so stay tuned then
again links to description for our full
hands-on video now acer is a
a company that just launched a tablet
and before you dismiss it yes this is
the iconia tab aww and yeah the
specifications are probably not great
1080p display 1 gig of ram 32 gigs of
storage not the hottest tablet in the
world until you look at the price tag
this thing runs a full version of
Windows 8 point when it gives you a full
year of office 365 for a hundred and
sixty bucks a hundred and sixty bucks I
did not get that wrong I can't wait for
this tablet to launch even if it sucked
my god what you're getting their office
365 alone makes this tablet worth buying
so stay tuned for that and finally for
the only rumors of the day let's talk
about Apple because their event is
happening until September 9 so the
rumors continue represent that Apple is
going to launch two i watch models this
time this is coming from The Wall Street
Journal by the way and apparently we're
getting a curved screen and these two
models are for him and her you know
different sizes because obviously women
don't want a big SmartWatch which is
actually up first no company has done
this yet and that's actually a smart
thing to do as most women prefer iPhones
and apple products and stuff like that
but even more interesting is that
apparently yes the iWatch will bring an
NFC chip but think about what for seems
that Apple is considering mobile
payments and apparently your SmartWatch
is going to be the deal which is
interesting and leads me to the question
of today would you still care about
mobile payments i mean android has tried
to do this for years and it hasn't taken
off is it something that's important to
you because in my case honestly no not
really especially when anybody could
steal my watch and do whatever they want
with it so leave us a comment down below
let's see how Apple figures this one out
friends yes you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video was filming she follow us on
packing.com is a scripture youtube
channel as well it also follow me on
twitter hein underscored iveta please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw i am high metal be better
