is for us to recommend a good SmartWatch
for fitness and that's actually a
challenge either you get a good fitness
watch that isn't smart or a good
SmartWatch that does some fitness unless
of course you go all out with the polar
m600 I'm high metal even with pocket now
and it's time for our review
Fitness has become the killer
application for many smartwatches
this is about the only thing a
smartphone won't do better than a watch
but the problem is that most solutions
in the market are only decent solutions
for Fitness aside from the usual
tracking some are either too limited or
just track the basics those of us the
Train seriously don't just want the
decent fitness tracker we need a product
that's truly smart and for those of us
there's the polar m600 I've been testing
the m600 for the last couple of weeks
and it has quickly become my weapon of
choice at the gym or on the road if
you're wondering what makes the m600 so
special these are the top 5 reasons why
I continuously drift to it number one it
was designed to be beat up the main
problem the basic SmartWatch is that
it's too fragile for a workout and then
the most popular fitness trackers are
not designed to allow you to replace the
band's which is just an irony the m600
was clearly designed to take a beating
with chrome accents protruding to
protect the display the side and front
buttons are protected by the band and
you can actually replace the full band
with different color options if you want
and this is also one of the few smart
watches out there with ipx8 ratings
making it suitable even for swimming the
second reason is because it's very
accurate polar pretty much invented the
heart rate sensor thirty years ago and
by simple visual comparison the heart
rate sensor on the m600 is clearly more
complete than everything else out there
the GPS on the m600 is also the quickest
in locking my position usually Fitness
watches take forever to do this and
that's the main reason why they're
always almost a quarter of a mile behind
your average smartphone but this is not
a problem with the m600 and I also love
the visual cue that you get whenever the
device locks your position through the
GPS number three is that it's a really
good tool for training smart the diet
that I follow requires me to be able to
calculate the intensity of my workouts
in order to define the amount of protein
and carb that I should intake the main
problem with the standard fit the
SmartWatch is that all you get us
information on the amount of calories
you burned polar is probably one of the
few or only platforms I've seen that
provides you with train zone information
the m600 provides instant
data on your wrist to help you determine
if you're burning fat or improving your
physical condition so this actually
allows you to keep yourself in check
while you're training once your training
is done polar flow kicks in with
detailed information of what you did and
how you performed and since your
performance is sync with the cloud it
doesn't really matter if you unpair the
m600 and pair it with another phone all
your information and even your training
settings are transferred to that next
smartphone the fourth reason it's crazy
customizable my biggest complaint with
your standard fitness watch is that it
can only track certain activities and
then many companies just abandon their
devices with few too little or none
software updates through polar flow you
can virtually add the most complete list
of workouts to track that I've seen in
the business you can also customize
these depending on your needs and keep
up to 20 different workouts to track on
your watch at a time you can later
glance on how your day has been matching
the information from both your average
daily activity and your training the
fifth of nosin point hey this is a smart
watch the rest of the time I can't say
that the m600 was really designed to be
my first pick of a watch that I'd wear
every day but the cool thing is that you
actually can running on Android wear
offers the benefits of a standard
SmartWatch with full notification
support access to your favorite
applications music synchronization for
whatever you want to use the watch as a
music player whenever you're running etc
the watch face has this really cool
trick where it tells you gradually as
you're achieving your fitness goal and
for the rest of the time you can
actually switch it up because again it
all depends on the Google ecosystem
overall I must say that this is the
first Android wear fitness watch that I
could recommend this is not your
standard Fitness watch but truly one of
the most complete products that I've
tested this year from smart training to
the flexibility of Android wear the
polar m600 is probably the only
SmartWatch you need
