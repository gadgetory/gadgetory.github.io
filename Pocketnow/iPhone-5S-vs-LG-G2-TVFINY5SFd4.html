powerful Android smartphones of the year
and in the other we have Apple's best
iPhone ever or so they say
which of these devices is better suited
for your needs let's find out I'm Jaime
Rivera this is PocketNow and this is
iPhone 5s versus LG g2 this comparison
is odd in its own way since LG is better
known for their intense competition with
Samsung and not Apple these devices are
completely different and absolutely
everything and still both support the
best cameras and their respective
platforms the best internals and both
even push the bar of design in their own
unique way when it comes to hardware the
only thing they have in common is that
both companies are trying to give you
the thinnest and lightest design you can
get for the experience they intend to
give you the g2 is in no way like last
year's Optimus G some are disappointed
at the company for ditching the glass on
glass for plastic but there's a reason
for that just picture this at 5.2 inches
diagonal this phone has almost the exact
same screen size as the monstrous first
generation galaxy note but sandwiched in
a chassis that's almost identical to the
galaxy s4 yes this phone is that big and
yet it is that small there's almost no
bezel here and if LG had to use plastic
to pull this off I'm gonna forgive them
especially because there is some heft to
the phone so it doesn't really feel
cheap in the hand yes the buttons are
awkward placed in the back but I've
gotten used to it and if you don't like
it simply double tap the display the
device will wake up or go back to
standby still the device is a smudge
magnet even though the denim pattern
that LG has chosen in the back looks
kind of cool now aside from the design
the real story here is the spec sheet
and this is one of the first devices to
rock the Snapdragon 800 processor from
Qualcomm
clocked at 2.2 gigahertz along with 2
gigabytes of RAM and all the other 2013
bells and whistles like an IR blaster
and Wi-Fi 802 a leaven AC sadly our 80
unit here features only 16 or 32
gigabytes of non-expandable storage and
a 3000 milliamp hour battery that is
non-replaceable which you can actually
get with someone
Lock models of this phone but we'll
explain later on on the test notes why
this is not really important the iPhone
is another device that challenges
designed I mean when was the last time
that you got a 4-inch display in such a
small and elegant housing Apple's focus
is to give you the best one-handed
experience and they nail it here the
design of this phone includes the usual
convention button layout but obviously
all sandwiched in a premium aluminum
design overall the device feels great in
the hand and any of the three color
options that you choose will deter
fingerprints quite well now specs on the
iPhone won't ever sound monstrous when
compared to any Android phone but Apple
say seven 64-bit processor is both
powerful and efficient we do have fixed
storage options in a non replaceable
battery that's the reality of every
iPhone that you buy but it's also the
reality of this g2 in particular though
we would like to have an IR blaster and
Wi-Fi AC on this phone as well and the
enhancements that are lacked by the g2
are touch ID which is actually quite
cool both these devices support IPS
displays and as such they are just
gorgeous
great color reproduction great pixel
density and great viewing angles though
obviously the g2 does a buy - a much
better 1080p standard and much better
pixel density as well overall on paper
and in the hand these two devices live
up to their top position in their
respective platforms and both are
future-proof devices in their own way
since the platform is really what
determines that it really depends on you
and if you'd prefer a larger-than-life
display that suits your needs or if one
hand that in premium feel is more
important to you when it comes to
hardware now I'll admit I didn't want to
get to the software section of this
video and sadly the time has come
okay so Apple's iOS 7 has definitely
matured for good and it is now more
visually pleasing and even though it's
not out there to wow you
instead it's actually there to blend
with your needs surely customizations
are limited but you won't need them for
the most part this is a very efficient
piece of software that just works and
that is logical in almost every aspect
enhancements like control center or the
smarter photo gallery will make any iOS
user happy so I'm sure that a lot of
people will be pleased but
sadly software is not LG's best work
this device does run Android 4.2.2 jelly
bean out of the box which is great but
LG's custom skin is in a word tacky it
is very poorly designed almost
everywhere and it does back down the
phone at times even with the snapdragon
800 the text and folder is overlaps and
you'll even find spelling mistakes
across various areas of the UI which
make everything look sloppy some areas
try to be like TouchWiz like the case of
the tap settings in even the whole
camera UI is a poor rip-off of the
galaxy s4 sadly multi-window didn't get
copied from Samsung which is the only
thing I would have praised here but LG
does bring cute slide apps which are
sloppy looking but still they bring a
window and interface to certain services
which is actually really cool now ok I'm
going to stop criticizing the g2 because
to LG's defense they chose Android as
their operating system so you don't
really have to put up with any of this
all you have to do is do what I did just
install nova launcher which i found to
be the best third-party launcher that
works with it and install Swift key and
then you can start enjoying this phone
you'll even notice that nova runs much
smoother on this g2 then pretty much
LG's own software UI overall even though
Apple doesn't allow customizations those
who have an iPhone know that you just
won't need them so software on iOS 7
could be considered solid LG may have
failed here but since it runs Android
you'll notice that you can customize
just about everything you want on the
phone so the in spiria pnes can be
awesome depending on you now how is it
to actually use these two phones on a
daily basis well I'll admit I love them
both performance is really the specialty
of both phones every single app launches
quickly on both of them and they are
very reliable they don't even have
significant heat issues when you're
playing hardcore games that are
optimized for them at first my tests
were kind of difficult with the g2
because asphalt 8 wasn't optimized for
the center 1800 but lucky g2 that just
got updated today so I did get to play
the game and it played quite great on
this device but so does the iPhone 5s
now touch ID while awesome on the iPhone
5s is not available on the g2 but that
really depends on your needs whether
that's
fool or not see I have a lot of
passwords I depend on them so I
definitely need something like touch ID
and the fact that it works in seconds
and it works flawlessly makes me love
this feature a lot but a lot of people
don't need passwords so that could just
mean that you don't need this and on
Android you have options like face to
unlock even though they're not as quick
as touch ID I'll tell you that now in
battery life things are dramatically
different between these two devices the
Snapdragon 800 on the lg g2 zips on that
battery with a straw you just can't kill
this phone I've gotten two solid days of
use with no mercy to this device and it
takes it like a champ
if gaming is your thing this is really
the perfect device you get a big display
a smooth processor and a battery that
just won't die on the other hand the
iPhone has good battery life that'll
last you through the day but just one
day that's fine for most users but the
d2 really takes the cake here when it
comes to their cameras guys the g2 has
the Android camera to beat the optical
image stabilization makes those 13
megapixel shots great on both sunlight
and low-light forget about the shooting
modes here just set this device to auto
and let the phone do the rest yes the
camera is that good now again that's
comparing the g2 against other Android
phones the 5s on the other hand this is
no slouch the camera does not have
optical image stabilization but the
software stabilization provided by Apple
is actually state-of-the-art there are
some lowlife photos that I did find
better on the iPhone but not
significantly better I would feel that
both cameras perform just as great on
both devices phone calls are good on
both devices as well the iPhone did
sound a little better over the earpiece
for me but caller said that I sounded
exactly the same on both devices on the
other end so I would call this even for
both now the iPhone has a speaker that's
second only to HTC's boomsound for
speaker phone calls and for music sadly
the g2 has a very bad speaker it's very
tinny and it's just the feature that I
would not recommend you use on this
phone
so bottom line iPhone 5s or LG g2 I'll
try to make this easy for you
I'd rather you select the platform that
you prefer whether it's iOS or Android I
mean in my case in the past I would
select iOS because the iPhone took
better photos and it had a more reliable
experience but when you use the g2
you'll notice that you get a great
camera that the user experience is very
reliable as long as you install a
third-party launcher so let's just say
that you have two very solid performers
you can pick from either of the
platforms that you want I'd call the g2
a gamers best friend or for anybody
that's interested in heavy multimedia
use there is definitely no compromise
here and if you prefer to stay on the
Android echo system this is your best
choice obviously if you don't mind the
big package and on the other hand I'd
call the iPhone everybody's best friend
since it can handle games it can handle
multimedia with ease
there is no compromise on your
experience with iOS here and you don't
have to have a monster phone in order to
get this experience which is sadly the
problem with Android for most people
regardless of what you pick I am sure
you're going to be a happy customer with
either of these two phones that's it for
today's comparison thank you very much
for watching please let us know in the
comments down below which device are you
picking or did you pick that you get the
LG g2 or the iPhone 5s you'd also leave
