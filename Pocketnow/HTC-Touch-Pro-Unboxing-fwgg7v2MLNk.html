pocketnow.com and today we're unboxing
what is probably the most highly
anticipated windows mobile device of
2008 the HTC touch pro the HTC Touch pro
is like the HTC touch diamond2 board it
has a bigger battery it adds a microSD
slot and also has TV out functionality
so I'm extremely excited to see what
this looks like it just came in five
minutes ago and let's let's get to it I
can feel that the the packaging is quite
small
probably in the diamond shape like the
touch diamond yep
look at this box beautiful box in the
shape of a diamond how do you open this
looks like a tab right here Wow
look at this this shiny plastic this is
beautiful I haven't even done anything
yet and I'm already super excited oh my
god
okay we'll look at that in a minute I
love how the keyboard is displayed right
when you take out the packaging for the
box let's see what's in this little
manual on how to care for your device
some software and probably more software
right this unboxing experience is
probably one of the best that I've ever
seen this this this material uses so
high quality it's plastic rather than
just cardboard looks like we have a case
and it is leather and it better be
leather this is one of the highest end
windows mobile devices ever this is not
a screen protector it's just a piece of
plastic here we have some headphones
using HTC's proprietary connector charge
cable or sync cable I should say for
charging and this looks like I'm not
sure what this is actually and we have a
battery which is smaller than I thought
it would be but I know it's quite large
in terms of size it's around 1,300
milliamp hours I can't see the capacity
right now but it's it's definitely
larger than the diamond we have an extra
stylus which is good it's non
collapsible I wonder wonder if it has
that same magnetic feature where when
you remove the stylus it turns on the
screen here we have some extra pieces of
felt for the earbuds comes with a screen
protector
good and we're getting we're getting
closer to the bottom and things are
getting smaller this is interesting it
looks like some sort of getting started
guide tell you how to use touchflo 3d in
full color very nice
and here's another small Quick Start
Guide more detailed here we have some
information about accessories and then
we have warranty information so
beautiful box let's take a look at the
device beautiful beautiful the screen is
completely flushed just like the diamond
it is thick it is thick it feels small
in hand much smaller than the Kaiser
I'll show you a comparison with the
Kaiser in a minute
but it feels small in hand it is
definitely a lot thicker than I I was
hoping it would be spring-assisted
keyboard keyboard is a fantastic layout
you have a dedicated row of numbers here
at the top we have the diamond faceted
backing
keyboard feels quite nice of course I'll
have to test it well let's take a look
how it compares to the you could
consider this its predecessor the Kaiser
right so it's the same form factor but
with a different kind of screen and a
lot of different other features let's
take a look at how they compare touch
pro is much smaller in terms of height
and in terms of width the the Kaiser is
a little bit thicker by two millimeters
unfortunately the touch pro isn't much
thinner than the Kaiser but it it is a
little bit thinner let's compare the
keyboards quickly of course the touch
pro does not have a tilting screen but
it has a lot more keys and they're a
little bit smaller a little bit smaller
and compared to other devices like the
omnia which also has a nice flush
touchscreen it's about the same height
smaller screen of course but the touch
pro has a higher resolution display of
course it's thicker so very interesting
this is a very elegant device probably
one of the most elegant devices I've
ever seen in terms of for the for the
business user we have a lot more
coverage coming up on the HTC touch pro
I'm really excited to turn this on and
take a look at what HTC has done with
this device this may be the new
must-have device for business users who
want the best of the best so more coming
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
