the Nokia Lumia 925 press renders also
make the scene and Google Rio may
disappoint you more than you think
I'm hi Merry Widow and if you're
offended by this Jersey well hey it's
not my fault we want la liga again this
is PocketNow daily let's start today off
with some sony news the company has just
announced their new sony xperia z RS of
the alphabet has not finished yet
this device bring some decent specs
probably the only thing that it doesn't
bring up part with the Sony Xperia Z is
that this one has a 720p display in
comparison to the 1080p display on the
Xperia Z but the display on the
experience he wasn't really that great
and Sony has done a better job with
their 720p displays but that said this
device allows you to be used underwater
not just waterproof I mean use this
thing for filming underwater aside from
other things as every single smartphone
should be so just stay tuned for the
release dates and pricing no information
just yet now let's talk about google
sundar Pichai which is the head of
Android and Google Chrome was recently
in an interview with wired and while he
stated that apparently Google IO is not
gonna be about hardware the company is
gonna focus more on giving developers
the tools they need to do better things
well you know smartphones and tablets
you know Nexus products are actually
tools and are not sure where you're
getting the information this should only
be a developer event but sadly
apparently that's the case and what do
you think we're getting at this event oh
that's the next segment and that's right
probably one of the things we're gonna
be getting at Google i/o is their new
Google Play games apparently it's not
gonna be called Google Play ground and
we've got some recent leaked photos of
what to expect them it's not a game it's
not a gaming console it's just another
game center ripoff it's the option for
you to play games with other people and
that's pretty much it you know not
really something groundbreaking it's
pretty much just Google catching up to
services that are already provided by
other smartphone platforms and that said
well it could probably be a very boring
Google i/o the event happens in two days
of stay tuned now let's continue talking
about samson those of you expecting the
samsung galaxy s
or zoom you know that apparent camera
that's also gonna be a phone it's
probably gonna replace the Galaxy camera
well I've got some leaked photographs
taken by that s4 zoom whatever they want
to call that thing links down below free
to watch the full resolution photos
which were ironically taken in 1080p not
sure why they're probably filming a
video why they were doing it but it was
a Saturn that we've also got the
confirmation from Verizon that the
galaxy s4 you know the usual device is
gonna be available at the carrier on may
23rd after a couple of the lays that we
know about so stay tuned for that
obviously I know that a lot of people
are waiting for the device on Verizon
and finally for the hot news of the day
we finally have some leaked press
renders of the Nokia Lumia 925 aka Kat
log and yes it has the aluminum chassis
we were expecting and a very big camera
lens as we saw in some leaked photos
recently and also in this new UK ad
that's recently teasing everything
that's gonna happen in the event
tomorrow which will most likely happen
around 5:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time
our own Anton di oggi is gonna be at the
event covering everything live and will
most likely have a roundtable to discuss
what we think about this device once the
event end so anyways that leads you to
the question of the day what are your
predictions for this Nokia Lumia 925
what are you expecting do you think that
Nokia is gonna leave it at the great
camera and the aluminum chassis or do
you think the node is gonna bring
something else like we already have at
the lowest Nokia Lumia 920 in my
particular case honestly if no-kiss just
planning to bring us another aluminum
chassis phone it's not gonna be that
popular in my wallet but leave us a
comment down below what are you
expecting is that enough for you when
you want some more let us know of course
it's always for an earlier scope of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's how long may she follow
