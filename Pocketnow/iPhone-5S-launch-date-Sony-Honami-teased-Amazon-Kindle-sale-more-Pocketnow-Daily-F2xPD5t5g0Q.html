launch for late-september Sony teases
their future Sony Honami as the best
they'll have and Amazon is working hard
on getting rid of their current Kindles
I'm high memory that I am I really can
remember when was the last time I saw my
kindle fire HD but this is out
daily let's say off with the official
news is yeah I may not be that much of a
fan of the kindle fire but that doesn't
mean that that's one of the most
affordable tablets in the market and
that i really do like kindle books just
read on something else and as it turns
out amazon is offering a fire sale of
the kindle fire lineup whatever and the
price drops are kind of significant so
links in the description for details
since this just last today and it's kind
of a great way to make yourself of a
portable tablet and then route it now
let's move the spotlight over to Samsung
as we know that they are the undeniable
king of Android which comes to sales and
just about everything and still we do
know about their Tizen platform and
we're still kind of confused we still
don't know if the Tizen platform is out
to somehow replace Android or if it's
there for emerging markets but that said
the company is now having this event on
October 27th or developers to pretty
much launch Tizen and we're still
wondering what we'll see at this event
so stay tuned i don't think they're
gonna be dropping android but hey you
never know aizen can run android apps
now let's talk about Sony there Sony
Honami is pretty much confirmed for
Aoife and Berlin we know that that's the
phone they're gonna be launching and the
company has already begun teasing the
phone and as a hashtag in the bottom of
their teasers they're saying that this
is the best Sony product yet so could it
be the 20 megapixel camera the rumors of
4k video recording or the build quality
of this phone there are so many things
on the table for this device so stay
tuned we're definitely going to be
covering everything live now let's talk
about Apple as their music event that's
pretty much dubbed the September music
event because it pretty much happens on
the same month every year and as it
turns out it's being rumoured that apple
will announce their next generation
iphones at this event and well we just
didn't know when these phones were going
to be launched but new credible reports
are stating that after
they get announced in the first phase of
September they will be launched for sale
on September 20th so preparator wallets
everyone and finally for the funny news
of the day let me be honest I've never
been a fan of Microsoft's Windows Phone
ads they're very funny and it has
nothing to do with the fact that they
mark appel ursa messing in these ads
because hey the mac vs pc ads were there
first right so let's just say that
Microsoft has been entitled to that
battle but sadly I always feel that they
never can figure out a way to portray
windows phone as a great solution all
they do is mock the competition and tell
you not to fight and to get Windows
Phone which is not telling me that
Windows Phone a superior until now they
finally launched this new ad today and
they make fun of Apple and Samsung in
the same way but they finally show you
the reason why you should buy a nokia
lumia 1020 up to the point where i'll be
honest i am even considering buying the
phone so that leads you to the question
of the day what do you personally think
about Microsoft's advertisement for
windows phone again in my particular
case I felt that they didn't nail the
point until now they finally figured it
out they finally figured out the fact
that people need to know why this phone
is better and yeah the Lumia 1020 is
better when it comes to the cameras only
