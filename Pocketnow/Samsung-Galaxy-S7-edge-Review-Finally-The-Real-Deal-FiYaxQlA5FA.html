reasons to buy the Galaxy s7 edge is
because hey it's a galaxy because your
phone should give you the freedom to do
more and it's the least that it should
do given the pretty penny that you're
investing for one but does it finally
live up to all the marketing hype I'm
high memory better with pocket now and
let's find out in our galaxy s7 edge
review brought to you by D brand
by now you've probably noticed that
every time that we've reviewed a galaxy
flagship there's always something
missing the galaxy s5 had expandable
everything but we hated its cheap
plastic and then the galaxy s6 brought
amazing build quality but then
expandability took a back seat never has
there been a galaxy that has been able
to balance the desires of everyone and
it seems that Samsung finally got the
memo the hardware story of our review
unit provided by AT&amp;amp;T follows on the
clear saying that if it's not broken
don't fix it or maybe just a little the
galaxy s7 edge continues last year's
legacy of premium metal and glass but
with many improvements Samsung has
decided to make this phone taller and
thicker and has compensated with an
extra set of curves in the back for
ergonomics the result is this surreal
feeling of holding something that seems
smaller than it visually is the glass on
glass design may be prone to
fingerprints but the black onyx finish
in our review unit is just gorgeous it
reminds us of the badass look of those
race muscle cars the quad HD AMOLED
display continues to Marvel with inky
blacks and deep saturation and also
addresses the greenish hue that we saw
in the borders of its predecessor the
screen is now larger at 5.5 inches
diagonal and adds to the surreal feeling
by giving you the impression of a
display without bezels the overall
effect is beautiful worth walking into a
store checking it out of you haven't
processing power is provided by either
the Snapdragon 820 or the Exynos 88-90
processor depending on your region
though the four gigs of RAM and 32 gigs
of storage come standard also standard
is the return of a few oldies but
goodies like microSD support up to 200
gigs ip68 water in this resistance also
returns providing protection for up to
30 minutes under a meter of water now
you technically can't swim with it for
hours
it's good for the average accident or
taking a few photos in the pool the only
thing that didn't make the cut is a
replaceable battery but it continues to
support fast and wireless charging and
as we'll discuss over the next few
minutes there is a good deal of juice
within this 3,600 milliamp hour power
pack within software is about the only
thing broken that got fixed and improved
at the same time android 6.0.1
marshmallow is doing the legwork below
Samsung's custom skin that sometimes is
called TouchWiz here and there it
follows on Samsung's legacy of visuals
and includes the same customization
options through the company's theme
store if you'd prefer to pimp it out or
also going for a stock look and feel
Samsung's always-on mode
finally takes advantage of its AMOLED
technology and stands out by allowing
colour wallpapers and different clock
and calendar options the only shortfall
here is that it isn't really built
around notifications like we currently
enjoy with Motorola or Nexus smartphones
I know right about now the comments will
be blazing over the lack of stock
Android but Samsung's UI is the only way
to take full advantage of this phone and
it also improves on a few things that
Google could do better it continues to
be the UI with most applications
supporting split window multitasking it
continues to be one of the few that
allows screen grid customizations for
more icons on your homescreen it's also
the only way that the edge will be more
than just the curve on the display
sliding on it reveals a customisable
list of panes that range from
application shortcuts to contact
shortcuts to tools and even to immediate
tasks you can be watching a YouTube
video while keeping an eye on your
Twitter feed and then calling on the
calculator when in need sure this was
very clunky a few years ago but Samsung
has now matured it to the point of being
useful so useful that I continue using
it on a daily basis
the result of all this premium hardware
and mature software blends into a very
pleasant experience in using this phone
navigating through menus is very fluid
save for the Flipboard menu that you can
always turn off app load times are quick
and so far I've been able to load a
total of 14 applications on RAM before
the phone decides to send any of these
to sleep kind of a record of you asked
me allowing for seamless multitasking
and rare app refresh when on the go this
experience extends the gameplay
something Samsung has rebuilt from the
ground up with game launcher you now
have the option to mute all alerts while
gaming lock the soft keys to avoid
pulling you away from your game minimize
it for a quick return when you're done
doing something else and you can now
even take a screenshot or record a video
of your gameplay the processing power
makes gameplay delightful and heat
dissipation seems top notch so far we've
tested the galaxy s7 edge from AT&amp;amp;T for
seven days in gloomy New York City
during that time call quality has been
rather deep through the earpiece with
colors also praising the audio quality
and noise cancellation
sadly the speaker placement continues to
be one of my pet peeves but its loudness
is welcome for regular media consumption
beta speeds over the AT&amp;amp;T network were
also great even when filming within this
gloomy Park in the surroundings of the
city now to answer the question that we
get the most the biggest shocker of all
of them is finally in the hands of the
Achilles heel of every Galaxy smartphone
its battery life this is the first time
that any galaxy smartphone we've tested
has reached the crazy five hours of
screen on time that's at least two hours
more than its predecessor and an hour
above phones that have shined in this
department before the complement of fast
and wireless charging takes over later
though we're sad to see that USB type-c
did not make the cut or even the faster
charging protocols
/ Qualcomm Samsung's camera combo is
also one of the best that we've tested
so far many complained about the
reduction of megapixels but this has
actually allowed for a brighter F 1.7
aperture on a wider 27 millimeter lens
and the new focus pixel technology that
really helps this camera shine in
low-light the results are simply
breathtaking color and saturation are
top-notch even in this gloomy portion of
the city
I know some of you are not fans of
saturation and for that you also get
manual modes in addition to a ton of
other camera options to choose from
video recording also lends to a
beautiful outcome with some of the best
stabilization features that we've seen
on a smartphone and it's also great to
see that this is one of the few Android
smartphones with a hyperlapse feature
for those of you that want even more
stabilization over a time lapse our own
Juan Carlos bag Mel just published the
full camera review of the galaxy s7 on a
separate video his trained eye is able
to give you a more in-depth look at what
this camera can do so make sure you also
catch this video for more information
and as our review period concludes it's
hard not to do so with an element of
surprise
Samsung has finally woken up to all the
criticism and has delivered one of the
best smartphone experiences that we've
tested hands-down sure there's no such
thing as the perfect smartphone and I
know many would say that you don't
really need a phone with a curved screen
back to the matter is you're right you
don't still you don't buy a phone this
expensive for the curves you do so
because over the last seven days at
least five people have come and asked me
if this is the new edge this is the
phone for those of you looking to stand
out and it's great that you can finally
stand out without putting up with
compromise from where I stand the Galaxy
s7 edge is one of the best experiences
that I've had with a smart phone and one
that I would highly recommend you give a
try
looking for a way to add some grip and
eliminate those fingerprints from your
new Galaxy s7 or s7 edge deep brand has
got you covered
