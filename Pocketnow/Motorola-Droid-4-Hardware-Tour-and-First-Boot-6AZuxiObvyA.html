recent video we showed you the unboxing
of the Motorola Droid 4 in this video
let's take a hardware walk around and
see what the first boot looks like ok so
let's take a look at the Motorola Droid
4 from Verizon this is the phone we
haven't booted it up yet we haven't even
finished taking all of the the plastic
off but let's look at and see what it
comes with first and foremost this fits
very nicely in hand we've got a 4 inch
qHD display now this means it's 960 by
540 so I'm not quite you know high
definition but it's still very nice very
very high quality screen is what we've
come to expect out of this on the back
we've got the Motorola logo Verizon and
the fact that this is 4G LTE we've got a
speaker this back is also relatively
textured so it's has a nice attack to it
it feels really grippy in hand up at the
top we've got a 1080p capable camera
with flash this is an 8 megapixel still
camera by the way on the top we've got
our headphone a headset jack and our
power button and what looks like it
might be a little mic at the top on the
side we've got our volume rocker now
that's over here underneath the index
finger on the front it tells you that
that's your volume up and down it also
doubles as a zoom on the front we have
another camera now that is a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera got our
main headset speaker there it's also
tells you that the power lock and
headset are in the front there's our
screen on the bottom we have actual real
buttons so not Ice Cream Sandwich on
this yet we have a search button back
home and menu with some verizon branding
again this comes off and we'll take that
off here in just a little bit we've got
our micro USB connector over on the side
and our HDMI connector on the side as
well so looking at that side that's the
only thing that's on that side does have
a little bit of a bump out there to
accommodate them
nice rounded area but since that's down
here in your poem you're not going to
notice that it's not going to be a
problem then of course you've got your
voice mic down at the bottom so that's
the walk-around of the phone this phone
however you'll notice how thick that is
relatively let's compare that to the
Galaxy Nexus you can see that it's a
little bit shorter quite a bit thicker
compared it that way in some places
about double the thickness all right set
the Nexus aside now looking at this the
reason it's so thick is it has a
slide-out keyboard now that sliding
mechanism is a little bit stiff right
now part of that is because of this back
sheet of plastic which is kind of
difficult to remove actually go ahead
and take that off and set it aside so
you've got a nice mirror finish back
there just kind of unusual but that's
why you've got that really really sticky
protective film on it we'll take the
protective film off that front as well
and now we've got this keyboard the keys
are very responsive and that they have a
nice ergonomic lay out some of the other
keyboards that we've seen like on the
Epic 4G have just a square grid that's
kind of hard to get to things it's not
that ergonomic this one has a nice
layout like that you've even got a
directional pad down there as well so
overall it looks pretty good we'll see
how it behaves let's go ahead and boot
it up before the first time push and
hold the power button now this is a
dual-core processor at 1.2 it does come
with Android 2.3.5 which is Gingerbread
it's got bluetooth of course Wi-Fi B G
and N five row keyboard like we
mentioned and of course we expect it to
be every bit as good as the previous
droids before it the nice Droid logo
here in the middle with the Droid audio
sound - to welcome you that nice
trademarked sound
now I'm feeling a few little vibrations
from the motor inside of it as it's
booting up and this is likely going to
take just a minute to get to of course
this now at the top we're preparing the
internal storage I don't have any
external storage but it does accept a 32
gig card go ahead and tap the droid to
continue this of course because it's a
CDMA phone has to take a little while to
activate the phone on the CDMA network
sometimes that can take a few minutes
other times not I'm gonna go ahead and
say okay select my Wi-Fi I'll type in
this password using the awesome keyboard
and I'll do that off camera here so I've
typed in the password and connected and
we'll go back to the phone setup now
part of the reason I do that is because
in my area my Wi-Fi is significantly
faster than 4G
so I like doing that as it's pulling
data down I can get it quicker and
without gobbling up my precious data
from my carrier now that doesn't really
matter if you have an unlimited plan but
if you don't want to be throttled you
know setting up a phone for the first
time usually entails an awful lot of
downloads I mean in my case I'm
downloading about a hundred apps if
they're you know two three megabytes
each that's 300 megabytes that died
pulling down over my data network so I'm
gonna go ahead and let this go and grab
a hold of this activate with the verizon
network and we'll pick right back there
where we left off
alright the phone activated and it asked
me to restart and now I'm back at the
touch the Droid to begin so we'll go
ahead and do that add a Google account
go ahead and do that as well I'll sign
in type in my username with this nice
keyboard and with the limited use that
I've had of the keyboard I'm relatively
impressed with it having a little bit of
a hard time finding the
the @ symbol and typing off-camera here
so nice having a 5th row because you
have your numbers up on the top and it's
kind of easy to to get that in there so
what you're basically accustomed to back
up room store we want to go ahead and do
that this usually takes just a minute to
go through and do hey we've added the
Google account we're done we'll hit
finish it's now setting up our backup
assistant which is something that that
the motorola droids have that some other
phones do not it's communicating with
the server which is taking a little bit
of time again where I am I'm connected
to 3G with relatively strong bars and
full bars on my Wi-Fi are all but full
bars just got some new email coming
through with the nice
trademark droid audio announcement there
and it's going through and syncing the
rest of my stuff now I really don't want
to do this right now so I'm going to
skip it it tells me how are you sure you
want to yes I want to skip for now you
probably don't want to you probably want
to go through and set all that up and I
recommend it because if you lose your
phone then pictures and whatnot you're
not going to be able to get back unless
you've synced them somewhere I use
Google+ to automatically synchronize my
pictures up to the cloud but this is
something else you could do now we've
shown you this on other things like the
Droid Razr for example has this account
setup screen and it has an awful lot of
accounts that you can set up very nice
it's all in one place we're not going to
set anything up here because it's just
input and credentials and that's kind of
boring for you to watch but we'll go
ahead and continue now next is our
privacy caution and data use and this
just warns you that hey it's got GPS and
stuff in here so you might actually be
telling people where you are yeah we
kind of know that but it warns you
anyway and we'll go ahead and say next
to that rural consent to all three of
these if it wants to accept that
agree agree and agree so all three of
the location options so if some videos
again we showed you this with the razor
you can see a basic setup on how to use
your phone video which is really neat
kind of a tutorial to show you how to
use your phone
my a Verizon mobile video and of course
just any additional videos go ahead and
take a look at that and just see how it
looks really quick how to set up
bluetooth using the Android Market and
web browsing okay great we're not gonna
watch any of those we'll go ahead and
finish and say done we're getting really
close to being able to use our phone for
the first time next thing we have is
just kind of a brief tutorial it tells
you about notifications how they're up
here touch and hold and options menu now
of course this is something that you can
tap and get instructions right there on
screen so if you're unfamiliar with that
with a Droid or with Android itself you
can learn how to use it really quick so
there you go I've got everything set up
I've got my droid for wallpaper logo
really nice scrolling and it's kind of
already set up some of my favorite
people that I can pull down to show who
they are pull up to close again very
fast and very fluid so really kind of
cool so there's a kind of a hardware
walk around in a first boot did take a
little bit of time but nothing that
we're not accustomed to with a CDMA
device like this of course we love the
the Droid family and will be impressed
to show you the full review and get that
all posted up at pocket now in a few
days as soon as we have well honestly a
few days with the phone in hand so we
can tell you how it works in the real
world what we like about it what we
don't like about it it's pros and cons
and whatnot so next video up is going to
be a video demo of the camera again
1080p HD video camera in there 8
megapixels still so we'll go ahead and
get those pictures posted up to the the
YouTube channel as soon as we can for
pocket now showing off the Motorola
Droid 4 by Verizon I'm at Joe the
