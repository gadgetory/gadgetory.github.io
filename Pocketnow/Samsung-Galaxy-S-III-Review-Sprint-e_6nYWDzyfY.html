routed it we've given you in-depth
feature coverage on every nook and
cranny of the Samsung Galaxy s3 and now
that it's seeing its stateside launch on
five US carriers it's time to do it
again this is Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is the video review
of the Sprint Samsung Galaxy s3
let's check it out as I wrote in my full
review which you can read at
pocketnow.com I started my mobile phone
life with a Samsung phone on Sprint 11
years ago so it's only right that I
should kick off my first review of the
summer with a Samsung phone on Sprint
now normally when there's a high profile
device launched across multiple US
carriers we get to take you through what
elements of this specific model differ
from the international version and from
its sister versions across the carriers
but Samsung now has enough brand power
with the galaxy brand to make every
galaxy s3 essentially identical across
all of the major carriers essentially
identical that means the same positives
an attractive pebble like design with
almost no straight lines display glass
that curves down into the body of the
phone an extremely pocket-friendly
slimness and lightweight there's also
the big bright LED notification light up
top invisible went off which I love and
the backlit menu and navigation keys
down here like Brandon I found the back
keys placement to the right of the HOME
key to be unintuitive unlike Brandon
though I kind of like how the light
diffuses through the casing on the
marble white version here in the dark
the notification light up here
illuminates the whole bezel making the
phone almost glow in the dark some will
find it cheap looking but I don't mind
it
in fact I love it being identical to its
international cousin though also means
the same negatives here as well a fake
looking brushed aluminum bezel with a
visible seam running
the middle and materials that while they
aren't actually cheap it's polycarbonate
under a hyper glazed coating still feel
cheap at times the device feels smooth
and comfortable in the hand but it picks
up fingerprints and skin oils very very
readily and it doesn't handle drops
terribly well either that plastic bezel
already has a nice looking chip in it
here on my international version after a
very slight drop also we've posted a few
pieces at pocket now about when a
smartphone can be too light for me the
galaxy s3 is definitely one of them to
my hands it just feels lower quality
than similar devices in its class like
the HTC One X as always though your
mileage will vary when it comes to
subjective stuff like this this is
probably the most subjective area of any
mobile phone review is the feel in hand
about half of the friends and family I
allowed to handle this phone agreed with
me that it felt a little too light a
little too cheap the other half thought
it felt fine some of them even said it
felt too heavy so you want to go to a
retail store and handle this in your
hand don't listen to me don't listen
anybody just go handle it for yourself I
can only tell you how it feels to me ask
them in the retail store if they can
give you a model to hold yourself so
that you don't have to deal with the
rubber band Eve tether on the back of it
and see how it feels to you before you
pull the trigger on it now popping off
the battery cover here we can catch one
of the only visible distinctions between
the international and the Sprint version
to the device the Sprint version does
not have a removable SIM that won't
matter much to people who don't swap
phones often but for you swap junkies
that may make a difference just like
with visual appearance the specs on the
Sprint Galaxy s3 are similar to its
international cousin with a 4.8 inch
Super AMOLED display and a 1.9 megapixel
camera here up front and on the back and
8 megapixel backside illuminated camera
with flash under the hood though is
where the differences come up the Sprint
Galaxy s3 gets rid of the quad core
Exynos processor in favor of a dual-core
Qualcomm s4 running at 1.5 gigahertz
that may sound like a downgrade but the
s4 is built on the superior crate
architecture using a 28 nanometer
process there's more on this in our
comparison videos and the full review
but the bottom line is that performance
doesn't suffer much at all that's all so
thanks in part to the extra gig of ram
samsung added to the US models and of
course using the Qualcomm CPU meant
Samsung could build in support for LTE
which will be a lot more relevant once
Sprint starts lighting up its first LTE
markets later this month for software
the galaxy s3 is running the same thing
on the Sprint version as it is on the
International Version it is Android 4.4
with the TouchWiz 5 nature UX layer on
top that means the same relatively
lightweight customized experience as the
International version with nice
additions to the UX like the toggle bar
here in the notification drawer which
Sprint has tweaked a little in their
version along with the improvements
Google brought to the table with Ice
Cream Sandwich like these side swipeable
notifications here to get rid of them
as for the nature UX elements well I've
said before that the analogy seems
forced and I haven't changed my mind
after about a month of exposure to the
skin I don't really need to hear the
sounds of a water droplet every time I
press fast-forward in the music widget
it got old very quickly fortunately
that's easy to change also easy to
change though you wouldn't know it right
away
necessarily is the app launcher and by
default instead of listing all apps
alphabetically like in stock ICS it
lists the out-of-the-box apps first
alphabetically followed by the apps
you've installed chronologically it's
not the most ideal situation it's good
that you can change this with the tap of
a menu button but frankly and call me
what you want
it took me watching Brendan minimums
review to realize that I know I know
amateur hour overall I found the device
to run quite smoothly even on intensive
tasks like downloading large files while
browsing large web pages pop-up play
works as well as it did on the
international version as well I share
many of the same thoughts as Brandon
does in his review of the International
Version TouchWiz is not at its best in
the email app Oh
or with the keyboard which is just a
disaster in its English implementation
the keyboard looks like the stock ICS
version but it's not autocorrect is very
very aggressive and it's impossible to
go back and modify a part of a word the
software assumes that you're making a
new word regardless of whether you're in
the middle of another one or not it'll
probably do fine for occasional textures
but that's not really the target market
of the galaxy s3 if it bugs you you'll
want to download a keyboard that's more
to your liking again thanks to the
nature of Android that's very easy to do
it's anybody's guess when Samsung will
bring jelly bean to the galaxy s3 but
the extra gig of ram in the US version
was meant to future-proof the device for
just that reason in any event the
software experience is better than good
enough as it is
just like on the international version
the camera performs excellently though I
wish HDR were the default setting
out-of-the-box as pictures taken in that
mode tended to be far superior to their
non HDR counterparts samsung's panorama
mode is also slightly easier to use than
on the Galaxy Nexus and stock ICS but it
also takes a very very steady hand burst
shot came in handy a few times and video
was crisp and smooth with great audio
using stabilization tended to make the
video more jumpy in my tests though
you'll want to experiment with your own
preferences now I tested the Galaxy s3
on Sprint between boston new york city
and eastern Long Island's so two very
urban areas and one very rural one and
generally my experience was positive the
whole way now sprint has not flipped the
switch on their LTE network in the
United States yet so all that testing
was done on their 1x EVDO 3G CDMA
network and you know I was surprised at
the quality voice calls were just fine
with good strong and clear audio callers
said I sounded fine as usual
speakerphone use was a little tinny but
acceptable data rates were pretty good
too and I was surprised at how well data
intensive applications worked
Spotify Pandora and Netflix in
particular did very well even though I
had such a limited bandwidth connection
it was only the image intensive apps
like Instagram that stuttered did I miss
LTE absolutely but it wasn't as painful
and experience on 3G as I thought it
would be now that's in well covered
areas mind you and when I went out into
the boonies or when I was in Yankee
Stadium with 40,000 other people trying
to upload a facebook picture the
performance was obviously worse also the
phone tended to run very hot onto the
galaxy s3 branding here it got very very
very hot in the palm much more so than
its international progenitor when it's
getting hot hunting for service or
fighting a high noise floor in a crowded
stadium the gs3 will run out of juice
quickly like any other smartphone really
but in normal conditions if you live in
a well covered area and you use smart
power management techniques like we've
covered in our earlier videos the Sprint
Galaxy s3 should last you longer than a
lot of Android powered phones some of
that is due to fancy features like smart
stay and some of it is thanks to the
beefy 2100 million power battery in any
case if you are a power user you'll want
to still carry around a spare battery or
a battery pack but the average user
should be able to squeeze a day out of
this device at least until LTE comes out
there's a lot I didn't cover in this
video review but not because it wasn't
worth covering it's because we've
covered a lot of it already in our
existing reviews and head-to-heads
but also there's so many more features
on this phone than on almost any other
phone it's amazing it's a bundle of new
features so here's what I liked I've
never handled a phone with this many
innovations packed into one casing make
sure a lot of them are gimmicky and not
all of them work perfectly but many of
them are very very useful and a lot of
them will turn heads also the basic and
advanced features required of modern
smartphones are all handled so well by
the GS 3 it's really an incredible
performer the new TouchWiz is so light
and so improved over its previous
iterations that I like it better than
the new HTC Sense which I liked a lot on
the HTC One X I love the camera on this
which is the best one I've used on an
Android smartphone and it blows my
Galaxy Nexus out of the water I like
that it can get through a day on one
battery charge if I'm smart about it
I like that if I don't know what a
feature does there's probably a tutorial
there to tell me about it and even
though it's pentile I love the big
bright saturated display I don't like
the hyper glaze coating the plastic
bezel masquerading as metal and the
unintuitive way some of the UI works I
don't like the dripping water sound
effects and I don't like how hot the
device gets when it's under a heavy
processing load and I don't like some of
the bloat Sprint has added in particular
it's very annoying loss of data message
that pops up every time I'm on the
subway and I lose coverage now would any
of that stop me if I were on Sprint and
in the market for a top-of-the-line
smartphone H know if you're in the
market for a smartphone don't mind 3G
data speeds for the time being and want
to be on one of the few carriers left in
the u.s. that gives you truly unlimited
data or at least doesn't throttle you
before five gigabytes the galaxy s3
deserves your top consideration as of
this week the galaxy s3 is available in
all Sprint sales channels on my
scoreboard the Sprint Galaxy s3 gets a
four out of five be sure to read my full
