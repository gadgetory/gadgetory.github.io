the first Windows Phone to feature
boomsound from HTC and it's sprints
first Windows Phone in over two years
but is it ready for primetime let's find
out I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is our video review of the HTC
8x t the only Windows Phone sprint had
ever carried until recently was the
arrive a side sliding QWERTY smartphone
also from HTC that made up the entirety
of Sprint's original Windows Phone 7
rollout back in March of 2011 the
carrier has led its Microsoft Collection
languish in the intervening years so the
HTC 8x T with its trimmer more modern
build has got to be a sight for sore
eyes if you're on America's third
largest network looking for a Windows
Phone so let's see how it holds up in
the usual four categories hardware
software camera performance and a few
test notes one of the most popular
viewer comments on our 8x T versus one
comparison video was the observation
that the 8x T should have been called
the 8 s T due to its decidedly more
mid-range specs it definitely resembles
HTC's earlier 8's more than the 8 X with
an off-color stripe highlighting the
bottom of the device and a 4.3 inch LCD
screen that's not gonna turn any heads
with its WVGA resolution 216 pixels per
inch isn't bad necessarily especially
not on Windows Phone but it definitely
isn't crisp enough to hold up next to
the higher resolution screens of the 8x
or Lumia 1020 and its colors really wash
out at certain angles it's a pretty
unremarkable panel which is a shame
because the device surrounding it feels
wonderful in the hand the soft touch
paint job comes in only one available
color on Sprint California blue and it
looks terrific the curved back nests
nicely in your palm the phone's nine
point nine millimeter thickness is a
perfect match for its 140 gram mass it's
just beautiful
the HTC branding is minimal and perfect
please set off by the phone's design the
buttons are where we expect them to be
and the camera bezel the little alien
looking bears an attractive steel finish
the phone really is stunning and it's
easy to see why HTC has won its share of
design awards down in engineering things
are a little more commonplace powering
everything is a dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 running at 1.4 gigahertz
and helped along by a gig of ram and a
paltry eight gigs of storage only 5.5 of
which are available to the user on first
boot thankfully there's microSD
expansion here for media but the same
can't be said for the 1800 milliamp hour
lipo battery which is embedded otherwise
it's a pretty tame cocktail of Bluetooth
4.0 Wi-Fi a/b/g/n
NFC and radios for Sprint's 3G CDMA and
4G LTE
there's nothing terribly special about
this phones spec load here's where we
normally follow that up by reminding you
that Windows Phone is a very consistent
and responsive platform no matter what
specs it's running on
well that is indeed normally true but
not sadly on the 8xt frankly this phone
has some significant performance issues
to begin with doing anything while
there's a music streaming app playing in
the background is a virtual guarantee of
lag and stutter try streaming anything
from Pandora or Spotify over cellular
even over LTE and then spend a few
minutes and Twitter more the People Hub
anywhere not only will the audio start
breaking up with pops and clicks as
though it's an old AM radio but the
phone's UI slows to a crawl too with
animations grinding to a skittering halt
and key press is not always logging
correctly it seems to happen
irrespective of what media app you're
using whether you're on headphones or
speakers and weather beats is enabled or
not sometimes it happens when you're not
even playing music at all the phone will
just bog down for no apparent reason
only to then go on behaving normally for
a few minutes before doing it again well
that's the most serious issue it's sadly
not the only one we've also run into
problems on phone calls we'll save you
the jump down to test notes and just
tell you hear that phone call
performance itself is only so-so to
begin with on both sides callers said we
sounded just okay and to us people came
through plenty loud but muffled but
that's not the issue the problem is that
the 8xt
periodically turns the screen on while
you're talking for no reason
causing your cheek to trigger the
speakerphone or conference call toggles
or even hit the end call key if these
sound like the kind of issue is found on
a defective phone we thought so too
so we reached out to HTC for a
replacement demo unit and to their
credit the company immediately sent one
over but the new phone bears the same
exact set of problems it seems pretty
clear the 8x tease software which is the
production release packing gtr2 is
pretty seriously undercooked
this phone is desperately in need of an
update to correct these issues because
as of now it's easily the least
enjoyable Windows Phone 8 experience
we've ever had it's possible some of
those bugs are coming from HTC's heavier
than usual customization of Windows
Phone which in some areas is actually
quite welcome
the camera is a big one the 8 xt packs a
fairly typical 8 megapixel BSI sensor
around back but it's the software that
makes it stand out from other Windows
Phone shooters the viewfinder is
essentially a Windows if ocation of
HTC's awesome viewfinder from the one
with many customization options filters
and special shooting modes like HDR
along with HTC's time saving persistent
double shutter keys for Stills and video
that quick draw video trigger helped us
capture this rapidly passing train is
something we wouldn't have been quick
enough to snag had we been using the
standard Windows Phone viewfinder the
video itself is quite nice as well as
you can see here and in our separate
1080p sample uploaded to YouTube and the
still image results are quite nice as
well
colours are typically nice and rich and
with enough light the camera can deliver
some pretty fine results outdoors
especially if you make use of the
various shooting modes available and
maybe you fiddle with a filter or two
here and there just for fun indoors
pictures are a little less impressive
sometimes overexposed with edges a
little blurrier and
a little more washed out a deluxe
edition camera this is not but for the
typical smartphone user it should do
fine the front-facing camera a 1.6
megapixel unit is as usual nothing to
write home about the 8xt performed well
in terms of reception keeping pace with
the sprint HTC One as we darted to and
fro across Boston over the course of
five days throughput was pretty
inconsistent on LTE though jumping from
download highs in the low 20 megabits
around midnight to comparatively
sluggish 2 megabit speeds around rush
hour and everywhere in between one of
the Halo features of the 8 xt is
boomsound HTC's forward firing speakers
paired with Beats Audio the first time
such a combination has ever been seen on
Windows Phone and it works brilliantly
space is fast
Kappa I'm sure you're aware that only
one out of every 43,000 planet supports
intelligent life sound is loud and clear
quite a bit of bass and almost no
distortion even at maximum volume if the
screen were a bit bigger this would make
the perfect phone to take in a movie on
Netflix but even as it is it's a very
enjoyable viewing experience thanks to
those speakers and audio performance
over the included earbuds is quite nice
as well including FM radio listening
which we found surprisingly static-free
just keep an eye on your battery when
you're blasting that media though the
lower capacity pack does indeed result
in a pretty spare runtime with heavy use
we ran the thing dry and quite a bit
less than a day and the phone's battery
scored lower in the WP bench exhaustion
tests than most other devices more
impressions in our full written review
head pocket now the Windows Phone
ecosystem has been growing steadily and
we were happy to see Nokia's here suite
which is a huge value add as HTC has yet
to match Nokia's custom titles in volume
or in usefulness that said HTC's custom
hub adds some nice flair to the
homescreen provides a convenient
shortcut to news weather and stocks in
addition to an instant visual
distinction from other windows phones of
course there's a usual sprint bloatware
here to which you'll find either useful
or if not at least easy to uninstall we
want to like the 8 xt as much as any
other mid-range Windows Phone we really
really do it's hardware is beautiful its
camera software is fun and its boomsound
implementation is even better than on
the HTC One but it's software just
doesn't measure up now is the 8x T the
first phone we've encountered with a
laggy or buggy UI no absolutely not
but we've come to expect a minimum
standard from Windows Phone if nothing
else you can usually count on phones
running the platform to at least be
snappy and mostly reliable regardless of
their specs so the 8x T's failure to
deliver in that area is jarring and
frankly it's a big surprise coming from
the same people who made the excellent
sense
suite for the HTC One can you live with
the 8x T in its current form probably if
you keep all your music hosted locally
and don't mind occasionally putting your
calls on speakerphone by accident but
those are sacrifices you shouldn't have
to make especially on Sprint's first new
Windows Phone in over two years a
software update would fix all this and
we hope it does but we have no way of
knowing when HTC will get around to that
if it happens we'll update our written
review at pocket now for now if you're
married to Sprint and dead set on
Windows Phone the 8 xt is your only
option and you can get it for 99 bucks
on contract through sprint or at much
lower prices down to even a penny at
third-party retailers if you're dying
for a Windows Phone 8 device and you're
open to switching carriers though there
are many other better windows phones out
there that deliver a much more polished
experience we give the HTC 8x T a 6.5
out of 10
