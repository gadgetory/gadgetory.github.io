SmartWatch ever
Motorola's Moto 360 isn't the first to
shoehorn a smartphone sidekick into a
round chassis but it is the first
Android wear device to do so does that
mean you should run out and buy it right
now well that's what we're here to find
out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our motorola moto 360 video
review we've already reviewed the
software driving Google's SmartWatch
platform Android wear and there's not
much different here in that respect what
really sets the Moto 360 apart is it's
hardware that includes a stainless steel
casing rater to ip67 for dust and water
resistance whore we another on the
conventional wristband and Gorilla Glass
3 display protection on the face the
display underneath is a large backlit
LCD with pixels stretching all the way
to the edge where the glass is beveled
slightly to meet the casing the display
is a bit lower in density than some of
its competition which means Google's
cards use up more of the watch face than
we like the more talked-about flaw in
the circular display is an equipment bay
at the bottom which gives the screen
what some have called a flat tire look
with certain watch faces we don't really
mind but you might there's a single
button on the right side with crisp
snappy feedback and on the back cover a
heart rate sensor sits nestled within a
wireless charging coil that eliminates
the need for external connectors it all
comes together in a sleek and beautiful
if big package that weighs in at 49
grams comes in silver or black and goes
with just about anything you wear
alongside it it might surprise you to
learn that counterbalancing this
cutting-edge exterior is a 4 year-old
processor on the inside the OMAP 3 from
Texas Instruments now it is backed up by
modern amounts of RAM and onboard
storage and really how much horsepower
do you need on a SmartWatch still we're
a little put off that this $250 device
is powered by the same silicon that
drove the Droid X in 2010
thankfully that seasoned chipset doesn't
often affect the day-to-day use of the
moto 360 it suffers from the occasional
hiccup sure but not really more so than
the other Android wear watches we've
tested and it has all the basics just as
well it buzzes your wrist for
notifications except voice commands and
dictated replies it measures your heart
rate and counts your steps it tells you
your next appointment and it plugs into
compatible third-party apps and of
course it tells you the time using
almost any watch face you can think of
it does all this so you don't have to
take your phone out of your pocket quite
as often which sounds like the ultimate
first world problem yes but is actually
a real compelling convenience once you
get used to it in particular navigating
to a destination from your wrist is very
handy when biking or even walking and
dismissing an inbound call with a candid
text response is also useful if you're
in the middle of something
unfortunately Android wear is still very
much a one-point ho product most of the
issues we complained of in our Android
wear review earlier this summer remain
like the inconsistent nature of the
cards interface the fact that your app
list is buried all the way at the bottom
of the least accessible menu and the
software's tendency to send a text
message while you're still dictating it
this software is also a stickler for
specific phrasing saying set a timer for
10 minutes will do just that
but saying start a 10 minute countdown
will make the watch try to open an app
on the phone we've never heard of and
don't even have installed that's because
the watch recognizes the start keyword
as an app launch command but still
saying set a 10 minute countdown just
takes you to a Google search so does
what movies are playing nearby
a question that in Google now on the
phone gives you a useful list some of
this just comes down to remembering what
to say and how to say it but Android
wear is still not as smart as it needs
to be to deliver consistent convenience
the Moto 360 hardware does its best to
make up for that in the details its
ambient light sensor automatically
adjusts the display brightness the
Motorola connect app lets you customize
watch faces to suit your own tastes and
you can also plug in specific data about
your health to give the watch a better
idea of how to track your exercise and
the charging pedestal may not be the
most portable device but its bedside
clock mode sure is slick you won't want
to get far away from that charger for
long but the 360 isn't the battery hog
we first suspected at least not
relatively speaking
keeping the screen on all the time will
definitely kill it faster we only
managed 11 hours of use in that state
but turning ambient screen off and
relying on either the accelerometer or
the side button to wake it when we need
it the 360 does much better one day
after 12 hours of moderate use and mild
notification traffic we still had half a
charge remaining at the end of the day
that's obviously not terrific but it is
par for the course with Android wear
watches so there's a lot of compromise
to the Moto 360 and for 250 dollars it's
not going to be worth it for everyone
you can certainly find more limited but
more reliable smartwatches
outside the Android wear ecosystem and
for cheaper but if you're looking for
the tightest possible integration with
your Android phone and you're looking
for a beautiful build to boot well you
just can't do better than this device
the Moto 360 lives up to the hardware
hype about as well as we could ask for
now all we have to do is wait for
Android wear to catch up for more on
Android wear other Motorola devices and
every other smartphone tablet and
SmartWatch we can get our hands on
