and we got a big unboxing today we were
in London to meet it personally but now
it's finally here the Samsung Galaxy s3
follow-up to the Samsung Galaxy s2 from
last year which was a best-seller now we
have absolutely no doubt that the galaxy
s3 here will outsell the Galaxy s2 in a
matter of months as it's been the most
anticipated Android phone of the year so
without any further ado this is the new
Samsung Galaxy s3 it's Tony and it's
pocket now unboxing
so we have the box here which is a
classic white carton box it's neutral
but those of you who got the Samsung
Galaxy s2 might found this box
resembling the one from last year
there's nothing on the top except for
the Galaxy S free branding nothing on
the sides but on the back it has the
specs which you all should know by now
it features a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
processor it's a Samsung Exynos
processor which is smoked the NVIDIA
Tegra 3 but we'll get to that in another
video
it also features a four point eight inch
huge HD Super AMOLED screen which is
also great for deep blacks it has an 8
megapixel camera one gigabyte of RAM and
a 2100 milliamp hour battery which
should give you enough juice ok let's
put it down break it open and see what's
in the box and for that we need our
special tool it's not the obligatory
scissors this time it's the Swiss Army
knife let's break the seal here and open
the box no there's a secondary seal we
break it to and Open Sesame
voila there's the samsung galaxy s3
which we'll put to the side but only for
a moment because we know we're
interested in the phone and not in the
box itself which by the way is full of
cartons let's get this out of the way
here I just pulled out what do we have
here we have some more carton and
literature which this one is in Romanian
because it came from Romania but yours
should be English or your native
language headphones white we have your
USB cable for syncing and charging we
have your buds for your headphones we
have the USB plug the USB charger with
the USB port on it it's black simple
nothing out of the ordinary let's put
that to the side too and your battery
which should be one of 2100 milliamp
hours let's just find the inscription
there we go
focus 2100 million power battery which
should give you enough juice enough with
the packaging let's take a look at the
samsung galaxy s3 which we will place
for the moment side-by-side with the HTC
One X so that you can get a feeling for
for the dimensions there we go they're
approximately the same son√≠s but we
have
4.7 inch screen on the left and a 4.8
inch on the right and in terms of
thickness they are approximately the
same I mean give or take 1 millimeter
it's safe to assume that they are both
the same let's take the 1 X to the side
the s3 is light it's very light but of
course the battery is not inserted yet
but even with the battery it will be
light let's take a look at the hardware
on it we have your speaker grille right
on the top above the samsung branding
and to its right we have your sensors
your webcam and your proximity and light
sensor we have a 4.8 inch Super HD
AMOLED screen which should be great for
deep blacks and at the bottom we have
your home button which generated a lot
of buzz regarding the US version to the
left and to the right we have the 2
capacitive buttons which light up
there's a shiny strip of chrome going
along the edges and also on the side
which gives it a nice feel and it also
gives it a little bit of curvature
feeling now since we're on this part
let's take a look at what we have here
power button that's your power button
but there's no dedicated camera button
unfortunately the bottom holds in micro
USB port for syncing and charging plus a
microphone on the left there's your
volume rocker for volume up and volume
down and the top holds a secondary
microphone for noise canceling 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and this
little place here is used to peel off
the back and since we're talking about
the back let's take a look at the camera
eight megapixel camera with an LED flash
and the speaker let's put it down break
it open and sir the sim and the battery
and we have the back cover peeled as you
can see it's a plastic thin layer of
white plastic if you're afraid not to
break it don't be it's rather flexible
as long as you don't bend it too much
you should be just fine
let's take a look at the phone with its
back peeled off this huge part right
here holds the 21 hundred million power
battery beneath that there's the micro
sim and microSD card slots now this
phone accepts a micro SD for memory
expansion unlike the HTC One X which has
32 gigs of RAM but no micro SD card slot
for expanding it
of course this version of the galaxy s3
here has 16 gigabytes of memory that's
why you need to
insert a micro SD card for expansion but
you can also go with a 32 gigabyte
version 64 gigabyte version they have
that let's insert the battery inside it
let's just pop in the SIM card which is
already cut by me to a micro sim
dimension put the back in its place
pop it back all the way around just like
that should fit nicely and let's power
it on and there we go Samsung Galaxy s3
will get back after the setup and we're
here finishing the setup process we just
hit the finish button as we should be
welcomed by the new know we have some
tutorials dismissed them yeah this is
the new TouchWiz user interface Samsung
is calling it touch with UX nature and
as you can see it's pretty fluid going
back and forth let's hit the app button
some more tutorials go back hit the
button again there we go as you can see
it's rather fluid going back and forth
between the panels which was not the
case with all of the touch with user
interfaces Samsung was using for
instance on the galaxy s2 and on the
galaxy note let's turn it off we'll have
lots of more coverage we're going to be
comparing it to other devices so stay
tuned if you liked this video give us a
thumbs up this was an time from
