devices this year which will generate as
much buzz as the phone we're reviewing
today my own personal experiences with
the brand I was very skeptical of the
company start especially critical of
early advertising campaigns but over
several generations this label really
has evolved to represent what their
slogans claim can you deliver a mere
flagship great experience at a
significant price reduction as vicious
as this market has become the oneplus 5
cuts precious few corners but can it
still excite fans like earlier oneplus
phones could when novelty was on their
side while starting off with design
let's get this out of the way right now
this phone looks an awful lot like
another phone out there well yeah sure
that one but it also looks like another
phone - in my R 11 first impressions I
had this to say this seems to be the
final evolution of this style as other
companies are pushing boundaries in
other ways we wouldn't disagree from the
comments we're short again about this
phone in similarities with other devices
and this runs doubly true for the
oneplus 5 the aesthetic is as evolved as
it really can be screen size aspect
ratio front fingerprint sensor camera
bolt we've lived through three
generations of similar Apple products so
this is as low risk as a manufacturer
can get a phone that aims for a premium
feel but won't rock the boat I'm not
angsty about the oppo there's actually
something charming about sharing a shell
like a joint effort between Porsche and
Volkswagen same frame different features
different trim different markets words
like derivative or copycat might be
bandied about but I do have to give one
plus credit for yet again showing how
much space Apple wastes for the same
screen size I'm definitely being kind
but there is a small moral victory to
applaud that and I just dig matte finish
phones a nice satiny layer over a
gracefully contoured back with faucets
carved into the sides for better grip
thankfully oneplus was kind enough to
send over some sample cases so
I can replace the sandstone texture I
enjoyed so much on the oneplus 2 it
makes the camera testing a lot easier
knowing I have a good grip on the thing
the tech inside is on point but doesn't
push the boundaries much on the oneplus
experience welcomes newest chipset packs
a great punch especially when paired
with fast storage and energy efficient
Ram
these guts are top-tier but some folks
might be frustrated by the dual SIM card
tray instead of expandable storage or
the lack of enhanced water resistance or
durability certifications and all this
horse power is paired again with a 1080p
display we've come to expect a higher
pixel density on proper Android
flagships though an HD screen is plenty
fine to make it through your daily
business so much so that even Samsung
now delivers a significantly more
expensive phone out of the box with a
reduced resolution AMOLED panels deliver
that tasty contrast ratio accentuated by
the dark scene included with oneplus
software pushing a nice color pop photos
and videos our consumer pleasing and
outdoor viewing is better than average
in auto brightness mode highlighted for
the oneplus 5r separate night time in
reading modes to ease the strain on your
eyes you can dial in a bit more of an
amber tone or select apps to shift into
an almost Kindle like state it's a nice
consideration for those late night
insomnia credit sessions and expanding
on the software oxygen OS is a
wonderfully evolved experience consider
it stock Android refined only minor
touches here and there to differentiate
with a minimum of green installed
software really clean a blank slate for
the consumer to customize as they see
fit a too handy additions mobile gamers
will certainly appreciate a do not
disturb mode setting filters for which
notifications can disrupt your boss
battles and for folks worried about
privacy the file manager now has a
secure box locked down by a pin or
fingerprint to keep your sensitive
materials away from prying eyes if there
is any concern software wise it's in an
area we can't properly predict and
that's future support we can be
confident that this phone will be in
line for Android oh but the recent
announcement that the oneplus 2 will not
be receiving nougat was disappointing it
introduces a touch of doubt as to how
this company might support future
products
turn back to happier news lien software
in HD resolution it's no great shot that
this phone is a screamer the most fluid
UI performance I've yet experienced on
this chipset I'm not sure how much
software really benefits from this
quantity of RAM but it's sure-footed and
predictable in multitasking situations
it chews up daily communication in
social networking and it's more than
capable of brute forcing its way through
a poorly optimized game like Marvel
future fight and oneplus touts improved
carrier reception and MIMO Wi-Fi
antennas for better wireless performance
real-world it didn't let me down in
tricky reception areas around Los
Angeles though both LTE and Wi-Fi
consistently fell behind a glass back
phone like the LG G 6 we dig deeper into
camera tech in our separate real camera
review but as a brief summation here if
you thought the overall phone Hardware
looked familiar
the camera will also create some deja vu
the dual lens setup opting for a
standard view and the equivalent of a 2
X optical zoom all round we saw very
good photo performance in a variety of
shooting situations it still falls
behind the fastest performers but
improvements to autofocus over the 3t
are certainly appreciated and refinement
to image processing produces some
stellar JPEGs even in low-light
situations
dual cameras deliver fun software blur
here in a portrait mode almost
completely copy pasted from the iPhone
we wish there were a bit more control
over this effect but it is well
implemented
unfortunately video takes us a small
step backwards with only software
stabilization and this is not available
when shooting UHD it's a shame as we've
seen what older chipsets can produce
when cropping and adjusting the frame
the oneplus 5 should be more than
powerful enough to match that smoothness
when switching to 1080p output is
deliciously fluid supporting my
hypothesis that hybrid software and
hardware stabilization is less desirable
but this comes at the expense of clarity
and resolution if there's any area we're
hoping for improvement on a future
update it's an adding stabilization to
UHD video while a significant focus has
been applied to camera tech we're happy
to hear that audio has also received
some attention
your performance won't wow anyone for
being a bottom firing mono solution it's
about as good as a single speaker can be
when not cleaning that okay no the one
plus five continues a track record of
including above-average headphone
performance new for 2017 retreated to
true blue 32-bit playback and this is
another phone added to our list of
gadgets which can properly produce
frequencies of sound that most dogs
cannot hear in terms of quality it's
exciting to see a less expensive phone
which produces almost exactly the same
numbers as the improved Galaxy s8 and
any differences we could detect we're
well within the margin of error better
still the amp on the five takes a small
step up over our 1 plus 3t making this
phone ever so slightly better at driving
nicer headphones then most of the
current flagship competition very well
done indeed but there have been some
concerns over the slightly smaller
battery in the 5 over last year's 3 T 1
plus claims the more power-efficient
chipset and RAM should more than make up
that difference and we'd say this
philosophy is on point in our media test
the oneplus 5 posted the best numbers of
any phone we've yet tested this year it
won't cross over into the marathon
territory of some bigger battery devices
but it shouldn't leave you stranded
during the day under moderate use in the
event you do need to recharge you can
also expect some of the fastest juicing
around thanks to the - charger not only
does this rapidly increase your runtime
it manages to keep the phone relatively
cool while topping off so let's wrap
this up where's that leave us with the 1
+ 5 I'm very happy with this initial
experience the mission of a company like
oneplus is to balance competitive
pricing against delivering as few
compromises as possible
reviewing the more expensive model
we're treated to performance which
exceeds our expectations and with a
retail price some $200 less than a
Galaxy sa you really do feel like most
of your money is going towards what's
inside the phone the trade-offs are
acceptable for most daily use scenarios
you don't get the most pixel dense
screen you don't get expandable storage
or water resistance you don't get the
most fashion-forward gadget any of those
could rightfully be deal breakers
depending on the consumer but the lower
price helps take some of the angst off
that balance of features for the dollar
is critically important and oneplus
makes a very compelling argument for
your money as always thanks so much for
