g6 coverage right now our review unit is
still on pre-release software but we're
getting a pretty good idea of what this
camera hardware can do we're going to go
ahead and push forward with our real
camera review just acknowledging at the
front of this video that there's a giant
asterisk as to the performance of this
phone and if there are any significant
changes once the software has been
updated to release software we'll go
back and revisit what those changes
might be buckle up folks we've got a lot
of ground to cover and I'm gonna move
pretty quick now on the third iteration
LG's dual camera solution brings most of
our favorite features from the b20
improving a few things while also taking
a small step back in a few other areas
but our goal here is to see if the
combined pros and cons add up to a great
consumer experience starting off with
exposure and saturation
it would seem LG is taking some small
steps towards delivering more on candy
subtle tweaks to JPEG processing pushing
up saturation for that nicer color pop
on the hole it's a successful
implementation as we're in an era where
people are more easily impressed by auto
HDR processing modes but we do see where
the saturation can sometimes kill
details in warmer colors looking at the
raw file of a yellow flower we lose
almost all of the structure in the
middle when converting it to a JPEG this
goes double for exposure most phones
tend to meter brighter than they need to
again people more impressed by bright
colorful images but this combo of slight
overexposure and juicy saturation can
cause Reds to sizzle and clip details
and highlights have stopped reduction
brings back pedal detail and reigns in
that magenta
crisp eNOS the wide camera is now more
competitive a better sensor than what we
find on the b20 images are well exposed
and we don't suffer the same graininess
as we did on the V 20 though in metering
for a much wider image we generally see
slightly warmer images from the standard
camera than from the wide which brings
us to white balance in keeping with the
eye pleasing approach LG leans slightly
warmer for that white balance most of
our shots were captured in really warm
California afternoon light and the g6
plays with this deliciously happily in
an overcast shot the phone avoids
to blue appropriately playing with pink
pedals though the clouds are pushing a
cooler tone overall and taking a quick
look at the raw file these aren't
retaining as much info as previous
phones we've reviewed purposely
overexposing to stops clipped highlights
can't be brought back down and editing
your metering on this phone is very
important as your range of editing is a
bit more limited happily the wide sensor
is improved over the V 20 and these
files will deliver nicer results than
LG's workhorse phone now we won't spend
a lot of time on the app layout it's
nearly identical to the V 20 and this is
one of the best photography apps
available on any phone today you can
make the app as simple as possible or as
feature complete as needed even down to
video controls which were completely
absent on other premium phones there's
still a number of fun features like the
pop-out mode we can't use these cameras
to attain a huawei like wide aperture
but we can produce a collage of sorts
also the tall g6 display gives us some
fun composition tools where you can
easily line up shots based on previous
photos and square shots can be playfully
displayed side by side your composition
window now LG zoom is well improved the
action is a lot smoother for the image
preview and while shooting video sliding
from the wide camera to the standard
there is still a bit of a pop
unavoidable as the camera sensors are
far enough apart for subtle changes in
the angle of view but it's an almost
seamless action in use this is a great
range for a phone camera from the wide
sensor to full software crop zoom on the
main sensor UHD video is grainy at full
zoom but it's not completely degraded
and the whole zoom range is far more
useful than phones that only focus on
zooming in one area where we see a small
step back with the g6 the smaller sensor
in this phone produces a slightly edgier
busier bouquet than the v20 a byproduct
of a sensor with a smaller surface area
it's more than competitive against an
iPhone with a similar sensor size
falling just behind always shooter but
larger sensor phones will produce
prettier bouquet we were a little
concerned that LG dropped the laser
module for the focusing system but it
really hasn't affected our day to day
shooting we see nearly the same focus
acquisition sometimes it's actually
faster than what the v20 could achieve
an accuracy hasn't been affected from
what we can find we do have the same
gripe about focus reporting though
especially
macro distances where the phone will
report a lot though it's obviously
missed the subject you're trying to
capture in making standard photos
juicier LG is also pushing brightness
and HDR mode it's still one of the
slower phones at capturing multiple
shots making it more likely that moving
subjects are going to blur but we often
just see shadow brightening in most of
these HDR outputs happily we don't see
highlights pushed as hard a little more
clipping over normal shot but the main
focus really is on boosting shadow
detail it would be nice if we could rein
in highlights just a bit more a quick
look at panorama and LG continues to
offer fantastic image stitching with an
easy process of panning across the scene
again very flexible from standard view
to wide - panning across a bold image
moving to a smaller sensor though puts a
crimp on low-light performance and
almost all of our indoor and night shots
we see an unpleasing combo of noise
reduction in sharpening viewing photos
as their total their well exposed in
lively night shots but there's very
little room to crop zooming in a little
we see a very hard patterned texture if
there's any area where software
improvements might benefit to g6 it's on
adjusting this algorithm and I suspect
that when this phone is updated for
consumer release we'll likely have to
take a second look at these kinds of
samples and I hate taking selfies but
the g6 maintains a solid front camera
with normal and wide options it'll get
the job done for a group shot has the
requisite odo modes to blur your skin
and the 1080p video captured is
reasonable enough for a little light
vlogging and looking at video from the
rear camera you know the important stuff
we see similar color processing and
exposure to still photos but LG tends to
produce a slightly flatter video than
competitors especially when shooting in
manual mode the idea that if you want to
edit these you can apply additional
contrast and saturation so the files out
of the phone are pleasant enough 1080p
video files suffer from a little
additional sharpening just reinforcing
that we're at that point to transition
over to UHD for any video you might
actually care about the G fix delivers a
very high bitrate
ultra high def hovering around 400
megabytes per minute of video the only
complaint we might illustrate is again
tied with sensor size we're indoors even
with our studio
light setup we see a bit more grain in
the sample than we prefer being able to
dial in your own settings for shutter
speed and ISO can help tame what the
camera would otherwise produce on its
own video also gives us a better look at
image stabilization and we see the
traditional LG lens shake and shimmy
while walking the phone does a better
job of smoothing the scene out than
previous LG's maybe due to that smaller
sensor but there's a busyness to nearly
all of our handheld shots shooting 1080p
we can use software stabilization in
conjunction with the hardware and LG has
improved on the jittery look from the
v20 but we're stuck with dull detail
from cropped in 1080p video the
exception of course is shooting from the
wide sensor which has no Hardware
stabilization there's significantly more
twist from the UHD video and free of the
lens warping aspects of the hardware oh
is the software stabilization is
actually quite nice now talking audio LG
maintains some of the best audio capture
available and while we lose the ability
to change the direction of the mics we
still have controls for volume limiting
and a low-cut filter the g6 is easily
one of the best solutions for capturing
high quality audio but it should be
mentioned that videos shot with the
hi-fi option are more difficult to work
with if you need to edit
we won't spend a lot of time on this but
slow-mo isn't much improved processing
from the phone shooting 120 frames per
second one-quarter speed looks okay but
it won't unseat any of the leaders in
this arena like the Pixlr the iPhone and
I wouldn't much bother slowing down
beyond four X's the data just isn't
there
the video just starts skipping when you
try to stretch to 1/8 so let's wrap this
up where's that leave us with the camera
on the LG g6 we always have to balance
compromises against benefits and LG's
largely on the right track here where
the V Series represents an
uncompromising approach to content
creation the G Series phones are a bit
more mainstream move to a smaller image
sensor introduces a few compromises
we'll certainly have to revisit low
light performance in a future video but
overall this phone is second only to
this phone in terms of real-world
flexibility the auto mode traditionally
a weakness on LG cameras is more
competitive against other smartphone
rivals the wide-angle shooter is
definitely improved over the g5 in the
p20 and the manual mode here absolutely
shamed those competitors which are
focused solely on auto processing and
HDR and what's exciting is that there's
less artificial software separation
between the G and the B Series now where
the g5 omitted those excellent video
controls the g6 doesn't try and front
that lame software split instead
Hardware differentiates these two
platforms where we have the larger image
sensor and the better microphone array
on the more expensive handset well g6
top our list of best shooters of 2017
well it's tough to say it's a little too
early to tell but these early results
are definitely encouraging and it's
certainly wetting our appetite for what
we might see in terms of evolution on a
future the 30 phone later in the year
and that's as good a place to end as any
