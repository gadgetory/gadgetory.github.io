Apple watch won't be any good Snapdragon
810 overheating rumors are being put to
rest by an OEM and what set finally
reaches the pc sort of I'm hi Mary vera
and I am just a day away from being able
to put this cold to rest with some
tequila this is outdated
yesterday Microsoft took over the
official news and we've got some more
today a lot of the questions that were
left after the events were where is a
Windows Phone flagship being launched
we're only seeing entry-level phone so
far that are ready for Windows 10 and
microsoft executives are already
claiming that we will see a flagship but
any time this summer yeah I know summer
that far so if you're waiting for
windows phone via Lumia 930 now one
platform that's silently being put to
rest is Windows RT it seems as Microsoft
this just come on record to state that
the surface our team will receive some
sort of an update but not necessarily
Windows 10 sort of like would happen
between Windows Phone 7 Windows Phone 8
where we had windows phone 7.8 wasn't
really Windows Phone 8 but it looked
like it and apparently that's going to
be the case for the surface RT which
pretty much means that Windows RT will
have the same look for any other product
that's running that the terrible
operating system hopefully you can sell
that thing right now on ebay and get
something new and speaking of problems
we've heard that Samsung doesn't want to
bring the Snapdragon 810 processor on
the galaxy s6 because of overheating
issues which is really interesting since
we use the LG G flex 2 at CES and didn't
experience any overheating issues with
that processor and that's really what
the news are about LG has just come on
record to state that there aren't any
overheating issues with the processor
and it just seems that Samsung is just
using this excuse to get on the exit
noseband this time and use its own
proprietary processor going forward I
don't know how good that's going to be
but we never liked exitos processors
aren't our reviews so let's see if
that's gonna bring a good future to
Samsung products going forward now in
some good news for some if you are a
whatsapp user which there are apparently
700
users in the world that are and I'm a
big avid user of it and you've been
wanting to use it on your computer well
it reached the pc in a way its web
whatsapp com it's really the web-based
whatsapp but it's really not a separate
client it actually mirrors what's on
your phone up to the point where your
phone has to connect to the computer for
this to be able to work which is cool
you get a bigger keyboard to be able to
message and the UI is really cool the
problem is that number one it only works
in chrome number two it doesn't work
with the iphone and the biggest user
base is the iphone apparently there are
platform limitations and whatsapp will
apparently address these in an update
hopefully and finally for the very
disappointing news of the day those of
you waiting for the Apple watch by the
end of March it seems that you're going
to have some battery issues apparently
there are 3,000 units right now in the
world being tested and Apple is
targeting a very interesting battery
life criteria two to three hours of
display on time four hours for training
and then we're talking about 19 hours of
continuous you know usage and non usage
for about three to four days of standby
time which is pretty much nothing better
than compared to something like Android
wear with the big difference that the
clock time will apparently only be three
hours meaning that you will only be able
to just glance at your watch for three
hours continuously and apparently Apple
has made all these studies and they've
confirmed that this is all the battery
life that you need to be able to charge
it every single day and that's really
disappointing because this play will go
on standby so it's not like for example
to deer live where you still get the
time even the displays off because of
the am OLED display and it just seems
that the Apple watch is just another
half baked you know SmartWatch four
hours for gym time that's how long it
takes the average runner to run a full
marathon meaning you won't be able to
use the Apple watch for that and it
really leads me to the question of the
day what would be the perfect battery
life for you on a SmartWatch because in
my case it still is a full week on the
pebble if they could give me a full week
of charging and I just charge it every
weekend then that's cool you know but
Wow every day is just terrible the leave
