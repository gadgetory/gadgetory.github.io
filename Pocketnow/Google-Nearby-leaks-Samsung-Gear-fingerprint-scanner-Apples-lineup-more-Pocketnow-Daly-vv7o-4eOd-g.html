just have gained a new name rumors
having Samsung will bring us fingerprint
scanners to wearables and according to
Tim Cook the best apple products are
coming very soon I'm high not to be
bettah and heads up guys i will be out
all of next week so expect a pocket now
daily to return on june sixteenth don't
say I didn't warn you this is parking
out daily let's begin today with the
official and tongue-twisting news as
AT&amp;amp;T has just made new products official
first of all the PadFone next which are
review is already live make sure you
follow the links in the description to
see what michael fisher has to say about
it but aside from that we also get the
Galaxy Tab 4 10 dot one from Samsung I
got that right and then we have the
Galaxy Note pro 12 that too from Samsung
as well available on AT&amp;amp;T again link to
this rule details pricing and everything
you need now is it to these official
news Motorola has just decided to make a
very crazy sale for the Moto X what
they're doing is that they're allowing
you to test the phone for two weeks for
just one penny and this is a fully
customizable phone then you get to try
for two weeks and return if you don't
like it or you get to keep it
interesting this is probably like the
most interesting strategy that I've ever
seen for a company to try to sell a
phone but then again since we have the
leaks that are kind of confirmed that
there is a 1080p Moto X out there it
could be because the Moto X plus one is
coming up next we have samsung as well
synaptics is one of its biggest partners
and this is the company that provides
samsung with all its biometrics for the
fingerprint scanner on the galaxy s5 and
according to the company's executives
they are working on new sensors for
wearables and since Samsung is pretty
much not their exclusive partner but
kind of their only one right now they
have other partners obviously but for
this specifically Samsung is the one
that has the wearable so we do assume
that the company is working on bringing
us these features on future gear
products kind of interesting and Google
i/o is just around the corner and
interesting we got some leaks from a
probable feature that may come at Google
i/o it's called nearby now the whole
concept
is that the phone will detect your
location we'll listen out to your
microphone and gather all this stuff to
provide a better detail location-based
services for you it's kind of hard to
know exactly how this will integrate
with applications most likely this will
become an API or sort of a huff or this
to work but yes it's going to be called
nearby and yeah google i/o is like the
best place to launch it hopefully will
be getting android for dot 5 as well and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day Tim Cook and Eddy Cue were
recently at Austin Texas as the company
has just launched a new campus there and
during the whole event attend cook and
cue were very emphatic over the fact
that Apple has amazing products that
will launch in the next couple of weeks
apparently the best products we have
ever seen from Apple will launch this
year according to them we did hear even
you know Eddy Cue mentioning this at a
recent event as well so it's kind of
interesting as obviously Apple needs to
say that everything that's coming is
going to be amazing because they didn't
launch anything at WWDC but anyways that
leaves you to the question of the day if
you're an apple customer what would
Apple need to launch to retain you as a
customer and if you're not an apple
customer what will Apple need to launch
for you to become an apple customer in
my particular case honestly this is
going to sound ironic but a Productivity
tala will be great aside from the fact
that I would like a bigger iPhone
definitely but leave us a comment down
below what would you want Apple to do to
make you a customer or to keep you and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
