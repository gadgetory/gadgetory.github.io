calm and today I'm going to show you a
program called radar love and this is a
beta program and what's going to allow
you to do is see the radar in your area
and the program is pretty new so there
might be a couple of glitches but all in
all I'd say it's a pretty good program
for seeing up to the date radar in your
area and we'll go into some of the
settings so you can pick your city and
there's a large list of city so we can
go through some of these and as you can
see there's there's quite a few and most
of them are main metropolitan areas and
I just have it set to see at all because
that's where I live and you can set the
radar transparency so if you want it to
be more transparent you can so you can
see the underlining topography can also
select the loop speed so however fast
the radar transitions from one scene to
the next and you can also have layers so
you can have a typography county line
cities rivers highways and radar and it
also gives a little bit of about
information so today okay and it will
show us our radar map and we can just
quickly and easily zoom directly into
our metropolitan area and it will show
you the whole state and this program
only works in north america
unfortunately so at this time it'll only
run in the united states and will
continue to zoom in and if you can see
this little thing this little ticker
right here is his image from june
thirtieth 2009 at 124 am so it's pretty
early in the morning so i'm just going
to zoom in a little more so now that i'm
at my desired zoom area i can actually
see a few cities it says seattle right
here and tacoma and olympia everett and
mount vernon so these are some major
cities in the seattle metropolitan area
so i'm just going to click radar loop
and it will start transitioning from one
radar scene to the next and i'll show
you the time on the bottom that same
tickers so it goes every 10 minutes
apparently which is a pretty accurate
radar for up to the date radar
information so going to another setting
so if i want to reload the radar i can
do that or i can select to reload all of
them so all in all I would say it's a
pretty good radar program if you want to
check with the weather or snow forecast
or whatever it is in your area and i'll
post a link in pocketnow.com is how to
get this is a free program and right now
it isn't only in a beta stage and it
seems to run pretty well on actually a
WVGA display so that's good thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
