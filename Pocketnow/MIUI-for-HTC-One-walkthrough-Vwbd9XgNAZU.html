HTC one you're in luck
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is mi UI version 5 on the HTC One
in my UI or my UI as some call it is as
controversial as it is unique and
refreshing its interface is a strange
mixture of webOS Android and iOS and
questions about the security of it in my
UI are never-ending no less mi UI
version 5 has been ported to the HTC One
by xda-developers user at a scorpius and
performing the quick and easy
installation process we'll have you up
and running on one of the most unique
Android experiences around based on
CyanogenMod the latest build of mi UI is
built on Android 4.2.2 for those who
have never used in my UI it requires a
mental context switch from every other
version of Android you've ever used the
lockscreen isn't all that different it's
a simple splash page with the time and
date near the top and an unlike slider
near the bottom slide to the left to
jump to the dialer up to access the
camera right to open the messages app
and down to simply unlock
however unlike stock Android since
TouchWiz or the thousands of other
custom roms in my UI just not utilize an
app drawer instead the homescreen is the
app drawer meaning every application
either has to be displayed as an icon on
your home screen
or tucked away in a folder for
organization freaks this may be a
problem unless of course you're familiar
with iOS and like older versions of
Android long-pressing an empty space on
the home screen will allow you to add a
widget though setting a wallpaper is
done in the settings app like and since
the notification shade actually doesn't
differ all that much from stock Android
4.2 in that it has a dedicated page for
notifications and a separate toggles
page which actually looks and operates
more like the quick toggles in the
latest version of TouchWiz the quick
toggles however cannot be accessed by a
two-finger swipe down from the top of
the display to handle the lack of a
physical menu button the developer has
added the ability to use the upper part
of the HTC logo as a menu button but
it's just as finicky as similar
implementations of the HTC logo the
settings application is easily the most
unique part of the standard mi UI rom
features the Settings app itself has a
quick settings page dedicated to things
like brightness Bluetooth Wi-Fi volume
wallpaper launcher settings etc swipe to
the left and you will switch to the all
settings tab which closely resembles the
layout in the stock Android settings app
with dedicated categories wireless and
networks personal accounts device and
system like any other MIUI rom there is
chinese lettering scattered throughout
the system such as on widgets and in one
area that makes mi UI the most unique
rom around theming yes other roms have
themes but the mi UI theme engine is
expansive there are thousands upon
thousands of different free and paid
themes to choose from the mi UI themes
cover everything from the lock screen
lock wallpaper icons and home screen to
ringtones notification shade alarm
styles fonts status bar boot animation
and much more if you want to see what i
OS 7 would look like on the HTC one
there's a theme for that or if you want
to make your homescreen resemble Windows
Phone you can for a price all these
themes can be applied on the fly and if
there's any aspect of a theme you don't
particularly like you can mix and match
elements from a handful of different
themes to get exactly what you want if
you're feeling bored with since 5 and
the Google Play edition software felt a
little bland on your HTC One you might
want to consider giving mi UI a try if
only temporarily so far the performance
seems smooth and the versatility of the
interface is great though we're not
terribly fond of not having an app
drawer on an Android device also like
with the Google Play edition software
you'll be missing many of the original
HTC one features such as the animated
gallery Zowie Beats Audio HTC's camera
optimizations and several other features
