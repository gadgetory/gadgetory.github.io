supports the iPad the iphone 5s shows up
in another photo with the smarter dual
flash and reports have the galaxy note 3
not growing much in this place eyes I'm
hi Mary betta and yeah I do feel your
pain I hate mondays too but this is
pocket now daily let's are they off with
some Samsung news even though Android
tablets haven't really taken off that
doesn't mean the company is not put as a
truckload of barians of the same tablet
but such as the case of the samsung
galaxy tab 3 which will be available on
July seventh in the United States and
even though the specification zar
nothing out of the ordinary you know
that thing is going to be retailing for
200 bucks that's going to be the entry
price tag and then obviously for the
different variants there are going to be
different price tags but it is really
compelling links in the description for
details of 200 bucks speaking of Samson
we've had rumors for the last year of
what the display size on the galaxy note
3 is going to be like first we heard
five point nine inches than six point
three inches and then we got the galaxy
mega smartphone so we know where that's
going but according to a very trusted
source that we have it's gonna be a 5.7
inch display and it's interesting that
it's not growing much from the galaxy
note tool that's at 5.5 inches but then
again how big is a smartphone for it to
still be usable so five point seven
inches is that okay with you guys it was
a comment now let's talk about some
deals over the weekend we heard that
AT&amp;amp;T is dropping the price tag on all
their smartphones even the ones that
were released now I mean the last couple
of days the galaxy s4 active by fifty
percent so it doesn't matter which
smartphone you want it's fifty percent
off from now to the end of June if you
buy the phone online so lives in the
description for the procedure and then
we've got Walmart who's also dropping
the price tag on the iPhones permanently
meaning you can get the iphone 5 4 130
bucks at walmart regardless of when you
buy in which is kind of interesting so
again links in the description for
details on that as well now let's move
over to Apple as the company has now
released their beta 2 of iOS 7 and even
though it's got some enhancements
cesarean
some bug fixes here and there the only
cool thing is that it actually now runs
on the iPad and even though a lot of
people are celebrating over that links
in the description watch our video on
our hands on of iOS 7 on the iPad and
not everything is cool and finally for
the interesting news of the day we've
got some leaked photographs of the dual
flash of the iphone 5s and as it turns
out it's not really a dual flash one
light is the flash and then the other
light is actually orange just like you
get on point and shoot digital cameras
to help the camera assist itself with
light and determine if it needs flash or
not an automatic settings so could it be
that we will be getting a smarter
performing iphone 5s for low-light
photography could be well but that leads
me to the question of the day anyways
how often do you actually use the flash
on your smartphone is it's a feature
that you're looking for it is something
that you want in my particular case it
depends on the phone obviously the Lumia
920 doesn't need a flash and so doesn't
the HTC one but the only phone that
actually does flash well as the iphone 5
in my personal opinion so that's the
only reason why I use it on that phone
but leave us a comment down below do you
want a smarter flasher would you like
better low-light photography of course
it's always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and talk about make sure you
