brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet please visit D brand calm I want
to try something a little different for
this topic the purpose of this video is
not to pan apple for being Apple but to
engage in a critical discussion with
gadget fans on what might improve a
product and we're aiming for an
examination of one of the most popular
features on the single highest profile
line of smartphones available today my
thesis statement is this the iPhone
camera app is not an intuitive app by
this I mean it's certainly easy to use
but this ease of use is derived more
from familiarity than it is from good
design I liken it to how most car
dashboards work you have to take your
eyes off the road to see how fast you're
traveling this isn't really good design
not in an age where we could have
heads-up displays but we're all really
familiar with this method of checking
our speed but I digress getting back to
the iPhone here are three points which
support my argument point number one a
confusing mix of modes and settings
navigating the iPhone camera app this
scrolling action for moving between
modes is fairly ingenious and often
copied by Android manufacturers but what
constitutes a mode changing from
photography to video that makes sense
that's a fundamentally different action
but moving from a four by three photo to
a square photo that's just a crop this
could be in some other collection of
settings I argue this is a strange
vestigial option to prioritize on a
modern iPhone the iPhone has shifted to
a widescreen display an Instagram now
allows people to upload photos of
different aspect ratios why continue
providing a square and not offer a 16 by
9 crop we don't have a special mode for
filters those are right here in the
corner
so why maintain a wholly specific mode
when a crop could be moved to some other
part of this app point number two moving
targets it's a common talking point in
tech circles that consumers don't shoot
like pro photographers as if that
somehow excuses the inclusion of
features or controls what the iPhone app
beautifully illustrates is that
consumers have actually grown
to become fairly sophisticated and how
they create their own personal content
and we should celebrate how Apple has
managed to bring complex ideas like
high-dynamic-range to people in a way
which was easy to use and understand
however the control interface for these
settings found on the left side of the
iPhone camera app aren't necessarily
well implemented think about what's
happening when you're in the process of
trying to take a photo you should be
focused on your subject in your
composition if you do need to adjust
something say activating the flash it
requires a two-step process which forces
you to follow a tiny moving text menu
ditto HDR ditto the timer even after
years of reviewing iPhone cameras I
still need to take my eyes off of the
road as it were to hit these small
moving targets and while not common I
still often miss the setting I'm trying
to hit people who rely on iPhone cameras
more than I are undoubtedly better at
adjusting these but not because they're
so well designed instead those
individuals are more familiar with where
those targets land on the display point
number 3 where the rest of my settings
lastly I just can't proclaim a camera
app is well-designed if key components
of controlling the camera require you to
actively leave the camera app to make
adjustments the iPhone can shoot a
high-quality 60 frame per second 1080p
and UHD video but to achieve that
quality is a setting here in the camera
app No you have to go home go to
settings then scroll down to photos and
camera then skip past photo organizing
settings to activate a grid and change
your video and slow-motion options we've
criticized Samsung for removing you from
your composition window when adjusting
things like photo and video resolution
but at least those options are still in
the actual camera app not buried in the
general phone settings again it's argued
that most consumers don't care about
adjusting these kinds of settings and I
find that to be terribly reductive and
more than a bit insulting if any company
could improve the user experience for
techy options like these it should be
Apple I personally believe people will
rise to the quality of the tool they are
presented if people aren't shooting
higher-quality video on their phones
maybe it's not because they don't want
high
quality video but instead for some
people it could be that these aren't the
easiest settings to locate so how could
we improve the iPhone camera app first
and foremost there should be a focus on
never removing the user's eyes from the
composition window one company which
does this very well is HTC sometimes
information on screen might be a bit
dense
but even when adjusting options your
composition is always visible I'd argue
for simplifying the modes we scroll
through on this main view at least
getting rid of the square crop in favour
of a setting above the shutter which
could change the aspect ratio between
full sensor square and full screen a
simple three way toggle would be easy to
use to that last point all buttons
should toggle in place if you tap on the
flash or HDR controls they should cycle
in that same location so you don't need
to move your thumb you shouldn't need to
hunt for an option which is moved lastly
all camera settings should remain in the
camera app or there should be a direct
shortcut built into the app to take you
to where that menu lives in the phone
settings Instagram for example has a
fantastic set of options behind this
gear icon in their app moving to the
phone settings all you have here are
notifications and app refresh settings
hardly mission-critical stuff for using
Instagram service so there's my argument
folks and some ideas on how we might
improve this camera app do you agree
disagree drop us some comments down
