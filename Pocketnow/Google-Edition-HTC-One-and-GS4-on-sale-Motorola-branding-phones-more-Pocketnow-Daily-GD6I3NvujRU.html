Galaxy s4 now on sale Motorola gets a
branding change along with some leaked
phone photographs and sprint finally
announces their first batch of Windows
phones I'm primary betta on a hot
Wednesday wondering why nobody has
invented a fast forward button for days
and this is out daily as we
cover on yesterday's episode of a
samsung galaxy s4 with LTE advanced
capabilities along with a snapdragon 800
processor you remember that one right
well it's now a reality as of today the
company is now made it official for the
South Korean market and guess what aside
from these two things that your current
galaxy s4 does in have your also
starting at 32 gigs of storage so let's
wait for it to come and doesn't it burn
to be an early adopter that was called
the spotlight over to LG as we've been
expecting their optimus g2 for some time
now and we've got some leaked
photographs of the video showing a
device that's probably this phone and
it's got this weird like sort of volume
rocker at the back which is completely
different and unique to any other phone
out there we just wonder why so Argus
7th is their event let's see what we get
now let's talk about HTC and sprint in
this particular case is the carrier has
finally announced their first windows
phones and among them is the HTC 8xt and
it looks like if the windows phone 8x
and the 8's and the boomsound speakers
of the HTC One had a baby because this
phone is pretty much an 8 s and specs
and everything but it does include the
dual speaker functionality that you do
see on the HTC One no details on dates
just yet but the company that does have
details on a date as a rumor is 02 is
apparently they're talking that the HTC
one mini that we saw a couple of days
ago we'll be ready for their carrier on
august 3rd so stay tuned for that one
now let's talk about motorola there are
a lot of news for this company first of
all they have a new logo and it looks
very googly but i'm happy that they kept
the motorola em as i remembered from the
early days we've also got some leaf
photographs of the Moto X which keeps
growing on me the more I see it does the
seem to be a very pretty phone but aside
from that we've also got leaks of this
new project called the droid
all truffaut's or the lineup that's
coming to verizon apparently very soon
and the question is if this is going to
be based on the Moto X or not because
apparently this will supersede the razor
lineup that we currently have stay tuned
for that one as well and finally for the
hot news of the day the HTC One and
Galaxy s4 goal editions are now
available at the google play store for a
very unaffordable price tag we finally
get what we want though we get the
google stock android experience on
high-end hardware LTE connectivity you
name it the whole nine yards but wait
just there apparently these phones will
be shipping with the stock kernel from
OEMs and not the stock kernel from
android so we could expect some minor
delays with software updates but i don't
think that's going to be something
significant then anyways that leads me
to the question of the day did you order
any of these google edition phones the
HTC one of the galaxy s4 or why didn't
you order any of these phones them in
our particular case I'm waiting for one
of these phones to reach our labs for us
to get our final verdict of what these
phones are like but so far i am quite
compelled so leave us a comment down
below what have you done and of course
