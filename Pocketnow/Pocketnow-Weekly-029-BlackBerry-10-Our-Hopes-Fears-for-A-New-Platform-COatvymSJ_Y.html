announcements and I already I already
have a flashing red light on my on my
new device here which is gonna be
distracting me throughout the whole
podcast I've just a certain new device I
am so envious i cannot wait to talk
about this new device but first let's
get some announcements out of the way
for fans of our brand new series putt
the pocket now live our series of Google
Hangouts with the readers there is a
post up about this already today but we
thought we'd let the listeners to the
weekly no we do not have the n episode

dealing with some technical issues that
we are trying to get ironed out as soon
as possible but they are currently
beyond our control so we apologize we
would love to hang out with you guys but
it's just not going to happen this week
and we are very sorry but we are having
a hang out of our own which is very
secret and that's that's all I'm able to
say about that but it will lead to a
special announcement from pocket now
Leah what
next week in the brand in the week after
I think it should be carrying on

an announcement from pocket now and a
guarding pocket now regarding already
regarding yeah that's the pocket no
media empire and it'll be great so stay
tuned for that do you've anything more
to say about that Brenner can we jump
into the thought thread there there's
nothing else I could possibly say about
it the night if that it's good it's good
it's exciting it's a it's an expansion
of our team and some other changes to
our team and we're growing up just a
whole bunch of good stuff yeah we're
we're shaping up into a just a promising
promising little group aren't we all
right let's let's jump into the tops
right here the device yeah yes chin
stroking time just kidding it I know I
won't edit that smuggle now that's
staying right in let's move on let's
jump into the thought thread which is
about this device that I alluded to as
as many of you as people who follow us
on Twitter know this is going to be a
very blackberry centric podcast at least
at the top because this that is the new
device sitting next to me it is a
blackberry z10 blackberry kind of Oprah
moment 'add all of us at the Toronto of
a nerd actually at all the launch events
but I is so I have that here we'll talk
about a device in second but I want to
talk about the device first excuse me I
want to talk about the event first now I
went to I went to toronto for the event
and as you may be aware listeners and
readers of pocket now longtime readers
we have not historically covered
blackberry as a matter of fact have
wheat Brandon heavily or I may have we
ever covered blackberry extensively yeah
I miss not on really just accidentally
like every so often somebody mentions
blackberry it's incidentally up to the
point where of everybody any if any of
our listeners watch pocket out daily
they'll notice that the first news I
ever covered a blackberry was with your
announcement that was pretty good yeah
so so this is exciting right because
we've never covered it before and we
don't even have a like a banner for it
on the home screen so when we do a
blackberry story it's just like a
homeless story it's like a web oster but
over that we're fixing that though
that's coming in the future redesign in
a redesign coming soon
but anyway because we've never covered
blackberry before the issue has been
that like trying to get in the door for
this launch event was a little difficult
because obviously the company then known
as rim had not heard of us or you know
they'd heard of us but we didn't weren't
terribly relevant to them so it was
really difficult even getting them to
respond to our inquiries to come cover
an event but unfortunately they did we
had we had a wonderful contact inside
rim who we've got to know and we were
invited to the launch event but we
couldn't go to the New York when because
it was already full so I ended up
driving nine hours to Toronto from
Boston because the last-minute plane
flight would have been just um teen
thousands of dollars and so I drove
through like cloud covered mountain tops
in western Massachusetts and New York
and I lucky you it was fun man I like I
enjoyed the drive it was what did you do
on the way Jen's listen to music I
listened to our podcast I listened to
other folks podcasts I really seriously
I was just podcast in the whole time and
I was making phone calls i was making
and taking phone calls because the only
time i do that is when i am too bored to
do anything else and I can't text you
know obviously so it was fun though I
got to you know here are some of our
friends on at other sites on the air I
got to hear some people who we don't
know and you know it was great it was it
was very informative drive but I popped
my ear so I've got some weird right ear
problems because of the altitude so I
don't know what's going on with that but
the thing is the blackberry event itself
in Toronto was really cool because it
was in Canada and Canadians are so like
amped about their blackberry making
company it's like a matter of national
pride so when the announcements were
going on you know we saw the live stream
from New York we saw it from London or
wherever and from all the other global
locations where blackberry was making
this announcement people were pretty
excited whatever but when the live cam
came up on Toronto did you guys see that
like the when the live cam came up on
Toronto and like everyone was supposed
to wave or whatever like everyone like
jumped out of their seats and like wave
their arms around like it was some kind
of football game like like somebody just
scored a goal in in soccer sound like
that and it really it was absolutely
crazy and actually on the livestream you
could see the people like in the audio
in New York and elsewhere like laughing
at the Toronto um explosion but it was
really cool like it wasn't tacky there
were no there were no plants in the
audience that you know you know the
plants that the companies will put in
there to start clapping when like an
event happened so that people clap ah
you know don't ya it was not there may
have been planned in the audience but
they were not like they were not
necessary everyone was legit cheering
all the time there's just there was just
so much authentic love for bb10 you
didn't need to have a plan they're
really what like if seriously it was
like it was like everyone was cheering
for their hometown team that had been
down for a couple years wasn't down
coming back so it was really easy to get
caught up in that that kind of
excitement and the product in many ways
you know deserves it i think at this
early stage but um the annoying thing is
that blackberry who recently changed our
name to blackberry which we can talk
about in a second if you want i had this
really cool event going on for about a
half hour where they're showing us the
new features of the two phones they
announced they're showing us bb10 and
really great stuff and then you know
what we're all riding pretty high and
then they're like we're gonna bring out
our new our new creative director or
some made-up position Alicia Keys oh god
I love Alicia and I stopped loving her
after that my god that was terrible like
I was really terrible it is and like
here's the thing it wouldn't have been
terrible if they brought her out and
just asked her for her authentic
impressions of the new blackberry or
yeah yeah the authentic impressions like
the jessica alba thing for windows phone
where she was like oh yeah and i just
loaded my itunes music on and jovial
fury was like oh yeah yeah method the
phone to to our was certain to our
windows software on the mac and that's
how she got it right you know making us
so stupid all right so that's a good
point right so you can't just let him
let him say anything but um like she
leased keys comes onstage and she's just
she's reading off the teleprompter which
is fine okay fine but she clearly didn't
write the content that she was like
spewing she's just dropping corporate
buzzword afterbuzz where she's like oh
yeah I really like using the blackberry
balance you know it's really nice that
it's a device built for work and play
and I'm really love dad it's like a
commercial allow mercial yeah
gently and then I I follow her on
Instagram and she's always publishing
things that she obviously did not do on
a z10 she did on it's an instrument for
iOS more specifically like she and she
had this whole convoluted story about
how she's like you know I was with
blackberry for a while but then you did
you put disappointed me so I went over
to Iowa to the iphone but now blackberry
you've been working out and you know now
I can come back and you know whatever
that this cute and stuff but it's it's
just you don't stop stop lying to me you
do not carry this device in your daily
life unless a company is throwing
millions of dollars at you and it
frustrated me to such an extent that you
can actually go back and look at my
tweets where they get legit angry we're
like a follower was like somebody got up
on the wrong side of the bed this
morning like listen I was having a good
time I'm here longer just deep I've been
alone everybody they're telling us that
i'm a fanboy fine just push it out to me
right now but um whenever there's an app
that whenever there's an apple music
event you get the ardent at the end of
the events playing music not talking
about the device that's just right one
exactly like doing what they do about it
just it really annoys me for companies
to use celebrities like oh wow so now
that Alicia Keys uses blackberry oh my
god I'm going to go running to go by the
way I have every single alicia keys
album um I am NOT gonna go buy that
thing just because she's talking about
it I thought I think it gives it
legitimacy what I do I think it I think
it helps in people associate I don't i'm
not an alicia keys fan but like let's
say Andre 3000 steve is yo yo yo check
out this Windows Phone nine now would do
a rap about it oh yeah I kind of I would
sort of think about on 33,000 when I
pick up a Windows Phone I'd advise I
people links off together I mean we are
like people link stuff together but it's
it's I think it just completely
undermines the authenticity of what
they're what they're trying to
accomplish because it's not like they
were trying to boost up a mediocre
device like Samsung was doing with the
Galaxy Note end up one when they brought
Baz Luhrmann out on stage right so that
was like a mediocre tablet that they're
like propping up with celebrity
endorsements and it's much more akin to
that Windows Phone Jessica Alba thing
where it's like let's bring out Jessica
Alba to talk about how this is awesome
for working moms like but even that was
like more relevant
like this alicia keys and just sort of
came out of nowhere and i can understand
that the mentality that drives a company
to do that out of like you know in
BlackBerry's position where they're like
we have lost a lot of share here and we
need to get this you know get get this
big and in depth but you think all her
call her the me the the Ambassador the
blackberry ambassador but i but the
creative director yeah they're they're
pretty much confirming that she were
putting which is complete BS just
complete BS you know here's the point um
we hate and I think our commoners know
that we hate paid chills we despise them
and that's what Alicia Keys look like up
and chill yeah so I don't know I don't
want to talk about Alicia Keys all day
all I'm saying is it was just so so
transparent and so disingenuous and so
irritating particularly on the heels of
such a cool what up to that moment had
been such a cool morning and I felt a
little bad for forgetting so angry on
Twitter until I looked at the rest of
the Twitter's feared and until I
listened to some of our competitors
podcasts and like everyone felt the same
way no one was into this everyone would
you know don't pander to to me don't
don't like patronize me with this like
obvious falsehood I'm not going to get
excited because Alicia Keys is falsely
backing a product that I know she's just
going to come home and like put on the
counter and pick up her iPhone and start
using like it does doing it you know I
think the problem was really the
audience I mean you know a room full of
press people um is really not the
audience where you want it I mean if
this would have been a live stream that
every single customer every blackberry
customer could have ever watched then it
would have made sense to bring alicia
keys on stage and call her the
ambassador but if you want to do it you
know to the press that's not really
gonna go well yeah so you know but
fortunately um and and since by the way
since we did mention samsung and nokia
i'm gonna write a piece on this because
it's not just blackberry i mean everyone
does this and it's stupid all the time
so we'll we'll discuss this maybe more
later but i want to talk about the
device and the new platform which
actually is really cool and wiggle huh
it is it it has surprised me that's an
interesting way to describe it can we
just kill me can we get into this
because I've got a lot
questions sleaze they just just just hit
me with a man like please because I've
got it right here this I've got the z10
they Oprah moment at us like I said so
every reporter in the room got a z10 and
I've been using it since yesterday so
for a moment all right yeah I think I
think the most relevant question in a
day when there are competing devices is
why blackberry 10 what is it or is there
anything about that device that you've
been using that has a better capability
than your note to your Lumia 920 an
iphone 5 there is there there are a few
things and they're they're unique and
they're interesting and you know I read
some of the other reviews because as
usual some other sites got review units
like weeks in advance and they were able
to go up right at the at like midnight
or whatever the hell it was that morning
and you know we didn't get one of those
because we haven't been a blackberry
cover a very for very long but I read a
lot of these reviews and they didn't
cover a lot of them didn't cover what
makes the new BlackBerry so unique and
that's because a lot of sites are not
tailored to cover like enterprise use of
use cases and we aren't either because
frankly I mean consumers don't really
want to read about that stuff it's
generally pretty boring to a lot of
consumers unless they're they really
invested in corporate smartphone doings
but blackberry balance is pretty cool
it's the feature that I feel like
blackberry and other companies try it
always cart out card out this feature
where they're like you want your phone
to be for work and play well god our
phone does both of them equally well and
you know Windows Phone tries to make
that claim and blackberry just does it
completely differently with blackberry
with this you can like switch swipe down
from it you can access a very special
menu and hit a button and your phone
like it Reese Ken's it wreath Eames it
like everything turns business like it
did you see I see it am I in the the
software tour eres law does that does
that it that's an interesting extra step
but does that extra step add value or
are you better off having everything
mixed together like you would on your
android phone it depends on your well it
depends on your preferences but it also
depends on your employer's preferences
like what's nice is that it doesn't just
change the wallpaper to like carbon
fiber
and it's I call an element business mode
like it actually establishes rules that
are then governed by whatever your
company's server like does so in
business mode you have access to certain
files and certain documents and like the
file manager and stuff that you do not
have access to and personal mode and
vice versa so it also prevents you from
coming in like whatever hung over on a
monday morning and accidentally like you
know sending out some pictures you took
over the weekend via your corporate
email like you know II because it
doesn't let you access it like
establishes a very strong firewall
between everything you've determined as
personal and everything you've
determined as corporate and it's on the
same device so I think it does do that
better than than anything I've seen so
far it's certainly not the other okay so
it's cool that's an interesting I mean
that's absolutely not something that I
would switch to blackberry for so please
continue on the stuff that it does
better it's okay no but but but but I'll
you know to Michael's point I'll make
one you know I worked 15 years and in
airline businesses and you know for me
it was really cool I worked in an
airline where everything was connected
the first one hmm and I had to you know
I had access to everything everywhere
and my problem was that I would get you
know I would have these crazy 10 12 hour
days and then I it was like you know
since the airline work 24 hours i would
get these crazy emails or crazy
communications or whatever at midnight
and you know the cool thing about going
to the other airline was like when you
were in the airline you got bud when you
were out of the airline you couldn't be
connected to anything so we don't ya you
had a life you seriously had a life um
and you know I really that was really
cool and you know if if that is a policy
there are actually companies that have
those policies where where you know
you're just not going to be disturbed
from this time to this time and you know
I think that's the cool thing to do so I
feel I feel that it has a purpose right
and you know maybe it was a mistake to
lead out for that because that just one
of the dryer features of this thing but
from a like if you're just a user and
you want to know like you know some
quick quick stuff that it does really
really well there's it's really
difficult to describe the the UI but you
know I me you I don't go on going about
it forever
like the live tiles we had to like the
live tiles on windows phone and
blackberry kind of replaces that with
these like your last 8 apps I end up in
in very webos like cards on your on your
home screen landing page but that's you
know that's cool and we can kind of talk
about that but the thing is if you swipe
to the right from your home screen you
just take your thumb and you slide to
the right you're dropped into the
blackberry hub and this is the coolest
thing about it because I have not I'll
tell you guys I have not been in the
blackberry app world much at all in it
since picking up the device i've
downloaded like google talk and like one
other thing because I've been so I've
had a lot of message traffic obviously
in the past couple days and blackberry
still whether it's but I think this
applies to blackberry 7 maybe as well
but even then but blackberry 10
especially does messaging better than
any device than any other device that I
have used what is it what do you mean by
that so that when you swipe to the right
you get in the BlackBerry hub and it
which is a mishmash of that's the right
neither is just like a it's a it's a
unified inbox okay of like everything
including your tweets and your Facebook
I'm everyone to tell you exactly what it
includes includes system notifications
BBM text messages gmail pocketnow mail
facebook twitter google talk at phone
calls and voicemail so every possible
kind of notification i could have on
this device it's all aggregated into a
list and then if you swipe right again
you can filter that list again into any
of those categories it's like I just
want to see my work email you just swipe
to the right and then you do that so it
a grits the messages in a very
blackberry way BlackBerry's been doing
that for like since its inception has
done this unified inbox really well but
in in modern form not only is it useful
but now it's also somewhat pretty like
it's still very businesslike
straight-laced blackberry but it's
actually really cool and if you pull
down on the message list instead of
doing a pull to refresh which might
actually be used pretty useful it shows
you your upcoming calendar events so
they're kind of always there for you're
like oh all right the weekly is coming
up I got to follow up with some people
okay and then you release it and it
snaps back to your message list and then
if you were there go ahead a little I
I'll say other little icons to say that
these are tweets these are Facebook
conversations yeah there are
to the left of everything there's like a
little delineator like show a text
message bubble or a tweeter or a Twitter
tweeter or a twitter icon or you know
whatever and then you also have like
status messages as blackberry has always
done for sending so say you send
something like you get the little wave
icon when it's trying to send and then
you get a check mark when it's delivered
which is really cool I don't know I
don't know Brandon remembers this but I
recently started in pocket mail like
five how long was it I don't remember
but I recently started I was like men I
just got myself a blackberry remember
the blackberry pearl back there oh yeah
it was the hotness I I was you know I I
was so I was like oh my god I really did
not want a blackberry I seriously didn't
until I actually unbox the thing and
started using it and really what blew me
away was that hub you know that the
messaging the inbox yeah you know it I
was like oh god I don't have to go
anywhere everything's here everything's
here it's in a straight run down it is
diametrically opposed to what Windows
Phone does which makes you go all over
the place and your inner different hoes
because it has no notification center so
what the iphone does as well I mean the
iphone gives you notifications but
everything just keeps pushing you from
app to app right oh and i phone and
Android put them in that notification
shade right like this is basically a
different form of that steps off the
left and what's awesome so if you're
watching youtube video on blackberry 10
and you want to see like a notification
comes in the red light starts flashing
it doesn't have a persistent message bar
across the top like there's no status
bar across the top of the screen which
is kind of annoying in a way like
there's no glanceable info but if you
drag your thumb up from the bottom of
the screen while that youtube video is
playing you get the the peak option and
from off to the left your little
notification icons come onto the screen
and they're like oh you have a facebook
message and an email and it's like okay
i don't want to deal with either of
those you just bring your thumb back
down and the video never gets
interrupted or just quit easy isn't it
better though if you have a notification
bar at the top so you don't have to like
you know do that you don't have to take
your hands off yes it totally is and I
used blackberry navigation to
turn-by-turn navigation to get me back
from Toronto so for nine hours I had
nine hours to think about how I would
really like this to be a glanceable
model because every time a notification
came in I had to like reach up to the
phone and like put my finger on the
screen and like peek in
so yes that that is annoying I feel like
it could be fixed if blackberry had
simply installed a multi-colored LED
instead of the the flashing red one yeah
because like I mean that would fix the
problem instantly without having to
compromise their screen aesthetic which
is very it's a little like Windows Phone
in that it's like you don't want that
status bar all the time we're gonna hide
it most of the time which okay you know
you guys are not liking that i'm eric i
actually do I it's just funny but for
example one of the things you everybody
in this planet hates iOS notifications
you know you hate being interrupted
you're trying to read a book you're
trying to you know watch a video and you
know these things just pop up on top of
a little portion of the video um it just
really annoys me and I you know there
are certain things that I you know I
wish it I actually wrote an editorial
about this I wish that that iOS do not
disturb thing actually worked when the
phone is on you know I wish that I could
tell it not to bother me when I'm
reading a book right um and you know the
fact that if they are focusing on making
the video and the navigation immersive
and that you're not being you know
distracted by notifications is something
I do like now yeah it's probably taking
it to an extreme I understand what
you're going yeah it is i mean there's a
happy medium that they still have yet to
find I mean but then one point oh
they're not going to be able to find it
but what before I forget about messaging
one of the nice things is when you
decide to reply you've got this new
keyboard model now you guys have seen
this right we're like the keyboard the
new predictive text yeah yeah you slow
you swipe up and everything tell you you
swipe up it's that little bits of work
predictions yeah the way predictions
instead of appearing on a ribbon at the
top of the keyboard like Android it the
word predictions happen on like on the
keyboard like you're typing and these
words are floating up like clouds from
the keys like under your thumb tips and
it's it's weird and what is it cool
thing is does it work is it is it good
that has two answers if you're I have
found that if you are typing with two
fingers if you're like flying like you
know going high speed you don't use it
like you they just don't even they're
not even a distraction after a few
seconds you just don't use them because
you're going so fast but if you are
carrying this thing with one hand which
is very easy to do because it's a four
point two inch screen
z10 and you've got like groceries in
your other hand or whatever and you're
trying to text it is so useful because
you can start typing like exploring or
whatever like a long word and by the
time you hit exp it already knows what
you want to say and you can just flick
up to to throw that word right into the
text and that and that sounds a little
bit better a little B there's less just
less thumb travel than iOS and Android
right exactly much less um now it is
difficult to get used to because your
eye on Android has been trained to go to
the top of the keyboard and that's you
know that that's fine and that's it
works well and I'm very fast when I'm
typing on Android but once you get used
to the blackberry implementation which
I'm still in the middle of like I say
two handed typing it doesn't really work
well in one-handed typing it it has
really saved me a lot of time already is
that I think most people type with two
fingers is that to say that the keyboard
is not necessarily better for two handed
to two finger typers for two finger
typers I would say the blackberry 10
keyboard is probably on par with the
stock jelly bean or stock windows phone
8 keyboard windows from a keyboard I
don't over and Michael well let's leave
windows phone 8 related for later sure
um because you remember a you remember
that somebody told us in me when we were
in Vegas that the iOS keyboard was
actually designed for 11 yes yes I do
remember that so you well I actually you
know the guy was like you know it is
true you just give it a try and I you
know actually give it a game to try and
the guy was you know the guy was
actually right but so you feel you have
that same feeling that it's really
functional when one handed but it's
obviously made for two hands as well yes
and especially when you go to landscape
me you can really fly on it and it's
responsive you know blackberry didn't
like I couldn't afford to screw up the
keyboard right oh and there's another
thing too now you guys high maybe in
particular and and Tony if he were here
would really appreciate this you can
start typing in another language so II
like you don't have to change the key
bowl I swiftkey like SwiftKey probably I
should really use that but yeah you just
start typing in like you know in French
or in Spanish whatever and it detects
that you're doing well and it puts all
the that is amazing yeah I puts the
accent lately switched my email sending
to Android just because of that just
yeah well I'd see I've i am the ignorant
american of course i only only speak one
language well and uh you know i can't i
can't type in other languages
seeing the demo was really cool I have a
question the the keyboard the on-screen
keyboard looks a lot like a real
keyboard cuz it's got those like fake
metallic bars between yeah the rose yeah
I imagine that helps to space the keys
out vertically is that helpful or do you
find it to increase the the finger
travel that you'd use no I mean I'm
looking at the bands right now and there
may be about poof gosh I don't know
maybe the space it looks actually
smaller than the iOS keyboard the
spacing is probably right on par with I
don't unfortunately don't have an iphone
5 here next to it to compare and I
haven't used on iOS keyboard in a while
on a mobile device but you know it's
it's the spacing is very very good and
the bands echo the actual metal bands on
the q10 which isn't released yet but
won't the real physical keyboard which
now on the software thing they don't
serve a purpose other than aesthetics on
the blackberry q10 the those metal bands
actually keep the keys in place I was
told so if you drop the the blackberry
q10 it like your keys don't go flying
everywhere like so that that's it's
nicely thought out your Alicia Keys
don't go flying anywhere Oh God but I
can we do that episode so they're still
there go ahead go ahead good I was gonna
say there's like a jillion things in dog
well so let's move on from the keyboard
yeah and why don't we talk about apps
next because when you were talking about
YouTube you got me curious on how this
thing does deals with YouTube is there a
native YouTube app ya know they just
drop it it's just like Windows Phone you
tap youtube it drops you and am youtube
com which is fine that you know that
youtube.com is great it's not it right
the problem that m.youtube.com is it
doesn't stream the true HD like on
android you get 720p video plus the
comment formatting is all screwed up
it's it's old school like it's weird
it's its services but it's not what can
they do you know its rim like Google is
just being kind of openly hostile to a
lot of smaller platforms that's a good
point and you know it's not that it's
not i'm not willing to blame rim just as
i'm not willing to blame microsoft if
like if google doesn't want to play with
you then there's nothing you can do
except try and be nice to them or try
and throw money at them or something you
know
so so there I go ahead go ahead oh sorry
i can say that i was gonna say so there
are 22 different i guess are three
different kinds of apps there are the
sort of qnx apps that that we found in
the playbook then there are the native
BB 10 apps and then there are android
apps is that is that right oh right yeah
because they have to get to that amazing
70,000 apps on launch day number they
had to have a porta thong where they
they ported a lot of android apps which
I didn't realize also ported the Android
UI from within those apps oh yeah so if
you're running like a game or something
on a dialog box comes up it's like oh
wow that's that's the dialog box from
Android that's weird and not doesn't
feel great and it looks like android 2.1
look yeah yeah it's gingerbread right
yeah something like this right oh yeah I
think it is so whatever the case it
doesn't it doesn't look great but yeah
some of the native apps from like you
can see the astonishing tribes influence
in some of these like the the clock is
really really pretty and you know it
sounds like stupids like ma'am but we're
going to talk about the clock but it is
actually you can see the potential for
some of these apps to look really good
but there's only a couple there's only a
handful frankly I'm a little
disappointed that there's not more of a
TI t influence throughout man i saw
asphalt 7 there and that's that just
sold me in and told me in because I know
it's a stupid game but the point is I
mean those phone users still using
asphalt five right so the fact that
Blackberry figured out how to get you
know some of the newer things you know I
wrote this in an editorial yesterday I
don't care if the if these guys have a
million apps you know it i mean windows
phone has a hundred thousand apps out of
which 70,000 are all ports are all fake
points ports of something real and I
really even hate the fact that Microsoft
actually promotes like these fake pinter
steps um when and you know just get the
damn Pinterest app I mean what's the
what's such a the big deal and I you
know I feel blackberry they you know I
hear that i heard that they said it you
know we focused on the best 1000 apps
that were on these app stores and that's
what we got and that's really the way
you should approach it oh yeah they they
they had some weak-ass like dig at
Microsoft where they like forget about
the 46 out of the top 50 we've got
70,000 which is like
oh okay so like okay how many of them
are you booked you know do they have do
they have spotify no they're not if I
know but they don't have Pandora they
don't have soup they do have skype yeah
when you search for spotify you get
music master for blackberry a
three-dollar rap with one star oh yeah
let's see when you search for you what
because I was trying to I was trying to
use Yelp before you know I was trying to
like I was like oh man I'm in Toronto
let me see if I can find a burger place
now you search yelp you get Yelp news a
free app with no reviews when you have
netflix and hulu and netflix is not
there neither is hulu netflix is a big
omission for launch day actually i think
big omission definitely frankly and
fortunately google talk is there but
yeah i just want to confirm pandora
while we're in here now Apollo pandora
radio client pandora city guide and
music master for blackberry again these
apps with very few stars so there are
significant significant gaps in the app
store it's it's commendable that they
managed to launch with 70,000 apps but i
think a lot of that is just kind of
playing this this numbers game where
they're like blow them away with the
number and we'll get to the the cool
apps later because there's not much
that's that's really piquing my interest
in the absolute westra what do you guys
predict will happen with the app
situation over the next year that's a
very good question and I think as just
holding this thing and looking at it and
seeing how invested rim is in it and how
like fiercely devoted they are to this
idea this platform is compelling enough
two of which where I think developers
would at least pause before choosing
between developing for windows phone or
blackberries the third platform like
developers will give this a chance I
think well let's let's think like a
developer developers want devices that
are in lots of people's hands so they
want it to be on lots of devices I know
I'm being a bit of an acer soso but
there will be two devices blackberry 10
we don't know about carrier availability
sprint said that they'll have a
blackberry 10 device and oh no we do I
don't think any other carriers mentioned
no in the states we've got ya off it'll
be on all for nationals oh oh okay
that's that's news to me that's that's a
great start yeah um isn't that great
yeah cuz I'll of all four carriers
announced pre-registration and price
plans in
the z10 is going to be available for
every fifth and it'll you know whatever
so it's it's definitely definitely
definitely going to be in a lot of hands
i I'm I'm going to put this whole out
you know to answer the app thing okay
first of all there are a ton of
blackberry enthusiasts still there still
out there right um and the difference
between oh you know I wrote you know
Windows Phone vs blackberry 10 which is
the next underdog I wrote that yesterday
and you know my point was very simple I
mean there is already a big market of
blackberry users out there that just
want another blackberry um there are a
ton of companies that already have
blackberry enterprise servers they just
want to keep using them and so I feel
that there is already a big opportunity
in market share out there for people
that just want to move to an ex
blackberry and that is so easy to forget
when you if you live in America a way if
you live in America but then when you
come to Latin America this country is
flocked with blackberries everybody's
got a blackberry here it's amazing and
so I'll same theory Canada yeah exactly
and so here's here's the arm in the in
the in the case of Windows Phone for
example the reason why I feel that it's
been so difficult for Microsoft to pick
it up is because there wasn't really any
Windows Phone enthusiasts out there that
are willing to you know people from
windows mobile were really let down by
windows phone instead of like being oh
my God we're going to Windows Phone 7
you know the reaction was completely
opposite yeah well it was a fresh start
like it was something so completely
different and stuff and we keep talking
about Windows Phone by the way because
it's very very important because if one
does phone a blackberry are are gonna be
head-to-head I mean they're fighting for
the third place slot right now we don't
need to worry about Android and iOS like
getting to parody with them you know
getting anywhere close to overcoming
them it's so far down the road it's
amazing but Windows Phone 8 and
blackberry 10 are the are the biggest
head-butters around right now I think
and write write you go ahead and there
and there breza and the reason why I
mentioned is because yet the reason why
I mentioned it is because um you know
for those poor probably you know upset
by whatever I wrote yes rate that the
point was very simple you know it's not
that I'm hating Microsoft I'm just
talking about a mathematical fact you
know one company already has a market
share and the other one is still
struggling
to figure that out I mean we already
we've already had windows phone for
pretty much three versions over the past
two and a half years and the apps the
app prob has not been fixed well then
we've got blackberry and then we've got
blackberry that figured out dropbox on
launch date then figured out asphalt 7
on launch date so i can what my so I'm
like Who am I gonna trust am I gonna
trust the company that figured it out on
day one with no excuses a couple of
excuses or am I gonna am I gonna trust
on the company that's been here for two
and a half years and that has not
figured it I think that's a no III I
know where you're coming from I think
it's a gross oversimplification because
yeah blackberry figured out a couple
things on launch date and it's cool that
they launched with an impressive number
but they're not launching with we just
went through it like five minutes ago
they're not launching with some crucial
apps that even windows 8 managed to
launch was such as Netflix so that you
know the BlackBerry has its own severe
app problems but I think blackberry is
showing more promise on launch day than
Windows Phone did in either in either at
seven or its eight iterations right so I
think it has less less distance to
travel to to grow in that sense but it's
going to be interesting to see how it
plays out but it's it's funny to me how
how how very much like actually webos it
is where it's like I for me personally
where's like I'm enjoying using the
device in its interface baseline out of
box functionality so much that I haven't
even paid attention to the app situation
much in the past couple days were you
gonna say some Brennan I was gonna I was
gonna say you know what gets my antenna
extended hmm this uh no III don't what
I'm with this all right I was gonna say
this this white q10 yeah it really does
it for me with the white q10 the white
q10 yes oh I didn't see a white q tennis
other the other one the q10 is that cute
the qwerty enabled one yeah tchenka
check google images here's here's the
here's a funny thing about these
hardware keyboards they totally went
away and we haven't seen an android
phone save for a few kind of low-end
mid-range motorola devices that have had
had a qwerty keyboard because i think
people have fully accepted and are so
used to
on-screen keyboards and they're really
good ah and of course there's this whole
issue of why would you want to have a
qwerty keyboard when you could make the
to hold devices screen but anyway I I
want to I I feel more productive with a
qwerty keyboard maybe it's just a mental
thing of like here these buttons are
clicking in but like this this this q10
although the keys are arranged like a
you know they're arranged in a grid
which is kind of weird they're not
staggered it gets me excited it really
does what he does be too I completely
agree and I played with the q10 and I
tried to get some hands-on time of the
q10 but I was so busy shooting the z10
videos and by the time I wanted to get
some hands on the q10 they were wrapping
up so I was like damn it but I the q10
is really cool it looks like a
blackberry bold with it with a taller
screen and what's the coolest thing
about it besides the physical keyboard
is they didn't make it a mid-range
device because normally Brandon you're
absolutely right like these android
devices with physical keyboards are
almost always this mid-range crap where
it's like oh wow the specs suck and the
performance sucks and whatever but the
the q10 has the same guts as the z10 has
the same process for the same ram the
screen size is reduced but the quality
is not the camera is that resolution
it's just it's just a Z time of the
keyboard is this so much a video with
that yeah that's gonna be it's not a
multimedia she I was thinking that too
high me like oh jeez bars galore games
are gonna be weird to but I feel like I
feel like this is the cute ends really a
messaging device job it is it and so
it's got its got probably an AMOLED
display like the z10 is right it does
yep it's the exact same display
technology and I think it's yawning the
resolution is it's like it's 720 x 720
is it a square oven by 720 yeah yeah
that's gonna be that's gonna be a crisp
green it and end is end the z10 is
probably very crisp screen can you see
any pixels Michael it does indeed I
cannot and you know not very good at
spotting pixels but that it has a 356
PPI I'm pretty high she's not bad at all
that's better than the iphone come on
yeah no it's it's it's it's quite nice
what's interesting though I do I don't
want to leave this point behind like
Canada I mean there I've talked about
how nationalistic they are but with
regard to how black but how BlackBerry
does and everyone seems very invested
in it but not only do I see people on
the street and in Toronto just carrying
blackberries everywhere everyone still
has an old blackberry my z10 was being
asked about kind of like constantly
after I got it like I talked to the
hotel clerk at the marriott for like 15
minutes and I mean people are really
really so there are that is another
advantage that blackberry has is that
they do have this installed base which
we dismiss in America because we've been
watching people for years drop their
BlackBerry's off at the recycling center
because they got their new iphone and
you know corporations are adopting
iphone integration all this kind of
stuff but there is still a large base of
installed blackberry customers that are
going to be pretty interested in this
yeah and that's what gives me that's
another thing that gives me hope for
them that's not a good good that's good
it's a do you find the z10 attractive I
mean I me and I were talking about how
thick those bezels are is that a problem
you mean on the top and bottom and the
sides and the sides very thick bezel all
around you know I don't find it I don't
find it unattractive it looks some
people have said that it looks like um
like it looks like a reference device or
a developer device a little bit
prototyped it almost looks like the dev
alpha yeah but it's it doesn't it
doesn't look that bad okay but it does
have a certain amount of no nonsense
like there's not a lot of glitz to it
it's you know it's a matte finish on the
top and bottom the bezel doesn't bother
me on the screen too much and the back
is this textured back that looks rigid
but it's actually kind of soft touchy it
feels pretty good um you know this is a
fun that I wouldn't mind beating up a
little bit it seems like it could take
it it's as if my girlfriend said last
night when I was showing it to her she
was like it's like an iPhone and a droid
had a pet a baby I guess basically what
it is it's like a cross between the
droid a baby and song already on God oh
no it is like like the weird offspring
of an iphone 5 and a droid x or
something like that I want that phone I
want that so it yet I mean hardware wise
it's cool can I tell you that something
a little weird and maybe this will make
me sound like a super amateur I don't
know but I had this with a Roger or a
bell Sam in Canada okay so this is you
know who's bored can find up there I
crossed the border in the United States
i'm still using it for navigation so I'm
like I'll let me pop in my AT&amp;amp;T sim
when I put in my AT&amp;amp;T sim and powered
this blackberry on I got instead of the
blackberry splash screen I got a brand
new AT&amp;amp;T splash screen no way yeah and
my ring tone changed to an AT&amp;amp;T ringtone
oh come on I didn't even know this was
technically possible i think yeah that's
so strange information was story asim
that could like affect splash screens
and like ring too I have no I are you
getting are you getting LTE oh yeah I
sure so you know it's probably I mean
it's wow that's very interesting it kind
of makes it kind of makes sense because
when you put the belt it's probably an
AT&amp;amp;T phone first and so you put the bell
sim and it says oh I'm roaming and then
we put the AT&amp;amp;T sim and it's like oh I'm
at home you know this so no this is an
unlocked global device no I think I
think that what they're doing is they
you know they they're changing something
you know they have a way of something is
pre-installed on the phone and when it
detects the sim it just adapts because
you know whenever you buy a blot you
like here in my country by Theo
blackberry it gives you a Teagle splash
screen or you go to Claude oh and you
get the other splash screen and
obviously that's pre-installed on the
phone but I guess they figured out a way
to do it you know like you know in a way
that it could flip itself depending on
what happens can probably even downloads
it from the net and just you know you
just really don't know what's happening
well I could but yeah it actually could
be you could use the data connection to
just grab it but so anyway I found that
very interesting can we talk just
briefly about some of the the one point
out stuff that that is very obvious like
that they really had to rush this thing
out the door it is it's it's once again
very reminiscent of picking up my palm
pre and like going home with it on in
2009 and being like oh oh you guys
weren't done oh that's amazing that they
it's it's really incredible if that is
the case because this has been you know
this is already delayed one timing what
have they been you know I I'm sure it's
very complicated to do what they've done
but it's just surprising but anyway what
is a half-baked the navigation the
turn-by-turn navigation would I used
from Toronto to Boston and that's a nine
hour drive as I said before and it
performed well it's using map data from
Tom Tamra Garmin or something like that
it's
being experienced it's very bare bones
but worse than that it freezes so like
the phone doesn't freeze the phone
doesn't hang a reboot but the app like
all of a sudden the road animation will
stop moving and also it's so it's worse
than Apple maps can that be even
possible yeah well I mean as far as the
maps itself go the maps are fine if
they're a little bare bone but the
navigation so like I'm driving along and
I'm like all of a sudden I realized that
like for 15 miles the display on the
screen hasn't changed much like I've
been in a gradual left-hand turn for 15
miles and I'm like what that can't be
right and if i unlock today I'm like oh
you're not even updating what's going on
so that happened about six or seven
times in 9 hours so that was exciting
don't use a z10 to to drive with it's a
it's it's interesting notes where is it
first impressions versus driving notes
I've got I've got a whole bunch of notes
for the for the for the eventual review
i guess or whatever we do but like the
facebook Messenger is so laggy that it's
completely unusable the blackberry
blackberry is built in this kind of like
Siri competitor which is pretty much the
same icon is Siri which is very kind of
test and it's convenient because you can
use it with the convenience k that's
between the volume up and volume down
you press and hold and then you've got
voice command but like I was using it to
make phone calls yesterday and i'm like
call you know Brandon minimun and then
it thinks about it for like 15 seconds
and then it's like and then when it
finally decides to call you regardless
of how many numbers you have like I have
like six phone numbers under you Brennan
it's like calling Brandon minimun mobile
like the only time it asks which number
you want to call is like if you have
multiple mobile instances always
defaults to mobile and then this is what
I it competes with s voice then God you
know what it doesn't even compete with s
voice like it's it's that it's pretty
bad and what Brandon didn't I send you
an email yesterday yeah it was like I
like aliens on my birthday that are
naked Oh what was I will actually uh
because you can't tell what the content
of the messages at all the aiea soso
voice tick tick tick I just got
an Android and Windows Phone so it's not
fantastic on my those phone but yes it
is fantastic and iOS Android a degree
but it's it's just it's it's it's slow
and not accurate what I will tell you
that listeners get to get to hear the
sentence this is what blackberry voice
dictation thought I was trying to say in
an email to Brandon no Tony I like the
more hot mama so maybe I have been
underwritten you later will exam
tomorrow like that's it is the most
ridiculous interpretation of nothing
speak it was the hot mama hot viola no
it wasn't it wasn't anything close to
that like I don't you know I'm not gonna
it's a little it's like it's it's like a
private business thing so I'm not going
to say what I was trying to say but man
that it was ridiculous so so there's
there's bugs you know none of them are
really major major except for that
driving one seriously don't don't don't
rely on the term a turn to get you
anywhere and but but you know these are
things that I imagine will get fixed
relatively quickly we have to see what
BlackBerry's track record is on updates
with the new BlackBerry OS we have to
see how well you know how quickly they
deal with bugs like this and how and and
and how quickly they can solve the app
problem frankly but I all this stuff
combined just to wrap it up really
really roughly from my end gives me more
hope for this platform than I thought I
kind of went to this event thinking I'm
like here's the last gasp out of
blackberry before somebody snaps them up
but ok you know they seem it's just it's
it's a product that I'm I'm excited
about actually ok i'll tell you why i
want that blackberry 10 yeah ok first of
all they're not doing the jumbo thing
right they're not you know they're
they're bringing in a decent size that's
good for your hand and that's focused on
really use using the phone and not just
lookin big you know thought that I agree
yet that I think I think we all kind of
agree with it with that idea that maybe
we kind of want our 442 4.3 inch phones
back yeah yes and we I also like the
fact that they are not doing mid-tier
you know they've you know they've always
been a mid tiered company which is funny
and now they're just doing high end
that's that's really interesting um but
really for me okay which are my biggest
gripes with iOS for example I hate
getting a notification and getting
popped into the app and have to wait for
the app to refresh oh that's so
ridiculous that is ridiculous notifying
me if it's not ready it's exactly i mean
if you come from windows mobile you're
really spoiled and you just don't want
for the apt to refresh and to my
understanding you don't have that prom
in blackberry right right now if you're
if you're a p8 of an app that like okay
the second thing is um for me you know I
feel that it's really smart that you
know when you turn on the phone the
first thing you get I like the fact that
you don't actually don't have to press
the power button I like the fact that
you can slide it on yeah which is really
cool it is home oh yeah everyone
everyone in the comment but i hate the
commenters today by the way all the like
i made yes that's a whole nother thing
but um everyone's like oh you know me
you know I wouldn't like that cuz it's
gonna like unlock in my pants pocket
like alright that's fine is legitimate
you can mash your palm against the
screen you can mash your thigh against
that it doesn't matter it is finger
detection it's not unlocking in your
pants pocket everyone settled down
please continue her at how does it do
that without you know wasting battery
life and we should talk about battery
life soon but doesn't it have to like
constantly watch for a gesture like that
constantly wait for a gesture yeah I
don't know how it does it but um you
you'll recall that the n9 did the same
thing with amigo yeah yeah mine did the
sink you can drag from bit and firm and
for me the thing about it is it's better
life was fun you remember whole string
on blackberries you remember that you
could buy a holster and when you put it
in the holster it would turn off coat on
and then you pulled it out and it turned
it on it does that I did the holster
that I have does that now yeah cuz it
comes with 100 you're kidding it does
that too it comes with one yeah it's got
a matter on a better that's God the man
got screwed up my hotel key mother made
me fall in love with blackberry years
ago yeah it's gonna do it again I am
going to do it again yes okay but one
thing that I really found interesting is
the whole thing that when you turn the
phone on you go into your recently used
apps i mean i think that's like a really
smart thing I mean what else do you you
what else do you do when you turn on
phone I mean you want to go usually the
recently you mean here's the deal I have
a ton of apps on my iphone or on my
droid phone but still there are really
only like five apps that I like
permanently and constantly use and here
i get a tiles so I i like that i like
the fact that my five favorite lee use
applications instagram facebook email of
twitter are gonna be permanently in the
cards in front well yeah i just want to
keep using them yeah absolutely yeah and
you're gonna automatically refresh
themselves in the card right and
sometimes they'll they'll turn into like
like widget like things like if the app
supports it when they're minimized you
can watch the the process killer or
whatever connects is doing you can watch
it coming in in the background cuz the
card will minimize to like a minimized
view first then after about two or three
seconds if it's enabled for like widget
view it'll flash up its its widget form
a problem with that like if you have if
you have the weather app open and you
know you you only check the weather once
a day and you're using other apps the
weather widget which is useful to see
the temperature floats to the bottom of
the page right yes and that is forget in
it I don't think and I don't think you
can rearrange them now I'm trying to
rearrange now walls ball but that could
be a version two you know I just I feel
that here's the deal it's gotta be yeah
what what the what the things don't i
like about iOS for example i like you
know I like that the UI is very well you
know it uses the space very well and it
does the same on blackberry 10 I like
that you know they're not giving you
people in like Gigantor text at the top
and just blocking like half your display
you know they're actually using the hub
better in when it comes to space but you
know I like the fact that it's elegant
and that it uses space well and I like
the fact that it's actually smart you
know the hub is smart I always felt that
it was Martin blackberry said in all the
previous versions so I am looking
forward to it I am looking forward to
waiting on on them to figure out apps
and I definitely want a z10 that's me
yeah yeah I wanted to to say Brennan in
response to your brief bit about battery
life it is not impressive so far not
impressive is that movie you're using it
a lot or because you're watching it go
down by ten percent with five minutes is
a combination i mean i am using it a lot
um it is a tiny cell to it's like 1800
milliamp hours now everybody's
complaining about the battery on
yeah it doesn't seem like it's gonna do
too well on the battery life thing but
well I'm going to reserve judgment but
you know you've got a you've got a
really you know further for the device
sighs you've got a really large and high
resolution screen I know it's not large
in conventional terms but it's it's it's
a large its large relative to the
battery and you have this blackberry hub
that's working you know it's got LTE
it's got a lot of power draining stuff
going on I mean let me ask you something
yeah uh the blackberry 10 is one of the
first pretty much fully gesture-based
operating systems it doesn't rely on
buttons or am I wrote it requires you to
remember a bunch of gestures right are
you finding that to be frustrating or or
or is it helpful yeah not have buttons
yes yes both it's it's awesome because
gesture based OS is once you get into
the groove of them you really you really
can move pretty quickly and you can get
a lot done with much more so than
mashing on a stupid mechanical button
which I've just hate so eighties yes it
is well and and it extends the
durability of the phone I mean Brandi
just had a problem with the iphone 4s
with a button being the button dragon
but the thing is no no it's true but
also there is a learning curve and this
is the important part and this is what i
think is hurting windows 8 already and
it's it's gonna hurt blackberry because
the learning curve for the gestures on
blackberry i would argue are steeper
then gather their crazy that go go up
and then to the left or right to the
left again right now yes not as good
it's not because you slide up with your
thumb from the bezel to unlock now
that's intuitive but you slide up from
the bezel and the screen extends to the
right and then you move to the right
then it extends further to the right
like that's not it doesn't immediately
come to you and then you slide down from
the top four settings that's that's okay
but the thing is sometimes there's a
back button and sometimes there's not if
there's not a back button you have to
remember what direction to slide the
screen to go back and if there is a back
button sometimes you forget to look for
it because you're trying to slide the
screen so there's a lack of consistency
in the gesture based you I that is
frustrating and if you have somebody
who's not like a lot but
forgive me but like maybe a lot of
business users who are like I don't have
time to mess around i need just or just
for it to work like the same thing they
feel about windows 8 right because like
if you're not willing to invest the two
or three days into getting used to the
gestures that I think it probably takes
then this thing is going to have I would
wager that it's going to have a high
return rate until blackberry figures out
a way to communicate gestures once again
I found like a broken record but I can
come back to webos webos suffered
significantly in the retail outlets
before it before palm was able to teach
people how to use the gestures with an
animation and blackberry has a little
guy down here that you can like you know
view the gut and how to work the
blackberry but it doesn't let you like
it shows you what to do in the screen
with animations but you can't actually
do the action it's asking Schneider
actors right so it's like so it's like
put your thumb here and then slide up
like this and then a green arrow does it
and then it's like and I'm like oh okay
I'd like to try that then it's like
swipe right to see the next thing I'm
like no no I want to try it I made that
in one hour some in turn made that real
quick yeah I think gestures to for the
record I think gestures are our mistake
I think and you know we were talking
about that with randon on on launch day
well and so sadly we we recorded our
impressions of blackberry 10 and we
couldn't upload the video for certain
technical issues no no you know it was
really disappointing but the thing is I
think gestures are missed our mistake
you know I love gestures on OS 10 but
they're optional you're not forced to
use them yeah I I don't think it's a
mistake I really don't i just think that
it's not in its launch iteration it's
not consistent enough and it's not it's
gonna be very difficult to educate the
customer on and that's the prob I think
that I think that one gesture to be
basic like going home and or turning the
phone on and then the UI should be
filled with arrows and then people could
just gesture if they want or use the
arrows well going home is is pretty
consistent like from anywhere in the OS
you can swipe up from the bezel on the
bottom to go back to the home screen so
there is that at least yeah but there
needs to be more consistency introduced
yet but anyway um yeah I don't know if
we have a ton of content coming on
blackberry
like really a lot I think we have a lot
more to do don't worry the next time we
compare a blackberry to Windows Phone I
will remember that you can search for
apps in windows phone by the way oh yeah
oh yeah the only thing is why were you
gonna search for apps if you weren't
gonna find any Oh troll in yeah all
right so let go by the way I feel like a
kid in a candy store windows phone 7.8
because Spotify works on it what yeah
yes horse adjust position right yeah
it's based on 7 and all the 7 apps work
on it and Spotify is working so i don't
like a kid in a candy store i don't want
to talk about that at all I'm that
frustrates meets into no degree every
time I pick up on Windows Phone and I'm
like I love almost every part about you
and then I can't use Spotify and I'm
like get out of my face go over there
with the other Instagram lyst devices um
let's see coming I look I could talk
about blackberry all day but we should
probably move on to other platforms you
guys agree given my way and closing
thoughts on blackberry well well
actually I i just i'd like to get Jaime
and I started to do this and then we ran
into a problem I liked it to get a
prediction for him from all of you about
what we're going to be talking about in
a year from now if blackberry will be
like Windows Phone is today you know you
know it get it getting gaining momentum
or if people will have not received it
very well Wow I think that depends on I
think that ultimately depends on whether
rim is able or blackberry is able to
survive long enough to make it to this
time next year and if it is not if it is
not hardy enough to survive if it gets
snapped up by somebody else then whether
that acquiring company is willing to
continue with this platform so in if
that is the case if whoever acquires
them if that happens is willing to keep
pushing blackberry into the market or if
rim survives and they're willing to keep
pushing black friend of the market which
is obviously they are then yes I think
this absolutely has a chance of still
being around in a year and fighting the
good fight against windows phone if they
run into problems where they can't scale
if
effectively or if they run out of money
and they miss a cycle like palm did then
it'll be it'll be palm all over again
yeah that that's what I you've got a
good point i mean this could be like the
palm story all over again if he I don't
want it to be because that was a
horrible horrible experience for you
know everyone were you yeah for me
especially if I yeah I don't know my
predictions are that blackberry has
better chances of succeeding than
Windows Phone and I do believe that this
is the next underdog and you know at
least in emerging countries there is so
much of a fan base already for
blackberry that there is a lot of
potential for the platform to strive I
just I feel that sadly you know when
those phone is not gonna be there yet I
feel that they they're still running
over excuses or for me blackberry is the
next underdog and I disagree with hi may
I think windows phone will continue to
be this third clicks underdog because i
feel that Windows Phone finally has
momentum yeah they're selling a lot of
Lumias you've got multiple hardware
partners making devices this blackberry
thing you're never gonna see an HTC or
Samsung blackberry so they've always got
that and you know the only company that
I can think of that can pull off making
their own hardware and software is Apple
well that's the thing blackberry pretty
much taught them how to do that right so
you know I think just looking at the
facts of the situation and looking at
how it feels windows phone is not going
anywhere like Windows Phone is is has a
lot of momentum as you just said Brandon
and also Microsoft is completely
unwilling to to let that just go by the
wayside I mean they're aggressively
they're gonna just keep their foot on
the gas until windows phone is out there
and on the other side of things you have
blackberry with far fewer resources and
a much more precarious situation as a
company but with this fierce thing where
we're even torsten Hines who doesn't
express emotion I don't think like ever
was like you know saying things like
this isn't the finish line this is the
starting line and we could have gone
with another platform but instead we
decided to just stay the course and do
our own thing and I mean they have the
there's fierce determination at the new
blackberry I think to make this work so
you have these two these two platforms
vying for the third place spot that are
going to collide and it's going to be
it's not going to be a
an uninteresting show it's going to be
really incredible I think in a year we
stand a pretty good chance of seeing
these two really in a heated battle yeah
well it's fun talking about blackberry
for a full hour and five minutes left
yeah yeah let's let's see if we can
blaze through some of the some of this
other so because there has been other
news i haven't read any of it until this
morning because I've been too busy in
Toronto but this is um this is some cool
stuff I guess samsung is teasing a Super
Bowl ad for for for sunday i love i i i
was watching I was floating through
YouTube last night and I saw that video
come up and I happily watched that
entire advertisement because it was just
it was funny and here and it was is also
low frustrating cuz it's like you guys
are gonna just talk about the note 2 at
the Super Bowl aren't you and and you
know that's what's gonna happen but
think the ad was funny with Seth Seth
Rogen and that other dude I was pregnant
I was really funny freaking uh Paul Rudd
like the best comedic actor ever i love
him um yea high self to watch the ad i'm
not gonna lie to you i haven't had time
to watch commercial but i'm glad to hear
it's cool i'm annoyed that yeah it's
probably gonna be pushing an old product
but not an old product but you know not
one of their newer ones but it's you
will have to wait until sunday to see if
you're not an American listener you're
probably are still aware that the Super
Bowl is a massive slot for ad pushes and
this is going to be huge you know I with
the amount of resources samsung throws
into their marketing though i have to
say that like i'm excited to see the
commercial or whatever but I it's I'm
getting a little tired of Samsung
saturating there was I feel like Tony
like two months ago where he was like I
will not buy a samsung device because
I'm tired of seeing their billboards
because I already have one for free I
you know I feel a little like Tony I'm
like I'm like you know I'm getting tired
of seeing I mean literally it's
everywhere and I like mark I like
marketing saturation I love when a
company knows how to put a brand and
style and they didn't you know you know
I I have a lot of admiration for good
marketing creativity and I feel that
Samsung is doing it I think that they're
there
killing it with their ads I mean I think
they're their marketing firm should we
come in I think creativity is not really
the right word I agree their marketing
firm should be commended but these are
not the most creative ads I'd like you
know phone tablet the best of both yeah
but the thing is I mean creativity can
be so many more things than just art you
know it could be a compelling way to
make people laugh uh you know with a
stupid ad that only lasts 30 seconds
well yeah but I don't none of them make
me laugh I guess it's maybe just a taste
thing where it's like I understand how
exactly oh god I hate you God I'm like
Samsung seriously think this is the
thing this is what you're doing now
you're like you're like promoting
sexting like I have nothing against
sexting but it's like wow all right wait
a way to be weird samsung thanks for
making me feel a little dirty and
awkward anyway blah blah blah blah blah
let's talk a little more about samsung
because they have bought a stake in
wacom the company that makes awesome to
pressure-sensitive art pads and the
digitizer within the galaxy note of the
galaxy note 2 and the ghost an attendant
one and presumably the Galaxy Note 8 all
the Galaxy Notes I can't wait for the
galaxy s3 to get an S Pen oh why really
uh you know I you I'd be willing to i'd
be willing to carry that thing you know
somewhere you know I you know I just I
love the Galaxy Note it's currently my
daily driver and I just you know it's
funny cuz you don't have the knowledge
it either and i just cannot go back to
the galaxy s3 welch isn't to do things
that that s pen does are just like men
it really adds value to the phone i hate
you i use a typical conversation I have
with someone hi how are you good how you
doing good what phone you use i'm using
the note 2 yeah uh ever use that s been
no are you uh but i'm glad i have it uh
I don't use it looky you know it's funny
because I was sitting at dunkin donuts
today with the with the blackberry z10
and at one point I went to pull out the
S Pen haha because I'm so used to using
the note 2 and I'm not like I use the S
Pen all the time but I do use it when
I'm sitting there and I have both hands
available the S Pen is really good for
scrolling because you can just hover
over the bottom of it is awesome and you
know it's funny but I already figured
out how to write on this thing no no one
knows you're right no don't
you know way to pit I can't believe I'm
doing this but I'm doing so so this is
cool we have the whole spectrum we have
me who used the S Pen infrequently
Brandon who's like just not even what
and I'm is like yeah man i just i wrote
my grocery list on this like that's Kyle
I am serious I mean I like it I it's
something nice to have it adds value and
I'd rather have it than not have it yeah
I I guess I guess you're not wrong I
guess your opinion is not wrong um I get
you know what's so funny about this red
flashing light is you really can't
ignore it like I just keep getting
derailed because the blackberry light
keeps going off just turn it over right
yeah I don't want to it's so pretty
anyway um so it's cool that Samsung has
bought this stake in in in in Wacom
because I mean what does this mean for
the future here I mean it still work
it's like Steven story says it works out
to a merely 60 million dollar investment
which is like peanuts for samsung but
that's you know that's significant well
just think about it they they want to
make it exclusive to them sure that sets
anything x i 70 so is that what this i
mean is that the most significant
takeaway here is that meaning that like
all these competitors that are trying to
ride the notes coattails and come out
with six inch plus phones like are not
are gonna have to find another way to
differentiate because they're not gonna
be able to do with the stylus unless
there's another company that makes an
excellent pressure-sensitive digitizer
that can be incorporated into a
beautiful display right which i don't
know about yeah it's a competing thing I
mean apple bought liquid metal we still
don't know what they're gonna use it for
but they bought it did that what'swhat's
liquid metal why am I am i it's a
special type of metal that's as strong
as aluminum but it's lighter oh so it's
like what Nokia is doing with that that
weather weird material right yeah yeah
yeah you know they bought that they
bought the whole company they just
wanted from them stuff for themselves we
still haven't seen a device use it
probably the iphone 6 so you never know
but but you know that's what they do
they buy these really unique things like
Siri because they don't want anybody
else to grab them right and i make sense
i mean competitively speaking that's
makes sense yeah speaking that's just
keep rolling out with the samsung stuff
we are hearing a rumor that there might
not be an official unpacked event
at mwc do we think this has any great
well it didn't happen last year as well
they didn't have an updated most likely
be that way I mean Sam so just had their
own show and it makes sense you know
last year we were really underwhelmed by
really mid to phones being launched
would have a couple of really bad
tablets come on no that's a galaxy
samsung is there the galaxy beam their
brother come on now God you know the
girl was like I am sorry but the booth
that we used to demo the galaxy beam is
currently being used and I'm like oh so
that thing can't illuminate the wall
she's like no you need to be in a in a
little lights issue its move on like all
right look at galaxy beam and the
projector phone is something that was
just know each other I remember I was
telling a friend of mine he was like oh
have you seen that galaxy beam it just
arrived at a store next you know there's
this store here and it just the right
that it's really cool it i might just
imagine yourself for a minute talking to
your friends and try to show them
something on the wall but then having
some okay let's go to a dark room no
that is not gonna sound right so you
know it's true um so yeah you know but
it was confusing to me because Samsung
was willing to have a giant event at CES
for their like TVs but they're not
willing to have any kind of event for
the note 8 which we're pretty sure is
gonna drop at mwc hmm I don't know I
need that's a good point I guess a good
point we'll find out where we're now in
the same arm down yeah one thing that
will be revealed at mwc everyone hold on
to your hats is the ZTE 5.7 inch grand
memo 50 grand memo out I've been waiting
for this forever what is ET by the way
it's that it's not that that feeling you
get in your stomach when you eat too
many beans gozie okay right you know we
played with some of the Grand line at at
CES and some you know we like some of
some of what we saw there with the grand
s not the grand king s as what's
happened I think that's the only part
you liked about it the faculty were
cracking up about that the rest of the
afternoon he tricked us she really did I
don't think she had the wherewithal to
trick us meme oh I keep forgetting with
like sex
frats a fire saffron sacra yes anyway um
anyway yeah so whatever everyone is I
think you know ZTE is is entering the
race to build the next not very good
phablet right we have this mate we have
the grant we've Sony's rumored
monstrosity with its digitizer photo I
do Berkman struck yeah man I mean like
none of this is gonna be a note killer
like nothing as we just talked about
with this kind of wacom thing like
unless companies find a way to
differentiate based on something other
than size you can build a phablet fine
pill to build a giant phablet that's
cool but it has to have another
something else to set it apart even if
it is innovative multitasking like that
would actually make a lot of sense my 12
year old son was like man you look
really ridiculous putting that galaxy
note 2 on your head so can you imagine
doing that with you know like the 6 inch
yeah the 6.1 inch because like I said
god seriously it's just that well we'll
pull a Tony they're doing that with the
iPad yeah with you baby um so okay
whatever let's let's let's move on from
that there's also on the opposite side
of the spectrum from sound wise there's
this HTC mini oh job I loved I loved
Stevens headline here the HTC mini is a
great idea that will be mocked to death
and then he's right he's right you lose
gonna buy a phone or his phone sir no
one is going to use that it's a 10 less
you're inside of a room where no one
else's okay so here's the deal in the
Western world countries like the one I
live on you know theft is so common here
that I would gladly have an HTC mini and
pull it out but then you know it's gonna
be like ah so it is there's a point
where you're just like well I've been
pulling out my iphone 5 forever since it
was launched and I haven't got mugged
yet so right so why do i why do I need a
minute you're gonna need to be mugged in
order to really want to start using that
thing if you're not familiar with the
mini it is a it is an accessory a
bluetooth accessory for a smartphone
that looks like a like a wireless home
telephone from like 1996 except shrunken
down to a very small size it's got a
keypad on us got a little screen and
it's basically just a bluetooth
accessory free phone so
I get it you know actually how may you
make a good point in the anti-theft
argument I remember about four or five
years ago somebody had built a bluetooth
headset into like an old-school nokia
3390 or something like that and it was
basically selling them on a on a maid
for you basis so that if you bought that
brand new like six hundred dollars
smartphone and you wanted to keep that
in your pocket if you're in a high crime
area or you know you don't want to see
people you know you don't want people to
see you're talking on your very
expensive phone yeah yeah but you think
for those people that have not been
mugged yet this is the way it works they
stop you they put a gun into your face
in their life by the way as they're like
empty your pockets so what am I gonna do
keep the droid DNA and like my underwear
or what I mean is it I don't know CIB i
am captain to phone so I'm often walking
around with two phones and I often
wonder about that I'm like what if I got
held up again could I just give him like
my less valuable phone that's always on
my mind man I'm like okay what am I
gonna give him this is a very much they
send you back home naked so there's just
no way for you to conceal the phone
especially if it's a phablet there's
like really no cavity at your body to
actually hold that tips on being mugged
from the bottom our weekly podcast he
he's he's like he's like hey man what
are you so happy about and you're like
no that's just my note 2 in the bottom
okay it's vibrating junk it's just it's
just my S Pen believe me it's your ass
better your AP hey my sea pen oh god the
sea pen it's such an awful thing um oh
yeah that's the dump n then awful
capacitor pen from Samsung for like 30
bucks yeah let's uh let's close out
Android because there's this beautiful
frickin unicorn phone called the Nexus 4
which I don't really you know we've
talked about we talked it to death but
it's white there are many more shots now
of this white Nexus very pretty either
they get an orderly sell it I don't know
nobody knows oh and I mean are they
actually get a cylinder oh there
well it's available at the black one
they still haven't figured out how to
sell they got it they got it available
it's been available for like a whole day
now like that's that's that's a world
record yeah this this is if you're not
if you're not seeing the photos you
should look at them of the nexus 4 in
white because it almost single-handed
lately like changes my opinion on it not
that I think the black one is ugly but I
would almost be able to put up with no
LTE for the white yeah none of these
yeah I like the white ones yeah there's
probably more Android news but we are we
have to keep movin you want to go into
Windows Phone 8 here and talk about our
favorite tablet ooh so it's nice about
going into this story which is titled a
surface RT return rate reportedly very
high is that if you skip the body of the
story and go right down to the comments
as many windows phone champions do you
can read the outrage and they're just
the bubbling fury of these extremely
defensive and angry angry people who
always comment on Windows Phone stories
and then you can see all the up votes
they get from their cronies I i I'm
going to write a piece soon about how
you are ruining ruining windows of 8 and
Windows Phone for me and for Microsoft
you overly aggressive commenters and I
don't like you and you guys did you guys
see the comments on the post that I did
of the surface pro and inhuman Bona I
didn't you know that an MSP 48 version
but all you get is twenty four gigs
available yeah well you know there's no
sense in reporting on the fact no right
but you know i got like i got like a
hundred comments of people that were
like okay they were trying to defend the
undefendable it's like yeah but what's
wrong with 24 games and i'm like i could
buy a fully fledged macbook air for 100
bucks more and get fifty nine gigs of
storage available and not 24 so like
yeah why don't you just start removing
the blower and I'm like well what's the
point then I mean what's the point of
having to remove stuff yeah so this is
entirely true and I'm sure we will talk
about this next week because i think
this editorial isla will go up next week
sometime and brent and i'll probably run
about you first Oh
yeah so anyway the point is this the
surface RT return rate has been reported
to be very high by cnet this was via PC
world yeah pc world and there's there's
some suggestion is the actual number of
shipped surface RT's looks to fluctuate
between 900,000 and 1.25 million but the
actual like sell-through might be
significantly lower around 700,000
because of very high return rate and
that's not about the hardware it's about
the software is what the story tells us
now I I mean hi mate we know how you
feel about this IIIi understand exactly
how you feel about this story I want to
hear I want to know if Brandon is
surprised by this I if it's true bought
a surface RT yeah I wonder if i gloated
very quickly infinity yeah and i think i
think a lot of other people are doing
the same thing you know i don't think i
would have kept a surface RT in its
current state i like whereas just to
draw a quick parallel to to blackberry
not that i want to keep talking about it
but if i bought a black bear in its
current state i could forgive it's um I
could forgive the errors that it brings
a board with its one point 0 kind of
product with Windows Phone excuse me
with windows 8 i'm not sure i could
forgive the lack of functionality that i
find in it for my needs so i would
probably have been one of the returners
as well and but I mean you know Jaime
you would have you would have kept it
and bought four more right oh yeah I
would have definitely you know I need
these like car cleaners very bad like no
I you know I find it a complete irony I
mean Microsoft is a software company how
is it that they make these you know they
make this really cool hardware on the
surface and then the software sucks
right how is that possible i was i was
at this at the staples the other day i
was looking at the new spread of windows
8 and office 365 stuff which is all very
interesting then I see the surface and I
just i'm reminded of how absurd some
aspects of it are like for example they
had the touch cover no that's good you
know so people can type with one hundred
and fifty dollars and then they had
different
of the touch cover for a hundred and
what is it twenty dollars it's it's so
overpriced and then and then I looked at
the prices of like Windows Windows 8 is
like in the hundreds now like 199 bucks
or something after the the discount is
over when it was previously 40 bucks and
and then office office is like a hundred
and sixty bucks or something and
Microsoft just has the wrong idea about
pricing and what people are willing to
pay and it's they're gonna figure it out
very quickly in an age when when OS 10
is like 19 bucks and where people are
switching to google docs it's it's
easier than ever to say no to microsoft
office today because there are so many
alternatives this is the time when they
need to get real on pricing not only for
office and windows but for you know a
touch cover that that you know that's a
really good point III have not often
thought about how price factors into all
this and you're absolutely correct i
mean we see what happens to tablets that
enter the market overpriced i mean
they're very very quickly discounted and
the surface as the surface seen it's big
discount yet or no no well it's close to
getting there i mean just think about it
how many android tablets survived before
the kindle fire came out and dropped
everything to 200 bucks right i mean
really really until my droid market is
is flooded with overpriced android
tablets too I mean still they they've
tried to learn a lesson but look at
companies like toshi about where it's
like yeah we got this awesome 7-inch
tablet which legitimately really is
awesome in this 8270 or whatever yeah
it's like it's it's only like five
hundred bucks but then you still have
microsoft ads that are that are you
they're like oh this is a delicious
clicking noise that you get from the
touch cover and the surface and you're
like man these guys really don't get it
you know these guys really just don't
get it starting from marketing to their
own products yes it goes back to that
discussion about the introductory
commercials to the surface we're all
about clicking in like this click thing
like who cares about that people care
about what the thing actually does and I
guess they don't really want to talk
about it because it doesn't do anything
it runs were on PowerPoint in this bake
windows environment and gives you access
to a library of the
smallest app store ever although maybe
I'll get better so I think that um I
think that the here the tanks rolling
around the corner and I think some
people are getting ready with
rocket-propelled grenades outside my
window so we should probably know I am
here I you're gonna propel your rockets
so listen let's talk about something a
little bit more positive on the
Microsoft side in this by the way this
made me feel really warm and said the
google has extended to google announced
that it would have liked months ago that
it was going to terminate exchange
exchange activesync support for windows
phone devices which would have
completely eviscerated contact sync and
and some one of the oak calendar sync
and also would have relegated gmail to
I'm app on windows phone devices well it
has extended that January 31st which was
yesterday I guess google announced that
the extension will go until July
thirty-first yeah which means a
Microsoft now has time to bake these I
guess these open protocols like CalDAV
and carddav into Windows Phone 8 in a
future update which will preserve this
sinking ability now I was terrorized I
mean like you know I've you know that
Lumia 920 is one of my daily drivers by
the way commenters I use a windows phone
as a daily driver shut up um anyway you
know that I use this and I was petrified
because i also am very invested in the
Google yuko system so I'm like I can't
ik i'm not gonna be able to deal with
this i mean you know i went the minute i
switch phones to another windows phone
i'm gonna lose all this stuff so i'm
very pleased as i'm sure many people are
about this extension I wonder what went
on and like backdoor deals to get this
done I'm sure Microsoft had to do
something real nice for Google you know
what I mean yeah they probably had to
cop something up yeah here's what
happened they said yo how about a bunch
of cash they're like I wondered uh yeah
I wonder if it I don't know I still I
have this theory where I feel that you
know Apple and Google they hate each
other but they get along better than
they do with Microsoft and I just feel
that they are just doing everything in
their power to destroy the competitive
side of Microsoft they're doing
everything they can to pull the rug from
the
from from their floor and any there it's
just evident it's really working and
just like a second finds out there's
pretty much getting you know a little
breath of their own money cuz they did
that you know you know Google comes up
with with their google search and then
comes Microsoft with Windows Live search
and everything that everybody has ever
done cool that you know Microsoft has
wanted to compete and so I feel that
it's fine that they're doing this to
Microsoft it doesn't it make it doesn't
that make it very confusing that Google
actually kind of relented on this like I
feel like Microsoft really must have
come at them aggressively with some kind
of offer because Google was like had its
feet set in the mud like it was like now
we're not we're not doing this like even
two weeks ago you know Microsoft was
comes out with this press statement
they're like we're very surprised about
this we we wish we could have worked
with Google to preserve this I could
seem like there was no hope whatsoever
whoever pulled this deal out deserves to
get a week off I think because this is
going to really help Windows Phone in
the short term while Microsoft resident
works on implementing these discal Devon
carddav support or you can always switch
to outlook.com which I will not be doing
but where there's a very helpful link to
Adam lanes story on our site in this
news post I have no interest in having
an Outlook com email address but that is
just me that's that's almost as uncool
as having a hot meal it's just
everybody's like oh you don't you don't
get spotify but there's windows like
there's xbox music right I mean you
don't get instagram oh but we've got
these camera filters I'm like who and
who has ever told you that I wanted an
alternative to Instagram I know I want
to Instagram I don't ya I want Instagram
not the alternative so let's talk about
let's talk about a platform that has
Instagram and that has every other app
under the Sun we have news out of the
iOS camp for the first time in a while I
feel like this is I was like it's gonna
be another podcast when we don't talk
about Apple at all but no there's some
stuff here there's the ipad the ipad 5
may have had its back leaked has this
been debunked yet or is this still maybe
a rumor even if that is not it that is
it that is exactly what a knife I ipad 5
is going to look like yeah this is from
nine to five mac and it looks like an
ipad mini blown up to full full-size
iPad proportions and i just it does
jacket I think that thing is not a
photoshop thing and it looks really cool
and I want it if it's photoshop thing
like it with this masking tape on it
like somebody did a really good job on a
photoshop but I don't think it is either
like I keep saying this it's a sad time
for for the iPad because you've got the
bigger iPad which is like a tank and it
hurt it's painful to use and then we've
got the ipad mini which has this this
low res display and it's painful to you
I mean it's just had there's you know
good choice an ipad right now if you're
a detail-oriented person right I am
sorry I am a high-resolution man these
days I have a Retina Display MacBook Pro
an iphone 5 you know every single phone
that I have a 720p and as much as I love
the design of my ipad mini I do not use
it real I hate I hate because I have
become spoiled by reddit displays yeah
it's it's tough to use it really is yeah
that's why I give it's my wife well if
he gave the the what color is that the
copper-colored iPad to your wife she
doesn't even appreciate the bronze only
only I can appreciate the bronze like it
deserves to be appreciated thanks Anto
style Oh shout out outside today's
episode of the pocket our weekly is
brought to you by Anna style it's not by
the way it's not we don't have a sponsor
for the podcast let's talk more the show
if that's the ipad 5 that'll be pretty
cool moving on on the opposite side of
the spectrum completely is this budget
iPhone that keeps getting fricking
rumored and which I cannot be less
interested in do you think it's baddest
I don't think it's gonna happen it's not
right it's not gonna happen I mean
justjust it's not gonna happen no I mean
the iPhone 5 is gonna be the next budget
iPhone has always been so I mean Apple
is not gonna dilute their market share
they're gonna keep doing what they do
all right so this is a common wisdom
okay then I completely agree and I right
but I spent my that nine hour drive to
Toronto listening to podcasts talking
about apples earnings and Apple it
generated umpteen billions of dollars
like it always does and it's sold record
numbers of units and it is it by all
measures very healthy in exceeding the
healthy company an insanely healthy
company and unless you are a stock
trader in which case we
Apple missed its target well in this is
dr. Rick the predictions target not very
prediction not yet exactly and so this
is why I hate talking about finance this
is why I just I don't want to get into
that at all but this has this is
exerting a little bit of pressure on
Apple right now I think from a public
perception sense at least because you
know people even people who don't follow
technology like I'm talking to my dad a
couple like days ago and I'm like a lot
of Technology and dads like oh yeah
apple took a big hit huh I'm like oh did
they and then it looked and like oh yeah
so this is this is going to put a little
pressure on Apple on it it actually is
it speaks to the fact that the company
has lost a little bit of its momentum
and so I wonder if any of those
pressures will drive it to do something
like a budget iPhone at some point what
do you guys think I mean it is that'll
be a low-margin device so they won't
make as much money on it but I wonder if
that would be something we're like I
wonder what do you think would happen
what do you think the market would do if
Apple came out and announced like we are
in fact making a low budget iPhone here
it is like Jesus did lose their not
their speed okay listen they've had the
opportunity to build budget computers
for the past decade and they have been
they have not they have you know i
remember you know molly molly wood from
seeing at once asked you know steve jobs
she was like oh god you know the the you
know these are these android phones and
these and these cheap windows computers
are really killing your market share and
he was like yeah but we don't chip junk
right that that was his response to her
we don't ship junk we build products
that were proud of and this is what we
do and whoever you know whoever's
willing we sell high-end that's us you
know it's like trying to get BMW to
build something cheap it's just not
gonna happen there they'll dilute their
brand impression into something cheap
and apples not gonna do that and that's
been the consistent like
counter-argument I completely agree it's
steve jobs is no longer there I think
Tim Cook does have a you know I think
the company is still going in the same
direction Steve Jobs was leading it
which is it but and I'll give you a
perfect a sampling ok so the kindle fire
comes out for two hundred bucks and the
whole market went crazy because a
two-hundred-dollar tablet is something
they had never seen and did Apple pull
out the ipad bitty immediately for the
same two hundred bucks no and even when
they pulled it out
make at the same price no but they
arguably and you know I think it is a
much better product in the kindle fire
but oh yeah but well here's the deal but
they didn't go for the same cheap price
that the point being is competition is
not going to drive Apple to do something
cheaper well with it but the ipad mini
you could argue is a lower and device
than we've come to expect from apple
just in the in the screen itself i mean
like the screen is yeah and i know they
were backed into a corner on that with
developer concerns and stuff and
whatever but it's not you know it's not
a high-end it's not necessarily a very
high-end apple device that we've come to
expect so yeah and you want the tree
somewhere i'm never buying an ipad mini
again yes i do i go to coffee shops and
you know obviously people are there with
their kids and so you've got the father
with the big ipad you know doing his
thing and you got his kid with an ipad
mini and I'm like oh god I look so I
look so cheap I love so cheap I've never
doing this is like when I walked around
town with the with the veer for like two
months I had like the dainty phone that
I walk into a room where everybody had
like the either evos and I'm like hey
guys I'm pull out my 2.8 inch fear hi
yeah yeah no yeah well it they're doing
something right because they the tablet
market has grown 75% and Apple is still
leading it sold 22.9 million units in
the fourth quarter 2012 and I think
that's counting all ipads according to
this story unless I'm reading it wrong
because there's a lot of percentage
points and numbers in here and stuff
like that and but Samsung though so
Apple grew forty-eight percent over the
same quarter of the previous year in
tablish Evans but Samsung grew two
hundred sixty-three percent
year-over-year probably because they
finally started making tablets people
were interested in or Android you think
that I still don't see anybody with a
galaxy tab either which galaxy and this
is why it's confusing to me because they
but they've shipped eight million
tablets so III don't know I you know I
mean we just we're talking in the chat
we were trying to do a little time
management and uh I meant to reply to
Brandon the message with okay
but instead i replied 8 minutes which I
don't I think it was is a mix between
eight million and okay i don't i don't
know that's so funny yeah kind of to be
there that's yeah Brandon's like i have
to go in five minutes I'm like eight
minutes like a negotiation here all
right i'll do a six point two minutes
all right dude give me six and a half
give it to you no no no that's my my
bottom line sir but upon my dear i'm
walking now all right let's talk about
this last story and then let's close it
out once again we're gonna get back to
the reader mail at some point listeners
but we did have to talk about blackberry
for an hour today because it was
important there's 128 gigabyte ipad and
that's gonna do it for the pocket out
weekly and overkill overkill no i don't
think it's overkill like I I run out of
space aw I have a 32 gig and I run out
of space easily on 64 I'd probably run
on if you want a lot of movies and a lot
of music you need more space down to
Brandon Brandon minimun is that you Oh
is you said even possible oh you would
always be like why do you want a 64 gig
iphone and I'm like I want it that's
that was orange I need that was before I
started sinking Spotify playlists that
are like three four gigabytes but no
that's that's nothing if you're doing it
128 the problem with the 128 gigabyte
iPad its price it's ridiculous it's like
a thousand bucks yeah I'll buy a macbook
air for that money yeah it's like who
would do it it's crazy it's not it's not
on their website yet it's what's
pre-order and just as its perf every
fish so in four days from now so that is
a problem can get out if you want to
yeah like price guys I feel like if I
was gonna drop a thousand bucks at an
apple store or near the house bucks i
would get the iphones well no i would
probably get the 11-inch macbook air
before i got the hundred twenty guys
because I it is it is acutely you know
I've been seriously considering that you
know I've when I saw that 128 gig ipad I
was like man I'd rather buy a macbook
Karen you know the problem is you know I
carry this 15 inch Retina Display
MacBook Pro which is a
three-thousand-dollar computer and so
for me it's like you know I would love
to carry the ipad and be my coffee shop
machine but I just can't work with it so
I would rather buy an 11-inch macbook
air and have that be my iPad and then
use the galaxy note as my phone
and we leave the macbook pro here at
home I actually bought the 11-inch
MacBook guarantee for personal use and I
ended up returning it and getting a
13-inch because line there's something
different about like the first of all
the touchpad is about twenty to thirty
percent smaller the touchpad and because
of that it feels different like it's
very difficult to do certain gestures
because it's not big enough and there
were some other little problems that
they might have fixed in in the you know
it's been a generation or two since that
a but it's it's a cute little son of a
gun well it is and you know it just
realized that this problem that we're
always complaining about about large
phones being the only high-end ones sort
of extends to computers too because it's
very like it's not like Apple couldn't
afford to make an 11-inch macbook air
with this with serious guts and you know
capable of running stuff like Final Cut
Pro and whatever well the problem is the
thermal envelope of these computers yeah
really yeah you can't really build a
powerful computer yet on a small chassis
because you know it'll just heat up so
much it'll turn off I didn't know that
okay well yeah no that's a good point
yeah speaking of heat the blackberry z10
gets very hot that's gonna do it for the
pocket I weekly where does it get on the
back yeah in the back and would be
especially well to be fair I was
stressing it i was i was charging it and
i was using it for navigation so I mean
are you yeah but we'll have more more
thoughts on the blackberry z10 in the
week ahead but um I think we better wrap
it up Brennan you have to go we have
business to attend to in a little over
an hour i think a little under an hour
and I think we should jet can I get some
final thoughts from from you hi mate or
you Brandon or you both okay whenever
they ping you for the AT&amp;amp;T review unit
of the z10 thank you very much I
appreciate it you know my address no
problem I am getting that cute Enda go
ahead so so final thoughts I'm I'm oh is
on the lookout for the next device or
technology thing that's going to improve
my life and this blackberry thing has me
cautiously interested and I well you
know I will absolutely be doing coverage
on it myself to offer some different
perspectives Jaime sounds like he's
going to be jumping in line and we've
got Michael's to UM
a little bit more negative on it than I
am more positive because I can't answer
the question why blackberry 10 and
that's that's my final thought so that's
a good that's a that's a solid final
thought and we'll look forward to to
revisiting this in the weeks ahead but
the one thing is clear we are absolutely
going to be covering it in depth so we
have yet another platform to add to the
