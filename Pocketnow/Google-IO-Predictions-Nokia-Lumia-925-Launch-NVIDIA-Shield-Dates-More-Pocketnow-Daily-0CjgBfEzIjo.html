minor surprise Nvidia's new project
shield should be ready for release is
very soon and blackberry will bring bbm
to iOS and Android almost half a decade
late I'm hi Mary meta and after so any
unsurprising events today it's time for
cold beer the spoken out daily the
sources day off talking about nvidia the
company has just confirmed their much
expected project shield will now just be
called the Nvidia shield it'll retail
for 350 bucks and you can buy it in June
and pre-order as early as May twentieth
even though you can sign up right now
and obviously if you're out there to
play some android games on a gaming
console that's designed for android
games now i'm going to show you off the
new Tegra 4 well stay tuned 350 bucks is
actually quite compelling now let's talk
about blackberry the company has just
unveiled their new BlackBerry q5 and
yeah that was the r10 that was leaked
recently in their roadmap and it's just
the mid tiered phone that I wouldn't
even recommend you wait for even though
it's going to be launched in July but
aside from that the company has just
confirmed that bbm you know that
blackberry messenger that's existed
forever is now gonna be available for
iOS and Android as a free application
five years later when nobody really
cares about BBM now you do it blackberry
i mean i don't even have any friends
left on BBM this well let's see how it
goes it's gonna be free and it's gonna
launch in July as well now let's talk
about the HTC droid DNA as Verizon is
now asking you to sign up to their
social networks and you can get a droid
DNA for free after obviously a two-year
contract and signing up and everything
but it just bets to wonder at verizon is
already preparing to launch their HTC
One and since the company has made a lot
of fanfare about their ctia event it
could be the case that since we already
have the nokia lumia 928 we might be
getting the HTC one for verizon right
now in the next coming days will stay
tuned now let's move over to Nokia's
they've had their event in London
happened today and locust what we've got
their new Nokia Lumia 925 AKA catwalk
being announced and i'm not even going
to bore you with the specs because you
already know them it's pretty much the
Lumia 920 with an aluminum rim
polycarbonate chassis that's pretty much
it it's got some enhancements in the
camera some enhancements and software
these software features are actually
going to come to the other Lumias in
July anyways with their gdr2 updates is
being called Amber so well I guess it
wasn't really that hot of the devices we
were expecting but we've got a full
round table discussion if everything
that all of us pakka now and it is
thought about it so links down below and
leave us your opinion in the comments as
to what you think about the Lumia 925 so
far none of us are really impressed and
by the way it's going to launch on
tmobile proudly exclusively so stay
tuned for that would as well and finally
for the sceptical news of the day Google
i/o is happening tomorrow we've got some
photographs of the show floor and
nothing points out to there being a
product being launched so it could just
be that send our patch I was actually
not lying when he said that they were
gonna focus on software and not really
on hardware we are expecting some Nexus
goodness to happen at this event but
then again coming from the guy that came
up with a Chromebook pixel you know that
very expensive netbook you're never
gonna buy I'm not really sure i really
want hardware coming from them but
anyways that leads you to the question
of the day what are your predictions for
google i/o tomorrow what do you think
that Google is going to launch do you
think that we are going to get at least
a new version of Android do you think
that we are going to get some software
hardware sorry I'm in my particular case
I do believe that we're at least getting
a product I mean meaning if there's
Android 4.3 or Android 5.0 well probably
get a revamp of the nexus 7 but that's
my personal opinion leave us a comment
down below what are your predictions for
the event and of course for another
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tell the world mckee
follow us on foggy no comment subscribe
to our YouTube channel as well we also
follow me on twitter our diamond
underscore to be beta please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hanging everywhere thank you
very much for watching tomorrow is
google i/o we will definitely have a
roundtable of everything we think of
whatever is launched at Google i/o or
whatever it's not launched so we'll keep
you posted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
