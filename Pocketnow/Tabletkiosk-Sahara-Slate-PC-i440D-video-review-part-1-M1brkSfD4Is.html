pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the video review of the tablet kiosk
seharris light pc i-44 0d this is a
tablet PC today we are going to see how
it compares to a 12.1 inch tablet laptop
PC we will also try out the digitizer
and touch interfaces the eye for 40d
sports a dual mode Wacom active
digitizer and a Fujitsu resistive touch
screen the dual mode us digitizer and
resistive touchscreens are hot-swappable
by using the top button right here on
the rights to hand side of the slate
all right let's see how the Sahara slate
PC compares to my Lenovo X 60 tablet PC
which I use every day so here's the
lenovo and you can see if we take both
of them together here that the slate
length is a little longer than the
lenovo from a thickness standpoint put
them side-by-side here the slate is
slightly thinner but that's because the
lenovo has the keyboard underneath it
but from a width standpoint the battery
on the lenovo extends out although i
have the extended battery there is
another battery for the lenovo which
doesn't last as long but still the
Lenovo's with down the side is is longer
than the tablet I do find the slate PC
very easy to handle it's definitely much
lighter by at least a pound than the
Lenovo tablet PC and that's because
obviously the lack of a keyboard allows
it to be much lighter the slate PC also
came with this little stand which is
actually quite useful and that's what
I've been leaning the device on for this
testing so let's take a look at the
touch interface first we'll take a look
at the touch interface with our actually
I should say the digitizer interface
with the pen which is a magnetic
interface this is a magnetic pen and
will bring up I installed Microsoft
Office OneNote which I use quite a bit
of
and let's go to create a new page and I
can say you can basically write on it
this is a test or I can also use the
input panel which actually converts as
you write oh let's see let me try this
again
this is a test and I have it set that
when I point to the insert it
automatically throws the text in so
we'll do that close this out the other
nice thing that you can do with OneNote
in most office products for that matter
let's see you also have the capability
with an eraser to erase this is a test
and use the lasso which allows me to
grab all this text and then the
right-click you hold the button down and
you hover over it and press and there's
an option to convert handwriting to text
so we just press that and you can see
this is a test so that's a pretty nice
feature now if we want to switch to
touch mode which is the Fujitsu touch
screen you need to press this button and
I find this a little painful because
there's no indication to me which mode
I'm in I have to say on my Lenovo both
modes are on all the time and you don't
have to think about it I don't know if
that's good or bad if you really I don't
use touch all that much but maybe it's
good to have a switch between the two I
think that the jury's still out on that
for me so if I want to create a new page
at this point I don't no longer needs
the pen I can just touch new page and a
new page comes up and you can actually
use your nail let's see go into pen mode
huh that's right I was in wasa mode and
I'm in text mode here so you need to go
into there and I can actually
right this is a test so in a pinch it's
helpful but obviously you're gonna do a
much better job with a pen but this is a
nice nice feature to have especially
with certain applications so I can
actually shut this down if I want to
bring up Internet Explorer I can bring
up Internet Explorer and I can actually
browse using my fingers and you know you
can have this on your lap and it's real
nice you know you could actually if you
write a program I'm sure there's some
applications out there use it as a
remote control capability or build
applications where people can use their
fingers to enter information let's say a
survey or so so this is a real nice
feature that the slate PC has that's
about all I was going to show you for
today and I'll be back with some more
features later on this week bye for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
