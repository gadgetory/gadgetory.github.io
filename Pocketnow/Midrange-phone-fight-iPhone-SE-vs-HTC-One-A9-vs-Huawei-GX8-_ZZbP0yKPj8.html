of the most divisive conversations I've
seen yet on pocketnow.com is this thing
a flagship is it a mid-range er is it
entry-level so we figured the best way
to examine that conversation and to
answer that question would be to put it
in a straight-up showdown between some
other Android devices purposely built
for the mid-range I'm one Carlos back
now for Pocket now and here's our iPhone
se vs. Android mid-range comparison
first a little housekeeping we've got to
put this phone somewhere and we decided
that this is a mid-range device it
represents the entry level for an Apple
product and that it replaces the
three-year-old iPhone 5s and there are
only a couple of areas where this thing
will truly compete against top-tier
Android offerings comparisons are always
tricky because at some point we just
have to pick two or more phones to pit
up against each other and the reasonings
for which devices we pick are pretty
subjective so we had to come up with a
few rules as to which phones we were
going to pick to compare against the
iPhone se we wanted to make sure that
they weren't top-tier devices that
manufacturers were specifically building
a lesser phone to compete in a middle
price tier and seeing as how consumer
facing smart phones can be priced
anywhere from 50 bucks to almost a
thousand we're going to put that mid
pack pricing tier in between those two
bookends
which is right where the iPhone se lives
for this comparison I've selected two
Android devices which bookend the iPhone
se by hundred dollars in either
direction the huawei GX eight at $2.99
the iPhone se at 399 and the HTC One a9
at 499 all of these manufacturers make
devices in tiers above the phones
represented on this table but all of
these devices also represent premium
billed for mid-range or mid pack pricing
all three phones have similar camera
hardware and that they feature 12 to 13
megapixel one third inch image sensors
with native 4x3 aspect ratios and all
three phones have respectable
fingerprint sensors onboard but
instantly we run into an ergonomic
discussion a 4-inch screen versus a 5
inch screen versus a 5.5 inch screen the
iPhone se design is built on brevity a 1
thumb on the run kind
a usage HTC is doing a great job of
balancing screen size and form factor
but it does start to veer into
two-handed territory when you really
want to dig into emails or texts or
turn-by-turn navigation and that issue
is just magnified when we step up to a
larger phone like the GX eight will have
to have a whole separate video detailing
the differences between a flagship and a
phablet but the GX eight does start to
blur the line between a regular-sized
phone and a bigger productivity focused
device area of subjectivity number one
do you need the phone that's going to be
a little bit more efficient at that
brief interaction getting out of my car
grabbing my camera bag and punching out
a quick one thumb text message reply
there are a few phones that do that
easier than the iPhone se but the flip
side of that is foreign screens not that
great for more in-depth interactions
I've personally gotten to a point where
I actually do enjoy riding out shorter
articles directly from my phone using a
little Bluetooth keyboard and that usage
is just not as nice on a 4-inch screen I
mean my eyesight is pretty good but it's
a bit small both the HTC and the kwame
are utilizing Qualcomm 600 series
processors decidedly mid-range territory
the iPhone se is using the a 9 chipset
found in the iPhone 6s from a horsepower
perspective the iPhone se is a clear
winner now all three phones do a
reasonably good job of navigating their
respective UI
switching between apps but you will run
into a little less lag and a little less
jank on the iPhone and that's handily
represented when we start talking about
things like gaming not only is this a
flagship grade chipset but we also have
a lower resolution screen so there's
just fewer pixels for that chipset to
push so if you're playing puzzle swap or
candy crush style games yeah all three
of these phones are going to do just
fine but if you start stepping up into
more graphics intensive territory games
like asphalt 8 or Marvel future fight
the iPhone is going to provide you a far
more fluid playback framerate than what
the HTC or the huawei can deliver but
again areas of subjectivity gaming on a
4-inch screen can sometimes be kind of
tough especially if that game gets
really involved the aforementioned
future fight there are menus and control
options that my fat little fingers just
can't interact with consistently and if
you're into tower defense games there is
not a lot of real estate to control
what's happening in that gameplay so
while there's a noticeable power
advantage how you you
that power is also affected by the other
trappings of the device a perfect
example is watching video are you just
scanning through your Facebook feed and
you see a little video clip
yeah the iPhone is going to be fine but
if you're sitting down say you're on an
airplane and you want to watch a longer
form piece of content again orange
screen kind of small five inch screen a
little bit better 5.5 inch screen you
actually get the lean back a little in
your chair but screen differences extend
beyond just resolution and surface area
the Huawei and the iPhone are utilizing
IPS LCD technology and HTC is moved over
to an AMOLED screen for the a9
funnily enough unlike a samsung amoled
screen the HTC's display doesn't get as
dim as I would like it to say you're
reading reddit in bed at night and the
iPhone screen is on right now at its
dimmest setting which is actually pretty
surprising performance for a backlit LCD
but where that performance flips is when
we start talking about a high brightness
mode especially when you're outside in
direct sunlight and here the AMOLED does
slightly outperform the really nice high
quality LCD panel in the iPhone se and
when you're out about you'll probably
want to take advantage of things like
the cameras on these phones that you can
capture those memories and share them
online optically all three of these
phones perform pretty similarly to each
other we've got very similar image
sensor sizes and pretty similar
resolution on each of those sensors and
a pretty similar focal lengths for all
three phones so the iPhone is the
narrowest closer to a 30 millimeter
equivalency and all three of these
phones even have dual LED color tone
flashes built into them comparing things
like pixel level detail and good light
or depth of field blur yeah all three of
these phones are pretty close where we
see standout performances unsurprisingly
on the device that's most powerful the
iPhone se has a faster 1080p mode with a
60 frame per second frame rate and then
also a UHD video mode so it can shoot
those 4k crispy detailed videos that we
all know and love and it also happens to
be the most consistent performer for
image processing
you know juicing up the color on those
HDR photos are stitching together your
panoramas however in this showdown the
iPhone does actually have a small issue
versus the Huawei and that the Huawei GX
8 has optical image stabilization
onboard which does give you a little bit
more of an advantage for low-light
photography the Huawei can hold its
shutter open a little bit longer to soak
up just a little bit more
light and it makes it easier to get
those low light exposures right on the
first try and for selfies the iPhone se
just isn't much competition for either
two android phones with that 1.2
megapixel FaceTime camera HTC is serving
up the ultra pixels and a native 16 by 9
aspect ratio while the GX 8 moves up to
an even higher resolution five megapixel
image sensor and the widest field of
view of all three phones this is
definitely one area where Apple
certainly did compromise the hardware on
the iPhone se and we mentioned lifestyle
features like the fingerprint scanner
and I really have to say Huawei has
probably the best implementation and the
fastest hardware for scanning a
fingerprint and unlocking your device
the SE small form factor makes it really
easy to reach down there and hit that
home button but it still does subtly
just ever so slightly change your grip
on the phone climbing up to 5-inch
screen devices like the a9 I'm just not
a huge fan of putting the fingerprint
sensor down in the chin bezel of the
phone under the screen it's a little bit
more of a contortion trick to get that
thumb down under the screen so that you
can unlock the device
lastly we should talk about audio
performance and that's an area where
both HTC and Apple excel sure we don't
have front-facing stereo speakers on the
a9 and we won't have them on the HTC 10
but boomsound still does influence the
quality of the amp built into the
headphone jack for these phones and
compared to the iPhone they're both
really good minimal distortion minimal
crosstalk between your stereo channels
if you listen to a lot of music on your
phone you're investing in higher quality
audio files you have a really nice pair
of headphones it's a it's may be worth
it to step up to a device that can
properly drive that software and that
hardware the gx8 will put that in good
territory but not great territory and I
suppose we should probably wrap this up
to this videos long enough already there
are no clear winners here folks like I
said at the top of this video all of
this stuff becomes highly subjective
just down to what phones we selected to
do this comparison that's why it's
vitally important that for every
situation where you're making a
purchasing decision that you're sitting
down and you're really weighing the pros
and cons on how you're going to spend
your money maybe you want screaming
performance in a smaller form factor
device or maybe you just need a little
more screen real estate for more
in-depth interactions or maybe top tier
audios your game and you're really into
Google services or someone might just
like the design
which is a tough call for the HTC One a9
because it's basically just an iPhone 6
and outside of these three phones this
situation is even further complicated
when we start looking at last year's
flagships
and of course we want to hear from you
classifying the iPhone se has been one
of the more controversial topics we
faced here recently at PocketNow and
comparisons are always hotly debated
videos for us so let's try and keep
those comments civil but I do want to
see some rough-and-tumble debates as
always thanks so much for watching be
