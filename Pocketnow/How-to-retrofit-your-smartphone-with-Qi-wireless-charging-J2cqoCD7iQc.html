very easy and something that I really
miss when a device doesn't include it
I'm Joe Levi with pocket now and here's
how you can retrofit your smartphone or
tablet with qi wireless charging support
so let's take a look this is a samsung
made galaxy nexus and you can see here
i've got a case on it this obviously
does not have qi wireless charging built
in but you can see right there it does
have qi wireless charging available to
it so let's go ahead and take all the
parts apart here this is the device now
luckily this does have a removable back
and a removable battery but your device
doesn't have to ok i'm going to show you
two different methods of mounting on
this pros and cons of each really fast
this guy it's gonna run you anywhere
between 5 and maybe $25 through amazon
including shipping depending on where
you are in the world
this one was $9 delivered through Amazon
Prime so very nice what you'll notice
here is this is the charging coil it is
relatively flexible it's got this nice
little adhesive strip that I haven't
taken off yet because I wanted to show
you guys first and then a ribbon cable
and a micro USB connector down at the
bottom of the device you've got a micro
USB connector and there's an orientation
to this you'll notice that the narrow
part is on the top the wide part is on
the bottom so on this charger you put in
the narrow part on the top the white
part on the bottom if your device is
oriented differently they do have
different skews so you can get this that
has that upside down and make it a
little bit easier nicer for you keep
that in mind when ordering yours but all
you have to do plug in route that cable
now I'm blocking my speaker here a
little bit which I haven't noticed any
problem in practice but if you want
there are versions of this device that
you basically shift this connector down
to the left or to the right so that if
you've got a port over here on the side
or whatnot you don't have to run it
diagonally across your phone you can
it's not a problem it won't hurt
anything but very money they do have
those that have the you know this ribbon
cable on either side so from there I can
simply snap the back cover on just like
that make sure everything is nice and
tight snap it on and I'm good to go if
your device doesn't have a removable
back cover that's okay
all you got to do is snap that back on
for him we're gonna pretend now that
this is a non removable back cover I
just lay that in place I get my case
start at the bottom in this case and
just wrap it around and now I'm retrofit
I can take this charger or any other Chi
compatible charger lend my device on top
and within seconds were charging it's
just that simple
and this is one of the best retrofits
that you can do to your smartphone or
tablet
so to recap the only two devices that
you need to enable Qi charging on your
smartphone or tablet is a charging pad
which should work with any Qi compatible
device and this little cheek oil that we
showed you plugged in right into the
bottom once you've got those two married
up together you're charging wirelessly
