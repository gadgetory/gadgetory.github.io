hydrogen one and we should expect the
launch later this summer we get final
rumors of the HTC you 12 plus s were
just a few days away from the
announcement and BlackBerry maybehe
announcing something else aside from the
key to very soon I'm hanging the red
auerbach in studio one and actually
packing to go to studio to I know it's
crazy this is pocket out daily the
official news today began with deals the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 continues to be
one of our favorite phones and right now
deals are going crazy 850 bucks if you
buy it on Best Buy then we have eight
hundred dollars if you buy it on Verizon
but there's an option on eBay where you
can actually get the dual SIM variant
for as little as six hundred and fifty
bucks you can learn more about
everything in the description this is
definitely one phone we still recommend
now let's talk about Apple those of you
wondering exactly how many home pods
were sold the this number is crazy
400,000 units is apparently the final
number where we have competitors like
Amazon with its Alexa speaker selling
four million units and then Google
trailing behind the 2.4 million and
obviously we have other competitors that
are even more aggressive like Xiaomi you
want to see all the stats there in the
description definitely Apple is making
more profit given its selling a crazy
price tag for these things but yeah
hopefully this teaches Apple something
but then I asked for the same thing with
the iPhone 10 now let's talk about the
BlackBerry key to those of you wondering
what the specifications for this phone
are you can see them in the description
their benchmarks right there but ok BBE
100 is the code name for another device
and we haven't really heard anything
about it so we're extremely curious as
to what the company is bringing here
we'll keep you posted and for those of
you wondering what we're getting with
the HTC u12 plus famous tipster Evan
blast is just chimed in with things like
the four cameras that we've talked about
in the past rumors that the design will
remain very similar to the U 11 the fact
that the user interface apparently won't
change but there are some tweaks and
improvements can't wait to see this
phone I've always been a big fan of HTC
devices let's see what we get this time
and finally the most interesting news
today are of a product that I have been
waiting for the red hydrogen one we
haven't gotten any details as to when it
launched but we do know that HT and
teach is pretty much confirmed they're
adopting it Verizon is going to adopt it
later price tags are the interesting
part and we're not expecting this
product to be cheap I mean the cameras
are $30,000 on their own and the
cheapest way but yeah we're talking one
thousand one hundred ninety five bucks
but obviously this is a modular phone
that brings a ton of things that phones
can't really do or at least we hear that
that's going to be the case so and
today's question let us know do you feel
that the price tag is reasonable or do
you think that it should be less
expensive because in my case oh I can't
wait to see what the prices of the
modules are gonna be really for me the
price tag is going to be everything
about what the whole cost of using that
thing is gonna be as a camera but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends again if you
