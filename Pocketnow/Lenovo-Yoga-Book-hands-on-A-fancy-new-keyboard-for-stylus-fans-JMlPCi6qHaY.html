is brought to you by XCOM global lenovo
is taking the yoga tablet upscale
blurring the line between their tablets
and multimode bendy flippy laptops the
yoga book sports a 10.1 1080p LCD
powered by an Intel Atom quad core 4
gigabytes of RAM and include 64
gigabytes of built-in storage and 8500
milliamp hour battery should deliver
plenty of runtime lenovo estimates
around 15 hours for multimedia and
content creation and like previous yoga
laptops there will be both Android and
Windows variants a quick second to point
out that we're really happy to see an
app drawer here on a Lenovo
Android powered gadget nicely done there
this puppy is sleek and ultra light the
casing a magnesium aluminum alloy the
frame is super thin and we have this
sexy clockwork gear hinge popularized by
bigger brother yoga laptops but internal
specs and stylish design aren't really
the hot story for this tablet lenovo has
gotten really techie creative with this
halo keyboard it's one completely flat
surface which you can type on or using a
stylus it can capture your handwriting
while riding on actual paper plus we'll
always enjoy gadget hardware which looks
like it might have been pulled directly
off the set of Tron this delivers
something of a hybrid typing experience
and it's a bit unfamiliar at first blush
where you lack the tactile response of a
mechanical keyboard but gain the
software autocorrect which is helpful
while typing on a tablet screen also
worth pointing out that while the
windows software keyboard can provide
autocorrect options those aren't
available when using the halo typer
though Android users will benefit from
auto correction assistance a stylus
input is hot right now but the ability
to capture notes from actual handwritten
ink on paper is a novel throwback my
chicken scratch hardly does this justice
so here's an actual artist playing
around with this input device
it's another flexi entry in Lenovo's
multimode lineup which at anytime can
flip from traditional laptop to a tent
or sleep mode expect the Android version
to sell for $4.99
and the windows version to sell for 549
once both tablets are available later in
October instead of paying terrible
roaming fees when travelling abroad or
the hassle of buying another SIM card
