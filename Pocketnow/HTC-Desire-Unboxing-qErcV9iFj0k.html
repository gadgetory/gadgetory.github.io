pocketnow.com the HTC Desire is HTC most
powerful Android device yet it's based
off of the Google Nexus One but it adds
a little bit of a different form factor
with an optical d-pad and it also has
the HTC Sense interface so really this
is the first time we are going to see
the HTC Sense interface with all the
widgets and all of the screens with a 1
gigahertz processor and a ton of RAM so
it should be a really blazing fast
device so let's get to the unboxing of
the HTC Desire alright so let's get to
the unboxing of the desire ok typical
HTC box here let's take a look around
the box so this is the actual size of
the desire it's pretty much the same
exact size as the Google Nexus One but
again we get this optical d-pad the
Google Nexus 1 had a row of buttons and
then a mechanical d-pad below it so this
is a nicer design I think we've got some
clouds here let's look at the specs on
the back it's running with the qualcomm
snapdragon 1 gigahertz processor it's
got the latest install of android 2.1
Eclair
it's got 576 megabytes of ram which
should mean that you can run a ton of
widgets on here without it's lowering
slowing down at all it's got an AMOLED
display just like the nexus 1 which
means that blacks are truly black the
colors really pop and power consumptions
fantastic this is a European phone so
you're not going to get 3G in the US
unfortunately you'll have to get the
Nexus One if you want to have that it's
got GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi standard stuff
let's get to the unboxing
ok so we'll put the device to this side
we've got the the battery here let's see
how big it is so it's 1400 milliamp
hours I believe that's the same size as
the Nexus One it's probably the same
exact battery as the Nexus One let's see
what else we have in here mmm-hmm
typical stuff wall charger headphones I
don't see a micro SD card in here
although perhaps it's pre-installed on
the device we'll have to take a look
let's look at the desire so here it is
we'll take off this protective covering
it's a thin device it's not as thin as
they say the hd2 but it is very very
sleek it looks like I ripped the package
in there and let's see feels very good
in hand it's lightweight right now
because the battery isn't in flush
touchscreen glass let's make sure it's
glass
take something yep it's glass obviously
it's capacitive and multi-touch so we've
gotten some some buttons down here
search menu home and this optical d-pad
around the back it is rubbery back here
I'm really curious to see if there's a
micro SD card installed let's pop off
the back battery cover and yes there is
there it is there's a 4 gigabyte micro
SD card that comes right with the HTC
Desire very cool alright we'll put that
back on and let's do some size
comparisons got a nice LED flash back
here some size comparisons with some
other devices that you may know ok so
here it is next to the HTC hd2 the
difference in screen size is 3.7 inches
and 4.3 inches and again the HD 2 is
actually thinner by a tiny a fraction of
a millimeter really both are very thin
devices and I'd say that the the desire
feels more like a phone because it's
smaller has a very very nice rubbery
coating on the back which really the the
Google Nexus One did not have parts of
it is rubber parts of it have a plasticy
coating let's take a look at it next to
the HD mini kind of a smaller device
let's take a look at it next to a
standard business card it's not that big
of a device the screen is actually
pretty much the same size as a business
card so we've got a lot more coming up
on the HTC Desire this is one of the
most powerful smartphones you can buy
the screen is very high resolution the
processor is screaming fast and it's got
enough RAM to run tons and tons of
programs without having it slow down so
we're really super excited about the HTC
Desire and if you want a desire of your
own they're now shipping at Clover you
can go to club code UK and they ship
worldwide that's it for now hey usually
I don't do this but I had to turn
hammered back on because I just noticed
something pretty awesome about the
desire it has a tiny little chin and the
purpose of the chin isn't like on the
legend which makes it feel more like a
phone I think but the chin makes the
d-pad perfectly within reach it's just
the most perfect angle so that the phone
rests in your hand comfortably and you
can rest your finger and move it along
this optical d-pad
so again just add a chime in that's it
for now seriously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
