afternoon to most of you good morning to
some of you I think that it doesn't even
apply to good morning good night to some
of you actually in certain parts of the
world google i/o has just finished and
our editorial roundtable is something
that just must happen you guys want our
opinions over everything that we saw and
that's what we are here for and we've
got a ton of coverage Joe leave i just
posted a full editorial on the 5 top
things that come with Android M in
addition all the news are already live
you can follow us on pocket now and make
sure you get that information everything
is social as well and you can expect the
pocket out daily to bring you more
details today later I will do a full
google i/o edition of the show and yes
of course our pocket now weekly will go
in depth with everything that we saw so
right now this is going to be a quick
30-minute roundtable that focuses just
on the top stuff the news and obviously
the QA is enabled for every one of you
to provide your feedback or whatever
things you would like to cover but
obviously we can't cover everything in a
30 minute video so we will try to do our
best to do this let's start with a roll
call starting with mr. Hayat Huesman
contributing editor one of our new
editors and team how are you I'm good
are you doing great doing great as well
so good so good to have you we also have
the very special crius edition of mr.
Joe Levi senior editor how are you I'm
doing very well but it's very hot it's
very hot okay we will try to keep this
short and sweet then obviously we also
have our editorial director mr. Michael
Fisher so good to talk to you again sir
wonderful to be back on a panel full of
you know general generic white tech guys
we just finished another round of hiring
a pocket now and well we tried ladies
that's all I will say lovely to see you
gentlemen again and let's talk to Liam
your American Michael so hey so my joe
what a coinkydink i didn't know that all
right over here I'm not even gonna talk
about our our newest addition to the
pocket now team but actually something
that's been with us for the longest of
time is true you Jules warm how are you
I am good right now I'm at the station w
GRS we are playing XTC uh sense is
working overtime I feel exactly that way
right now good good and nothing that
beer can't fix chief news editor mr.
Stephen J how are you again I really
well I never got that I've got my full
of Android M news so also under firing
and yeah you're actually going to start
this off how about we tell everybody
what we just got what I enjoy them
starters are to interrupt esteem but
before you jump right into that Jules
can we get you to mute your mic well
while other people are talking cuz that
that station music is gonna just drive
me nuts all day as well I guess it is
I'm in the music sir sard override you
there host this this sounds like that
specific moment when Michael is tearing
up removing the plastic film for my
phone is like silence foods that's right
good episode 150 of the pocket that we
soon to the surprise of absolutely no
one we got our announcement of Android M
today the preview release is out now
gugus made downloads available for the
nexus 5 Nexus 6 Nexus 9 even the nexus
player if you're into that whole Android
TV thing sadly not the nexus 7 we have
moved on in the tablet world but let's
get right to features we heard a lot of
these rumored in the past weeks and
months a lot of them were confirmed here
one of the big ones especially for me is
new granular app permissions first of
all permissions aren't going to be
approved when you install an app for the
play store instead the app itself is
going to ask you about these permissions
as you go to use them for the first time
so if you're not you're trying on all
the features of a nap initially you
might not approve everything all at once
if something comes up you want to send a
text message don't ask you if it can do
that you'll give it's your approval or
not and then later on you can go back
and revoke certain approvals or grant
ones you may have denied initially in
app settings these are going to be
writing for new apps built with the
Android SDK old apps will keep the old
way of doing permissions for now
presumably as they update and start
being coded for Android in particular
we'll see this new support arrived
this is you know we had the old a pops
thing several generations ago was kind
of half-baked so they've really
formalized this it looks like it's going
to be pretty graceful with apps it was
able to deny permissions without them
failing in weird unexpected ways so if
you're a you know privacy enthusiast
great news there there's a change of how
links are going to be handled within the
system uh Google really doesn't like it
when you click on a URL and doesn't know
what to do with it it's asking you to an
open this in a browser if you want to
use a specific app to open it so going
forward with Android M absolutely able
to claim certain kinds of links the
great example they gave in the
presentation was Twitter you click on a
tweet length isn't sent to you in email
or a text or something the system will
know to open it directly in the Twitter
app rather than loading the Twitter web
page in the browser and there's no
indication system where apps will be
able to verify that they're the ones who
should be opening this so it won't go
somewhere unexpected and if it works as
well as Google promise it should all be
pretty darn graceful we have
improvements to battery life there are
some new tools to extend the battery
life of devices if they're sitting
unused for a long period of time the
system will take advantage of
accelerometers detect when a device is
just sitting there being wholly unused
versus you know carrying around you
might be checking it occasionally and if
it's been in sleep mode for a while
you're not touching it it will start
checking things online with less
frequency so once sync is often your
apps won't necessarily be immediately up
to date when you go to pick up the
device but as a result it will stretch
the battery life super far I think
Google said we might even see double
battery life depending on what your app
music situation looked like mm by mode
yeah yeah they did to in side-by-side
right right if you're not a big heavy
social user you might your mileage may
vary there but it has the potential to
deliver some big improvements we heard
about some improvements to Google now
including is exciting now on tap thing
that will let you do these really great
contextual queries from within apps so
if you are you're watching a movie or
you're looking at a picture in a nap you
might be able to just click and hold
question hold on the home button have
google now pop up and just asking
where was this taken Who am I looking at
tell me something about the artist
playing this song and Google will be
able to pull information out of the app
to figure out what you're talking about
then give you the information based on
the question you asked hopefully really
really smoothly it sounds like we won't
be able to have to wait for apps to be
refreshed with this important mind the
sort of in-app search Google already
uses to generate search results inside
of apps will be extended for the use of
now on tap we have android pay has been
confirmed this is the next generation of
android wallet one of the big
differences here is that it's going to
be baked right into the OS such that you
don't have to manually pull up an appt
each time you want to do a payment so no
longer clicking a wallet entering in
your pin and then tapping and paying so
long as your phone is woken up and you
entered in your your unlock code when
when waking device from sleep you can
just tap on NFC reader no matter where
you are in the system and it should make
that payment straight away it's not
clear yet how that will work work at all
for people who don't use lock screen so
that includes myself I'm a little
worried but hopefully we will learn more
about that in the future android pay
also has an API to allow apps to offer
this kind of tap and pay support
directly within and a fingerprint
scanning we have heard that finger
prints before but be baked into the OS
and that's been confirmed you can use up
to authenticate Android pay as well as
apps we will use that for their own
internal authentication and there's been
some suggestions that as a result of
this we might see a fingerprint reader
built into the next Nexus phone or
phones as you leaving hearing but that
remains to be seen uh there are a lot of
code changes but that's sort of dev
focused and outside our purview here
some little things they mentioned about
changing how text is highlighted copy
and paste should work a little bit
better and a volume controls getting an
overhaul it was kind of completely
borked in android l lollipop they tried
to improve this and it ended up using a
lot of users so for every damn look to
be look for it to be more
straightforward as well as giving you
really convenient roll over individual
ringer app volume sliders you get
everything just where you like it
I think that hits all the major points
here am I forgetting anything that you
guys heard mentioned I know I jewelry
yeah that's what I'll talk about go
ahead go here Joe so that's the majority
of what we saw with Android M there were
some other things announced that that
tie into Android that are particular to
Android M like photos that we'll talk
about later android auto and whatnot but
as far as Android M goes this looks like
it's going to be a very iterative
release it's not going to be very very
major we've talked about the highlights
of what we're going to see a lot of a
lot of what we saw I mean android pay
compared to Google Wallet the
functionality is essentially going to be
the same from my experience because i've
been using google wallet for a lot so
it's more a rebranding and an
optimization and i think that that sums
up what Android M is it's taking
everything that we had and just tweaking
it making it a little bit better to see
if I can pull out the quote here I don't
have it on tap but Android M is all
about quality and everything has been
really aided that was David vice
president of engineering yeah a
conscious decision to focus on quality
and to end a focus on product excellence
squashing bugs and rethinking core
aspects yeah the emphasis there is end
to end they made the implication that
this was a ground-up relook at the code
base so i would say that Android M is
probably going to be 5.2 rather than 6.0
but with an end-to-end approach we might
see a full sick point bump it's a
possibility we'll see we'll see I mean
and what do you guys think will be the
final name I actually asked we're gonna
hold together I just saw a interesting
theory on this but they were zooming in
on during the Android wear announcement
I forget the name of the guy who was on
stage there but his watch some people
thought that they could see a milkshake
on the on the wallpaper there so the
watch face there so maybe Android
milkshake who knows
and real good around the campus a lot of
people are using macadamia nut cookie
that's what's being used on the Google
campus I'm all for marshmallow but I
think we're probably going to end up
with milkshake milkshake stented beat in
Cambridge there were only sugar cookies
so I cannot be of any assistance and
figuring out there's no no am in any of
that with our macadamia nuts in the
cookies man I'm aware of that that's the
thing that's sort of going on a limb I
mean we've seen Google use the three
word desserts or its internal code names
you know and then you have ice cream
sammies and then you have ice cream
sandwich would would be like like the
perfect example I guess and we're going
to talk about Android wear later because
probably what's most shocking about
those new Steven that close up is that
Android wear was really just Android
wear and we'll talk about that later
yeah it wasn't that big of focus is
reminding us where it's come but we
didn't really hear a lot about where
it's going what's next compared to last
year when we not only got the
information about the first Android wear
device is going for sale we saw the
Samsung gear live announced for the
first time ever so this was a much lower
key as far as wearables go now it when
it comes to android there was an
announcement of Android you know
expanding its reach two years ago we we
saw Android be announced for products
like lamps light bulbs and stuff that
can really take off it was pretty much a
prototype that never left that stage
unless I'm wrong Joe do you know
anything about that again I thought
you're referring to Android at home and
that we saw a we saw an SDK that came
out and a clock that was based on it but
that was about it it fell off the map so
you're getting into brillo and and into
what is it don't we've we exactly and
protocols week yeah yeah so google just
announced something called Project
brillo and this is really the company's
stripping down Android and making it
usable to things that are not that don't
need a smart operating system like a
smartphone or tablet but really let's
say a smart light bulb a smart oven a
smart refrigerator whatever you want to
call it and project brillo is really
that core operating system that's going
to be used to power these products and
what's cool about this is that you know
it is extremely efficient it doesn't
really require a specific silicon
apparently it is it has a broad silicon
support it's very easy to secure it it
has very minimal requirements and what
Google is doing is that they're
launching a new guy i would say code or
i don't think it's a code but it's
called weave and it's pretty much the
common language that will be used
between products within project brillo
to communicate with each other so for
example you can determine it as a
communication protocol yeah it's
communication protocol and so the way
the way this would be is you this like
for example you could be writing a
recipe on your tablet or your phone and
through your smartphone you will be able
to turn on your oven and make it work
and actually apply certain of these
things up through and apparently we've
is going to be the communication
protocol between all these products so
it does seem that Google wants to make
the Internet of Things something hot
they're really focused on getting this
done we've seen Apple work on home kit
for a little bit and obviously to see
how the stacks up against home kit
efforts exactly exactly so we we really
don't know with the problem is that that
announcement lasted for like three
minutes so we really don't have details
on on how this is going to work but we
do know is that the developer preview of
brillo will be available in q3 2015 and
the stack for we will be available in q4
so later this year we will learn more
about this and probably in CES 2016 will
see the android-powered toaster that
michael has always wanted to have the
one thing that I got out of this from a
developer standpoint is weave is that
communication protocol it will be able
to run on brillo but it is not tied to
brittles you're not going to have to
have a brillo powered device to be able
to use we've as your your common
language that the biases both the
controllers and the devices themselves
used to intercommunicate so we could see
stuff powered by Arduino or stuff power
by anybody else that can tap into the
weave protocol and those devices won't
have to be powered by Android brillo and
if I'm if I'm not mistaken leave is also
cross platform yeah yeah by definition
it's it's a cross-platform protocol this
is going to be absolutely key to any
kind of success with Internet of Things
you have to make it really easy for the
people making this hardware to make it
appeal to as many users as possible and
to make it as cheap to implement as they
can so right now you know you want to
buy connected light bulb you're paying a
ton of money for that there's no
guarantee it's going to work with all
your stuff so a standard like this could
be really important to seeing adaptation
of this really kick off yeah definitely
the standard communication that we have
right now appears to be either
proprietary apps or proprietary services
like works with nest as one and believe
it or not if this then that seems to be
our hub for making all these things talk
together so this takes the the third
party service you know the requirement
that they are connected to the Internet
proper and connected to a subscription
and know when you're turning your lights
on and off and it can put that more
local so that your home can know and can
do things in about itself without
sending that out to the Internet proper
right right and well I am I missing
anything about project brillo or you
guys think we can move on to google now
and a little broader scope of everything
that we got sure what it's worth I'm
I've started looking at my Twitter feed
so i think that's an indication like
yeah i talked code and Michael goes to
Twitter I see how know Jojo it's not you
I'm so happy to have you back well take
over Michael alright so what am I
talking about i'm gonna talk about
google now on tap is that is that what
the rundown degrees that's awesome i'm
so glad i get to talk about something
awesome because stephen touch on this a
little bit before and like the kind of
buzz word of the day we've with regard
to this was context which can sound a
little a little you know antiseptic exam
yes I content well what does that
exactly mean Google was doing a little
bragging on stage
how much data it's managed to accrue
over time through its knowledge graph
and other services there are apparently
1 billion-plus entries in the knowledge
graph everything from you know this is
just the name of baseball teams the name
of famous actors the location of you
know football stadiums or whatever and
Google now on tab leverages all of that
and Google talked a little bit about its
expanded multi-layer neural net it
basically just talked about how very
smart Google is and how it's getting
better at accessing all of that
information that it sits on so some of
the demos on stage which were I'm going
to do my best here this was the director
of product management Aparna chin up
rugged that China brigata I think she
was on stage doing this demo of now on
tap and we're now nowadays you you have
google now and it's this kind of thing
and it predicts what information you
want when you want it there's going to
be an active component to it you're
going to be able to be looking at
something on the screen the example they
gave on stage was an email about
tomorrow land from a friend it's like
hey you want to go see Tomorrowland
tomorrow you can long press the home
button on your Android device and a
little pop-up card will not take over
the whole screen it will just pop up
from the bottom and it will contain
it'll it'll search that email for
context and it'll say hey Tomorrowland
boom there that here's here's the IMDb
entry for the movie you're talking about
you want to watch the trailer here's a
link to that here's just my note says
blister but I think that's an
autocorrect from flixster yeah here's a
flexeril and if you want to if you want
to buy tickets for it which is pretty
cool and there's a but it gets like
weirder and awesomer and if if you're a
little more wary of Google's intrusive
elements may be a little freakier but
it's not freaky because Google is not
doing anything new here it's just
implementing it differently it's
allowing you to call it over the email
that comes in after that is can you get
the dry-cleaning you forgot to get it
also do you want to go to this specific
restaurant for dinner which I'll call
alia and if you long press the home
button BAM you get a card that contains
the yelp entry for alia ristorante that
a link to call it a google maps link so
you can navigate to it and an open table
link so you can do it and it will give
you a separate card reminding you to get
the dry cleaning and it does all this by
just crawling the email just like just
like Google crawls the internet and
looking for context and Jennifer gotta
told Ars Technica that the neat thing
here and Steven mentioned this is that
the app doesn't have to do anything
custom for this to be supported that's
the reason we wanted to make sure it was
based on the platform api the apps don't
have to implement anything for the
context to be read that is the coolest
part about this whole thing for me
because it's not going to be like a
situation with dual screen on a samsung
phone where ya dual window is a lot of
fun but only the apps that have have the
code implemented are going to be able to
use it no it's basically the new google
now on tap can read your screen and try
and figure out what you want to what you
want to know yeah and it's not limited
to eyes because it's so far we've been
seeing with the new cards coming to
Google now there was there been 70 or so
new apps that have been supporting these
but this has been something developers
had to implement themselves with now
like half its going to just be this
flood gate opening where everything is
working with right out of the gate and
that's gonna be huge exactly and and it
applies to the voice input stuff too
they fired up a Skrillex track onstage
and she did a really good job of
pretending like she didn't hate every
sound that was that was coming out of
that time oh poor man that was rough but
but the and the demo her assistant whose
name I don't remember I'm sorry who also
helps develop everything said ok Google
and Spotify paused and the window came
up and said what's his real name and
like verbatim that's what he asked what
his real name and in fact what we got
was a Wikipedia entry and a Google card
that said Skrillex his real name is
something that I forgot it's cuz really
so it's really cool stuff that I'm
looking forward to trying out how funny
is it though they use Spotify in the
demo instead of google play music oh
yeah and I realized like that I I think
no but I think it emphasizes the fact
that that third-party apps are going to
be really important to this whole thing
and second is
it's so refreshing when a company isn't
in denial about it I hate it when like
Samsung will take the stage and be like
yeah you know how when you're using
samsung milk and this happens or like no
no I don't know how that is nobody so
anyway I'm looking forward to Google now
on top I think it's gonna be gonna be a
hot and and very sexy is it is another
hot service that was announced today
believe it or not and this is gonna
sound ironic because we've been covering
rumors of google photos update for the
last couple of weeks and uh you know I
I've been doing most of the posting
about this Thank You Steven and that's
like okay so it's just gonna be removed
from from Google+ that's gonna be it
what's so cool about this you know it
turns out to be cooler than than we
thought and this is actually to answer
mark Washington's question on the QA
he's asking if Google+ is google photos
the only cool thing actually it's not
the only cool thing but it is extremely
cool mainly because well first of all it
focuses on three different things number
one a big wants to become your home for
all your photos and videos available
number two it wants to help you organize
and bring your moments life and number
three wants to make it easy for you to
share stuff so the way it's going to
become the home for all your photos is
because first of all it allows you to
store in a limited amount of photos and
videos that are up to 16 megapixels or
1080p videos that in itself is like okay
I don't you know I don't really care if
it's great or not but just to have a
service it's not going to be eating up
space on my computer or phone or tablet
is awesome that is just perfect and even
better is the fact that this is
cross-platform so it works with iOS
Android that works on the web i wish
there would have been an application for
the mac or windows but you know windows
was not going to happen in the mac is
not announced yet but yeah that's going
to be part of it there's a lot of pinch
to zoom in the gestures that are
available here and the idea is to make
it work sort of like the way i OS does
with collections where you can zoom in
and out of you know months years stays
stuff like that other things there is
since you mentioned it go ahead can I
just say that and somebody can prove me
wrong if they want but i don't think
google said the
word windows on stage wants this entire
no reality good yeah which is pretty
amazing once know once want you I think
they did once in the context of highway
just mentioned did they say out the
window or something like that the second
they might have just been referring to
web but but I don't I think they took
the ones all right the second thing
there ya go ahead guy so so Android
photos is the one thing that I took away
from that is not just your smartphone
whether Apple or iOS excuse me iOS or
Android those are two different things
by the way it's hot in the car but it's
also other devices so if you've got a
DSLR if you've got a GoPro if you've got
something else Google photos is now your
hub for all of your pictures in all of
your photos regardless of it came from
your smartphone tablet or your your
dedicated high-end camera or or you're
not powered by Android video camera so
it's your central hub and this unlimited
number that you mentioned Jaime is free
it there is no extra cost to that the
the one caveat is you know that the
limitations that you listed 16
megapixels and 1080p but they also
mentioned that it is a near lossless
compression that they're using so you're
not going to be getting exactly that
image but the compression they're using
to enable them to do that is you're not
going to be losing much if anything from
the original picture up to 16 megapixels
know it was you know they showed they
showed a demo didn't look that bad at
all yeah I look it didn't look any
different than the original photo from
what I could tell he liked Christopher
miles Q&amp;amp;A Android M also allowing backup
apps to backup and restore data up to 25
MiG's perhap to Google Drive I was about
to I was about to ask that Joe what
exactly is that because this is not
pertain to photos but yeah what what
exactly are they doing here so that's
something that I didn't catch but the
way android does that presently
an app can be written to store settings
to store information to store your login
information credentials pictures
whatever and store that with Google
whether that's through drive proper or
through the their app storage so that
when you restore a device for example
you're getting a new device and you want
to migrate everything over it's
automatically going to pull down all of
the apps that you installed before and
once you've logged into them whether
that's through their proprietary login
or through a Google of Facebook Twitter
something else through through one of
the accounts plugins that's compatible
with Android it's going to automatically
bring down your settings it's going to
bring down your state information that
was already there the downside has been
that that storage space is relatively
limited and from what I understand from
this question that's being extended out
to 25 meg so you'll be able to have more
stuff available there that actually
answers one of the questions to my
article I sorry I'm not going to not
drop your name because that's a
different window but the question would
ask have they done anything to make the
backup process any better this is the
way that Android does it and honestly
having used apples having used you know
back with windows ce e and nandroid this
is the best way i can take a generic
device log in and be completely restored
back to my state including wallpaper and
icons and widgets within a matter of an
hour or so and it's all fresh it's not a
it's not a stale backup it's it's all
fresh brought down but that's the thing
that's that's currently what I cloud
does in a way you can store applications
can separately store their stuff on
iCloud and and there in a way it's like
bringing it on par with iCloud I guess
the the way that they're doing it is
fundamentally different the result is
fundamentally the same right right right
ok cool so that that answers that
question on the Q&amp;amp;A just to continue
with google photos before we lose the
scope the second focus of the google
photos application is for it to organize
and bring moments to life and you know
we've seen apple tree
right to help you tagged photos in
iphoto and in its new google and it
sorry its new Apple photos application
and help you be able to you know have
faces and that determined and filter
photos but it seems that google service
is going to be much smarter and being
able to tag everything without the need
of you doing it because that's the
problem with Apple servers you have to
tag everybody whereas Google is going to
do it automatically and for some reason
it seems that it's going to be capable
of even filtering your baby photos all
the way back so you select the specific
contact then you can go all the way back
to whatever photos you have from that
person to whichever photos you have as
far back as you do we will just have to
give it a try and see how good that is
we also notice that there is contact
search like for example if you're
searching for a baseball game now you're
searching for photos of a baseball game
it seems that google is able to
determine that these specific photos
were taking out a baseball stadium and
it'll allow you to filter those photos
searching for text and that is extremely
literally by typing in the word baseball
stadium again execs crazy to me and I've
said that for a long time I thought that
was an opportunity maybe I was rather
short-sighted I thought that might be an
opportunity for the third party
developer to be like oh let me cook up
an app that can actually search photos
through plain text because I do that all
the time they made a great point on
stage where you're like yeah oh they're
hanging out with friends let me show you
this old picture from four years ago it
takes I need a half hour to scroll
through all this crap Andy is to exact
type in a never to be able to type in
submarine oh yeah that was cool against
VA almost there for the desktop version
not quite yeah yeah and and to make
matters even cooler going with Michaels
point probably sharing was the part that
I like the most usually if you want to
share a photo with somebody you have to
have it locally on your device or share
a link or whatever and that person has
to download the photo on their device
but the way this photos application is
going to work is you can select whatever
photos you have let's say you select 25
random photos out of your hole out of
your whole list and out of those 25
photos it'll generate a specific link
read and allow do you share just that
and you can either view it a small
website with that or if that person uses
google photos
those can automatically be imported to
this google photos application without
the need of you downloading or uploading
anything just really cool you all need
to do things twice and who is beside an
airport yeah exactly that's the set of
freedom that sorry to go over well so
got I'm also getting some feedback from
our own audio and somebody's cans are
turned up way too loud I don't know
whose it is that but anyway moving on
Eddie anyway moving on so i think that's
that's uh i think that's pretty much it
for google photos again it is completely
free it should be available today and
again if your photos or 16 megapixels or
below or video is 1080p or below you can
upload this in an unlimited fashion only
yes it will have some sort of a loss
when it comes to compression yeah i
can't wait to see someone worry all down
some of those and look at exactly how
much quality were losing but it's
interesting how you know we are naming
this based on the resolution file size
I'm sure Sony is just you know looking
hanging their heads in shame or shame
but frustration over there 20.7
megapixel sensors and all those pixels
going to waste now oh man des le the
great quality and my 20 megapixel m9
camera is gonna go down now oh oh a burn
from the Midwest mmm speaking speaking
of burns how about uh hi Otto since you
started talking right now how about me
tell us a little more about the new maps
updates that are coming yeah so the maps
are actually really cool because uh so
now they're gonna be there bringing off
offline we've had ability with maps so
that's going to kind of take the same
kind of feature from things like Nokia
here maps that have the offline features
and that's really great for especially
people that are either it just in a bad
connection area or if you're doing a lot
of traveling if you're you know driving
across the highway and a lot of time
most people kind of tend to drop their
their signal there and that they can't
navigate to where they're trying to go
so you can use google maps offline now
you download the the map that you need
and it'll still give you the navigation
with turn-by-turn voice navigation
everything what i think is really
cool about it is the fact that you can
actually still get the the suggestions
while you're searching for something so
if I search for you know restaurants on
an on a downloaded offline map it'll
still give me recommendations and it
will even still pull in reviews for
those local areas um so it really keeps
a lot of the functionality pretty much
all the functionality of online google
maps which are these connected or not hi
i maybe you mentioned this I'm sorry but
I've been wondering like how how wide is
the scope of that catch zone like when
you I mean when do you when you when do
you say like all right well I'm gonna be
offline for a while so I really need to
download a bunch of maps for this region
you know um I'm not really sure what the
scope is I would assume you just
download probably a city at a time or so
yeah well I have mosel those previous
cool yeah it was yeah it was a sovereign
you have to really figure out where I do
multiple ones making overlap was a pain
in the ass so I'm presuming that this
thing is a lot more streamlined and
ability and able to capture a much
larger area so you're not stopping
halfway through your trip and
redownloading stuff is one other thing
to keep in mind here guys Google just
acquired ways and the way that the Waze
app has been doing that is when you log
in and to you open up your map you're
saying I want to go from point A to
point B ways is going to go out and
automatically bring in that entire trip
so where are you going from right now to
right there plus a couple different
routes plus whatever the currents data
is of weather and alerts and restaurants
and points of interest along the way
it's going to pull all of that to your
device as you're setting up that
navigation to begin with so if you go
offline you still have that information
present that sounds a lot like what
Google Maps is going to be doing here
automatically but it's going to have
some way to to enable you to pull that
down as well through some some kind of
magic offline mode that I still don't
fully understand I think it's a habit
thing like for example every time did I
travel to places I always download the
maps automatically and you know because
you never know you never know if you
will have data connectivity or
I guess for frequent travelers that's
going to be a good tool to have but
again I think it depends on habits
mainly yeah other in other cases I mean
if you're on a limited data plan and
you're reaching your cap is another
option just download your map and you
won't need to be spending data for
navigation yeah I would not be wrong
idea as well I also have to wonder about
updates you know whether or not hey this
business is closed down or late there
has to be some sort of way to you know
efficiently update a safe level because
imagine the pain that would be you know
some help getting information you use
turned out hey you drove down a wrong
you know a wrong way street now yeah and
I think we're looking for it's an
industrial park now we're well in
factory hi correct me if I'm wrong but I
believe that currently when you download
an app when you download a map it does
update itself periodically when you
connect to Wi-Fi oh god sea horse I
think it does I can't comment on that I
would imagine that it will but just for
life bility stay but I don't know
mechanism that it doesn't yeah yeah
again it's something that will have to
prove in this map service is going to be
available until end of the year later
this year no no dates were provided we
also got updates for services like
Google Play will cardboard I don't know
if you want to summarize that quickly
Stephen sure we saw the first cardboard
launched last year at i/o and for this
year why not have the 2nd gen announced
google has a new design for the
cardboard viewer it's simpler it's
compatible with more phones they used to
have this NFC or magnet that it used to
trigger the button now it's a simple
hardware thing designed out of cardboard
appropriately enough constructions going
to be streamlined there's only three
steps to assembly rather a down for 12
and it supports a wider range devices
now with those up to screen sizes as
long as six ancients so the Nexus 6 will
be right at home with this guy third
parties will be able to start making
their own viewers with these plans
immediately google for is giving out the
viewers to it
and ease of i/o we also learned about an
SDK which now has cross-platform support
with iOS so you'll be able to use your
iPhone to view content design for Google
cardboard there's also some new way to
create content something called jump on
get this wrong as a jump this is all so
new it's a special rig that they built
where developers of hardware can make a
way to automatically record 360-degree
content in 3d GoPro is an early partner
here and it's going to use a special
algorithms to stick everything together
but for right now Google cardboard is
already having some pretty popular are
pretty high popularity this isn't like a
million cardboard viewers have been
bought by users out there and to push
that number even higher you need high
quality content so making it easier for
people to create this is going to be key
to cardboards future growth we also
heard about a way for students to access
this it's kind of a guided way through
cardboard where a teacher can use a
tablet and you sort of take classes on a
virtual field trip with all the students
using their own viewers that you're
guiding them along they can look at
stuff like they're just there and this
you know fits into Google's broader
connecting the world strategy here
exposing people to places they might not
normally see and you know in the months
to come we're going to start seeing
these new google viewers we're going to
get higher quality content out there so
a lot of improvements in this field yeah
google just killed field trips for kids
the other thing that they mentioned
there was all of these immersive videos
are going to be hosted on YouTube so
they're going to use the YouTube channel
to to allow people to watch this content
rather than creating some new
proprietary thing right yeah yeah yeah
they've got the whole architecture in
place already to make this a big thing
it's gonna be cold yeah it's gonna be
like that a GoPro knew that new 6 mount
GoPro thing that does 3d 16 mount 16
tell really ah yeah now correct me if
I'm wrong this is only for emerging
markets uh the immersive like field trip
thing
I don't think it's only for emerging
work no no no I think they demoed it
with with videos of like I think that
was the same section of i/o where they
were talking about the Kenyan farmer so
there was a lot of that everything that
the markets done with it we didn't get
to I'm if we're going back to photos for
a second or maps and going back to the
offline storage they talked about
YouTube having offline availability for
areas where data connectivity isn't what
we would like it to be and we saw a new
low data web browsing and search tool
that will allow the important content to
come through while cutting back on
extraneous graphics and making it
possible to get a solid google
experience out of the web even when you
don't have high quality 4G or even 3g
speeds so that's going to be important
in developing markets yeah all right I I
think we pretty much ran down the news
and I guess the only thing that's left
is really what wasn't news today uh I'm
extremely disappointed join me if you do
know android wear update and although
just none of the other gate honest you
know I mean the update came like you
know two weeks ago so they took the
opportunity to reinstate hey got almost
always for that update yeah all of us
are still waiting for that update Tony's
the only one that has it on what your
thing but I what but I guess I guess
what I'm saying is Android M was demoed
there was no show there's like no
Android M version for Android wear like
yeah he's on a gentleman schedule you
know I mean they did they just like I
said they just announced that update
right so it's like it's just it's
disappointing yeah i agree with you i
mean but i wasn't at all surprised with
us what version to you 11 you have you
have it oh man I got a I got to start
running that on my G watch our oh that
is my G watch her have to change that's
about me i'm good i'm sorry i was just
gonna ask if we were hitting any
questions before we go because there's
one I want to answer if we do please go
ahead by all means just this one's from
Christopher miles a really good question
who asks how will
Google now on tap be implemented on
phones with physical home buttons such
as Samsung the long presses and double
taps are already taken so Christopher
this is a I don't know how to answer
this yet but I will tell you that on the
node for which I'm using right now which
I'm using again for the purposes of an
after the buzz re-review print look the
long press is taken yes but it's taken
by Google now so I think they will
probably just reassign that in the next
version and probably Android M will
contain some some special allowances for
devices running a manufacturer
third-party you I'd just sort of force
it to do what Google wants because I
have a feeling they're gonna really be
pitching a google now on tap pretty hard
yeah well we'll see about that another
question that we have in the Q&amp;amp;A now
that you mention it from ivan is asking
about nexus devices anybody disappointed
here isn't there was a solid chance of
us getting evening if we were gonna get
any hardware it was going to be Android
wear and it was established it's really
not interested in this summer time small
tablet launch anymore so we're gonna
wait till the fall we'll get a nexus
phone maybe two phones maybe not a new
tablet at all this year but not for a
few more months the only thing you can
say about the nexus users is I kind of
feel I kind of feel like the Nexus
phones are gonna feel the left out now
with some of the new support that
Android M is going to bring like the
fingerprint scanner and the and the was
the other thing seriously um word will
see the fingerprint scan joseph Morgan
Nexus hardware well sure but current
neck like even the nexus 6 it doesn't
have a fingerprint scanner you kind of
had a look there and I still don't think
the public at large is sold on the the
worth of fingerprint scanners maybe
android pay will convince us otherwise I
don't know I disagree I mean they're on
every iphone has been released for the
past three years or something like that
or two two or three years and then the
galaxy s6 and edger only gonna improve
on that I mean no I think I think the
public is very very much your soul
they're just gonna sociate that you know
you can put your thumb to critical
reader and no hay magic no I don't think
this is a massive leap for people i have
more faith in people than that i think
that everyone's been watching the
science fiction fingerprint scanners for
my you've been out of the retail
business for too long Michael that's a
good point we're all making the
transition from cash to credit I mean
it's start out like sixty percent down
to you know whatever in the plastic is
like still thirty percent of all
transactions I can't even begin to
imagine the proportion of you know those
wireless NFC um hey man how much they
make of the POS yeah well mentioned a
lot of new when a retail partners who
are going to be supporting Android pay
presumably companies will already have
contactless readers in place that are
supporting apple pay right now and it'll
probably just get better as a system as
retailers upgrade their systems newer
POS models will see broader so it's
growing I think it does have a feature I
mainly think it does have a feature
because of the fingerprint scanning
capabilities but for that to work I it's
not that they have to do away with
credit cards meaning remove the option
for users to have an alternate way to
pay and be you know and get into some
sort of thought that problem through
that I but again I feel it it does have
a future because of the fingerprint
scanning that's just my opinion the
problem is I haven't really tested it so
I can't really just to throw this out
there guys uh the the company that I
work for from my day job we're a
completely iOS shop as far as mobile
devices go every single one of our
phones is set up with fingerprint
enabled as a security measure so we
don't have anything that's unlocked and
then it's required that you don't turn
that off so from an enterprise
perspective and things going forward
fingerprints are a very easy way to get
security I've already mentioned in
articles over on the website why that
might not be a good thing but
enterprises are going to adopt this
payments are going to adopt this it's
the future like it or not yeah I think
you have a point definitely all this
will be integrated into android
or Android Michael Fisher as Alex blazes
there you go he said yes or no he's a
beefcake so a Christian co blazer aquam
are more fun Twitter reminded us that in
fact internally Android M is known as
MNC it's mike november charlie which
does lend some credence atheneum
macadamia nut cookie yeah so probably at
least if history but but but but wasn't
that the case with android l it was
called lemon meringue pie for a long
time and then out of the blue boom yeah
hey short until they're able to uh until
today was all QR drive with exactly
right Joe yeah yeah and until they're
able to secure a partnership with the
Mars candy company I think we can
android Mars and we're back to the 33
word of code words then that is actually
not a bad idea Android Mars trade milky
way android Milky Way there you go
another hog game earlier gentlemen I
don't are we missing anything we are
just one thing just one thing in this
room the last thing I say David
singleton I think had the quote of the
day the the lead for Android wear with
his quote that um what did he say it's
it's really cool to check the time
doctor checking the time on your website
checking the time is a really cool thing
it's like yeah okay these said we love
watches are Laura are those gonna be our
final thoughts Michael or would you like
to elaborate on anything else now i'm
just i'm ready to I i I'm going to join
everyone else who's already written
14,000 think pieces on why Google now on
tap is the next big thing but more
importantly and I'm about to write about
this it is the it is the next thing
that's going to it's going to make it
easy to explain to people why you have
an android phone instead of an iphone as
the iphone i could be able to do
anything like it and wait it is not good
I'm not sure I'm not trying I'm not
trying to start one of those things I'm
just saying
it hasn't been terribly easy to describe
why why you carry one platform over
another this is going to be a very big
talking point when it rolls out if it
works right yeah true truths gonna be
praised just like this it's gonna be why
do I carry an Android watch this yeah
yeah exactly right yeah your biggest
problem Michael and Joe is called Google
because this is the company that
launches those exact same tools on iOS
eventually that's the problem and then
we also have it or can we work on I oh
yeah my OS is far too closed for this to
function yeah yeah that that's the thing
it's that even in that way it's even
more important as an Android development
I mean we might get the natural language
processing improvements to google voice
search but we're not going to see
anywhere near the type of even at all
the sort of app integration is gonna be
key to making interpretation so yeah
yeah that's definitely a good point and
and now you were speaking Joe any final
thoughts uh I'm gonna go back to my old
old line and say wow we saw an awful lot
of cool stuff it sure is a great time to
be alive amen Joe nicely and Joe
definitely mr. hi Otto Huesman any final
thoughts I'm resonating with Joe there
cool cool how about you girls yeah I
want to keep everyone here for three
minutes longer so that I could come on
Android auto um no Belinelli I think
worth talking about I mean you saw the
release before talked about chevys you
know Oh 15 30 2016 models are going to
be able to have android on it was epic
larp know Hyundai GM Volkswagen and more
what whatever just announced during the
during the keynote I I guess I guess the
reason why I've been ignored Android
auto like completely as because it's
been announced for like the longest time
it took this long to get partners you
know well I mean it's here they're
they're announcing partners every you
know
you know that that kind of pace so we
should we should see it more than sue
and beyond all the other and no car dash
boy in our systems well it's hard to get
excited about so far just because of the
the high barrier to entry whether you're
buying an expensive new in dash system
or a whole new car it's not something
everyone's gonna get to experience
straightaway exactly over time girl see
these systems in more and more cars and
and I think popularity will grow up or
anyway I'm just going to keep on taking
the t and not have to worry there you go
what would you what were your final
thoughts be Steven uh I think based on
what I've heard about Android M I am
cautiously optimistic it might finally
be time to upgrade I'm still running
KitKat on my Nexus 5 here so hangers
crossed I see it all I like you're
finally step forward oh wow dude time
will tell you are you are how can you
avoid the need to update seriously like
I serious I got lollipop on my tablet I
got enough lollipop in my life Steven
wait we trade me that nexus 5 for my
fiancé's who is excess cash buoyed by
lollipop i guess i guess and i think the
best way to end it is with Joe's quote
it's a great time to be alive there you
know Google proves that there is a lot
of innovation coming up I am looking
forward to Android M mainly because I do
hate how lollipop has you know just made
device is useless in some points I mean
my galaxy note edge was not that bad on
KitKat but now it's terrible so but I
guess the biggest problem or the biggest
take over here is how long will it take
Google or OEM partners to update their
phones that's that's the only problem
that's left that's that's what we have
to wait for the developer preview is
already available you can bet that we
will be covering will be posting
coverage on this developer preview in
our impressions on what we get with
Android M again we have a lot of fix
downloading it right now oh yeah I'm
telling that loading that now yeah in
the car in the car LT you got the edge
guys we have a lot of
it's coming again the pocket now weekly
will go in depth with everything that we
saw at this event in addition to other
things that have happened this week you
can expect the full google Ohio version
of the pocket out daily happening later
today we've got a lot of posts a lot of
editorials coming on our impressions and
yes this editorial roundtable you could
come back to later guys thank you very
much for joining our editorial
roundtable thank you everyone for your
QA sadly we can go through them but you
can bet that we will try to cover these
and eventual coverage that will come
within the later day so and thank you
very much for watching and we will see
you in the next coverage that's to come
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
