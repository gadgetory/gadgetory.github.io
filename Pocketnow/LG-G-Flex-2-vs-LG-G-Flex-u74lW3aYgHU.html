G flex 2 can claim it's that it improves
on its predecessors Hardware in almost
every measurable sense we've already
covered much of that in our G flex 2
review now it's time to put the 2 curve
eke in face to face I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is new G flex
versus old G flex the first generation G
flex was a bold experiment on LG's part
and not just because of the curve
size-wise it was also a monster with a
6-inch display and pronounced bezels
above and below that made it even taller
than most phones in the same class the
screen had a low pixel density even for
2013 and it was subject to image
retention problems and an ugly
blotchiness it also lacked features
offered by some other high-end phones
like expandable memory all this made it
doubly doubtful the first G flex would
ever be a mainstream hit not only was it
expensive relative to its spec sheet it
was also bigger than most were willing
to deal with with the G flex 2 LG Slim's
everything down it's smaller in every
way and lighter to the industrial design
is more modern the build quality is
better and the fit and finish shows
greater attention to detail the somewhat
mushy rear keys of the first generation
are clicky ER and more ergonomic on the
newer model though I do miss the
notification LED the IR port has been
moved from the back cover to a more
sensible location on the top edge that
cover is now removable so the ugly
external SIM tray is no more there are
now two colors available instead of just
one and there's also microSD expansion
on the new phone probably the most
visible improvement is the display the
half-inch size reduction and increase to
Full HD makes it much sharper and the
burnin and blotchiness problems seem all
but solved the newer screen has a
shallower apparent curve because of its
reduced size so it is slightly less
immersive but given all the other
improvements that's hardly worth
mentioning
the Gorilla Glass 3 covering that
display has been chemically restrain
thenbye LG for a 20% increase in damage
resistance versus standard Gorilla Glass
the company says and LG also claims the
self-healing coating on the back cover
of the new phone repairs superficial
scratches 18 times faster but as you can
see neither phone is as immune to damage
as the hype would suggest a better
durability demonstration is in the Flex
test where the phones each take my full
weight before springing back to shape
while the G flex 2 creaks and pops more
dramatically because of its removable
back cover it's the harder one to bend
and it doesn't show damage like this
bump shaped distortion on the first gen
model stay tuned for more durability
testing in the weeks ahead to see if
that changes on to the user experience
the Qualcomm processors powering these
phones are similarly named but they're
vastly different in design potential
power and actual performance but the
same token the software load out on both
phones is the same basic idea Android
with an LG UI at it on top but there's a
huge gulf in aesthetics and
responsiveness between the original
phones KitKat and the new ones lollipop
at the risk of oversimplifying that
means this the first generation software
looks dated almost comically so at times
but it's very responsive on the flip
side the G flex 2 brings all the
cosmetic and feature upgrades of the
latest Android but it's not very
responsive to say the least and it tends
to run much hotter in the hand than its
predecessor I won't belabor this point
as we covered the new phones performance
problems extensively in our full review
check it out at the link in the
description below for more details
software isn't the only place the new
phone lags behind in user experience if
you're a road warrior spends a lot of
time between charges the G flex 2 should
not be at the top of your list probably
thanks to those software and processor
issues I find it's sometimes hard to get
through a full day with it even given
moderate use I've never gotten past
three and a half hours of screen on time
now you might make the point that I'm
using a South Korean phone in a market
it wasn't designed for and you'd be
right but the same exact thing is true
of the first-generation flex which we've
been using for over a year
the older phone routinely delivers up to
six hours of screen on time per charge
in fact it's such an endurance champ
that we often use it at trade shows for
this exact reason it's a shame that we
haven't seen similar staying power on
the newer phone not yet anyway finally
we come to the cameras again on paper LG
has corrected all the shortcomings of
the original flexes shooter the new one
keeps the resolution at 13 megapixels
but brings optical image stabilization
and the laser autofocus of the g3 the
biggest improvements to my eye though
have nothing to do with those changes
but with color reproduction the G flex 2
is much more faithful to real-world
color doing away with the to warm tones
of the original the newer phone is also
better at picking out details in faraway
objects and all this applies in good
lighting whether you're outdoors or in
ironically one of the issues I have with
the G flex 2 camera is with focus in a
few shots the supposedly superior laser
assisted module on the new phone
produced a blurrier photo than the older
one that happened in video 2 for all the
ballyhoo about the laser it's obviously
not comfortable with a lot of snow
around thankfully the optical image
stabilization did its job the flex 2's
picture is much more steady even in a
shivering hand and you can also shoot an
UHD with it as well the concluding
comparison sample taken in low-light
indoors is another point for the older
phone the newer phone brings washed out
color and much more digital noise to the
shot which is a shame but we can tie up
this crazy back-and-forth category with
good news for the G flex 2 its selfie
camera spanks the one on its predecessor
despite being the same 2.1 megapixel
resolution and it's more fun to use too
instead of focusing on gimmicks like
that
sliding lockscreen animation on the
original flex LG has gone for
practicality to some extent with the new
one building in a handy gesture trigger
to help with selfies also reviewing the
shot is as easy as bringing the phone
down to chest level no button pressing
required
if you watch our G flex 2 review video
or read the full review you know it's
not necessarily the slam-dunk that we
might have hoped and you also know our
coverage doesn't stop with this import
model we'll be testing the device in its
US trim as soon as we can all we need to
know in the context of this comparison
for now is how well the G flex 2 fares
against the original G flex and the
answer is as unsurprising as the brand
names are the newer phone is the one to
get if you want contemporary tech in a
beautiful package and you don't mind
some software bumps if instead you want
to save some money and you don't mind a
huge chassis with a disappointing screen
or you just want a battery that lasts
forever the original G flex will be the
better fit for you folks LG has released
a statement commenting on the
performance issues in the current build
of the G flex 2 you can read it in the
description below for more on the G flex
2 our full review is available both here
on YouTube and at pocketnow.com
and stay tuned for our coverage of the
US Edition coming soon until next time
this has been michael fisher with
PocketNow captain to phones on twitter
making the claim that to notification
lights are better than one agree
disagree let me know in the comments
till then thanks for watching we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
