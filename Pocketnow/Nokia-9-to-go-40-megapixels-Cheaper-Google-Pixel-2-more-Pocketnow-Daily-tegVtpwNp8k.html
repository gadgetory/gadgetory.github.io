Nokia 9 at least on paper we've got some
interesting details of a less-expensive
pixel to be launched soon and it seems
that drones and iPhones go together at
least when you get them smuggled out of
China
I'm Jaime Rivera and yeah I'm a little
rusty I feel like if I haven't done this
in forever let's go through the news
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals I still
recommend the Huawei may 10 Pro is
probably one of the best phones of last
year that you can still buy today it's
currently 150 dollars off on retailers
but even more interesting if you do the
math well you also have the mate se now
available for 230 dollars yeah that's
the price for the whole phone 230 bucks
so it would actually be a good time to
buy both of you considerate and
apparently the deal is going to last a
little Mother's Day now let's talk about
Android Oreo rollouts and Samsung
devices it's funny I don't usually come
for updates the only reason why I do is
because it takes forever for Samsung to
do so if you're on t-mobile Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 finally gets it and if
you're on AT&amp;amp;T the Samsung Galaxy S a
active which I still like to use a lot
is also getting the Oreo update uh yeah
I would highly suggest you start working
on that now and hilarious news today
let's talk about iPhones and drones what
do these have in common in addition to
Shenzhen and Hong Kong and for those of
you that don't know these are bordering
cities well it turns out that there was
this operation that just got stopped
today 26 individuals have been
apprehended and the reason why is
because they were using drones to
smuggle iPhones between those cities up
to 15,000 units a day we're talking
nearly a 30 million-dollar full
operation here apparently these devices
were refurbished though it's kind of
interesting what the news develop on
this we'll keep you posted
now for those of you in the market for a
Google pixel particularly in emerging
markets it's probably a good time to
wait for those of you that don't know I
mean you can currently get pretty much
project 5 services and the Google
Experience on the Moto X 4 but
apparently Google wants to change that
as of the summer
it seems the company is reportedly
working on a device and it seems that it
will focus mainly
emerging markets what is the price going
to be what is the approach going to be
we don't know but probably Google i/o
will shed some light and finally the
most interesting news that they have to
do with the Nokia 9 it's making the
hottest news once again because
apparently we're supposed to expect
three different cameras on this device
and stop me if you've heard this before
but apparently one is going to have a 40
megapixel shooter for RGB then there's
gonna be a monochrome sensor and then
there's gonna be another telephoto
sensor as well so yeah it sounds like
the p20 pro most interesting apparently
it'll bring all the bells and whistles
of the flagship snapdragon 845 processor
from Qualcomm eight gigs of ram 256 gigs
of storage outlet in the display like
the Nokia Sirocco this is going to be a
beast when should we expect this film we
don't know but we do hear that Zeiss is
going to be involved so oh my god this
sounds really cool in the comments today
let us know do you think that a device
like this would pull Nokia back into the
limelight because I think it would even
if the company is not going to sell much
of these flagships I feel that those
bragging rights are what keeps the
company on buzz
