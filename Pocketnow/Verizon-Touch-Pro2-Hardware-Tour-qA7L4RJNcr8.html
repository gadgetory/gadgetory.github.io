packing.com and today I'm going to show
you the hardware tour the verizon touch
pro2 so we get started at the top of the
device at the top we have a notification
LED to the right of that we have the
earphone speaker covering a metallic
mesh to the right of that we had the
light sensor below that we have the
verizon emblem we have an LED backlit
touchscreen LCD display this is the
resistive touchscreen of course we have
the zoom slider for sliding an
application such as pictures and opera
mobile we have a HTC emblem right here
we have the call start button the
windows button they return our back
button and the call and and power button
it actually took me a minute to turn on
this device because I assumed that the
top button on this device was actually
the power button like it is on the other
touch pro tues but it's actually this
button here so if i push on this button
it'll turn on the device and then it
will ask me to it'll say backlight is
off so I've soft to press this button
which is kind of weird so I'll just turn
that off turn off the backlight and
we'll move to this side of the device we
have the volume rocker so up and down
pretty simple no other buttons on this
side move to the bottom we have the
proprietary info which is also a mini
USB right here we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack for stereo headset we
also have one of our microphones right
here this is a stereo microphone device
so this is the main calling for stereo
or for speakerphone there's another
microphone on the cycles will show you
in a second we'll have our stylist a
nonmagnetic stylist but when you pull it
out it actually turns on the device as
you can see we'll just turn off this now
move on to the other side we have one of
our other speakers for conference
calling move on to the back of the
device we have a lanyard hole right here
so if you want to put a strap on this
device you can do that as well we have
this global scene
that's etched into the back of the
device along with the brushed metallic
bezel around the 3.2 megapixel camera
and the mute button for the conference
calling feature if we open up the back
of the battery cover we have all of our
normal equipment under here we of course
head of our battery on this device we
have a stereo speakers so one on each
side of the camera this is also a
notification LED so when the device is
muted it will actually turn I think red
we take off the battery we can pull out
the stylus there's little instructions
on here and how to get the sim card out
this is a dual gsm and cdma device so
it'll work pretty much anywhere in the
world we can just pop that out put it
back in right here we have a slot for a
microSD card so it can support 32
gigabytes of memory we also have the
reset button underneath the battery
cover so it's a little bit annoying to
have to take off the battery cover and
push the reset button so just close up
this here also if you want to put the
cover back on for some odd reason it's a
little bit easier to take out the stylus
and just put it back in and open up the
device we have a keyboard it's a
standard Cordy five row keyboard and it
works very well I'm actually surprised
of how well the keyboard is it's a
little bit different than some of the
other touch pro tues some of the button
configurations are a little bit
different like for instance the of the
function one is a tilde opposed to an
exclamation mark so if i compare this
device to a few other devices we have
the newly released samsung omnia here
and as you can see the screen is a
little bit smaller on the touch pro 2
than it is on the omnia it's also a
little bit thicker as you can tell right
here it's a little bit thicker than the
samsung omnia and about the same width
so if you look at that one a little bit
different than the sprint touch pro 2 +
button configurations but i'll go into
that in a video later on the original
touch pro a little bit thinner then they
touch pro the keyboard of course it does
tilt up on the newer device opposed to
the older device
close that and an xperia x1 screen is a
little bit larger on the touch pro two
opposed to this one also button
configurations and is about the same
thickness as the xperia x1 and the for a
credit card sized object it is a little
bit taller than a credit card let's see
it's about almost two centimeters taller
than a credit card nearly the same width
about one millimeter to wider than a
credit card sized object so be sure to
follow us on the software tour coming up
next on the verizon touch pro2 and
shortly i will be featuring a comparison
of the cdma gsm hybrid touch pro tues
for verizon and sprint thanks for
