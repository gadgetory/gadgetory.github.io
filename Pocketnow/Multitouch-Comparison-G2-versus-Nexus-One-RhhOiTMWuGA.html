you guys have heard me compare the new
g2 to the nexus one is being the next
generation of that device or a nexus one
with a keyboard which i really think it
is well that got one of our readers
thinking this is mitchell who sent me an
email and he said hey what about the
digitizer the multi-touch input panel on
the g2 how does it fare compared to some
of the problems that we've had in the
past with the same on the nexus one it's
a good question let's go look ok to
start out some vocabulary and some
history multi-touch is the availability
or the ability to touch a touch screen
in more than one location at the same
time this is nice for pinch to zoom in
and to zoom out and there are some other
things that you can do in the but those
are the main things you want to be able
to pinch to zoom in and back out again
when Android first hit the scene they
didn't have multitouch and that was kind
of a gentleman's agreement as we
understand with Apple because Apple
wanted that exclusivity on their devices
the ipods the iphones and whatnot so
later on multi-touch was added in and
this is an app that you can get free in
the market called yet another
multi-touch tester when they implemented
that on the nexus one some people argue
that they did it wrong where they didn't
have the right kind of hardware to
support multitouch so let's take a look
I'm going to tap up here in the corner
and you can see under my finger a little
bit I've got a little blue dot you see
that down there and then it also shows
me the grid lines of where that
intersection point is do the same thing
down here in the bottom now I've got a
red dot under my finger just hiding
under there so you can't see it and
again those grid lines now when I come
up here and cross them they kind of
stick together and then as I pass oh you
see that they hand it off wrong so now
my finger doesn't have any touch point
underneath it it thinks that I'm
touching way over to the right where I'm
on the left and down on the bottom way
over to the left where I'm on
right so to show you that again tap tap
cross sometimes it works just fine other
times it doesn't hand off very well and
to add another finger into the mix
there's no third point so it's just two
points so let's see how this does on the
g2 and answer Mitchell's question I'm
going to go ahead and unlock the g2 same
app from the market touch the first
point touch the second point and cross
and there's no hesitation there as I go
past them and I can go around and I
don't have any problem at all other than
smudging up my screen a bit with those
points getting confused now you saw
another line there just for a minute
that's because i was using more of my
finger to touch and that got me thinking
ok so we know one works we know two
works what about three and four so let's
do it this way two and two sure enough
we have four points that it recognizes
and it's kind of hard to do this on
camera but if you've got a g2 go ahead
and try this yourself you can see it
actually actively tracks four points on
the screen which is really cool that's a
lot of points to pinch and zoom kind of
difficult to do on a small screen such
as this but you can do it and I'm not
having any of those problems that we've
had with the nexus one on the new g2 so
thank you for the email mitchell that's
awesome i love your input make sure that
all you guys speaking to the entire
audience now are subscribed to our
YouTube channel so you can stay up to
date on new stuff as we find out about
it you're not left out at the water

types of videos like this and of course
leave us comments that's the only way we
can give you the information that you
want then that's what we're all about
showing off multi touch capabilities on
the g2 comparing that to the nexus one
I'm Joe for pocket now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
