know who I am this is hands on this is
pocket now we are still in London still
many videos to go this time is the
samsung galaxy s4 on the left and
against the samsung galaxy s4 mini real
quick there's no need for making a
difference between them and comparisons
this is the s4 this is a smaller version
of the s4 and even if you look at the
materials and the texture everything is
the same will try to catch that on
camera but the materials used are also
identical starting from hyper blaze up
to color options and the texture so if
we're talking about specifications we
have a 5 inch Super AMOLED HD screen on
the s4 vs a 4.3 inch qhd display on the
s4 mini series of RAM vs. 1.5 years of
RAM this particular version here of the
s4 is the Exynos 5 octa version the s4
also comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon
600 processor version the s4 mini is
powered by a dual-core processor clocked
at 1.7 megahertz and flipping them to
the back we'll try to do that while not
touching anything and messing up in this
place will have a 13 megapixel camera on
the s4 vs &amp;amp; 8
pixel shooter on the s4 mini and as you
can see lots of lots of fingerprints
because that's what hyper blaze does it
collects fingerprints flipping them back
to the side for a quick comparison in
terms of width as you can see they are
exactly at the same width and even the
bezels are made out of the same
materials I'm going to stack them up
right here so you can see
how they compare in terms of height and
width it is approximately 1.7 centimeter
smaller and I'd say about five to six
millimeters
thinner than the s4 so this was a really
really quick look at the samsung galaxy
s4 compared to the samsung galaxy s4
mini we have lots of videos coming to
you from london it's going to be a long
day and an even longer night this has
been answer from pocket now thank you
very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
