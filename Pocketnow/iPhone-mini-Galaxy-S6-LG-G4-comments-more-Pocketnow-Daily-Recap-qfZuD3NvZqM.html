lol come Canada cornejo and I thought
that meant I was getting wiser just show
you what the starting quotes please we
know you're a bloody drunk already need
not to say it every time you begin a
video just shut up and just do the video
that's enough you mad bro I mean you
know you're hiding that Apple watch
behind your ears show it already and my
ears are big but not that big that's
right it's that time of the week I'm
hind everything that I this is pocket
now and this is the pocket out daily
recap for last week brought to you by
Linda calm so last Monday asked you what
was the last time that you bought a
tablet as the rumors are that Apple is
still experimenting with the iPad plus
and we wonder that bigger size and a
display would make a difference we have
454 comments out of which drunken pot
says my nexus 7 2013 still running
strong no need to upgrade not yet anyway
and you probably won't that's probably
one of the best tablets we've tested
period Justin Reid says I have the
surface pro 3 after using this I can
honestly say I'll never buy a tablet
that doesn't run a full OS Android and
iPad tablets are too limited for my
taste and yet that's your only computer
it makes sense to you dude but not the
case for everybody the niccola says last
time I bought a tablet I've had two in
2011 still runs somewhat smoothly and
yeah my son's ipad 2 is still retaining
not like new but it still works which is
great then on Tuesday I asked you what
is your current smartphone and do you
like the camera as the rumors are that
Apple's fattening this new technology
for a new seidel display type it's a
crazy new patent design for a camera
that'll bring you both optical image
stabilization in addition to optical
zoom if you can believe that birth in
our iPhone we have 1107 comments thanks
a lot guys out of which Abby says note
for great camera but lags a bit and
that's my same experience with a note
edge I hate the fact that it lags but
it's still my favorite camera period and
i sold out ago says proud owner of the
lumia 930 and the denim update has
brought lots of good stuff on board you
guys should make a comparison video
between the 930 the note for the z3 in
the iphone 6 plus and that is a really
good idea the ninth
is my second pick as a camera for our
smartphone it used to be the first thing
as the Galaxy Note my god it is that
good then Vice says the Nexus 5
absolutely hate the camera what is
google going to update their apt to take
advantage of the camera to api and
lollipop and that is a very good
question but sadly that is a story for
nexus cameras they've always sucked on
wednesday asked you of a free year of
netflix would make you buy a galaxy s6
as well t-mobile is bundling that deal
but it seems that this is a samsung deal
I'm necessarily t-mobile we have 336
comments out of which one of them says I
was going to get the s6 anyways the next
was still just sweetens the pot I hope
that it starts the trend for all smart
phone companies and that should be the
case for the amount of money that you're
paying for smartphone you should be
getting a lot of these free services and
these companies actually benefit from
the fact that you actually prefer their
services after being free for a little
bit make sense and chris says t-mobile
is on their game right now I was gonna
get the s6 on sprint but I might be
dumping it for tmobile and Michael
Fisher has been testing team oval for
the last couple of months he's liked a
little he's hit a little but when you
compare it to sprint oh my god that's a
typical one I i think i'd go for tmobile
that's just me and you sir says this
netflix deal is a good strategy
especially in australia where Netflix is
coming soon Samsung is a good flair with
this one to get people hooked on samsung
smartphones and disclaimer this is
actually only available for the t mobile
carrier in the united states not even in
germany so we're not really sure if it's
gonna go global but if it does then do
it it would be awesome indeed next up
Thursday was about iphones there are
rumors that there will be three iphones
this year and i asked you which size
would you pick it given the choice
between a foreign jar iphone a 4.7 inch
model or the 5.5 inch phablet we have
197 comments out of what you ben says
4.7 is the sweet spot that's why the
sgs3 is the best phone for me my god the
samsung galaxy s3 well 4.7 inches i do
agree on that one what's probably not
the best phone though but up yeah for me
that's the sweet spot
not too small not too big but that's
what she said and Jeff's comp says
depending on the specs I'd stick to the
four enjoy phone and I know a lot of
friends that would stick to the smaller
iPhone because they prefer one hand the
usability but again that's a preference
deal and sophia says i'd stick to the
six plus i'm loving the battery life and
that is what everybody this bought the
six blood says they don't care about the
screen size as much as the fact that the
thing lasts for more than a day and
that's probably the reason why it
probably give the iphone 7 plus a try
next year we'll see and finally on
friday asked you if you're waiting for
the LG g4 as we got the first leaked
photos of the phone we should be
expecting we have 500 1 comments out of
which Caleb says I feel like they made
the g4 curve then it would compete with
the galaxy edge for a unique design and
I thought that was the G flex 2 so I
don't think that would applies but hey
we'll see when Evan says and what
exactly will be the difference between
the LG g3 and the four camera and well
of the g3 needed a better display trust
me I was waiting for the g3 badly and
then the display just completely
disappointed me so I'm expecting for
that I am expecting for a better camera
because the g3's camera was good but it
wasn't as great as the g2's oddly so
those are my expectations we'll see and
whose error says it looks cool and all
but i like the geez watch two more cuz
it's well self-healing back and flexible
flexibility pneus that's a word um yeah
I do agree with you I prefer the G flex
2 mainly because of its innovation and
I'd rather stick to 1080p but that would
be the case for many people will see in
the end with the g4 and folks if you
ever wanted to build your own
professional website or hey become a pro
adobe tools or build a video like this
one there are thousands of awesome
courses at our sponsor Linda calm /
