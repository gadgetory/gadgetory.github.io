calm and i'm going to show you this
week's new xbox live game for windows
phone 7 it is called implode so this
game has been on the iphone for quite a
long time you may notice some
similarities a lot of similarities and
here it is and it's coming to Windows
Phone tomorrow on Wednesday so let's
check it out a little bit here's our
menu we have leaderboard achievements
help and options let's see that that's
some options there audio you can do
difficulty casual veteran or expert
credit some tips that's all good so
let's do play so this is kind of like a
chalkboard physics game let's do that
level
Oh already just one so there we go i
blew it up and we'll be able to go to
the next building after comes down to
make sure i won there we go next project
okay so what we do we've got to drag the
bombs the dynamite actually into places
that I want to put it and I can't put it
there so let's put it right there and we
only have that many cases of dynamite so
we got to place them properly maybe this
one it right there and hello to their
eat right there and then you got to
press this plunger over here to make
them explode you have to get it so it's
all below this line I was going to count
down to make sure everything's settled
and there we go
now there's some other cool features I
can make my own building so let's edit
it so i can put I tap it I can rotate it
I can make it bigger zoom and you're
supposed to be able to make a picker
there we go I can put that there and I
put another one over there when you
first do it gives you a nice tutorial
there we go that's better okay so you
get the idea if you tap the piece you
get different corners up there to choose
from pinching you can zoom well when
it's selected it changes the size
pinching you can zoom like that and two
fingers you can pan
a little bit difficult but you can have
some fun making your own buildings to
blow up where's your test that was an
easy one
all right let's get back here we also
got the leaderboard and since this
doesn't come out till tomorrow nobody
else has it except for that guy and I
can make sure i'm beating him in the
score and we have achievements here of
course some of them are pretty easy so
that's about it pretty cool game now
coming to Windows Phone for 299 with a
free trial that gives you a certain
amount of levels so when Wednesday comes
along check that out in the windows
phone marketplace that's it for now
