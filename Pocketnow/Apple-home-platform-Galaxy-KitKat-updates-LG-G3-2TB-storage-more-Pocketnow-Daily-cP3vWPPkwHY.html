platform at WWDC 2014 leaks point to
Samsung already working on a SmartWatch
with a round display and could it be
that LG is going to bring as a two
terabyte compatible microSD card slot on
the g3 I'm high netting that I and the
spaceship can travel at the speed of
light what the headlights work this is
pocket out daily let's begin today with
what's official nuh squawk on has
already begun showing off what things
you can expect to be able to do with the
Snapdragon 805 processor which should
launch very soon apparently dual cameras
will be a thing as a the processor will
be able to bring these things without
any sort of twigs from OEMs aside from
the fact that you'll be able to take as
much as a 16 megapixel burst shots while
you're filming a video which is great
since I currently that's almost like a
screenshot so interesting points that
are coming hopefully we'll see this
processor by the end of this year now
out of the things that you can do
already we've got the first leaks of
when you are getting your Android 4.4
KitKat update for samsung devices or at
least the current status link to the
scripture for full details as we've got
the galaxy s4 new versions for the
galaxy s5 aside from other devices like
the galaxy mega which are also getting
the update nothing really substantial
though there are some phones there that
are parently not getting it at all
because of instability issue and
speaking of Samsung if you're wondering
which is the king of smartwatches right
now well it is Samsung and just give you
an idea the company is already working
on patents for the future SmartWatch
that will apparently include a round
display as a I'm sure that the company
notice that all of us found the Moto 360
to be a gorgeous smart watch whenever it
gets launched so obviously that is the
future hopefully we get some Android
wear on it as well now out of the hot
stuff that's coming we've got the LG g3
which is just a couple of hours away
from being launched and probably one of
the coolest features designed from the
2k display and aside from all the other
great specifications that we're getting
is it apparently the micro SD card slot
will be compatible with two terabyte
cards and there is none in the market
right now but it's cool to see the
protocols already there though given the
fact that this is pretty much still in
the grounds of SDXC not really sure
exactly what the difference
here but stay tuned as we we'll know
very soon and finally for the very
interesting news of the day rumors have
it that Apple is going to launch more
than just iOS 8 and health book and all
these things that we've seen in rumors
at WWDC 2014 rather the company is also
working on bringing us this home
automation platform just like we have
with Google home and just what we've
seen from Samsung as well the company
plans to bring us something cool using
its I beacon platform and technology
rumors say and apparently Apple has to
be unique about this though we don't
really know how as pretty much
everything's already been invented with
the nest thermostat and with the fire
detector just about everything but that
leaves use of the question of the day
what do you think about this do you
think that this is something that you
want for your home for your apartment
right now is it something cool for you
in my particular case I find it cool i
do it's just that if i'm gonna have to
buy a hundred-dollar switch module just
to turn on my lights then it's pretty
much gonna be pointless whatever money i
would save with this i would pretty much
throw away with the accessories so leave
us a comment down below what do you
think and friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
