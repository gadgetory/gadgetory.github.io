years that it can blend gorgeous design
powerful specs great innovations in
photography and the price tag that
doesn't break the bank all into its
zenfone lineup in 2018 the company's
theme is back to five and it's actually
a reference to its brand new product I'm
here to go down with PocketNow reporting
from WC 2018 and meet the isuzu phone 5z
the zenfone 5c is the company's new
top-of-the-line flagship which might
look identical to the zenfone 5 the same
gorgeous finish of glass and aluminum
that feel very nice in the hand the
device is powered by the new Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 the Adreno 630 GPU along
with options that range from four six or
eight gigabytes of RAM and 64 128 or 256
gigs of storage respectively along with
a 3300 milliamp hour battery as whose
claims improvements in performance of
25% of the CPU and 30% of the GPU now
the major theme of this phone is really
its photography and the inclusion of
Qualcomm's latest chipset allows for
much of the major selling points of the
zenfone 5c and it really starts with a
camera combo we have a primary 12
megapixel camera def 1.8 aperture Sony's
latest imx6 36 sensor 83 degrees of
field of view and both optical and
electronic image stabilization the
secondary lens is an 8 megapixel sensor
at f/2 point 2 aperture in 120 degrees
of field of view yes thank you
a soos we need more manufacturers
supporting wide-angle photography this
combo will allows this camera to do a
ton of things we're talking dual pixel
face detection autofocus five times
higher light sensitivity and since we
have a snapdragon 845 onboard we have ai
scene detection of up to 16 scenes and
objectives which means we have true auto
mode here all you have to do is point
the camera at a cat it'll notify you
that it sees a cat and dial exposure
time sharpness and noise for it same
goes for people boot a sunset etc ai
capabilities also mean the camera
reportedly excels at night shots color
exposure and sharpness are all tuned to
the scene once the
hammer detects the night shot you think
the wide-angle camera means goodbye
portrait mode but it's here this is
actually created a special metal frame
around the lens to ensure alignment and
make sure this is possible the selfie
camera is also of 8 megapixels at f/2
aperture and 83 degrees of field of view
and though some of these capabilities
content consumption is also a big deal
here I'm actually impressed by the 6.2
inch full HD panel mainly due to its
insane 90 percent screen to body ratio
and it's way to adapt a color
temperature automatically we've also got
dual speakers that are crazy loud and
the phone also supports some great
wireless features like bluetooth 5
welcomes aptX HD etc Zen UI 5 powers the
experience and provides added values
over other UIs
first there's very little boat here as
opposed to previous variants there's AI
charging which claims to double battery
longevity by not leaving your phone
charged at 100% all night
it detects when you usually wake up and
charges the phone up to 80% and then the
extra 20 before you're awake there's
clearly a lot of AI features in this
device but along with all this it seems
that more and more flagships are finally
getting onboard not only Google but LTE
but with second generation gigabit LTE
from the synaptic in 845 and the ex 20
LTE modem
overall the ascend phone vibes is a very
interesting blend of hardware and
software one that we can't wait to test
and show you more about when our review
and it arrives in the pocket our labs
