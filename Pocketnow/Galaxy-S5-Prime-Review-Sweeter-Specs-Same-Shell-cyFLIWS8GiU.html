we showed you why you shouldn't
necessarily be ticked off if you opted
for a standard galaxy s5 over the new
LTE a version they're very similar
devices from a day-to-day standpoint and
for now this one's only available in
South Korea to boot but if you're
thinking of importing one maybe because
you think it's the best Samsung Galaxy
s5 you can find well we don't
necessarily disagree and we're here to
give you a quick look at what you can
expect I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the Samsung Galaxy s5 LTE a if you
ultimately decide to spring for the
phone some are calling the galaxy s5
prime do what we did get in touch with
the folks at 28 mobile they provided the
demo device for this review for which we
thank them and they have the phone in
stock linked in the description below
physically there's not much new to this
version of the galaxy s5 which comes in
a few more colors but otherwise is
almost exactly the same as its
predecessor in terms of look and feel
and fit and finish the removable battery
and microSD slot sit behind a gasketed
back cover that when properly sealed
protects the phone against dust and
fresh water immersion just don't get
your fingers too wet if you're using the
fingerprint scanner or heart rate sensor
both of which work about as well here as
they do on the standard s5 the whole
thing is fronted by a quad HD display
under a sheet of damage resistant
Gorilla Glass 3 the Super AMOLED screen
is a little bluer than we're used to but
it's dense with dots and capable of both
overpowering brightness and dark room
dimness and that combined with the
strong color saturation and almost
perfect blacks make it a real beauty in
almost all conditions the Snapdragon 805
powering it packs the latest graphics
and image signal processors making for a
very slick software experience out of
the box
slick has its limits of course and we'd
be interested to see how well Samsung's
custom software ages overtime despite
the powerful processor the interface
formerly known as TouchWiz has
transition animations that function is
kind of an unfortunate speed bump it's
no worse than the animations in say iOS
but combined with the kind of
half-finished aesthetic we complained
about in our u.s. Galaxy s5 review it
does get a little frustrating at times
fortunately there's cool stuff here that
makes up for that once you've used
multi-window to keep a chat going while
watching a youtube video at the same
time you start to understand the utility
that TouchWiz brings to the table and
you're more inclined to forgive it's
cosmetic shortcomings also there are
options here not present on US versions
of this phone there's a button right in
the dialer to record calls in progress
which should be standard on all
smartphones and you've got a download
booster - which uses both LTE and Wi-Fi
to speed up file transfers there's also
some cutesy stuff like festival effect
for date specific wallpapers and such
but that's nothing we haven't seen
before for those ground-pounders
interested in using the prime - it's
full exercise potential s-health is
still here and it's mostly identical to
what we're used to there's no signal
life coach so you don't need to worry
about your phone judging your lifestyle
and you also need to manually pair your
gear fit if you have one as the manager
isn't available through Samsung Apps
odds are if you're importing an out of
region smartphone you're used to these
kind of bumps in the road speaking of
bumps you'll still feel most of them
when recording video in motion on the s5
prime no matter which of the five
available resolutions you're shooting it
the lack of optical stabilization is
still a sore point and the software
stabilization isn't as good as say
Sony's also low-light photography really
stinks at drawing out the detail from a
scene fortunately still shots in good
lighting come out nicely if you hold the
phone still enough and the software
benefits from the added juice of the
phone's new image signal processor
making the camera speedier on the whole
we're glad Samsung offers the ability to
modify the shooting mode selector here
but the 27 individual settings toggles
really need to be pared down to make
this a more usable experience at least
the volume key toggle is handy for
snapping underwater photos where the
display is useless once we got this
device set up to use a TTS network here
in the States
performance was on par with what we've
come to expect from both big orange and
Samsung while there's no American LTE
advanced network to take advantage of
throughput is still excellent over 4G
and reception is solid on the phone's
end which also helps out with calling
Samsung's Galaxy S Line has never been a
favorite of ours in terms of voice
quality which is usually a little muddy
on both ends of the call in both modes
and the rear firing speakerphone doesn't
help matters fortunately it is loud
enough to take in a movie or a Spotify
track and quiet
and it's also plenty loud for gaming
which as you might expect is an
excellent experience it's still possible
to find hiccups in unoptimized titles as
always but by and large the excellent
hardware lives up to its name
specs may not always matter but to a
gamer they're crucial and the galaxy s5
lte-a is effectively the best you can
get on Android finally we were surprised
at the phone's endurance despite what we
presume is quite a power drain from the
pixel Pak display the optimizations
within the Snapdragon 805 SOC overcome
that giving the prime about the same
battery life as the stock s5 over our
four days of testing that doesn't mean
it's got the staying power of some of
its super-sized competition but it's
still respectable and there's even a
spare battery in the box and at least
some units which sweetens the pot quite
a bit just like its stock cousin the
galaxy s5 lte-a is not the phone for
everyone it's got a boring design
uninspired software and despite
Samsung's recent progress more gimmicks
than it should but if you care more
about performance damage resistance and
the best combination of specs you can
find on an Android phone well this is
the device that's going to pop your corn
for many it's the phone the stock galaxy
s5 should have been and whether you
agree with that or not it can't be
denied that this is a very powerful and
capable product no matter how
predictable the package it comes in
maybe once again if you're in the United
States and you'd like one of these you
won't find it on your carrier's shelves
