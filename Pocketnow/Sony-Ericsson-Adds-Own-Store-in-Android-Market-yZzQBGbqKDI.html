pocketnow.com Sony Ericsson is the first
om to come out with a subsection for the
android market so you can get specific
Sony Ericsson applications on your Sony
Ericsson smartphone in this video we're
going to drill through them and talk
about the offering that they've provided
let's get to it
okay again you're going to need a Sony
Ericsson device to be able to see these
applications and they're very specific
to Sony Ericsson devices you'll see why
in a second so this one's kind of
intriguing it's the Sony Xperia Play
game launcher which of course comes on
the Play right out of the box I'm
curious as to whether people without an
experience light maybe with the arc or
the Neo or the x10 can access this so if
you have any of those devices let us
know if you're able to get to the same
application even though you don't have a
play so let's go back into portrait see
what else we have inside of this
subsection we've got hot shots which is
sort of a kind of a novelty be able to
follow the lives of six incredible
tennis players so sort of a social type
game extension search the extension
start search application helps you to
find the latest extensions for Timescape
okay so this allows you to get the
plugins for the Sony Ericsson time scape
interface and you've got a bunch of
other stuff for Timescape the Foursquare
plugin LinkedIn plug in hives whatever
that is VZ net for Verizon and some
other things so it gives you the ability
to really extend the functionality of
Timescape if you're using that as your
primary interface on the on a Sony
Ericsson phone we've got hot xi
messenger I don't know if I pronounced
that right let's see it looks like a
chat with Facebook friends and let's see
what the screenshots look like kind of
just a standard messenger that you can
add let's go back again we've got live
where this one's kind of called Live
View application which allows you to
work with this little live view watch
that Sony Ericsson sells it's not too
popular but they give you the
application within their sub section of
the market and then you get a bunch of
games some of which are free like
restaurant Story Farm Story some which
costs money like cyber Lords and age of
zombies and raging thunder
- so really hand selected apps designed
for Sony Ericsson devices specifically
for those that have the Timescape
interface so if you have a Sony Ericsson
device let us know if you found anything
interesting in here that's worth
checking out if you liked this video
please give it a thumbs up thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
