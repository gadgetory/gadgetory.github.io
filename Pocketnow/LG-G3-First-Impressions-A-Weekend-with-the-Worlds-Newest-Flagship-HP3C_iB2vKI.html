while we don't think that's quite enough
time for a full review we do have some
thoughts that just can't wait I'm
Michael Fisher this is pocket now and
these are our first impressions on the
LG g3 the first thing you're going to
notice on picking up the g3 is its
special fit and finish the hardware is
plastic and it shows on our demo unit
which arrived with a big scratch that
shows it's not impervious to damage
still it strikes the perfect balance
between the premium look and feel of the
HTC One m8 itself a bit of a scratch
magnet and the comfortable lightweight
softness of the galaxy s5 there are some
great contradictions here on the face it
looks quite angular but in cross-section
the g3 is floating Ark build better
resembles in an airfoil or a helicopter
rotor blade or something that combines
with the re-engineered control keys and
minimal display bezels to make for a
very comfortable fit in the hand the 13
megapixel camera with enhanced image
stabilization and laser assisted focus
has a lot of terminology to live up to
and during our travels this weekend we
put it to the test in bright sunshine we
found shooting with the g3 pretty breezy
LG seems to have the same attitude as
other smartphone makers with regard to
color which look a little saturated to
our eye but that added vibrance sure
does make for a pretty picture it took a
little while to get the hang of manual
HDR versus automatic and to be honest
we're not sure we found the right
balance yet also so far low light
shooting looks hit and miss but again
we're still working and on the whole
we're pretty impressed with this shooter
so far after using the software on last
year's g2 we weren't expecting much from
LG's new user interface and we do have
some reservations concerning some of
what we're seeing here but on the whole
the g3 offers a friendly sharp-looking
android skin a much of last year's
chrome that we didn't like has been
sandblasted away and the newer simpler
elements result in a very responsive
flagship that's despite LG's pervasive
animations which are attractive and
snappy a tough combination to deliver
there's also more utility here compared
with other smartphones the customizable
home keys are so handy that we think
every manufacturer should offer them and
the double tap to wake combined with LG
is new knock on unlock feature makes
waking the phone painless and fun too if
you expected more like a few words on
that quad HD display don't worry we'll
get to it in our full review and we do
indeed have some downsides to report in
that review as well but early
indications are that the g3 is a refined
capable flagship smartphone with some
compelling features that should keep it
feeling fresh well beyond the honeymoon
phase check out our first hands-on with
the LG g3 and get up to speed with LG's
previous offerings with our G flex and
g2 reviews then stay tuned for a full g3
review and comparison coverage coming to
pocketnow.com very soon until then this
has been Michael Fisher thanks for
watching and we'll see you again next
time ooh bruley wet al is coming out
Duke Duke we've spent the last 48 hours
with the waveform trying to make the
waveform be a waveform you to move very
pretty you are very pretty telephone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
