waiting for the iPhone 10 R which should
really boost Apple sales we got some new
renders of the new screen dimensions for
the new iPads the Samsung Galaxy S
weight a nine was just announced and we
wonder when we've got enough cameras I'm
Jaime Rivera and yes we were here in LA
for the razor phone event it was awesome
our unit is already here there's a lot
to share watch that separate video in
the link in the description this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for the new Google pixel 3 or pixel 3 XL
there's a way to kind of get a credit
that'll give you a free phone but there
are a ton of conditions like you have to
follow this whole procedure or you have
to bring somebody and that other person
east activate a specific amount of
things and you end up getting like $750
in credit I'm not gonna bore you with
all the details read the link in the
description to follow the plans so far
my pixel 3 Excel the in the experience
has been interesting it's a great phone
but there's more there's more needed
here now let's talk about the Asaro G
phone because what else did companies do
whenever a competitor like razer
announces their phone the rog finally
will be available for pre-order on
october 18th funny how you need a
competing device to get somebody to
announce their own it is uh definitely a
pre-order that works through the
Microsoft Store $8.99 for the entry
level and then 1099 for the higher tier
but guess what the accessories are not
ready yet so I'm not exactly sure how
useful this gaming phone is going to be
without those now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy a nine because if you
didn't have enough cameras with the LG
g5 this is a mid-range er that brings
something similar we're not talking
about two cameras to the front it's
actually four cameras to the back one in
the front for selfies then in the back
you have a regular camera we've got the
super wide angle then we've got a
telephoto and then we've got another one
with a depth sensor which makes me
wonder exactly what the point here is I
mean don't the other cameras serve as
that is this just bragging rights
whatever the case may be you can learn
more about the specifications on these
cameras and everything in the link in
the description
now let's talk about iPads as well there
are some leak renders of what to expect
with the design of iPads and we're kind
of a little confused because it seems
that we will be having two iPad pros one
of these both sorry both will have
bezel-less displace to a certain degree
more like the iPhone 10s though there
won't be a notch here we notice the
antenna bands at the back which is
another interesting thing we noticed
that pogo pins at the bottom for
accessories but it seems that the
screens are getting larger we're not
exactly sure which one is getting 13
inches if it's the smaller one because
of the lack of bezels or if that one is
just gonna get a smaller design which I
presume is gonna be the smartest way
like if we get a 10 point five inch
display with less bezels that means a
smaller tablet that'd be cool
13 inches for the larger one stay tuned
that sounds interesting and finally the
hot news today have to do with sales in
China and the the need for new iPhones
as min Chico has just shined then and
said that the only company that's really
selling well in China right now is
Huawei other companies are not
necessarily doing well or at least as
expected and the main reason why is we
would rarely the market along with other
markets across the world are waiting for
the iPhone 10 are because of the
dual-sim capabilities because of a
lesser price and because it's got a FRU
logo in the back and you know that there
are certain cultures that just go crazy
for these so let me know in the comments
down below are you waiting for the
iPhone 10 are is that the device that
you're waiting for or with all the bevy
of phones that we've seen lately is
there anything else that's enticing you
