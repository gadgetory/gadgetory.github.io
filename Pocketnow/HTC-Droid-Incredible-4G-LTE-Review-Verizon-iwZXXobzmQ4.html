reviewing a phone that's the third in
its family line will it live up to its
good name or will it fall flat on its
face or somewhere in between I'm Michael
Fisher this is pocketnow.com and this is
the full review of the HTC droid
incredible 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless
let's get to it the droid incredible 4G
LTE packs a lot of hardware into its
body and that's a pretty small body the
device is much smaller and more
importantly it feels much smaller than
some of the super phones that flank it
on store shelves like the Galaxy Nexus
here or the samsung galaxy s3 like its
predecessors the new incredible isn't
trying to be the biggest on the block
but don't let the small size fool you
there's some very capable hardware here
taking a little tour around the device
we've got a four inch super LCD panel at
540 x 960 resolution up front at 275
pixels per inch down below it here HTC's
three capacitive android buttons and up
above below the red painted earpiece a
vga resolution front-facing camera and
there's also a notification LED hiding
behind the glass there on the right side
here is the volume rocker and we can see
that the phone is not going for the
thinnest award either it's pretty Hardy
at eleven point seven millimeters but
because it's got such a small footprint
that thickness actually makes it feel
great in the hand flipping it around to
the back we have this wonderful
asymmetric styling reminiscent of the
first generation incredible we lost some
of that uniqueness in the incredible too
so it's really nice to see the boldness
come back there's the 8 megapixel camera
lens there with its flash alongside and
the 4g LTE and beats branding there as
well as the speakerphone grill very much
like the same component on the resound
over on the left side here there's just
the micro USB port and up top the power
button and the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack we wish the lock button here was on
the side as it would make a lot more
sense with a device of this size
is but obviously that preference is
subjective in all the phone feels really
really great in the hand and it's nice
to carry a phone that doesn't have to
take up your entire pocket when you're
carrying it around on the town and like
we said about the huawei ascend p1 it
almost feels technologically more
advanced because it doesn't need all
that space in the casing to deliver
almost the same user experience the new
incredible isn't going to blow you away
with its specs but it's no slouch either
this phone is powered by a dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 cpu running at
one point two gigahertz that's a little
on the slow side compared to its
contemporaries but still nothing to
sneeze at that's backed up by one gig of
ram and eight gigs of on-board storage
of which for a little over four is user
accessible there is microSD expansion up
to 32 gigs and powering all that a
battery rated at 1,700 milliamp hours
now this is an HTC phone so it's running
a skin on top of Android how does it
feel to revisit sense for on Android Ice
Cream Sandwich in all pretty good we
felt pretty good about sense for on the
HTC One X which we reviewed several
months ago in fact we called it the best
version of the skin yet and that still
holds true here though on this smaller
screen you're going to be dealing with
smaller touch targets which take some
getting used to if you're coming from a
larger phone still HTC does everything
it can to make the experience smooth
providing convenient features like home
screen widgets and their custom
card-based multitasking view and a
pretty convenient lock screen and all of
it runs fairly smoothly we've made our
feelings pretty plain about OEMs
slapping on custom keyboards the stock
ICS keyboard is preferable to most
manufacturers substitutes and that holds
true here but we don't like HTC's
attempt as much as we do some others the
haptic feedback is inconsistent and it
will drop feedback inputs at some points
the keys are a little crowded in
portrait view here as well but it's the
first time in a while we haven't wanted
to immediately replace the keyboard with
a stock ICS build
now it won't work for everyone and if
you're a super fast typer you won't like
it at all but it should serve the
average user just fine overall census
impact on Android is noticeable even
though this is the lightest version of
the sense skin it's still plenty heavy
and it does slow the experience down
slightly but the lag it introduces is at
least consistent and it's predictable
and it's very minor and the conveniences
sense brings with it are worth the
trade-off testing the incredible 4G LTE
in the real world was a distinct
pleasure it's really nice when a phone
strikes the right balance between power
and pocket ability the new Incredible
did that very well we tested it in and
around the Greater Boston area from the
city to the seashore reception was above
average beating out our galaxy nexus for
connectivity in some remote areas like a
far-off beach we were able to average
consistently good data speeds over
verizon's LTE network averaging about 20
megabits down and about 10 up callers
said I sounded loud and clear even over
speakerphone on my end people I spoke to
sounded just fine through the earpiece
the speakerphone was tinny like they all
are but it was loud the new Incredible
might lack the same hardware as the One
X but HTC has brought its full set of
software camera improvements to this
device the unified view finder
multi-shot HDR panorama and fun filters
they're all here and they all work
pretty well HDR tends to deliver
cartoony results that are too bright but
it's handy to have around when you have
a backlit subject or a shot with a wide
variation in light and dark but all that
aside if you're just taking regular old
still shots the new incredibles 8
megapixel camera really does quite a
nice job 1080p video is sharp with quick
white balance and exposure correction
and the sound it captures is great it's
nice to have the option of shooting
slow-mo as well using all these features
will constitute quite a bit of power but
we're happy to report that the
incredible did pretty well in this
regard
not exemplary mind you it took us only
about seven hours of heavy usage to go
from one hundred percent to shut down
but that's heavy use average users
should be able to go a full day if you
can't make it that long you can always
grab a spare battery remember it's
removable so should you get it well if
you're looking for a feature-packed
top-of-the-line jumbo phone then no
that's not what this phone is but if
you're looking for a mid-sized
attractive boldly design smart phone
that doesn't sacrifice too much
performance for Pocket ability the
incredible 4G LTE is definitely worth a
look personally I still have two friends
carrying the original droid incredible
more than two years after its release
and they both still love it that's a
great legacy and it looks like this
newest incredible is living up to it so
even at 149 99 on contract after all
discounts which is a little pricey if
you're shopping verizon wireless for an
LTE Android smartphone I would
definitely rate this 1 strong buy this
