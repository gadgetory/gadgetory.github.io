out there but which was us the best job
at being visual stick around for our
next app store hello everybody I'm home
out of it and welcome to the pocket now
app store pick where we'll be featuring
pulse news mini or pulse for short is
actually an application that's focused
on bringing you the simplicity of a
newsreader with the idea of adding a
little bit more style you can see here
that you'd actually have up to 20
different news feed stacked up in tiles
of imagery or thumbnails of each of the
posts that the editor has been intended
and within each of these you can
actually scroll from right to left and
look at specific different news within
each of the feeds when selecting each of
the feeds you can actually just move up
and down and scroll within the news post
and you also have a reader within the
application but the coolest thing is you
can actually also scroll from right to
left within any of the news post meaning
you could actually start reading one of
them and just move around to another one
once you finish reading that one you can
also share this post with facebook or
twitter email or even Instapaper
within the settings of the application
you can actually drag and drop any of
the feeds from up to bottom depending on
which one is most important to you you
can also search beads there's also a
list of featured feeds in case you're
interested in any other ones that the
application is offering and you can also
connect to google reader in case you
just want to pull stuff from your google
reader already refreshing is actually
very simple all you have to do is hit
the refresh button and the heart icon at
the top actually allows you to tell with
a friend you can actually bump news
within anybody else that carries the
same pulse news reader pulse is
