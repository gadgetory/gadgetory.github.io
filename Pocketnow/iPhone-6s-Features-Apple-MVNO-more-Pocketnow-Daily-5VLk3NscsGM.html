success and mad at ricks rumors claim
that Apple might launch a project by
competitor and sony has just made a
couple of major announcements I'm high
net iveta and the best way to start the
week off is to try without a bandage but
you don't want to see the burns this is
 out daily the official news
today start with Sony as that we've seen
the leaks of the Sony Xperia z5 ultra
and now the n5 and the company has just
made both devices official these are mid
Rangers but Sony's dumping them super
mid Rangers because of their cameras
21.5 megapixel camera at the back match
with a 13 megapixel shooter at the front
for selfies that's crazy on its own we
have the no bezels display these cameras
are actually 4k capable but the specs
are intellectual description even cooler
news or the fact that so many already
begun teasing its Aoife events so we can
expect a hot black ship probably
announced later this year other official
news have nokia and we're talking about
the no different finland by the way the
company has just made it's a selling of
its here services official to german
automaker's like adi BMW and mercedes
which is Daimler which is great news
particularly because these companies
plan to keep the nokia services active
as a separate company and just serve
themselves from the service meaning you
will get here maps on Windows and iOS
and Android going forward and probably
some new platforms let's see what we get
three billion dollars as a transaction
wasn't really that bad I'll talk about
that company that says that thin and
light is everything aka Apple the
company is rumored to make the iphone
success thicker to add the force touch
technology and we've got some CAD
documents and files that show that the
design pretty much proves that it will
but even more interesting is the fact
that we get leaks of the display panel
and that film that protects the display
from the internals has a new cut that
could be for there's a taptic engine or
for such technology let's see exactly
what in this now even hotter news
from Apple have the company apparently
working on its own MVNO and according to
the trusted source the company is very
advanced in negotiations with us Carrie
years and even European carriers so yeah
this is pretty much a project fire
competitor we don't know exactly how
apple plans to differentiate this from
Project five but we should learn more
soon now those Isom cards start making
sense by the way and finally for the
very interesting rumors up the day it
seems that Apple is planning to reinvent
voicemail again remember visual
voicemail was an iphone project back
with the original iphone but apparently
Apple wants to marry Siri with voicemail
make it your true digital assistant by
reading your voicemail messages out in
addition to also allowing you to share
information with specific contacts
through Siri through your voicemail it
all sounds very confusing but it could
be cool but it does lead me to the
question of the day do you use voicemail
late lead even care about it or do you
prefer text messages and all the new
data information and stuff that we have
today in my case I can't remember the
last time that I access my inbox for
voicemail because of that it's a
terrible and cumbersome service so yeah
I'd love for Apple to bring something
new but leave us a comment down below
what do you use friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on fire
