getting a known designed with improved
specification as though not great the LG
g5 is step to finally take a step
towards an aluminum design an Amazon is
going all out for a full week of black
friday I'm hi Mary meta and yes you can
bet that I also missed you guys too this
is pocket out daily the official news
today bigger with Amazon as the company
has clearly taken Black Friday a little
too seriously deals begin on the 20th
and end on the 27 and the list is huge
links in the description for full
details we've got amazon products all
pretty much every computer you can think
up and other cool deals that you should
definitely take a look at and even
though we have been waiting for the sous
made Google Chrome bit you know that
dongle which is an HDMI stickney connect
to your TV to turn it into a full
Chromebook we've been waiting for six
months for this product and it is
finally official and with a good price
tag is actually starting for 15 bucks
less at $85 which is a really good
starting point obviously you'll need to
buy a keyboard and a mouse for this
thing to work but then again it's a
really cool way to get some sort of a
computer for a lot cheaper than some of
the Intel products out there that are
above a hundred dollars and if you're
currently not using google photos you
probably should consider it and
especially if you're currently rocking
any device with 16 gigabytes you're less
of storage especially if it's not
expandable as the company has just
launched an update to Google photos on
Android wear what you'll be getting is a
new feature that will detect the photos
or repeated redundant and will allow you
to delete them from your phone and just
keep them in google photos this is a
really cool feature hopefully it reaches
io as soon as well and given the fact
that sales of the LG g4 were kind of
slow it seems that the company is
reconsidering its design policy for the
g5 we've got trusted sources claiming
that LG is going all out with aluminium
on this design they'll pull some of the
things they've learned from the v10 and
then bringing an all aluminum design on
the g5 we're not exactly sure how early
we will be getting this phone but given
the fact that this was the same
experience with the LG G flex 2 meaning
the phone then really so well
really it could launch earlier than
expected we'll see about that early next
year and finally the hot news today
speaking of products that we're waiting
for early next year is that iphone mini
we've got other trusted sources claiming
that yes it will apparently be either
the same iphone 5s design or extremely
similar and that we're getting boosted
specifications like a better camera but
interesting we were waiting for an a
mind chip on this smartphone then as it
turns out apparently it'll be the 88 as
Apple does want to boost the
specifications of the iphone 5s in a way
but apparently they don't want to make
it better than the iphone success which
makes you wonder and it does lead me to
the question of the day if you're given
the option for a smaller iPhone like
this the iphone many would you choose it
even if you know it has lesser
specifications in the iphone 6s and 6s
plus because in my case no I'm actually
finding the iphone success smaller every
time I use it leave us a comment down
below let us know what you think friends
as always you know the drill if we want
to get the news earlier before this
video is owned make sure you follow was
