component of using a smartphone for many
people yet it's often overlooked in many
reviews we just sort of take it for
granted that because a phone has
speakers and a headphone jack that audio
playback is probably fine
every phone just kind of becomes good or
vaguely in the top five we're working on
this channel to balance more scientific
testing against anecdotal experiences
using software like write mark to
analyze test files and sound Forge to
examine amplifier power we're also
taking a listen with our own ears on a
variety of different headphones and to
the speaker playback to provide a more
well-rounded discussion of smartphone
audio taking a look and a listen to the
main phone's released this year and
allowing for any current phones from the
end of 2015 which are the top players
for the audio files in our audience
here's our top five for the first half
of 2016
number five is a Samsung tie between the
Galaxy Note 5 and the s6 edge+ the
galaxy s7 might be well improved on a
number of key features but headphone and
speaker playback are areas where
samsung's 2015 phablets take the win
neither of these phones excel in any one
specific spot but both are well rounded
performers even-handed EQ fairly low
noise and respectable speaker
performance this all adds up to an
overall enjoyable audio experience
number four the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus
Apple uttered consumers into the modern
era of digital audio and the iPhone
continues a tradition of consistency and
punchy playback while speaker output
might fall mid pack the headphone jack
is paired with one of the more powerful
amps available in a smart phone to our
ears high EQ can sometimes land a bit
shrill and iOS doesn't properly fully
support 24-bit audio playback but the
current 6s and 6s plus are terrific
populist performers for the mp3 crowd
number three the blackberry Prive we
really shouldn't be surprised to see a
business focused device on this list the
privet hedge fund performance though it
leans a touch noisier than the other
entries on this list it makes up for
that slight deficit by adding terrific
front-facing speakers for media and
speaker phone calls the privy us that
even a work device
can be built to include a little play
time number two the LG v10 this beast
just gets so much right no modular
pieces here a supremely high-quality DAC
and amp are built directly into this
monster phablet the v10 has become one
of our favorite headphone performers and
is often used as a high-water mark for
our phone comparisons this phone falls
out of the top spot however for
including the quietest speaker on this
list but you'll never want to listen to
that speaker once you plug in a decent
pair of headphones number one the HTC 10
why have a great speaker or a great
headphone jack when you can have the
total audio package the HTC 10 features
a unique boom sound split speaker
arrangement with a front-facing mid and
high EQ speaker and a bottom firing low
EQ speaker it's not the loudest solution
for alerts but it offers great clarity
and detail for a phone when paired with
truly excellent headphone playback you
get an overall audio experience second
to none and we have a few honorable
mentions in that United States branded
LG g5 s are still unable to utilize the
modular DAC we've been unable to test
where that hardware might rank by
comparison we also need to give a nod to
Sony as that hardware does support high
quality and lossless audio files but we
ran into issues with our previous review
unit and since then have been unable to
keep our hands on one long enough to
properly test record and benchmark or
current zphone we're hoping that will
change with this year's xperia x lineup
lastly it should be mentioned that for
folks looking at the mid-range the
iPhone se packs nearly identical audio
hardware compared with its more
expensive bigger iPhone brothers so
listening to music or podcasts playing
games or watching films what's been your
all-time favorite mobile audio gadget

can chat me up on Twitter and Instagram
as some gadget guy and I will catch you
all on the next video you're still
afraid stop it now I mean it
