review until we could get our hands on
this bad boy here
the Xperia X performance moves us up to
a top-tier Qualcomm 820 chipset and this
now represents the flagship offering
since Sony retired the Xperia Z line of
phones while Sony is streamlining the
hardware and features on the Xperia X
they aren't streamlining the price the
smart phone faces intense camera
competition so let's see if it lives up
to the reputation of sporting a Sony
badge buckle up folks we have a lot of
ground to cover and I'm gonna move
pretty quick first a little housekeeping
the xperia x performance packs a 1 over
2.3 inch 23 megapixel image sensor with
phase detect autofocus and f 2.0
aperture and a 24 millimeter equivalent
field of view there's no Hardware
stabilization but Sony does provide a
software solution called steady shot the
camera max is out at 1080p for video but
we are uploading a UHD video file to
preserve more still photo image
integrity it's also worth noting here
that this camera app defaults to an 8
megapixel resolution for stills the sony
is using some fairly sophisticated pixel
sampling to create better looking images
though you can switch it back to the
full resolution of the sensor and will
note when we're using the 8 or 23
megapixel images now starting off with
exposure this phone uses a matrix style
metering so it doesn't pull exposure
info from where you focus this isn't bad
per se and for the most part this app
will nicely balance your subject against
the background but starting off with a
white flower in daylight just forget
about it in preserving the background we
completely overexposed the subject we
have to walk back the exposure to full
stops in manual mode to rein in these
clipped highlights the auto mode handles
blues and greens wonderfully however
punchy and saturated these are lush
colors to play with and earthy colors
browns are also well captured and warm
while avoiding the trap of pushing too
far into orange territory yellows are
tricky as yellow objects are prone to
over exposing because of the matrix
metering but the JPEGs produced aren't
oversaturated which helps retain detail
and Red's are always tricky to pull
but Sony is one of the better performers
here and delivering a very even-handed
exposure for these blossoms
it's an eye-pleasing color and clip
detail or become some weird magenta
unfortunately there is no raw support
built into the sony camera app nor does
the Xperia fully support the camera API
for third-party camera apps to save RAW
files so we can't properly test dynamic
range here finished JPEGs do deliver
good range between shadows and
highlights so we know sony has fitted
this phone with a very high quality
sensor but only saving JPEGs means we
lose the editing flexibility we enjoy on
other similarly priced phones now those
JPEGs range in size based on resolution
obviously but the eight megapixel stills
will land somewhere around three to five
megabytes per shot while full resolution
photos will land closer to twelve
megabytes per exposure the best quality
video delivered by the Xperia is 1080p
at 60 frames per second which results in
file sizes around 220 megabytes per
minute of video taking a tour around the
camera software for as good as this
sensor is this app is an unfamiliar way
to shoot photos and videos sure it looks
common enough modes are on the left hand
side and shutter button on the right but
the organization for options and
settings requires quite a bit of
memorization do you want to force the
camera to shoot an HDR photo well you
can't just toggle that from the main
auto mode you have to go into manual
mode hit the settings gear and then flip
that switch from the menu speaking of
the manual mode it's not really a manual
mode we can adjust exposure compensation
and again buried in the settings we can
adjust the ISO but there are no options
to control the shutter speed we have
multiple scene options like landscape
night scene pets food party and sports
but almost all of those modes deal in
some way with changing the shutter speed
which you cannot do on your own I can
change the white balance but I can't set
up my own long exposure so there are no
streaking taillight photos for this
review no matter what you do
the app acts as if it knows better than
you do and it gets the shot wrong far
too often to be this controlling the
focusing system on the camera is a
perfect example sony boasts that it's
one of the fastest systems on any phone
which it likely is but controlling when
it focuses is an exercise in frustration
in photos you can tap to set the focus
on an object but pushing the shutter
causes the phone to refocus immediately
before taking the photo the slight
movements from your hands or from your
subject will regularly cause the camera
to miss focus there is no way I can find
to focus during video tapping on the
screen does nothing unless you have
object tracking on and even then the
phone will randomly decide what it wants
to track did you tap in the middle of
the screen nah brah these trees on the
corner of your frame are way cooler this
device just absolutely never wants to be
told what to do it's constantly fighting
you for control and it seems to work
best when you just leave everything on
full auto and never touch the screen
except for when you hit the shutter
button
these focusing issues make macro shots
extremely painful to set up but when you
do land a close-up shot you're treated
to a gorgeous bouquet as objects in your
background blur like soft watercolor
paintings this image sensor can deliver
some really photographic output like
saturation white balance is also
terrifically even-handed the Xperia uses
afternoon light in a really pleasing way
delivering warm images that capture the
moment well and avoid looking too yellow
but we should also mention here that
there is a significant amount of
sharpening applied in post while
finishing off those JPEGs cropping in
close means almost all of your shots
will start to look like comic book
panels the total image is usually quite
pleasant but you don't get much room to
crop in before things start getting
funky now sony does a better job than
most other androids a training in
highlights for HDR photo though often
this just makes shots look kind of dull
as it seems to reduce contrast sometimes
this can be used to help save a shot
from being overexposed though while we
see more petal detail on this flower the
HDR output isn't exact
nice this matrix metering means we're
often starting from a point of
overexposing a subject and it's
exceedingly difficult to recover from
that when we don't get raw files a
panorama stitching is excellent the
phone processes images quickly and in a
busy scene like this we see few errors
and piecing the shot together moving to
the front of the phone DX performance
includes a 1/3 inch 13 megapixel selfie
camera which works well for the most
part we're treated to the same color and
white balance we enjoyed from the main
camera on the back but this sensor
struggles to land a crisp shot in shade
now Sony SteadyShot software
stabilization is available for selfie
videos and it helps take some of the
edge off but your handheld vlogs will
still look kinda jittery now looking at
low-light samples there's no Hardware
stabilization but the larger sensor
seems to soak up light well enough for
reasonable shutter speeds most of our
issues at night had little to do with
holding the phone steady and more to do
with making sure we were focusing on
what we wanted to shoot busy street
scenes proved very distracting to this
phone and it would regularly shift from
the building to a closer car or person
walking around our creepy tunnel shot
also shows that this isn't the sharpest
lens we've ever reviewed on a phone a
shame as we know Sony can make killer
lenses in the experience to deliver one
of the prettiest versions of our creepy
date shot playing with the ugly yellow
security light here and shifting it a
bit more golden again very well handled
white balance even if this is a bit
romantic for such a normally gross scene
and in almost no light the Sony would
focus on this flower only if we never
tried to tap on the screen it would only
grace us with focus if it arrived on
that focus on its own terms it wasn't
going to be told by some lowly human
where to focus so what's the verdict on
video in a word disappointing it's
already a bummer that we max out in
1080p resolution and the lack of
autofocus makes this an extremely
unreliable way to capture moments and
memories but it's also just not very
nice to look at there's a bit of
sharpening applied here too which makes
this output fuzzier
year it was a bit headache-inducing
editing this video review thanks in no
small part to the terrible image
stabilization okay steady shot so we
don't have optical hardware
stabilization but we do get this steady
shot option all of our samples were shot
using steady shot and it's not good
there are no videos over multiple days
of shooting which don't have some kind
of twitch or movement to them even when
bracing the phone against the ground and
comparing footage of steady shot on and
off while walking doesn't seem to show
any differences in providing us smoother
video checking out the Zil this is also
a disappointment the Xperia has a 23
megapixel image sensor but will blow up
an image well beyond the camera's
resolution sticking closer to around
half the total zoom range is a better
way to preserve image integrity
thankfully audio capture is excellent
one of the better performers we've
reviewed recently these mics capture
scenes well and noise filtering doesn't
overly degrade the feel of the scene
now for an exposure test moving from
dark to bright and back the Xperia
handles changing light well it's a
little slow to react for exposure but
when it does shift it's usually a
pleasant enough bloom the white balance
here is really twitchy though we see
fast shifts from bluish tint to warmer
white balance during this pan when the
camera can settle it usually nails the
color temperature but in changing the
light it tends to overreact before
making the right adjustment and
unfortunately the slow-motion video is
bad too this just isn't fun to use at
all compared to some other phones we've
recently reviewed the only positive is
that after finishing a slow-motion video
at least the camera keeps the audio
intact
lastly we should also mention that this
phone runs warm it's not as bad as the
Xperia X which would shut off after
around nine minutes of video indoors
under air conditioning but it's closed
as our X performance recorded for about
13 minutes before shutting the camera
off and we started getting thermal
warnings after five minutes of video
again indoors under air conditioning
outside a ninety degree heat in Southern
California that thermal warning would
sometimes come after twenty seconds of
video and in between each shot we had to
blast the phone with my car's AC to cool
it down enough to get a couple minutes
of footage before throttling us again so
let's wrap this up where does that leave
us with the camera on the sony xperia x
performance what's really frustrating is
how this whole phone is letting down one
of the better image sensors we've tested
this 23 megapixel sensor from sony is
legit but the phone case can't keep it
running cool for longer shoots the
phone's screen is dim and hard to read
in direct sun the lenses mid-pack and
the software is almost arrogant in how
it tries to remove you from the
decision-making process even if we were
to cop out like many other tech bloggers
and say that regular people don't care
about being pro photographers from their
phones and ignored the fact that our
audience is smart enough to follow us on
a deeper examination than only shooting
a handful of mediocre images in full
auto even then we're still not able to
completely trust that this sony would
make good choices for you it feels like
an anachronistic throwback to the ugly
days of point-and-shoot cameras which
would have a dozen scene modes but very
poor basic controls and when we factor
in the price this starts to look dire
for Sony as this year we've seen
incredible bang for buck options from
Apple oneplus and ZTE we've seen HTC
succeed with a much better offering than
they've had in years
LG and Huawei had invent
we different takes on dual sensor phones
and Samsung delivered something truly
unique with the galaxy s7 Sony's brand
still stands as a multimedia and
entertainment juggernaut
but the xperia x performance just
doesn't have the goods to back up that
reputation as always thanks so much for
