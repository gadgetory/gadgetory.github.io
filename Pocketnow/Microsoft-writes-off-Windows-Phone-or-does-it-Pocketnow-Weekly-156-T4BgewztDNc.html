matter how you slice it but that's just
what Microsoft did earlier this week in

but are things really as gloomy as they
seem for Windows Phone we'll talk about
that plus new gadget news from Sony

Dallas Cowboys okay so wait yeah wait a
second so you're in New York which is
well the Buffalo Bills are from yeah

conventional conventions regarding
sports teams because I remember the 90s
these two teams went at each other like
every season for like five years
the Cowboys always want yeah I don't
know I don't know anything about any of
this I myself do not follow soccer but
soccer right that's a football now
bowling is not my game why do I have to
keep telling you yeah so yes Thomas
thank you Lazarus soul song says I have
to question the whole be a part of the
conversation only on a computer bit I'd
like to be comfortable when watching
YouTube videos I don't know is Q&amp;amp;A only
if you're on
pewter I guess so so sorry that's that's
a hangout sir thank ya you get the link
but then on the phone you get the link
but then when you hit it it doesn't give
you an option to oh I see well while
we're on this subject I may you've been
here a couple times so why don't you
tell listeners maybe we have a couple
first-time listeners on the show I don't
know you get to tell people how the hell
to participate in the circus ride of a
podcast from two days to email there's
well there's at least two ways to do it
so tell the listeners exactly how to do
that I'm a you know what the story is
okay also I mean you were typing so you
were automatically muted for some reason
there I know so so uh first of all you
could write as a podcast at
pocketnow.com that is the best way to
contact this obviously our podcast
happens every week and you can also join
the Q&amp;amp;A which is available right now but
podcast at pocketnow.com is probably
like the best way to do it to you know
send us your questions and we usually
try to head lizard or mail at least
three different listener mail options
every single podcast that's right yeah
we've been pretty good at it podcast at
pocketnow.com so yes we don't even does
that better it's cool man no no you were
cured a great Jaime Rivera folks is the
only reason we can have a podcast today
well my man Jules but Jules is reliable
as anything but you know the team
members change up every week and this
week freaking Stephens on vacation Adam
doubters in a car heading to New York
and I'm going to see from the New York
City tomorrow
Hayato is in the same situation I think
there's just everyone who's not
available Joe was working on Adam Lane
we tried desperately to get him on to
talk Windows Phone he's got a big deal
at his day job so and Jaime what
somebody's cleaning up dishes in your
background is that right I'm sorry about
that
territory I understand all right listen
let's stop
Dalli Dalli Lansing or pushed
pussyfooting or whatever the hell you
want to call it we need to get to the
topic of the week and it is not
necessary thanks buddy it's not
necessarily a all smart and giggles so I
will delay it endlessly if I'm allowed
to which I'm not because we have no time
so let's go also we've
three years on the air with this episode
folks so good for good for us but mainly
good for you for choosing choosing a
podcast that you like what I'm trying to
say is thank you for God's sake let's
just move on ready
Thank You Microsoft we had some bad news
out of Microsoft this week as it
announced not just layoffs of 7800
people primarily Nokia people former
Nokia people from the Nokia devices and
services group which microsoft acquired
but also a write down a charge in the
amount of seven point six billion
dollars that the Microsoft's is
essentially signifying Microsoft is
writing off more than actually the value
of the Nokia acquisition was to begin
with which was 7.2 billion he ins and
outs of the business side of that are
sort of opaque to me to it to a degree
but in any sense it is not very good
news you have people in the comments
saying well no this is just
trimming the fat making for a leaner
meaner machine and while some of that is
true just in terms of I mean tech an
overly technical leading of the news
it's really really not very good news
for fans of Windows it's terrible stop
being so nice come on yeah it's it's
it's really really not great just to
give folks if you haven't read cite unit
a bellows memo which is where this news
comes from the cuts will take place
primarily in the company's mobile phone
business as well as there are
restructuring charges of 750 to 850
million dollars on top of the 707 point
six billion dollar right down the
Della's email says the CEO says he's
committed to our first party devices
including phones promising Windows fans
the flagship devices they'll love but
also says that in the longer term
Microsoft devices will spark innovation
create new categories and generate
opportunity for the windows ecosystem
more broadly our a reinvention will be
centered on creating mobility of
experiences across the entire device
family including phones I mean what does
that mean to you it's the same typical
be
that we hereby you know it's something
that was typed by somebody from PR
that's like oh we can't really look bad
it's gonna make us look terrible with
our investors so let's just create false
optimism because we don't want to look
bad in the stock market which just fell
a few days ago that that is what it is I
hate it how can you fire somebody how
couldn't you fire seven thousand eight
hundred people and say we're gonna be
better how can you do that that's like
the most insensitive corporate talk that
was ever designed but sadly every
company does that Microsoft has just
gotten really good at it because it's
fired I mean how many people I mean how
can you say oh we're firing Stephen Elop
which I'm not sure if I'm happy or not
but that was like you know we should
have gone that indication they got rid
of the devices guy Oh what was gonna
happen next and what this is what
happened so yeah that's I like I like
starting with the cynical view over
there twentieth Jules is very helpful
26,000 people over the past year have
been let go under under an Adela's
leadership but I want to say that you
know it's not I don't think tactically
speaking this is this is the most
terrible news let's say this it's
terrible for the people who've been
moving movement let go and and our
thoughts are certainly with them and
we're not in any way trying to make
light of any of that because that's
that's terrible but sometimes in order
to if you if you were in the position
that Microsoft is in which is that
they're being forced to rethink a lot of
their older strategy under Steve Ballmer
sometimes layoffs are often layoffs are
a massive part of that so I wanted to
lay this I want to keep this discussion
focused on mobile though Paul Mitchell
and the chat says why are people so
eager to proclaim the death of Windows
Phone I expect to be a happy Windows
Phone user for years to come and just
don't get all the negativity love the
show yeah if we keep it up yes so I'm
sure he didn't use Windows Mobile and
that's the reason why he made that
comment why cuz because the Windows
Mobile people have been there but been
here before is that we were saying so
I'm gonna say this I used to work for a
company like the first company that I
worked for for eight years was like this
every time they would they would change
a VP or they would change the company's
president or CEO you know it was just
the stupidest thing they would start
firing people like crazy hiring people
like crazy and it just seems
I give if these companies have no clue
what they're doing it's like Microsoft
has got the best talent in the world
when it comes to employment the people
that work there and I cannot believe
that this is like a really interesting
ship without direction it's crazy
I mean how many changes have happened
with Microsoft after a Ballmer's
departure I mean lots but seriously but
the I mean that the changes have
occurred but they I don't think as a
ship without Direction I think it was a
ship with that was trying to go in many
different directions and what Nadella is
doing is actually getting the ship first
of all shedding a lot of the ship and
then getting the remnants to move in one
direction which I think ultimately will
pay off in Microsoft's favor but the
question is how bad how much is it gonna
suck for fans of Windows Phone as a lot
of our listeners are a lot of our
viewers are a lot of our readers are and
as I have been up to version 8.1 and
still don't know how I feel about
Windows 10 on mobile but let's let's
talk about that we've been asked more
and more often on social media folks
whether whether we'll cover Windows
Phone anymore because it's very much
gone to the backburner super we are
still covering device launches we just
reviewed the Lumia 640 and I'm Lane just
reviewed the Lumia 735 for Verizon but
by and large they're not the devices
people want to read about because
they're not flagships so a much smaller
portion of our readers than before are
now asking for Windows coverage and who
can blame them on July 4th the last
Lumia flagship the Lumia 930 turned one
year old there was the last Lumia
flagship class device and if you say
Lumia 830 you can get out because it's a
fine con but it's not a flagship it's
not a fact you know on August 20th it
will have been a full year since the
release of any flagship class Windows
Phone
that's the HTC One m8 for Windows you
couple that with the high profile
banking app departures and other apps
leaving the platform and it's been
obvious for quite some time that Windows
Phone is just not going to achieve the
scale that Microsoft initially wanted
but does that mean that it's necessarily
dead overall I don't think so and that's
not what Nadella seems to be saying in
that and I may you're right buzzword
Laden memo there's so much course
eriously I mean just tell me this yeah
if if a mic of a Microsoft and
previously on okiya with all its
infrastructure was not able to make a
phone platform successful with 7800
people how are they gonna do it without
the people I mean can you imagine us
having to bang all the videos that we
have to do a week plus editorials bliss
news and then slice the team in half
would that be even possible how can that
be even possible you know I don't if we
change if we radically changed our
delivery structure if we radically
changed our tactics which is what we're
looking at here right so I don't know
let's let's see what we've got we've got
I've selected three sort of takes on
this or actually four from from various
sites that I think have got pretty
interesting reads on the situation the
first is from computer world as is from
Greg Kaiser a computer world who
surmises that the Lumia line will be
relegated to a peripheral position the
spot the surface pro 3 now occupies in
comparison to broader personal computing
devices like a google nexus handset so
that's this that's the bit of
speculation we're getting from computer
world windows phones will not disappear
not yet Nadella once again says I'm
committed to our first party devices
including phones and Microsoft certainly
even Nadella says in the short term
they're gonna still keep kicking out
Windows Phone handsets but they've had a
lot in the pipeline already so really
they can just keep churning out what was
in the pipeline without needing any of
those people they just let off but the
interesting question is what's gonna
happen later and even with billions
poured into mobile Kaiser continues
Windows powered just 2.7 percent of the
devices shipped worldwide last year down
from 3.3 percent in 2013
that's an IDC figure but Jan Dawson of
jackdaw research who Kaiser quote says
the timing just doesn't seem right for
abandoning either Microsoft's first
party phone business or Windows Phone as
a whole and here we go back to Newton
Della's email and guys this is the crazy
part hi man do you remember in the New
Delhi email where he says we plan to
narrow our focus to three customer
segments we break them into three
channels yeah which was enterprise right
Phipps and then it was general I think
like lower tiers
yes so it's it's business customers
value-oriented buyers and loyalists
exactly so okay but and I love this
because that confuse the hell and me I'm
like okay wow so you're making it sound
like they're we're just gonna condense
Windows Phone in those three channels
okay but wait a second look at that
again we're gonna make funds for
business customers people who don't want
to spend a lot of money and people who
are Windows fans right what isn't that
sort of what they're already doing
exactly exactly wait a second what's
going on here I'm glad I didn't report
on this because I was like oh my god
house I would I would have trashed the
hell out of them I'm like that's an
Johnson Jan Dawson agrees to eject all
right research once again those are the
customers all smartphone makers
accepting Apple target they're the very
customers Microsoft has itself chased
for years
that's no focus at all Dawson argue so
we're not the only ones confused about
that Jaime so there's that no I think
that again it's just it's really sad
what's going on is really sad again but
the memo is just something that somebody
from PR that has nothing no conscience
on tech wrote down for Nutella and he
approved it that's it I don't know I
wouldn't go that far I wouldn't I
wouldn't go far is it cuz it's not
clueless and Nadella if if there's one
thing we know about sight you know is
that he's very smart he's cunning and I
do think the Microsoft he's building is
far better positioned to succeed then
then bombers Microsoft would have been I
mean that's that's debatable but I I
think that's true but it is frustrating
to get this flowery kind of content list
and corporate buzzwords speak that we
have to sort of sift through and pick
through tell us what the verge made of
all this I made there are the next Tom
Warren of the verge yes so we have Tom
Warren from the verge thing and his
analysis no Telus restructuring will
likely reduce the phone business
confusing numbering schemes and huge
selections of handsets but that wasn't
really clarify what it all means simply
saying that it will be more effective a
more effective phone port portfolio with
better products right I'd like to see
that then he also says Microsoft the
signal to developers that it's okay to
ignore developing directly for Windows
on mobile devices and to support
existing apps across
combine that with some of the changes
that Microsoft
making to the interface and features of
Windows 10 mobile Cortana for iOS
Android and continue to mobile push on
rival platforms and it's easy to
conclude that Windows Phone has a very
few unique capabilities anymore and I do
agree yeah that's that's interesting to
me I mean what do you think about that
about that argument about listen it's
just he's just saying listen I'm you
know I have my platform but my platform
is not successful so I would rather Bank
on what is successful and try to make
money out of something at least some
portion of the market so you know wine
is pretty much saying you know it's it's
he's just again he I think he agrees
with us in the fact that the memo is
just the memo and that you know what how
how are they gonna be more effective and
provide better products without the
infrastructure that's like the biggest
question that's left I mean they they
brought all this expertise from Nokia
you and I were in you remember when we
were in Vegas and that that how do you
call the high roller yeah yeah thing you
remember that everybody that was with us
that when they gave us the Lumia 930
everybody that was with us was from
Finland
they brought a crazy amount of people
from Nokia to build this Microsoft phone
portfolio now they're letting them go I
would have rather they sold the company
they would have sold the mobile division
back to either Nokia or somebody else
you're making a good point there we when
I forgot who ran the headline I'm sorry
I just sprung to mine but back when
Microsoft first announced the
partnership with Nokia not the
acquisition but the exclusive
partnership with Nokia to make Windows
Phone devices someone ran a headline
that says Microsoft buys Nokia for 0
billion dollars and it was a great story
because Microsoft was essentially
getting the cow getting the milk without
having it buy the cow and the arguments
at the time was that it was a very savvy
move to make because Microsoft didn't
have to spend billions of dollars by
nokia nokia was already doing what it
would do anyway in such a situation so
that was very savvy and then of course
later on Microsoft found herself in a
position where it felt forced to buy
Nokia possibly because Nokia was was
very very obviously fidgeting around
with the idea of maybe making an Android
handset and they wanted a force
Microsoft's hand but Dex even
Chadd asks about that silly thought why
did Microsoft take over Nokia and did it
to take one less competition away or did
it to take Nokia having a mobile
platform despite the device I sort of
lost the thread of that but that's a
really good question and the hi may what
do you you have a thought there I don't
know I think that I think that this was
like a very interesting corporate play
it's like Microsoft tried to convince
partners to build Windows phones I'm
talking years ago partners started
building stuff they didn't make any
money and then you know Microsoft
started losing ground for partners so
it's like okay should I'm gonna have to
grab a company and build my own thing is
if Apple can do phones and why can't I
and say okay they start the whole Nokia
thing they cry the company they start
working on that whole thing and I I'm
sure that once they started
renegotiating the Windows 10 mobile
strategy and how things were going
partners would would have been like wait
a second you have the Lumias and why
should we build for you and and such
pretty much what happened with Motorola
Google acquires Motorola and then you
know Android partners started
complaining about the fact that Google
would obviously provide preferences to
Motorola and so it makes sense to me the
whole Nexus scheme that Jules was saying
that it could be that Microsoft is
probably just
relegating their whole Lumia approach to
make it more of a nexus in order to make
partners happy the problem is where are
the partners you know when are we gonna
see products right let's uh this is this
that whole Microsoft Nokia story is
fascinating going forever and one of the
best steaks I've seen on it is from
strategery from Ben Thompson
which I got this content from a
subscription emailed update so I'm not
gonna share it all verbatim because you
should actually subscribe to strategy if
you want this kind of analysis because
it's really good but moving forward Ben
says Nadella and Microsoft will focus on
the cloud and office productivity this
is speculation focus on the cloud and
office and productivity or the areas
where Microsoft has potential for growth
let Windows work to earn back the trust
of enterprises to get the cash flow back
up and keep a small hardware operation
that will enable Microsoft to maintain
expertise and connections in China in
the hopes of developing what comes next
such as hololens
and then he goes on to say let me be
clear Windows Phone is effectively dead
a couple models a year notwithstanding
Microsoft's mobile future is apps and
cloud backends for iOS and Android
along with continued emphasis on
Microsoft's traditional enterprise
strengths so there you go that's this is
that that's a that's a pretty stark
prediction of just Windows Phones and
and its really if it was just some guy
dotnet I wouldn't be quoting him the
time out and has written some of the
best analysis of Microsoft I think of
the great years and it's a lot of what
he said has come true when the Nokia
acquisition was first announced he wrote
a great piece talking about how it made
no sense and it wouldn't work out at all
and well what do you know yeah wouldn't
went down seven point six billion
dollars is right it didn't go well at
all let me let me ask you do you think
that Microsoft is trying to turn into
the next IBM uh you know I think HP
tried to try to do that no it's
important to remember Microsoft has
always been a software company so are
you asking that that what you they
trying to trying to shift their focus to
mostly enterprise is that we were asking
I don't know so we remember IBM they had
the ThinkPad and they had their their
lineup of products and at some point
they were like okay it's too so the
problem with building hardware is your
operating ratio is much higher than
building software obviously you don't
need to build anything when it comes to
software it's pretty much non tangible
it only requires Talent and so what IBM
expensive is expensive yes but again you
don't have the fixed cost of building
something that's tangible that you can't
sell the good thing about software is
it's not you're not gonna be left with
five hundred thousand phones in a
warehouse that you weren't able to sell
and so it made all the sense in the
world at some point for IBM to be like
wait a second let's move away from
hardware let's focus on software we have
all these patents and we can drop our
operating ratio significantly and
obviously not make as much you know you
know not make as much money but make
more profit out of the money that we're
making and so it seems that that's what
HP tried to do and then it pulled back
but it seems that Microsoft is like wait
a second we are a software company at
the core
that's the way we were built that bomber
had this crazy idea of making this
company of devices in hardware company
and it didn't work so why don't we go
back to our roots and that's probably
what Nadella
proposed when you know when he was
offered or probably applied for the job
and this is what Microsoft said they
would want and obviously hey if you're
looking at profit margins building
software is a lot more profitable than
again building hardware yeah it just
really tough to make money in hardware I
think that absolutely and you need only
to look to Android 2 to see the truth of
that ending on a somewhat higher note
this is from the wind super site of
course Paul Roth's windows focused web
site but this was not Paul throughout
this was rod Trent writing an article
entitled the Windows Phone isn't dead
it's changing it was the other side of
the coin according to reports Microsoft
will manufacture just six devices per
year the types of models that will be
produced are unclear but I can only
assume that we'll see new hardware
released in stages throughout the year
with two large screens two mid-range and
two low-end devices all running Windows
10 mobile targeted toward types of
people with specific preferences and
that boils down to the society Adela's
narrowed focus to three customer
segments what do you think about the
likelihood of that I mean you think that
that seems reasonable to expect for the
first for the next two years at least it
depends I mean like Jules as Jules makes
a really cool comment right now on our
group chat where he's saying yeah but
there's software in hardwood the problem
is the software that Microsoft built for
mobile hasn't been appealing to
customers it is a very interesting
strategy the problem is what happens
when your product is not able to sell on
its own even in your own hardware we're
liking every set everything sounds
beautiful on paper but the problem is
are is it is their software enough to
gain the mindshare that they're looking
for if they've spent so much so many
years in the back you know they've spent
so many years as an underdog already
yeah and that's why the the the opining
about Microsoft buildings say like
aspirational Windows Phone devices you
know the Google Nexus style devices the
Microsoft Surface phone maybe it's all
very compelling to me as a window
phone you know as an erstwhile Windows
Phone champion as someone who does want
to see the platform succeed because I'd
like the interface I like many things
about it but it doesn't strike me as I
mean if I'm Microsoft why am I going to
do that I'm gonna build a Google Nexus
style Windows Phone device to motivate
OMS to come back on into the Windows
Phone boat assuming their dissolution
which I think they are but if you only
it reached a high of you know three
something percent worldwide and you're
now at 2.7 percent in falling and no one
is no one who knows anything about this
business is really convinced that you
can make you can beat iOS or Android why
would you do that and I guess meeting
iOS Android is not really necessary you
don't need to do that you a Palazzo that
you can exist as a existent profit as a
small segment of the market but the
ecosystem problem persists and it's not
gonna get any better
you're just gonna stay in this vicious
circle exactly away after this exactly I
think that again Microsoft was just I
think that the company just doesn't want
to show that it it it itself considers
it a failure they consider that they
failed and you know they're just not
trying to show that obviously the
problem is when they have a button
though I'm to forgive me I'm sorry
however what they did they just wrote
off the whole Nokia acquisition Oh
straight up you're like yeah this was
that didn't work out you know I
understand but I get I guess what I'm
saying am this is the problem with these
public companies the problem of these
public companies is that they make
strategic moves to make themselves look
good in front of investors so why do you
fire people why don't you keep the
talent and try to you know restructure
and lose a little money and figure out a
way to do it right well because
investors will not like it and that's
gonna drop their stock and that's just
gonna throw everything off the table and
you know that's again III would I wish I
didn't have to mention Apple but this is
one of the things that I like about
Apple I mean Apple has had cases like
the Apple TV or so many other products
where they failed that but the company
is making so much money for investors
and other products that even if they
failed in these things they're not
firing people they're not restructuring
things and killing their
they keep trying they keep it there and
Microsoft seems to want to make people
think that they're gonna do that they're
gonna continue trying but then two years
from now they're just gonna let it die
off they're just gonna let let all the
bus kill it and let it die off Apple of
course has the luxury of sitting on a
mountain of money
thanks to their their iPhone and we're
talking about a company that file from
that was 21 days from filing from
bankruptcy 15 years ago yeah which is
and you know I'm a that's a really good
way to end up I think anything can
happen in this business we you know iOS
and Android are established players in
the mobile space they dominate the
mobile space and they seem to be sitting
on top of mountains of money that are
that are just insurmountable but
anything can happen given enough time
and I think what we've what I believe
going forward is that I do think Windows
Phone is Microsoft just doesn't doesn't
care about it to the degree that they
used to because they used to want to
make it the platform that would that
would do battle with the big guys I
don't think they want to do that anymore
but I also don't think it's going away
in the short term or in the long term
because if you're a software company you
just can't ignore mobile and I don't
think them they're not ignoring mobile
anyway they're still gonna build apps as
Ben Thompson said they're still gonna
build apps for other platforms and a lot
of companies regular good amount of
money doing that but I don't think if
you have your own desktop software and
your own tablet software which they're
betting on Windows 10 is what that's
going to be their their future you know
chariot yeah I don't think you can
ignore smaller screens I don't think you
can not play in smart phones well if you
think about it I mean how many companies
five years ago decided that they were
gonna leave mobile and then out of the
blue one company an underdog ends up
building the iPhone and now it
represents sixty percent of their income
I mean if a political is because of the
iPhone that it's just that I mean the
iPads on the Klein the Mac is on was on
the climb this quarter the iPods are on
the client Apple is only making well
they're making money out of everything
but even making the most money by far
out of the iPhone I mean if if imagine
this if the iPhone was a business on its
own it would be bigger than Microsoft
and Google
find it should act crazy it's that crazy
and so I mean any other CEO that sees
apples success with the iPhone would be
stupid if he said oh we're gonna move
away from mobile that's not the story
everybody's actually jumping back in the
problem is nobody's been able to figure
it out and it's really hard to stop the
momentum that Apple already started
that's the problem and of course it was
really hard back in the 80s to to - in -
to get past or excuse me in the 90s to
get past the momentum the Microsoft had
so we will see yeah Jules is reminding
us that it's 40 past the hour we got to
get we gotta move on but just to close
up on some with some user comments in
the live feed you said it says Richard
Fila Microsoft is a software company
acquiring Nokia was totally off vision
and always smelt of desperation I think
Mandela is wise to the fact that
perception is everything in the consumer
market thanks for that Richard that was
a it was a good comment appreciate
really good Arjen PC throwback review of
Nokia n9 in memory of Nokia and Lumia I
think that would be a lot of fun Irish
and PC we if we can get a hold of Nokia
if anyone wants to send us an m9 which
I'm happy to send back after we complete
the throwback review that's fine
otherwise we'll buy one and Jules Jules
he said it's 40 past the hour and then
you're continuing in the chat alright
the way he handled it was all right well
hold on we can't talk about that Jules
we have to move you're the one who wants
us to move on Jules no more chat do you
guys even care about Windows Phone if we
get no 1030 I know for me personally
nokia was the only reason why I cared if
they do not continue the camera
boundary-pushing of Nokia I'm not going
to buy one that's from gosh be Shh you
preach man I think I know a lot of
people who still carry the 10 20 because
it's one of the best cameras you can get
our own Adam Lang does like if you want
to crack up I just ordered one on eBay a
10 20 yeah no kidding good for you yeah
I mean it's it's one of those things
were it's like ok crap these things are
gonna become collectibles but forget
about the collectible thing you just
can't ignore the fact that nobody does
cameras like nokia I mean or did
no doubt yeah um sorry I there's a lot
of stuff that we will get to in quite a
second but then all right fine mod mod
calm our very sponsors are in the chat
that's wonderful which would you prefer
to exist a Windows Phone future or Star
Trek communicator that's me
you know what mod that should have been
a tough spot we should have had a tough
spot segment for that very question mod
is of course referring to the Bluetooth
communicator that we've announced this
week from wah the wand company which i
pre-ordered 10 minutes after it went on
sale and and how many did you order by
the way I wanted to do more than one but
it's a buck so I'm not you know but
listen we're gonna be talking about that
a lot we don't have time today because I
got a lot time I go at some point so
we're gonna get back to that thanks mod
thanks for your for your continued
support
Yolo users says I can send you my n9
it's almost brand new get in touch with
me Michael at pocketnow.com I love you
guys by the way Yolo user so you aren't
the best please we'll work that out
we'll give you a shout out in the
throwback and it'll be a lot of fun for
everybody in the interim guys we've got
to move off Microsoft I know it's the
big news of the week but we've got to
handle the news real quick before we go
as I say it's gonna be a tight podcast
so Jules sound the news Bell if you
would not ready you kill me that is
awesome
thank you very much Jules we got stuff
from oneplus blackberry Amazon Motorola
Sony and Apple holy crap there's a lot
coming up not a lot to say in the
Windows Phone camp outside the major
news of the week but there is something
coming apparently leaked by Evan Blass a
Windows Phones selfie phone into that
it's got a front firing flash and it is
going to be a Lumia we think what does
what else do we know about this sucker
it is no that's pretty much it just that
just is gonna have a front firing flash
but then no no design specifics this is
it and let me just ask you this Michael
because you handled the desire I I mean
this the fact that there is a flash in
the front really make a selfie phone a
good selfie phone
is it it does help I was surprised at
how much it helps I think an ultra pixel
is in I think an ultra pixel camera in
the front makes a little bit more sense
hey Hyman is this gonna be a Lumia
definitely or just a Windows Phone Lumia
according to from what I understood it
was a Lumia really because I'm not
seeing that in our story lonely where
what are you saying no well you have a
good point but but apparently the
sources or you know Evan he doesn't
really provide sources but to my
understanding it was gonna be a Lumia
all right EV League says he teases
possible upcoming Lumia with
front-facing a flash there but is it
trying to go I'm sorry I'm reading yeah
this is great radio I know but I'm
reading a blast Evan bless his feed and
I'm not seeing a specific reference that
it is Lumia but that's because he's
retweeting a lot of pizza stuff and then
and then Blackberry because I can't see
anyway if it's not the reason I get all
weird about this is that if it's not a
Lumia it is possibly an H it could be a
Windows version of the HTC Desire
I am I totally off-base or does that
seem rebound no it doesn't make sense
because they see of course did the One
m8 so hmm that's interesting anyway I
guess we will have to see like once
again we recently reviewed the Lumia 735
which Adam Lane titled the original
selfie phone reviews check it out but in
other news we've talked about Windows
Phone enough in other news blackberry
silently registers a very telling domain
name I mean you want to tell us the
story real quick okay so there's a very
interesting development obviously we've
been talking about two Blackberry phones
that will run Android and we've been
covering that but out of the blue this
other company that's owned by blackberry
ended up registering the domain Android
secure comm so we started speculating
over is this going to be the approach
that Blackberry is going to try to do
with Android are they gonna try to
launch another black phone or should I
say one black phone competitor and just
take over Android and make it more
secure and that's going to be their
differentiation fact
but other news that happened yesterday
have blackberry and Google partnering
over bringing Android to the enterprise
and making it a more secure platform for
the enterprise and combining BES 12 with
you know Android and you know all the
benefits in security that came with
lollipop so right now it's it's a little
ambiguous we're not really sure the site
is up now hi Mei have you been to it yet
no not yet
all right so yesterday it was just a
landing page or the other day now it is
a it is what we're showing on the video
feed right now it is a spy okay bring
Iceland to work yes so that's it that's
it bringing closely together to set new
standards and enterprise mobile security
for organizations deploying Android
device so that that's what I reported
yesterday that's what I reported
yesterday that blackberry and Google had
made a partnership the idea is to marry
BES 12 with a you know Android lollipop
and you know all the security benefits
and the idea is really to give
Enterprise more teeth with Android allow
you know enterprise companies to be able
to lock down phones or lock down
features so that users can't you know
users can't use them for whatever they
want right it's it's pretty much for
deployment
you know it's go ahead no I was just
thinking of the parallels on this it was
like wow blackberries yet another
company that's then was really great at
hardware then the hardware went away and
now are trying to to just operate as a
software company is okay but that's
that's the point that I'm about to make
right now okay about think about this
Michael yeah what phone is the President
of the United States currently using
he's got a blackberry still okay so
here's the thing blackberry is extremely
famous for security if the the task
government agencies in the world use
blackberry there's a purpose for that
and so here's the thing how is
blackberry going to sell you an Android
phone if they don't figure out a way to
elevate Android security I think that
this is like a good pre move before
launching an Android phone I think this
is like a really smart move it's like
okay we're showing you what we can do
for Android and now this is our new
phone that's running Android but it's a
blackberry proprietor
very sort of platform sort of like black
phone hmm no interesting that's where I
think this was I should mention that
this said Jules thank you for being on
top of this this was a shout out this
was a shout out this was the story was
broken by Jimmy westenberg of Android
authority a longtime friend of the
pocket met weekly so kudos for the for
the news makin news man
not know I mean what would I have
preferred on this tab I would have
preferred to see the BlackBerry Venice
because I think that's gonna be a really
compelling device for Android users if
it lives up the potential but I guess we
can talk about that on another show
because we got to talk about another
phone right now it is the Amazon fire
phone you guys have one right I mean
everyone has a fire phone right I know
you know yeah come on Trey to do Jules
has everybody has a fire phone who
doesn't have one well if you don't have
one right now you can buy one yeah you
can always buy one but now you can buy
one for the price it should but should
have been to begin with this thing
started life at I think $4.99 full
retail which was asinine it was $1.99 on
contract with AT&amp;amp;T which was again
asinine it was eventually we were
rapidly reduced in price to two hundred
unlock than 190 now Amazon is selling it
for $160 now that's crazy I've seen
other people I think Dan Seifert of the
verge was saying listen no one should
try to justify the purchase of a fire
phone it's a bad idea but okay Amazon
Prime comes with the fire phone and
Prime gets you things like free shipping
and a free two-day shipping of other
stuff so if you were to if you were
already gonna buy Amazon Prime and you
were gonna spend $100 on that because it
costs $100 for the year if you're
spending enough if you if you're willing
to spend another $60 you get a smart
phone with Amazon Prime you know with
your Amazon Prime membership and that's
just $60 more and as I said in my review
and I think I'm the only guy in the
world who ever said it it's not a bad
phone it's kind of fun to use really yes
are you using it
that's because Amazon wouldn't send us
one I got one through AT&amp;amp;T and was about
release on the embargo times everybody
else in the Amazon specifically told
AT&amp;amp;T no you can't let them do that only
the people we select are going to be in
on the embargo
so my up to them that was frankly and
cover your ears everyone you Amazon
I think about that because that's some
debt of some top-level
especially when you're coming to market
with a product that was received as
poorly as this nevertheless
I found that phone a lot of fun to use
and I don't I don't think it deserves
all the crap it got even though it was
priced really poorly to begin I guess
that level of arrogance and then a
payoff didn't it yes I guess some just
look at the screen again and it's 449
again at amazon.com so I don't know who
knows if you want a fire phone nobody
wants a fire phone so I'm not talking
anyone let's move on could the Moto X
sport and moto G nuevo be new Motorola's
in the works I'm really confused about
these news because obviously we've been
covering the leaks of the Moto X and the
Moto G the next generations but then out
of the blue we've got specifications for
apparently this this came out from a
Chilean carrier and you have to remember
that Motorola launches products under
different monitors outside of the United
States and apologized by the way yeah so
apparently so we've got specs for the
Moto X port which will allegedly have a
5.2 inch display 16 megapixel rear
camera our front firing 5 megapixel
shooter and we've got a quad-core 1.5
gigahertz processor that is not
confirmed what type of processor it is
sorry about that
then the Moto G level mobile because
that's the correct thing yeah no is a
pieman screen 13 megapixel rear camera 5
not 5 megapixel front firing shooter 1.4
gigahertz quad-core CPU and the reason
why why we're confused is how are these
specs any different to the ones we've
already covered from the 2013 Moto X and
Moto e I don't know I mean you know they
don't seem all that different every
megapixel did the Moto G I think had a
didn't have an 8 megapixel rear camera
on the 2014 variant I don't know
maybe the same on I don't know yeah no
the spectra not all that different but I
like that the sport seems to be a
ruggedized version of the Moto X I think
that's a I think that could be a good a
good decision for from Motorola to make
because it already has a large subset of
customers need a phone that will perform
well under duress like the Droid turbo
that I just after the buzzed
now tell me something what is not rugged
about them with the current Moto X you
know it says it's black from other ones
so it's not splash proof well it is but
the weather we run but no it's you're
right if splash proof it is you can drop
it probably without break and busting it
up too much I mean I dropped my original
Moto X a bunch and like but it's not
it's not specifically rated it doesn't
have IP certification that's not milspec
they don't sell it as a phone that you
can drop kick around the place and I
think they they're traditionally very
strong in that segment their home next
I'll line up back in the day was just
rugged oh I've got one right here check
it out oh where am I where's my oh my
god yeah so guys I'm holding on if
you're just listening the audio version
this is a Motorola I 580 from 2007 it is
the next I'll support of the days like a
ban look at that gigantic scream junk
master yeah that bezel listen and the
bezel is diamond plate so you know it's
rough but I real like jokes aside this
is uh this was a really really peaceful
beefy phone and I bought I bought one
for my parents and they had them for
years and they are tough on their phones
so no you know Motorola has a long it's
a big audience that is used to to these
products and I think the Moto X is one
of their most impressive phones I've
ever made a sport version would be great
I want to say something before I forget
I I apologize I was a little crass
before I didn't I don't think I was
totally necessary for me to go off and
I'm something like that and I apologize
this wasn't because I'm it just it just
it wasn't I try to stay classy and that
wasn't very classy so I apologize people
this isn't about Amazon sending us
review stuff by the way cuz obviously we
don't care I just feel like I was sort
of a little bit of childish just then so
I'm sorry to anybody I may have offended
with that but let's uh let's
from the motox stuff which I never want
to move on from but because I already
know that I'm gonna talk about it all
day we should but before let me in a
yeah yeah okay okay tell us good no do
you know you tell us about all right
Motorola's model 51:37 has hit the FCC
approval desk it is measuring one
hundred fifty three point six
millimeters by seventy five point three
millimeters which normally we wouldn't
go into talking about but it is
important because it appears to be
larger than what we're what we're
talking about
normally it might put it in the same
class as the five point five inch model
code name and Kinsey we've been talking
about for Verizon this is Steven Schenk
reporting on this but this time there's
no sign of compatibility with Verizon's
networks instead we get t-mobile
eighteen t LTE support and sprint LTE
support but no apparent CDMA to match
the older technology of that network so
what the eff is going on of these
incomplete documents is this a project
five phone perhaps I'm thinking it like
last year was the year of the prime
phones this year is gonna be the year of
plus phones could it be the Motorola is
working on a plus 4x plus yeah why not
I mean if they came up with the Nexus
and by the way they did sell that you
remember that we looked for that Nexus 6
but the Motorola version we looked for
it at the Qualcomm booth when we were at
CES remember yes the Moto X plus which
which the back of which a reader booth
model used to modify his Nexus 6 and D
anodized the aluminum for a way
different look which was awesome
exactly yeah yeah yeah so I don't know I
mean it's not tracking the 800 we know
there's a chance of microSD expansion
too so this is this is gonna be
interesting to have an interesting year
for Motorola here's hoping they don't
have their press event in Chicago while
all of us are at Aoife again that will
be very annoying please don't do that
again motorola please don't hi May tell
us about the oneplus 2 we know a lot
about it and we've got a hurry but we
got to talk about it well the thing is
of
one plus has been doing the job for us
like fully first of all they've been
leaking absolutely everything they've
been teasing the phone the phone were
pretty much what a couple of two weeks
away from the launch and they've been
teasing that it's got 4 gigs of LD
lpddr4 ram which is the fastest ram you
can buy right now yeah it's
then the the team was on way Bose asks
which is the no reddit AMA there are an
AMA recently and they were like oh okay
we're gonna confirm it's got a 3300
milliamp hour battery that's another
thing they teased and then because there
is so much speculation over the price
tag of the phone the company CEO just
came on Google+ and was like okay I am
confirming that this phone is going to
cost less than $450 so you know 149 then
yeah that's what I'm guessing because
that's what you come out and say and so
it's funny cuz it's funny because like
two weeks ago the guy the same guy was
like okay it's gonna cost more than
three more than 300 what was the number
of 333 dollars something crazy like that
yes now we know the threshold which is
less than $450 right right so you know
oneplus has been I mean I've really
gotta hand it to this company I mean
they know how to keep people on the edge
of their seats like seriously they come
up with news every single day of a phone
that nobody's yet seen they've managed
to do an amazing job and not getting the
phone leaked and yet they keep teasing
everything and they keep creating that
momentum and I mean that's how how can
you have an underdog company that didn't
exist two years ago become so successful
with the oneplus one even with their
terrible sales tactics and now they're
doing it again with the oneplus 2 and by
the way rumours from yesterday are that
we are going to get an invite system
again no no no didn't they promise that
the invites were gone apparently they
won't be again it's it's speculation you
know of all the of all the things to
beat up on one plus four with their
tone-deaf marketing all that kind of
stuff earlier last year I don't I think
the invite system got a bad rap I think
you only do that if you you have scale
problems you have a you have ability to
meet demand problems and you you need to
find a creative way to solve
that and the creative way to do it and
it drums up crest in the process I never
thought that was a bad idea and even I
even say that now I'm on the invite
waitlist for project 5 because Google
doesn't care that we exist
so I'm sitting here waiting for a
project by invite like some regular
Schmo and freaking I don't mind it
because I know that they're doing it so
that they can hone it they're doing it
they don't want thousands of people on
that network because they have to do
engineering troubleshooting on it and
they're doing a stagger relief like get
that folks and what do you get in
exchange for your several weeks of
waiting what are you getting on one plus
you're getting one of the best phones
you can get for a very low price tag so
freaking you know deal with it invites
invites in what has to happen sorry but
maybe they won't be invited to knows I
don't know what's up let's see Sony will
never ever sell its smartphone business
says Sony yeah I'm not gonna pronounce
the guys the CEOs name I always fumble
with it every time where it see that's
mobile president and CEO Hiroki tataki
that's how yeah yeah but I know but
every time that they present him on CES
they you know it's funny yes fast right
no they have another name you know I
it's not until right now that I was in
China now you know I was talking to the
Opel and I learned that everybody you
know they decide on a u.s. name and they
use it whenever they have to yeah you
know I uh oh and you know that makes
sense um anyway there was an interview
from Arabian business which was
reblogged by the Xperia blog where
tataki addresses the rumors you know
selling off the business and saying no
he's not yeah according to him and you
know we've got to hand it to Sony I mean
truly the Xperia lineup has really not
has not been as popular as it should be
I feel that they deserve more popularity
up dude my Xperia Z L which is in a
drawer downstairs and it's three years
old just got lollipop like a week I mean
which other company does that I feel
that you know Sony has been doing an
amazing job over the last three years
and giving you more bang for your buck
when you buy a Sony phone and they've
done so with software they've done an
amazing job this is like erase
the old Sony Ericsson days where that
was like terrible you would buy a phone
that was threatening Android donut we
were we were Romeo days already yeah so
one of the things that he said was that
you know the selling the bio lineup
could have clearly built that indication
they were gonna do that but they admit
that that wasn't such a good idea and
they are definitely not gonna do it with
the smartphone lineup which is great
that is great news and I loved here as
somebody was asking me for a tablet
recommendation on Twitter the other day
and I'd stop to think about it cuz I
don't think about tablets all that often
these days but I was like oh man if I
was gonna get a tablet today tablet the
Sony Xperia z3 tablet compact so I get
that right tablet or whatever I think
you forgot like one or two names there
but yeah I'd get that one because their
tablets are freaking gorgeous and then
somebody just asked me to read to after
the buzz the z3 compact which I have not
played with yet and I really want to so
absolutely I will try to do that if we
can get a hold of one from one of our
suppliers I mean absolutely they make
great phones the lazarus soul song again
and the Chad Sony can own the mid-range
market if they just release a yearly
compact phone word up and I do wish they
would they would take take some interest
in the US market but we are still
expecting that z4z or whatever z4v
for Verizon Wireless soon I mean hey
come to United States and use it on
Verizon Wireless the good thing as
Verizon phones are unlocked by default
which is great but anyways I'm in tell
us wrap it up for us they end up the
news block with the Apple watch sales
estimates okay so was so market watch so
this is funny
clearly Apple is either not meeting
demand or or I don't know what problems
are having with the Apple watch but this
is like the first time that they have a
product that they don't stand on stage
on a keynote and say we sold 10 million
Apple watches right and so market watch
is already claiming that the sales of
the Apple watch are on decline
apparently for the first time ever Apple
is not selling more than 10,000 units a
day which is funny it was like 10,000
units that's a lot of watches but you
know it's it's apparently this they're
an
time low and they're there wondering if
it has to do with the fact that Apple
hasn't met the man or it's because a lot
of people have their Apple watch on eBay
because it's not as hot as they were
expecting it to be but yeah it seems
that that that is the current status of
the Apple watch we III can't wait for
this quarter to end for Apple to have to
be forced to tell us how many Apple
watches they've sold I know everybody
wants to know yeah no doubt
Mayer excuse me I'm sorry Jules made the
point that they were sourcing a slice
for some of those figures we just want
to have that covered I was looking
somebody was doing some comparative
sales of Apple watch versus pebble time
data recently and I sort of forgot who
that was I wanted to look it up for
context the massively successful pebble
time Kickstarter had 80,000 backers
estimates of Apple watch sales were
greater than 1 million on day one that's
from them and yeah what 1.5 million
something like that on the first day
right and yeah I don't know I don't know
this is a massive debate but it's
interesting to see I don't know what how
these figures are being generated but I
wouldn't be surprised at that but watch
sales we're slowing down now i sat with
some extended family recently ago I
don't get to see very often and a lot of
them were two of them so a lot of them
at the table at the time had Apple
watches and I was surprised to hear them
people asked them do you like your Apple
watch why do you have it
etc and I was surprised to hear these
Apple watch owning cousins of mine
explain why they had the Apple watch in
exactly the same way I always explain
smart watches and end on the point that
you know if you don't own one it's
really hard to make you understand why
you might want one and they're talking
my smart watches in general so I think
it's a continues to be a tough sell I
think until in a critical mass of people
is wearing wearables all the time you're
not going to get the kind of
word-of-mouth like oh god it'll change
your life because it will but not enough
people have realized that yet
no and I don't think it's gonna happen
anytime soon as long as the technology
doesn't evolve and the technology
doesn't need to evolve you're right I
talks sometimes like these are perfect
products
they really needed honing you are
absolutely correct but yeah anyway I may
listen I am forced to I know you have to
go I can do listener mail by myself so
do you want to do them now let's do it
let's do it all right cool Jules it's
time for listener mail it's beyond time
for listener mail in fact let's do it
brother
so the first email is from Greg bond
which is a really cool name by the way
he says who writes in and says I use my
HTC one max for media consumption
perfect size portable good screen size
that's awesome this is the first person
in a while who's written in with an HTC
one max I'll aging with a screen crack
it's time to replace need six to 6.5
inches and two front facing speakers
with good volume and quality as the max
please help regards Greg from Sweden
extra non important info as I know you
like it short I'm 66 years old and had a
real mobile phone in my car in 66 with a
rotary dial getting a dial tone lifting
the receiver Wow
working just around Stockholm in two
other cities if you called and told an
operator where you were going he first
pc was an msi 88 he built from a kit in
the 70s still super geek listen your
podcast every week that's awesome
Greg thanks so cool to have you here
seriously that's awesome oh my god well
that's cool Greg um I my recommend you
know what my recommendation for a one
max replacement is gonna be given those
criteria mm-hmm Nexus 6 or what got it
man yeah the Nexus 6 is absolutely the
best phone for these uh for those
criteria the speakers are louder than on
the one max they do not I don't think
they kick out quite as high quality a
sound but that's because the HTC One
family gives you the best two audio
quality there is on a speakerphone the
Nexus 6 is loud it's clear it's got a
six inch display so it doesn't have the
best camera around but then neither did
the one Max and it's got a big ol
battery too I actually I ended up liking
your your after the buzz on the Nexus 6
so much that I was like huh
like one did you want to buy a white one
like I want really liked it I've got it
right here it's helping me run the show
as it usually does Thank You AT&amp;amp;T for
the extended loan for forgetting to ask
for it back so far and letting us review
it every few months
so yeah the Nexus 6 I can't think of
anything better for our friend Greg
truly I mean listeners were probably
right in if you'd leave a comment on the
video thread if Greg wants to see it on
the post at pocketnow.com a another
recommendation at all my this sound is
the kicker
you know it's he needs front-facing
speakers and not a lot of phablets have
front-facing speakers but I know him
I've got a mind block there's another
phablet out there with front firing
speakers I don't know which well well
the Xperia z4 which is not a family
that's got from firing speakers yeah the
Sony's right they do yeah yeah so if if
for some reason Greg you can't get the
next section you don't want it the Sony
devices was from ferry speakership
they're quiet speakers but they they
tend to be oh yeah I made that old one
they won't Taylor had for a bit busy
the z3 ultra yeah it's the ultra but
it's too old and I'm trying to remember
like the camera was terrible it was like
a really before the Sun II figured out
their camera software yeah yes it's it's
real it's a really bad phone up to the
point where it's no longer a Google Play
edition thing right okay all right let's
move on let's move that was a Greg thank
you for your email that was really cool
do you want to read jebadiah's email
Jaime I let me get the third one you get
this okay
hey guys I heard Michael say that pebble
doesn't do turn-by-turn oh this is a
correction everybody this isn't a
question so this is important yeah I
said pebble didn't do turn-by-turn
navigation which doesn't out of the box
but he I just had to write in since
jebadiah because it's one of my three
favorite and most used pebble features
I've been using the pebble app nav me
for well over a year now and my og
pebble it works great on every Android
phone I've tried it with it launches on
the pebble when navigation is started
from the phone so I don't need to think
about launching it myself and it shows
the next turn and vibrates before the
earng I highly recommend you give it a
try guys this is my first time writing
into the podcast I think I did okay yes
you did keep up the good work and live
long and prosper sincerely the GA bye
awesome awesome awesome awesome and he
has another recommendation for pebble
users seeking apps music boss yeah I
talked about that in the review so thank
you jebediah for the correction excuse
me and as the newspapers say pocket now
regrets the error I'm at number three I
need to polish up on my on my Android
knowledge I guess as well feedback is
great man it's well appreciated it's a
high pocket now team this is got a Luis
Moreau is that the way you pronounce
yeah buddy you got it you know okay hi
froggy now team let's keep this short as
possible what extra features do you use
on your Android phones if your daily
drivers have them or how do and how do
you use them like for example I our
ports NFC heart rate sensors barcode
scanners etc what would you put an NFC
tag on your business card to send people
your contact information stuff like that
I finally gun started using NFC on
iphone it's opens up a ton of
possibilities except that everybody uses
iPhones uh-huh so I can't use NFC
together then scaring them into thinking
I've taken their money carlos website
maker everything fixer love - lovely to
meet you dude yeah what do you use
because I think that the only thing that
I use and that's the reason why I
usually like galaxy notes are the IR
port for the you know controlling the TV
I'm really use NFC so Jules uses NFC for
purchasing but there aren't many
terminals still even in our for looking
boston offices or they don't work yeah I
don't I use the I reports when I'm
reviewing phones to to see if they work
and yeah they work and the peel remote
okay there it is networks and you know
if I lose my remote on an occasion I'll
do this but I really don't do NFC very
often I'll use NFC to like do the tap
the phones together to to do the Android
backup when you get a
but that always screws up the new
Android phone somehow so I ended up
having a flexion like a fact you know
though I don't use that cute QR codes I
use almost every day because we use
AirDroid here in the office to
wirelessly transfer files and you need
to scan the QR code on the screen to get
it to connect but aside from that I
don't use QR codes because no I wouldn't
put it on my business cards because you
know it'll happen
hey scan my business card you'll get all
my content oh I don't have a QR reader
installed on my phone okay you want to
install it yeah just give me a second to
install it oh I'm from the United States
and we're both in Germany and this is
gonna take four hours on the you know
what here does it take when you just
take my business card I have five
million of them anyway oh you're right
I'll just take this card and then I
would say point being the experience is
so cumbersome never mind
word up indeed ya know um and what are
the other things about your Billy
barcode scanner that's at NFC is um
really I wish I used I wish I used the
more for that stuff I guess I guess the
only thing and I'm gonna admit it the
only thing that I actually use that's
extra are a Moga controller to play
Nintendo old Super Nintendo games on my
phone and that's really like like the
only extra thing that I use and I really
highly recommend it I love I love the
experience of playing the game with it
with it with an external controller
something that iPhones really suck at
yeah and and so that's like one of the
main extras that I use like if I'm gonna
play I want to controller
well ooh shiny there's something I'm
forgetting I'm gonna kick myself
afterwards but you know I use smart
watches like I'm like the one of the
only SmartWatch champions so I feel like
I already I get a pass for saying no on
this right we both are
yes there you go all right cool I think
we gotta go cuz I promise to let you go
about a half hour ago
and there's Q&amp;amp;A is here just the most up
voted ones
boki smokey toki asks almost 1 million
subscribers that is true on our youtube
channel we're about to hit 1 million
subscribers do you guys have something
planned to do as a celebration we do we
haven't talked about the Bible we do
we're gonna roll that
it's gonna be cool it's gonna be great
so it's thanks for baby it's amazing
right Michael
it is incredible it's just awesome I
absolutely love it and I'm somewhere
between one many many multipliers of
that in monthly viewership too so thank
you to all of you millions who helped us
do this stuff fire phone is dead all
caps for sin as well yeah yeah we got
there we just need to get rid of the
inventory that's the problem
move it move it out of the warehouse and
make room for more some more drone UPS
drones they're building best camera on
any non Lumia device I'm assuming you
mean so far I gotta say the s6 is really
far up there along with the iPhone 6 and
the LG g4 if you were to press me on
that matter yeah I wish I would have
received that LG g4 I asked for no but
you can get one of them we got we got a
couple hanging around you can get one
thank you really appreciate it I love
doing this on the podcast I get free
phones after that yeah honestly I feel
that you know whatever Samsung has done
after the note 4 is just amazing like I
despise using the node edge particularly
after lollipop but I put up with it
because of the camera you put up with
what because of the camera I put up with
the phone you know the Note edge I put
up with all the know - oh God yeah ok
yeah no you write the note 4 had a
really good camera too but the s6 camera
is so much faster that I feel like it's
just worlds and worlds better right and
that that is the problem with the node
lineup but it's extremely slow extremely
slow after lollipop it's just stupid I'm
gonna I want to end the show on bends of
fly benzo fly why not let Sony make the
next generation Nexus phone for the sake
of helping a partner and giving a chance
to others plus they make good hardware
beautiful hardware that will also force
Sony to market their phones in the US
more properly I think that would be like
the best Nexus phone ever no doubt that
would be awesome
I don't think you're gonna find any
disagreements like if you would ask me
right now if I
have the cash what fun would I buy it
would be an experience period I mean big
big I love the high Wisconsin okay no
chair please do share which one would
you buy if I had them just to buy a
phone right now you know for myself okay
so I'm leaving and I'm not gonna marry
oh I'm very happy with my motox even
though it's getting old I would probably
wait for the new motor ex but it would
probably the Nexus 6 on project five but
that's a carrier thing you know I'm
special Jaime I can't answer okay but
but wait a second I mean you're a camera
guy come on you love this no job no
doubt but I walked around a lot with the
droid turbo join the after the buzz on
that and I found that even in
challenging situations I could usually
get the shot I wanted it was good enough
and the Nexus 6 is very similar
performance there send something like
wrong again did it is he are you okay
are we there am i there am I here are
you there is anyone around anywhere no
one knows about anything I'm amazed I
miss frozen is drool frozen Chad Hymas
got okay so it's us and the two hundred
sixty two of the rest of you okay well I
had to go anyway
so we're gonna end the podcast but
Kelvin Alonso asks Michael after using
time is back Michael after using the
turbo again would you recommend for a
Moto X for a Verizon customer aesthetics
aside as a turbo user I must know
Kelvin no I I would if you need to beat
up your phone and if you really need a
quad HD screen for some reason and it
might last a little longer than the Moto
X but considering how big of a missed
opportunity was in terms of battery life
I would I would say that feel them both
in your hand first and then determine if
you want the higher resolution of the
Droid turbos camera there's also a
processor difference which doesn't
really do anything so it doesn't matter
I you have to hold them both you have to
use them both that's what I would say
brother so I'm sorry that's not a very
useful answer but it's the best one I
can give you I was really sad I mean how
could you have such a large battery and
have it be so terrible yeah and from
what phone arenas testing materials who
use it as the Droid Maxx to or towards
Super Max with yeah yeah the Droid Maxx
that's the name yeah no no sorry the
Motorola Maxx
Rolla masks y'know max that's the name
from what I hear it's really good if you
don't get a vice version so the Verizon
bloatware is very likely the cause and I
was gonna ask you this why don't you pop
a t-mobile SIM on that thing and give it
a try er AT&amp;amp;T CU let's see what happens
it's an unlocked phone already
it does your grabbing of it that's the
cool thing about right but it won't do
anything about the Verizon below where
it's still sitting on there and I can't
flash the thing it's a review device you
know I don't know the bloatware is there
but obviously the only thing I'm not
sure you're gonna get is LTE
that's the only thing but give it a try
let's check the man support I'm not sure
watch the after the buzz of it folks if
you don't know we're talking about watch
the after the buzz video watch our
videos consume our content thanks
