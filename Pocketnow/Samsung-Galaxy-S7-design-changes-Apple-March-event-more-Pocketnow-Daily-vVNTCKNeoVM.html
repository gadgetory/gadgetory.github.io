some design changes on the Galaxy s7
wicked solid dates of when to expect
apples next event and if you wanted a
Turing phone well you could still cancel
your order if you want I'm hi meri behna
and what I'm doing that is do is repeat
hype every bit of multiple times just to
mess with you this is parking out daily
say I won't remember that touring phone
the device that made a lot of headlines
because it was supposed to be
uncrackable it was supposed to launch in
December and had this very cool design
running Android well you could scratch
that out the company's a CEO just
confirmed that the device is actually
going to launch an April and for those
of you that order you will be happy to
know that it no longer runs Android
apparently it is running sailfish OS and
while we don't have anything against
sailfish OS it's just rather interesting
that the you change operating systems
just so quickly right other very
interesting headlines that they have to
do with Apple as we hear that that event
for March is actually going to happen on
March 15 and the reason why this event
is important is because if you remember
apparently we're getting the ipad air
three in addition to the apple watch too
and the iphone mini all devices which
are rather important even though it
seems that the by select the Apple watch
aren't really launching until further in
the year we will keep you posted as we
learn more and speaking of Apple and the
Apple watch it seems that the company
has to pay a lawsuit because well a
customer had a crack display as much is
a week with in buying the product and
even though we wonder exactly what
happened afterwards because usually what
you do is just take the Apple watch or
iPad or iPhone to an apple store and
usually they'll give you a fee for you
to replace it seems it no he went over
with the lawsuit and Apple has to pay it
because apparently due to the
specifications and the legalities the
display was not supposed to crack in the
way did links in description read more
about it but then again all this guys
getting is another Apple watch and his
legal fees being paid for house we'll
just fall out over to Samsung as we get
to hear more news of the galaxy s7
mainly because the company's website
leaks everything they confirm that there
is a galaxy s7 edge that there will be
some code changes in the way that the
displays
edge works and we even hear information
about Android M so it seems that even
though we doubt they will hear anything
about Android M before Google i/o it
seems that Samsung is already beginning
to prepare for that hopefully we'll get
something like that around 2017 by the
way Samsung does things and finally the
very hot news is they have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy s7 again if you
thought that the changes only had to do
with the curved back it seems that there
is more apparently the camera bump is
going to get smaller a lot smaller it's
not going to be flush but it will change
though this is not the first time that
this happens if you didn't know it on
the galaxy note 5 the camera bump is
actually half as small as compared to
every other samsung galaxy now in the
case of the galaxy note 5 has to do with
the fact that the phone is thicker than
every other phone so we wonder exactly
if that means that the galaxy s7 will be
thicker or if they just figured out new
technology then again it leads me to the
question of the day whenever you buy a
phone is a large camera bump a
deal-breaker for you in my case it
depends on the camera bump I hate the
one on the iPhone but then in the case
of the samsung one I don't mind it that
much leave us a comment down below we
look to know your opinion friends as
