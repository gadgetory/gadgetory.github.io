Samsung Galaxy fold after a lot of hype
a teaser and then MWC 2019 where we
couldn't even hold the product today we
finally can reporting from New York City
I'm home it'll be better with pocket now
along with Adam Lane let's go hands-on
according to Samsung consumers want a
large screen but they don't necessarily
want to carry a large device either in
their purse or their pocket the solution
a new form factor that we've actually
been hearing rumors about for the last
couple of years the company calls this
meaningful innovation an entire new
mobile experience and there are three
key pillars design experience and
performance from a design standpoint it
definitely shows this is literally a
sandwich of aluminium and glass and
probably one of the coolest devices that
I've seen and held hands down I wish I
could tell you that it feels like a
phone but it actually doesn't it's as if
the intent is not for it to follow
current phone trends when closed I mean
all you have to do is hold it beside the
galaxy as ten are pretty much any other
smartphone to notice it is significantly
taller and thicker than the galaxy s 10
and also narrower feeding into the
concept that it's actually a device that
you can hold in one hand when closed at
the front we have a 4.6 inch Super
AMOLED display at 720p resolution with
some of the tallest bezels you've ever
seen but it seems that the idea here is
for you not to spend so much time on it
more like the secondary display on old
clamshell phones it really invites you
to open it and the magnets holding both
sides create this awesome
feel that leads to a 7.3 inch Infinity
flex display resolution is a weird 1536
521 52 but the PPI is great at around
362 samsung claims that this is the
thinnest display ever fit into a mobile
product all while retaining the dynamic
AMOLED technology that we've praised on
the galaxy s 10 it's made of an advanced
composite polymer layer that solves the
main challenge which is to allow it to
fold and yes there is a crease it is
noticeable you can feel it
but with foldables I think this is just
part of the territory
moving on to performance we have the
latest some greatest welcome snapdragon
855 along with 12 gigabytes of RAM 512
gigs of storage
a43 80 milliamp hour battery that's
actually split in two but works as one
wireless power share and 4g LTE
connectivity yes No
Jesus yet and no it doesn't have
expandable storage or water resistance I
guess this is par for the course for
device this new there are a total of six
cameras yeah I said six on the outside
we have a 10 megapixel selfie shooter on
the inside we have yet another 10
megapixel selfie camera but this one is
assisted by an 8 megapixel depth sensor
and then we have the primary cameras
that are at the back with a 16 megapixel
ultra wide a 12 megapixel primary with
variable aperture and the 12 megapixel
telephoto that's capable of 2 X optical
zoom
now obviously on a device like this the
experience is everything
Samsung claims to have partner with
Amazon Google Microsoft slack what's
happened pretty much every app consumers
use most in order to tailor the Galaxy
fold to shine as you use it we're
talking about Samsung's one UI on top of
Android 9pi but everything designed for
foldable one of my favorite features is
app continuity the fact that you can
start using the outer display ask for
directions on Google Maps and then open
the device to get a better view on the
larger canvas you could also use multi
active window meaning up to 3
applications working simultaneously
which explains the whole need for 12
gigs of ram swipe from the right to get
access to more applications and you can
swap their order around to your
convenience depending on which
application you want on the larger
portion of the canvas ensure there will
be applications that won't be supported
as of yet so floating windows will be
the solution for them and yes I know
you're also wondering about the keyboard
and even that adapts to whatever screen
orientation you pick and works like a
split window for you to not be reaching
out for keys between one side or the
other so yes this is the Galaxy fold
obviously this is just her hands-on
experience we've barely had a couple of
hours with a device so far color options
are space silver cosmos black and
different variations of astro blue
pre-orders begin today with availability
on April 26 and the price yeah you
guessed it nineteen hundred and eighty
dollars I know this is crazy expensive
but I'm really curious as to what your
opinion is do you think that this device
given all of its innovation is worth
all this money or not I'm gonna say that
there's really only one way to find out
and yes we have a review unit to prove
it in our labs already so expect
coverage on our full experience as soon
as tomorrow actually our preliminary
unboxing is already live on Instagram so
be sure you follow us on social media it
subscribe to both of our channels
english and spanish for more videos like
this one you can follow me on twitter
i'm an underscore to be that on
instagram at high many data please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw i'm hiya metairie that i think
so much for watching we'll see you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
