you remember way back when you were a
kid and when you wanted to make a phone
call you actually had to pick up a phone
that have like a cord on it that plugged
into a wall well some of you might
others had antennas that you had to pull
out we're really long well today we've
got cellular phones and smart phones
smart phones of course are smarter than
normal phones and today what I would
like to show you as a feature of some of
the higher-end smartphones and that's
video calling or to be more precise
video chat so let's go take a look at
video chat using kik or a quick
depending on how you want to pronounce
it between the mytouch 4G on t-mobile's
hspa+ 4g network and the sprint epic 4g
on sprint's 4g network let's see how it
looks alright so over here we have the
tmobile mytouch 4G connected to their
hspa+ network which should get me near
4G speeds they haven't deployed it fully
in my location so we're just going to
have to trust that it's a little bit
better if you're in a more populated
area where they've done a full rollout
of 4G over here we've got the sprint
samsung epic 4g and unfortunately 4g
where i am kind of rolls in and out so
right now we're connected to 3g we'll
see what it's like now why do I mention
3g 4g well first and foremost these
phones can do video calling or video
chat is a better way to to say it over
well not Wi-Fi and and I'm kind of doing
that I'm kind of mentioning that just to
to poke it Apple a little bit because on
their devices you can only video chat
over Wi-Fi not over cellular data which
is a kind of self-defeating if you ask
me but it's a carrier thing if your
carrier doesn't have the bandwidth to be
able to support video calling which
obviously takes more bandwidth than just
straight audio calling well they're not
going to want that to happen I don't
know if that's the case with AT&amp;amp;T or not
but
for the purpose of this video will say
that it is and if we've got a
representative from AT&amp;amp;T watching this
video who would like to clarify that
we've got comments down below I'm glad
to receive that feedback but let's take
a look first and foremost each one of
these phones comes with a custom version
of qik or quick and I'm going to make
fun of it by saying it both ways for the
purpose of this video you know because I
do that kind of stuff now custom
versions that's kind of goofy in my
opinion you can go out to the market you
can download this app just search for
qik and you can download it use it on
your phone now it's not going to be all
that useful if you don't have a front
facing camera both of these phones have
a front facing camera t-mobile g2 on the
other hand doesn't have a front facing
camera that doesn't mean that you can't
use it it just means that when you're
looking at the person you're talking to
on the screen they're going to be
looking at whatever is on the back side
of your phone in this case this nice
high density polyethylene tabletop if
you're walking down the street they're
going to be looking at the person's back
or head or whatever is walking in front
of you so keep that in mind that's not
all that this can do of course you can
do video chat you can also record and
share your life as it happens now I've
mentioned this app particularly in the
past if you're ever involved in any kind
of a police or security issue or any
place that you might want to get a
record of what's going on this app is
great because once you have it installed
and setup you can stream that
information to their website in real
time so that if something were to happen
say your phone was confiscated as
evidence and I don't know maybe the data
got erased or destroyed I know that
would never happen in today's society
but if it did you still have what
happened available to you out on the
website so very nice to have an off-site
copy there and it's there just to help
keep people more honest don't use this
in any way shape or form that might be
illegal or inappropriate or unethical
there's my disclaimer alright next is
you've got video mail or messages which
are basically the same thing it's a
voicemail with video on it doesn't get
much simpler than that and then of
course my videos and video gallery which
again same
it's what you've already recorded so you
can watch it later stream back down to
your phone or played from the local copy
but we're not interested in any of that
what we're interested in is video chat
now back to what I said these are both
custom versions of the app what's
unfortunate is when I went out to the
market to update these apps there were
updates for both of them when i updated
the qik app for the sprint samsung epic
4g it broke I don't know what else to
say force closes every time you try and
record a video so update fail luckily I
was able to uninstall the update and go
back to the version that came pretty
installed on the phone and everything
was working again so there was an hour
or so of my life in troubleshooting that
I hope the guy's a kick are listening to
and will fix over here on the mytouch 4G
the version that came on the phone I
never got to test because it came up and
said hey there's an update the update
just happens to work so okay enough with
the blabber let's get right to the
videos alright in a previous video I
showed you a little bit about or I
talked a little bit about how this was
probably one of the most frustrating
apps that i have ever ever ever used and
I have spent literally hours and hours
trying to get this to work my contacts
have a whole bunch of people in them and
apparently nobody in my contacts is on
the the kick network and I don't know
why because I know several of them are
which is kind of frustrating second
thing that's frustrating is this is a
separate app that I have to launch so I
have to go in and try and i have to say
i want to video chat with someone to be
able to video chat with someone which is
kind of lame instead i'd like to open my
dialer dial somebody's number and have
it ask me hey do you want a video or do
you want to audio and have it do the
call that way we're not quite there yet
but hopefully soon so what I've done is
I have Jessica she's my daughter she's
in the other room again on the sprint
network and I'm over here on the
t-mobile network and we're going to go
ahead and make this call now to do that
I had to type in her username and that
was kind of a pain in the neck because
you might not know their username you
might just know their phone number all
right so I'm gonna go ahead and connect
to my daughter who is used
my wife's account her name is Jessica
let's see how that works go to recent
calls and tap that and you can hear it
ringing on my end and there it is you
can see me and the camera I've been the
upper left and Jessica can you hear me
now here's the funny thing that Jessica
and I just learned on the mytouch 4G it
automatically broadcast video and audio
over to the receiving end is that right
Jessica okay now the funny thing is over
on the the epic 4g version of the same
app it's still it's still kick or quick
or however you pronounce it you have to
press and hold this little button see
that button down there in the corner
which looks a little bit different it
says talk on it and if you want to talk
to the other person on the other side
using the epic 4g you have to press and
hold that and release it just like a
walkie talkie which is kind of goofy so
Jessica I'm noticing can you hold the
camera back a little bit more so we can
see you and you know maybe smile a
little bit see there you go now how old
are you Jessica Jessica is almost 10
years old everybody so in a really nice
girl make sure you're nice in the
comments what do you think about video
calling is is this something that's
going to replace say you know picking up
a phone and calling your friends yes she
says it definitely is going to do that I
don't think that that this app is quite
ready for mainstream I mean you and I
have been trying to figure this out the
same app on two different phones for for
how long has it been now
so we've been working for half an hour
to try and get this phone to connect to
your phone and you and I have been
practicing in the same room together so
kind of difficult we're going to try one
other thing and this is a competing app
that doesn't come pre-installed on
either phone but we're going to see how
it works for both usability and an audio
and video quality so we're going to go
ahead and do that here in just a minute
so Jessica thank you very much i'm going
to go ahead and let you go and I will
see you in just a little bit alright so
let's try it with another video calling
app in this case it is fring I don't
really like their interface it looks not
complete I've complained about that
before but you know it's kind of a kind
of unique and novel in this case we can
do a text talk which is like instant
messaging the phone call which is void
and then a video chat so we'll go ahead
and do video and it's dialing her up
right now has kind of a funny ringtone
and look there's Jessica Jessica can you
hear me yes she can hear me now this is
over hspa+ on my end but ah the the
sprint 4G on her end it just isn't
working right so it's just 3g now you'll
notice over here I've got a little kind
of a white window now Jessica can you
see me sorta you can just see the table
right so that's unfortunate what what
fring has is they've got a platform that
kind of works I mean it dials it
connects it behaves just like you'd
expect it to but the mytouch 4G isn't
supported yet so the front-facing camera
doesn't work now and I'm sure they'll
have an update for it hopefully Susan
later but Jessica can you see me now and
yes she can now see me but I can't see
her so we're going to have to keep
flipping the phone around like this and
that
kind of awkward so home run for fring
getting this call to work just right off
the bat something that the kick couldn't
do but unfortunately they don't have the
front facing camera working so I'm still
no positive solution in that point but
in any event Jessica thank you very much
for being my spokesmodel for the day
alright so there we go it's still a
little bit in its infancy this whole
video calling thing but you can very
clearly see how not to do it and that's
what this kick video chat it doesn't
work well at all I don't know if that's
because we're going across different
networks or there are different versions
of the app or what I don't really know
why it seems like a relatively simple
concept to employ but they haven't done
it and they failed miserably at least in
my experience if your experience has
been better I would love to hear about
it in the comments down below fring on
the other hand frame looks like it's
just a kind of a sketchy thing that it's
not done that it's not complete but the
calls are made now we can do voice calls
really easily a little bit of a delay
obviously I'm going void across my
cellular data network to her cellular
data networking down to her phone and
the faster that your network is the
faster that that's going to be in most
cases this is where latency really comes
into play and where t-mobile's got kind
of a home run here Sprint's latency is
in the hundreds of milliseconds
sometimes three and four hundred whereas
t-mobile's is just you know about a
hundred ninety eighty somewhere in that
range but still kind of goofy that they
can't get video chat or video calling
right and that's really what this phone
is advertised to do please prove me
wrong you guys have better experiences
let me know but showing off what chat
can and can't do I'm Joe for
