now we are here in London with Nokia and
Nokia's ari's here thank you very much
for joining us thank you he's going to
answer one question for us which is an
important question on the minds of many
consumers we got the Lumia 920 on AT&amp;amp;T
the 925 hopefully on tmobile soon and
the 928 on verizon why is the 925 better
than the 920 order 928 we know it's a
newer phone but in the minds of the
consumers they have the same 8.7
megapixel carl zeiss lens camera why is
re the 925 better than the 920 and the
928 well actually the 929 25 and 928 are
all from the same imaging pedigree so
they are all based on the same design
principles but with 925 we actually
listened our customers quite a bit and
what they would like to have my table
life to improve and based on that
feedback they actually added an
additional and so we redesigned the lens
system for 925 and that
sole purpose of that extra lens is to
give even better daylight shoppers but
actually daylight Chavez panel online
shop so we got six lenses on the 925
versus five lenses on the 920 on the 928
exactly yes but also so that's the hard
way to know so we have a lot of new
stuff under the bonnet so the software
has gone through quite a bit of tweaks
so the most obvious ones for example
that people's boosted up the iso from
800 to 3200 so that is to f-stop f-stops
meaning of course more times more light
so we know in nokia me know in rocket
camera team that low light is important
feature people want to take pictures in
a low light so we keep on pushing the
boundaries how well that can be so even
though they have the same camera sensor
the same products iceland's the 925 with
the additional six lengths will produce
better images under both low light and
normal circumstances yes that is now
latest and greatest
how do you thank you very much for your
time thank you very much my pleasure my
pleasure this was Anton from
pocketnow.com coming to you from London
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
