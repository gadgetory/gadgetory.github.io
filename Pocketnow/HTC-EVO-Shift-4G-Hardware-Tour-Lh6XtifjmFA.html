pocket comm and this is the hardware
tour of the HTC EVO shift running on
Sprint's 4G WiMAX network so let's get
started okay so the first thing you
probably noticed this is three point six
inch WVGA resolution screen that's also
glass and capacitive multi-touch that's
480 resolution across and 800 resolution
up on the bottom we have these four
capacitive buttons they're outlined in a
chrome accent I don't know if you can
see that too well on the camera but
there you go you can see it kind of like
that if I move the light in the
reflection on the outside of the screen
on the glass we had this chrome bezel
unfortunately it's a little bit sharp I
don't know if you remember that HD two's
a camera on the back of the device it
was a little bit sharp it's kind of like
that the entire thing is somewhat of a
blue accent color I don't know if you
can see it on the camera but it's blue
it's not actually black it's a blue hue
to it and the outside of this is metal
on the top we have a light sensor along
with a speaker grille for our headset we
have an LED notification light
underneath the speaker grille on the top
we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
our power standby button which is kind
of weird it's not exactly on the top
it's more of on an angle to the back
sort of so if I go to this side I have
the volume rocker and I also have the
microUSB port which is a little bit
different than most devices that I've
seen because it kind of goes in
backwards and I can show you that here
if I have a micro USB as you can see the
flat part goes up whereas the curved
part goes down so it's a little bit
different it's kind of like the HD 2 I
don't know if you've ever use that phone
but it's just like that
on the bottom we have our microphone and
on this side we don't really have
anything on the back we have a 5
megapixel camera with a LED and our
speakerphone and we also have a sprint
4G emblem I'm going to take off the
battery cover and we'll go to look at
that CD micro SD card slot and all that
great stuff it's a little bit tricky to
get the battery cover off it's also in
this rubberized material which makes it
easy to hold in hand let's see here I
hopefully don't break it
ok there we go so we have a 1500
milliamp hour battery underneath the
battery we have our micro SD card slot
which is capable of holding up to 32
gigabytes of space so it comes with a 2
gigabyte card and it's time weird you
have to put it back to pull it out you
have to pull this little tab right here
and put it back in you have to push it
in and then push the tab down it locks
in place so you just put the battery
back on this device is running at 800
megahertz and it does have 512 megabytes
of RAM the radios on the device are a
CDMA variant along with D Bluetooth 2.1
the Wi-Fi b/g/n
and it also has a built-in FM radio if
we slide out the device which I've
already done we have a Google mo on the
back and we have a full QWERTY keyboard
with a function button that allows us to
access these other keys so it's a four
row keyboard and I have to tell you it
is rather tricky to use it doesn't work
very well because the buttons are so
flat it doesn't work that great I find
myself actually using the on-screen
keyboard just because this one is so
tedious to use so this has been the
hardware tour of the HTC EVO shift 4G on
Sprint's wife max 4G network the device
does cost around a hundred and forty
nine dollars with the two-year contract
if you like our videos make sure you
give us a thumbs up and also leave some
comments down below in case you missed
the unboxing I'll post a link right
about here and stay tuned for the
software tour coming up next thanks for
