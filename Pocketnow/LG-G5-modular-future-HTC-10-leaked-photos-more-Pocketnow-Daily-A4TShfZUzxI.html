design plays a big role some of the
latest HTC 10 least show us color
variants and believe it or not sharp
just got acquired and not necessarily by
a competitor I'm hi I'm Adam iveta and
know my voice is not going to get any
sexier I just hate grabbing colds in
this crazy weather this is pocket out
daily
the official news today begin with sharp
the company that was famous for TVs
years ago still is they built that
really cool Sharp Aquos smartphone that
had no bezels and they also built a ton
of apple displays well the company just
got acquired by none other than Fox
konnen for a fraction of the company's
worth Foxconn now owns sixty-six percent
of a controlling stake over the company
for only 88 y en per share which is a
crazy considering how sharp was so
famous years ago sharp is actually 104
years old hopefully this means a good
future for the company or whatever's
left of it now let's talk about the
iphone SE as even though we don't have
official figures over how many devices
were sold analysts are already talking
about 3.5 million units being sold in
China alone over the first three days a
staggering number compared to what Apple
is used to doing but for a launch of
this magnitude it kind of makes a lot of
sense in addition to that analysts are
already talking about how many Android
users actually switch to the iphone just
because of the S II the number is
actually rather large in addition to how
many men made that factor whether we
thought that was actually going to be
something completely different LIXIL
description should read more about what
the analysts are already predicting and
speaking of Apple the company kind of
hit it out of the park with its new
partnerships just like you see the
surface in the NFL Samsung tablets over
in the NBA now you'll be able to see
iPad pros at major league baseball and
this marks a really interesting move for
Apple as we do remember the NFL you know
teams going crazy over that move to the
surface people wanted iPads for reasons
we don't really understand but then
again hey the MLB is actually going to
have a better opportunity to test iPads
out and hopefully that grows mindshare
for apple tablets that haven't
necessarily been selling great lately
and for those of you that are waiting
for the HTC 10 yes we r to the power of
10 event is happening very soon we've
seen League renders of color options but
today we finally see photos of these
color options live we see the space gray
color option in addition to the great
aluminum standard and they both look
good we just cannot wait to see what
variants these pertain to and we also
hope that these color options are not
exclusive to any carrier and finally the
very hot lips that they have to do with
LG's future design plans the company's
lead designer was in an interview he
confirmed that modular smartphones are
the future for the company we're not
exactly sure if the current existing
modules will work on future LG phones
but that would make a lot of sense just
like lenses on cameras can be used on
future models for a certain period of
time it makes a lot of sense not exactly
sure if that's what the company plans to
do but it does lead me to the question
of the day is the modular design of the
LG g5 the reason you're buying the phone
in my case I'll admit it's something
cool to have for me right now for me
it's really about that wide angle lens
camera at the back but leave us a
comment down below it could be the case
for you friends you know the way it goes
