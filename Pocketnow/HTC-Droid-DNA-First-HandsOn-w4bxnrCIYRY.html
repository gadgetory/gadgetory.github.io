pocketnow.com here at the verizon
wireless an HTC announcement event in
new york city for the droid DNA we're
checking out this new five-inch droid
device so HTC's big buzzword in pushing
the droid DNA is ultimate ultimate
device basically it's an americanized
butterfly J that we caught sight of a
few weeks back it's a massive one and
like some earlier droid products from
HTC it's grills and accents are designed
to evoke the feel of a muscle car but it
still feels quite slim in the hand HTC
says the screen is what really sets the
droid DNA apart in the industry and its
really a focus for the entire phone is a
5-inch super lcd3 display HTC says it's
the first phone in the world capable of
full 1080p HD video features a 440 PPI
density which is far better than any
phone tablet or TV on the markets as HTC
they claim its fifty percent brighter
than the galaxy s3 it is protected by
Gorilla Glass 2 which is curved and
which blends into the bezel and the
company has also improved the viewing
angle so you can see a clear image if
you're looking at it eighty degrees on
and they compare that to the galaxy s3
which is only 30 degrees they say
everyone will have a great view
especially in a group if you're trying
to share a YouTube video or a web page
or anything like that that's the idea
the cameras were also a huge focus at
today's presentation HTC tells us the
optics are the same 8 megapixel sensor
that F 2 dot 0 lends an image chip as on
the One X but software image handling
has been improved their support for
better face detection smile capture HD
are a whole new mode called sightseeing
countdown timer photo gallery
enhancements album support and the usual
continuous shooting simultaneous video
and photos and the like the front-facing
camera looks like it's taking some cues
from the front facing camera on the HTC
windows 8x it also has an f2 lens a 2.1
megapixel sensor and it's capable of
1080p video it is an 88 degrees ultra
wide-angle lens triple the area of other
cameras out there on the front side and
of course there's the Beats Audio
technology with the twin amplifiers one
for headphones and one for the speaker
again something we saw on the Windows
Phone 8x but it's nice to see it make
the leap to this droid super
fun we can have a whole lot more on the
droid DNA from verizon and HTC in the
days and weeks ahead stay tuned to
pocket now for that follow us at pocket
now tweets follow me michael fisher at
captain two phones and thanks for
watching we'll see you next time
