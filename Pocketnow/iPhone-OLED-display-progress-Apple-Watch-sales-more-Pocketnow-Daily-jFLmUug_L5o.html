rocking an OLED display cases are now
being considered as a solution for
modular smartphones and it seems that
the Apple watch actually sold more than
analysts expected I'm hi Mary vana and
as we prefer 4 2016 let's reflect on all
the partying we did this year and repeat
this is parking out daily official news
today have everything to do with modular
phones but in a smarter way as a company
called I blades just launched an
indiegogo campaign where they are trying
to get some money in order to give you a
modular case that will provide added
functionality like extra storage extra
battery and obviously another bevy of
options that should be considered once
they reach their thirty thousand dollar
commitment but hey it is a cool idea
we've seen it before with compact I
packs and the interchangeable sleeves
let's just hope this campaign works and
let's hope they bring out a better
design it seems that Sony is trying a
salute Lee everything it can to regain
its limelight and smartphone space the
company is apparently already working on
its premium mid-range future as that is
really a very disruptive market right
now and while we hear that there is a
sony xperia z5 light which will bring a
Snapdragon 650 processor in addition to
2.5 D glass in the design apparently
it's going to be a 5-inch display we're
not sure what resolution but hopefully
we will learn more about it the next
couple of events that are coming and yes
all the rumors of a more affordable
iphone for the future are about to
happen apparently trusted sources
claimed that Apple is ready to enter
mass production as of next month which
starts in the next few days and yeah it
seems that this could either be the
iphone 6c the iphone 7 see we're not
exactly sure even if this.c variant will
not just be a plastic version of the
iphone 6s or if it'll be a smaller
4-inch beriant there are just so many
big rumors right now we should learn
more as we occurred to march even though
analysts are not painting a pretty
picture for apple's future when it comes
to sales it seems that the
the watch actually then go so bad
analysts weren't really predicting much
for the holiday season but apparently
Apple is celebrating 5.5 million units
sold though Cupertino hasn't really said
anything but if you're wondering exactly
which is the company that follows in
sales it is not any Android wear
counterpart it's actually not even
Android wear combined it's the Fitbit so
yeah that was the holiday season let's
see how things evolved going forward and
finally a very hot news today have other
trusted sources claiming that both
Samsung and LG will be the OLED
providers for some future iphone in 2017
we're not sure what the moniker is going
to be but yeah it seems that both
companies are going to invest twelve
point eight billion dollars combined in
all the facilities and modernization
they're going to need to be able to
address apples need for iPhones and that
will be the near future it seems
obviously we're not sure if that's going
to be the case for the iphone 7
particularly with other rumors that just
happen but it leads me to the question
of the day what is your favorite display
technology do you think that Apple is
making a good move and moving 20 letter
do you think that the smartest thing
would be to stick to IPS in my case
let's do the OLED it's going to be
amazing in my opinion but then again
leave us a comment down below we would
love to know what you prefer friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
