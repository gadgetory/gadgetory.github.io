its google play music offerings reports
have the HTC volantis being a very beef
the Android tablet and if you haven't
bought the Amazon fire phone don't worry
a lot of people haven't either I'm high
Meadow iveta and the rule of thumb for
Wednesday's is that if you're having a
bad day to day it's not going to get any
better tomorrow just smile this is
walking out daily and just like apple
acquired beats music yes Google is
following the same trend the official
news today are of the company acquiring
songs I'm the reason my arms are cool is
because it has these really cool curated
playlists and obviously it seems that it
wants that sort of technology in order
to enhance its google play music
offerings we still don't know exactly
when that will happen and according to
them song so we'll continue working the
same for now so we'll see how that goes
and don't worry if you haven't bought
the Amazon fire phone we haven't either
the phone launched recently it was
ranking 45 and Amazon's own store on
monday and it right now tainted ranking
77 I didn't even know amazon sold more
than 70 phones and its store but
currently yes it is ranking 77 it's
probably the worst selling bone in their
own store so this could just tell you
exactly how sales are going there and it
gives you an idea of why amazon did
things wrong it's too expensive compared
to everything out there and probably too
gimmicky as well now a company that is
finding a lot of successes LG with its
g3 so much so the company is already
filing for new trade marks for the g3
Vista the g3 lights and even the g3 beat
now don't get confused the g3 beat is
apparently the g3 mini which hopefully
will not be a doc down version of the
current g3 though that's historically
the case and then in the case of the g3
light that's interesting we wonder if
what they're planning is to give us a
1080p variant of the same phone which is
sort of like what Apple does with the
fine 7 and then with the g3 Vista we
don't know if this will be the more
professional Pro variant the phones they
tune more rumors will be coming very
soon and for those of you that have been
waiting for Microsoft Office to reach
Android tablets just like it's reached
the IP
and currently it's only available for
Android smartphones well the application
is apparently already ready for testing
as it turns out Microsoft has this
signup page and even though it's not
telling you that it's explicitly looking
for Android users apparently the plans
are that eventually when it finds some
it will give them a beta for them to
give this office Ranger and a try
obviously we're wondering exactly how
well is it going on the iPad when you
have to pay a lot of money to be able to
use these apps and none of us really
want to just read documents still hey it
could be good stay tuned for that and
finally for the very hot rumors of the
day we get more details on the HTC
volantis which is apparently the code
name for the Nexus 9 project from HTC
One which habit that will be getting the
Tegra k1 processor at 64-bit
architecture and even cooler apparently
this will be the first product ever to
actually take advantage of 64-bit as
apparently will have a staggering five
gigs of ram we don't know exactly why
those five gigs are there probably to
actually take advantage of the tablet
probably it could be a need from the
processor we don't know any details but
that leads you to the question of the
day would you buy an HTC tablet HTC
nexus tablet i mean the Nexus 7 has been
hot but hey it would be cool to see this
nexus 9 imagine you know the HTC want to
make design on a very hot tablet it's
also very powerful I'll tell you this
much I would love a tablet made by HTC
and especially with Nexus benefits but
leave us a comment down below what's
your frenzy as you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video is still mushy follow us on
talking a comment subscribe change
channel as well you'll also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore iveta please
