comparison of the year and we're giving
you a hands-on preview from MWC 2015 i'm
michael fisher with pocket now and this
is a short show floor showdown from
barcelona samsung galaxy s6 vs. HTC one
m9 the key thing about the first glance
impression here is that HTC basically
repeated its design from last year while
samsung really didn't the HTC One m9
features an aluminum chassis dotted with
front firing speakers flanking a full HD
display with a new double anodization
process and precision fit and finish
making it stand out from other metal
smartphones the Samsung Galaxy s6
incorporates metal too but here it's
accented and augmented by Gorilla Glass
4 a newer stronger material than HTC's
Gorilla Glass 3 while it's much more
fingerprint prone the s6 is also the
more rounded of the two the one less
likely to rough up your skin with a
sharp edge and it's much thinner and a
bit lighter as well they're both
beautiful just in very different ways
below the skin in the world of
processing and pixels Samsung gets a
chance to pull ahead a little the
processors are each 64-bit but Samsung's
does better in some benchmarks the
screens are both excellent but Samsung's
quad HD Super AMOLED is by far the more
pixel packed and vibrant the One m-9s
battery is 11% larger but the Galaxy s6
has integrated wireless charging HTC
beats Samsung in-camera resolution but
the galaxy brings optical stabilization
and a better lens ty in the usual
Samsung extras like the improved
fingerprint scanner and heart rate
sensor and the galaxy s6 emerges as the
more densely packed device more features
doesn't always mean a better experience
something Samsung has proved time and
time again with its bloated and bogged
down software this year the company
swears up and down its banish'd
interface lag to a distant memory and
our experience on the demo units bears
that
out for now also animations have been
accelerated typeface and color
selections have been updated to reflect
the new Samsung aesthetic and shortcuts
like double tapping the home button to
launch the camera show just how fast
this software can be but HTC's Sense
skin hasn't been sitting still version 7
maintains the already blazing speed of
previous versions
despite the intricacy and deep reaching
hooks of sense it still feels like a
very light UI features like blinkfeed
still offer more customization and a
more personalized experience compared to
their Samsung equivalents and nice
touches like the lockscreen mealtime
suggestions and occasional contextual
bits of information might make the one
m9 feel more homey to some people more
like a fun sidekick than a bland
instrument just awaiting input maybe
we're just giving HTC more points here
because of how much better sense looks
Samsung's software may no longer
officially be called TouchWiz but those
cartoony icons and settings toggles
continue to evoke bad memories of
yesteryear fortunately whichever look
you like better
each phone offers prominent theming
options to change and customize the
experience finally we'd be remiss not to
mention the biggest difference here
which is something I'll call the quantum
leap effect after years of stubbornly
sticking to a stale formula Samsung
finally dared to give us something
different something world's better than
its predecessor
HTC didn't have as far to go with the m9
last year's m8 was one of our favorite
smartphones of 2014 but it itself was a
redo of the earlier m7 the result is
that HTC seems to be spinning its wheels
a bit its long-standing sheen dulling
slightly under the withering glare of
its reinvented super reflective rival
how the shine on each one will stand up
to a full battery of tests remains to be
seen there are always umpteen
differences between HTC and Samsung
flagships from color selection to
browsing to sound tests to camera
shootouts we're gonna cover them all
when we do our full review and
comparison coverage in the weeks ahead
and yes we'll even have both phones in
the same room for those videos if you
have an opinion a preference or some
incontrovertible fact that puts one over
the other in your mind share it with us
in the comments below and be sure to
catch our existing coverage on both of
these flagships including full hands-on
videos feature tours and first
impressions from MWC 2015 till next time
