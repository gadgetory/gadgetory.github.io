camera iPhone is coming this year but
not the way we expected Samsung
accidentally leaked the Galaxy S ten in
someone UI user interface and it looks
like iPhones and China keep getting
cheaper and cheaper as we speak I'm high
metal Iveta reporting from a baron press
room because everybody's on their way
out
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for devices like for example
the iPad pro believe it or not they're
currently on discount invest buy for two
days a hundred and fifty dollars off
pretty much making them start like at
five fifty and that is totally not Apple
so I would highly recommend you follow
the link in the description and speaking
of discounts believe it or not yesterday
we've reported about iPhones being
discounted in China but it seems that
what Apple is doing officially is not
what retailers are doing on the other
end we see devices that are being
discounted 150 160 dollars in certain
retailers and it seems that Apple is
okay with that apparently the company
just want to test the waters and see how
people react to these heavy discounts
and let's talk about HTC for those of
you wondering what's been happening with
the company the company is actually
focusing a lot on VR we've seen their
booths here for the vibe obviously no
mobile it seems that they are working on
mobile but mainly focus on 5g and they
first want to see what the competition
does with that so we're not expecting
anything until the second half of 2019
which I don't think it's the best thing
for HTC now let's start about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 obviously the
working prototype for 5g that we saw in
Hawaii is here in CES but we also hear
that the company pretty much leaked the
design of the s10 in the 1ui recent
demos that were shown off where we see
that cutout for the camera etc not
exactly sure if this is the final design
but hoping it is it actually doesn't
look bad at all and finally the hottest
news today have to do with triple camera
iPhones and the fact that this
apparently is going to be the max
variant that we're gonna be getting this
year it's gonna be the 11 max and then
we're gonna get dual cameras on the 10r
it seems that all devices are finally
going OLED No
longer doing LCD for the most affordable
variant of you could call it that
but let us know in the comments down
below I mean what do you think Apple
should do with the approach of these
triple cameras because the rumors are
that they're gonna be mainly for
augmented reality and not necessarily to
bring wide-angle functionality I hope
that's not the case but leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us on
out I'll kind of skirt to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one
and follow me on twitter handles
quarterly that aren't Instagram at high
memory data please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw
I'm happy memory died thanks so much for
watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
