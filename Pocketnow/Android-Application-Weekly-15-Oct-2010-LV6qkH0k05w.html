Pacquiao calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which review five applications
in 30 seconds each so let's get started
aldiko is a free eater from the android
market that allows you to view a
thousands of different books for free as
well as purchase other ones from there
download site so we can go to our
bookshelf as like and see all the books
that I have available or I can just
click on these recent reads at the top
so let's click on moby-dick ok so here I
am on the story and a neat thing about
this application is that you can switch
between day and night view and you can
also change it to any color combination
that you like under the setting and to
switch pages all you have to do is swipe
your finger from either the left to the
right or you can just tap on one of the
sides Adobe Photoshop Express is a free
photo editing program that allows you to
change practically any aspect of any
photo on your device so you can crop
straight and rotate flip you can also go
here and change the exposure and all
these other features you can go here and
add a sock focus which is pretty cool it
gives it more elegant look if you're
going to take portrait photos and go
here and we can add effects or borders
let's say I wanted to change is the fact
that you go here another cool feature
about this program is you can upload
your photos directly to the Photoshop
server police scanners are somewhat of a
novelty that allow you to listen in on
police and EMS broadcasts so all you
have to do on your Android device is
download scanner radio which is free on
the android market and you can listen to
scanners near you which are broadcast
over the Internet and then sent to this
scanner radio program or you can view
the top 50 scanner so we'll just go
there and listen to one so i'll try
Chicago Police and I along with 231
other listeners are listening in on the
Chicago Police broadcast this
application only works in the United
States and Canada skype has been around
for a while and is now available to
download from the android market
anything about this application has
allows you to talk to any skype contact
in the world for free so if you have a
friend over and let's say austra you can
call them up on skype for free you can
also make landline calls just by
clicking here dial the phone number but
it does cost a small nominal fee and you
it states to call someone it's only one
cent per minute you have to buy of skype
credit which is pretty cheap and you can
also check your balance by going to my
info and all the way down at the bottom
urban dictionary is a free application
that's great if you want to try to
decipher what your friends are saying on
social networks and whatnot so a few
months ago I didn't know what FTW mix I
thought it meant something rather
inappropriate so I searched it on urban
dictionary and was able to find out that
it actually means for the win I thought
it might have meant what the biker gangs
here thought it meant another neat
feature about this is all you have to do
is shake your phone to get a random word
or phrase so this has been another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each and if
you like our videos make sure you that's
a thumbs up and also lives in comments
down below we like to hear what you're
saying and want to know what you're
thinking about anyways you can find the
download links in the description and
