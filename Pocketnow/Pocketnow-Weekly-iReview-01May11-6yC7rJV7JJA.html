million dollars spike it gets official
Steve Jobs goes on record to say it's a
bug and let the rumors end the white
iphone 4 finally got released all this
and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm Hyneman iveta and welcome
to the pocket now I review the show we
go through all this week school and the
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start this week off
with the cool yes the white iphone 4
finally got released and this time it
came an AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon flavors both
gsm and cdma though well there's really
nothing special about this iphone it's
just white we're still not understanding
why it's a bit chubbier than the current
black iphone because it's a couple of
microns or micro something thicker but
then again i guess it has to do with the
paint job finally speaking of white
iphones a white iphone 4s or five was
leaked somehow and this time it wasn't
to a guy on a bar and we could notice
that it was the current iphone 4 housing
but it was sporting a 3.7 inch screen
instead of the 3.5 inch screen that we
currently know aside from that it had
the a5 chip so it was faster device and
it also was a 64 gigabyte storage device
instead of the current 16 and 32
gigabyte models that we know now there
aren't any specifics on how the device
was leaked or when we're going to get it
but those 3.7 inch screens do make sense
considering it's still going to be on
the 300 pixels per inch range that makes
the rent of display possible let's see
what happens and well let the iOS 5
rumors begin recently a crash test fell
into the hands of a developer where he
could verify that his application was
being tested on iOS 5 though no
specifics on what device was testing it
or where it was aside from that well we
have seen images of a white iphone 4
again being tested and this time it had
t-mobile logos at the top and 3G written
all over it so this could either mean
that t-mobile is merging to the AT&amp;amp;T
network or that the next generation
iphone could sport more support than
just the AT&amp;amp;T bands and Verizon we could
see it being released to support more
networks considering that the you know
exclusivity deal with AT&amp;amp;T is finish
though again rumors not really sure what
to expect yet and while speaking of
rumors Apple has just purchased a domain
yeah I set a domain icloud.com for 4.5
million bucks if this doesn't sound like
itunes in the cloud i don't know what
does i really don't understand why Apple
didn't buy the whole company for the 4.5
million bucks but it was just a domain
the company is now registered as cloud
me calm but then again we could see
Apple moving into this whole mobile me
going into the cloud a lot more than it
currently is and probably bringing
itunes to it though no they threw yet
specific not really sure we could expect
it to be out yet because rumors out
there say that everything is ready for
release no events have been mentioned so
not really sure we have to expect or
wait for this till June and well ever
since froyo was released on android i
must admit i'm on the list of people
that use android specifically for the
turn-by-turn free navigation services
offered and we have been expecting or
wishing that this made iOS somehow but
sadly it's currently not free you have
to pay for it so rumors have it that
Apple is working on a crowdsource
traffic navigation turn-by-turn thing to
be released eventually but since we're
getting close to the not-so-cool section
let me just warn you this what Steve
Jobs said was being created as an excuse
for Spygate so let's talk about that now
well add listen for the coolest continue
on with the not so cool that's right
Spygate Steve Jobs came on record on an
interview and also offered a press
release where he said that Apple wasn't
really trying to track you the whole
reason why your iphone ipad ipod touch
and everything was tracking you was
because they were building this
crowdsource service where they want to
bring turn-by-turn and traffic services
to iOS devices for free well they didn't
say for free but that's the reason why
they were working on it though the
reason why the device was storing this
on the device and on your mac or pc was
a bug and apple seems to be releasing an
iOS update to clear the bug not really
sure when apple will release this
crowdsource service or if this new
update will be released the next couple
of weeks but again apple says they're
not tracking you let's see what they say
to Congress and well if you're on the
small list of people that waited for the
white iphone 4 to be releasing I've got
a black iphone have you ever wondered
why it took Apple 10 months to release
the device while Steve Jobs and Philip
Schiller came on an interview and they
talked about it and according to them it
was more difficult to build a white
iphone because the sensors then react
nicely with the white paint so that
probably explains why the device is a
bit more chubbier and then aside from
that well it seems that the white paint
then do a good job at enduring over time
but then again you know Apple ten months
then sound really good I mean you did a
really good job with the white iPad
though it does though the tron behavior
sometimes with light so we'll see what
happens with the white iphone for the
future and let's hope this doesn't
become another excuse for the iphone
fight will be released next year or
within the next 10 months let's hope it
comes out of june that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm high metairie better remember to
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
