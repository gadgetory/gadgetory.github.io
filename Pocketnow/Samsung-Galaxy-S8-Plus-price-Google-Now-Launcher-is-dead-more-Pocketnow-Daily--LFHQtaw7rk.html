broader sales at the same price tag LG
g6 leaked images show was brushed
aluminum in 2016 specifications and the
Google now launcher will apparently
cease to exist very soon I'm hiding that
leave it and the somebody told me the
combination of gray hair and t-shirts
then look that good and I'll spare you
the response
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals believe it
or not the Microsoft Surface pro 4
continues to be on sale you can find
certain s KU's for as little as $200 off
each one and actually that's not as
little $200 off or surfaces a lot of
money but then those of you in the
market for the surface book that's
rarely ever available on sale it's
currently now at $1700 but we're not
talking about the performance base by
the way so yeah now for those of you
that we're looking forward to an Android
wear solution coming from Google
apparently it's not going to come from
LG we've got some leaked images of the
retail box of the LG watch style and it
seems that it's going to be an LG watch
there's no pixel branding there is no
Nexus rounding or anything that
indicates that this will be a Google
product so it seems that the weight
might still continue the rumors still
reigned that there will be a Google
variant the question is what oh Emily B
we're still thinking that it should be
LG we'll see
and speaking of LG we've got some leaked
images that show us the fact that yes
this will be a brushed aluminum device
at least in the sides we're still not
sure what exactly this bag is going to
be made of we've seen cases where
apparently it's going to be glass other
ones where is this texture that
shouldn't look that bad at all but then
again probably what concerns us most are
the specifications we've got some
benchmarks to show with a Snapdragon 801
processor and four gigs of ram so think
about it this is going to be a very
expensive phone that has lesser
specifications to the 1 plus 3t that
doesn't make any sense now how about if
we go back to the Samsung Galaxy s8
rumors two things number one we've seen
some leaked cases of the Galaxy S 8 and
Galaxy f8 plus clearly one
larger than the other the other is that
apparently some sources claims that
Samson plans to keep the same price tag
of the galaxy s7 edge or at least the
whole concept of the difference between
the s7 and the s7 edge or s8 and s8 plus
will be just $100 question is what will
the price be of the s8 but still it
seems that Samsung wants to remain with
that strategy and the company is also
expecting to sell more of the larger
units than the smaller ones so that's
going to be interesting and finally the
very concerning news today I do with the
probable the miss of the Google now
launcher there is a leaked letter
between Google and developers and OEMs
talking about the fact that Google will
cease to distribute it as of March 1st
now this is rather interesting as
apparently we're not waiting for a pixel
launcher to make it there is no
confirmation on that and it seems that
consumers will still be getting updates
from the Google now launcher if it's
already on your apps installed on your
phone but apparently you won't be able
to download it as a new application
going forward OMS will still have tools
that will allow them to embed the feed
or the old Google now feed into their
launchers but this could mean that there
will be no more Google launcher I don't
know I'm kind of worried but it leads me
to the question of the day what is your
favorite launcher on Android and do you
feel that that would be a loss if the
Google now launcher dies and there is no
pixel launcher coming in my case I will
be honest my favorite Android launcher
is the oxygen OS variant that comes from
oneplus I feel that this company is the
one that figures it out the most but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion
