blackberry mercury well we've just
received confirmation that the code name
actually never existed even though the
device did I'm hey MIT or even it with
pocket now along with Kyoto Houston and
want back now and let's talk about the
new BlackBerry
now if you're asking yourself why we're
just calling it the new blackberry
that's because it actually doesn't have
a name yet
as a matter of fact there's very little
that we can share with you about
specification Zoar internals as TCL
isn't ready to share details like screen
dimensions and technology are also not
known yet what we do know is that for a
pre-production unit this new blackberry
is gorgeous we've got a metallic build
on the trim that's complemented by a
textured back and then there's the
signature blackberry feature its
security keyboard we are allowed to
share that the keyboard includes a few
tricks like a passage of navigation for
menus sort of like what we saw with the
probe but with a couple of enhancements
and you'll also notice that the keys
actually look somewhat larger than the
probe something we do applaud another
trick includes a fingerprint scanner on
the space bar but that's something we
still cannot show off as again the
software is not final about the only
signature TCL feature here that we've
noticed is the infamous power button at
the top left and the convenience key at
the middle right today's presentation
was mostly about how blackberry and TCL
book collaborates and providing users
with the best BlackBerry experience ever
and I've got to say that from this
device in particular this is a very
positive start expect more information
as we get closer to MWC 2017 and
Barcelona as again a lot of information
is still not on the table for now make
