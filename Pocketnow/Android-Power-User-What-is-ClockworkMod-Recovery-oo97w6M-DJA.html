abbreviated to CWM is a recovery image
used by power users to do well powerful
things on their Android powered
smartphones and tablets originally
developed by koushik duta sorry I've
probably said that really really wrong
we'll just call him Koosh because that's
what he calls himself CWM let's power
users do all kinds of stuff like flash
new images backup existing ones do all
kinds of maintenance tasks what does it
look like and what some background
behind it that's what we're gonna talk
about in today's episode of the Android
power user what our images no I'm not
talking about those things that are
pretty and worth a thousand words
no in Android images are essentially
self-contained
operating systems I know you're thinking
wait a minute Android is an operating
system so what on earth is this thing
about operating systems in Android well
you see the Android that we're used to
is the system image we run around all
day long in the system image that is
Android well we've also got another
image that we can load up it's kind of
like dual booting in fact you know what
it pretty much is exactly dual booting
this image is called the recovery image
most of us have seen it once or twice we
may not have known what it was but
essentially what it is something an OS
if you will a really small one that lets
you boot up your machine it's not
Android at this point remember and
install saying over-the-air update or
flash a new image and once it's done it
reboots and you're back up into your
system image that's pretty much all it's
used for when it's stuck but yeah we
don't stick with stock for very long
Dewi so what can you do with your
recovery image when you're not limited
to just stock when you're running a
custom recovery image in addition to
flashing roms say custom roms that we
get from the interwebs
you can also flash kernels you can flash
themes you can flash other mods you can
do all kinds of stuff but that's just
flashing these things on top of what you
already have
you can also backup so for example if I
want to try a new version of some other
ROM I can back up my current
installation with all my apps all my
configurations of say CyanogenMod ROM do
a full wipe and then install something
else like a okp for example and if I
like it well I can stick with that and
just go forward but if I want to revert
and go back all I have to do is reboot
into clockworkmod recovery and restore
my old rom very simple takes a little
bit of time because we're talking about
you know images that could be a gig or
more in size so be patient but it's a
lot better than having to reflash reset
up redownload reinstall reconfigure all
that stuff it's all in one you can
restore it's very nice well the only way
you can restore of course is if you can
back that up as well so you can do that
too there are other maintenance things
that you can do we'll get into that when
I show everything to you on the device
itself so let's go over and take a walk
through of clockworkmod recovery this is
my Nexus 7
I've already rooted it I'm running a
CyanogenMod at nightly on it and I've
already installed clockworkmod recovery
version 6.0.1 point 0 this I believe is
the touch friendly version of of the
recovery image itself if yours is not
touch friendly you can navigate by using
the volume buttons to go up and down and
then the power button to execute but
since this should be finger friendly we
just have to touch on the screen really
cool big thumbs up to Koosh for that by
the way so what can you do the first
thing is of course you can reboot why is
that important why is that featured well
we don't run inside clockworkmod or even
our recovery image for very long it just
lets us do stuff it doesn't really let
us do you know system stuff like make
phone calls or read books or surf the
web so eventually
gonna have to reboot into the system
image so that's why it's highlighted
first and foremost next what we can do
is we can install a zip from the SD card
so let's go ahead and navigate in here I
can choose a zip I can ply a update.zip
a lot of times your over-the-air updates
will come as an update zip file and you
just drop them right there so this is a
quick and easy way if you're just doing
something similar to that just tap that
you're done you can toggle signature
verification just in case you have
signatures that don't match or stuff
that's not signed you can toggle that
leave it alone in most cases you'll be
good to go and of course you can go back
to the previous menu let's look at this
choose zip from sdcard here what you're
going to see is a somewhat alphabetized
list and when I say somewhat I mean it's
Linux alphabetized so capital letters
and lowercase letters are not the same
so we're not going to go a a b c d d
we're gonna do all of our uppercase
first and then all of our lowercase a
second so if you're wondering why things
are split the way they are that's why so
if I've gone ahead and downloaded
something I can come in here navigate to
wherever that is I don't have one that I
can show you right now but you just
navigate to it select that file and
you're good to go
the next thing that you can do is wipe
data and factory reset comes in very
handy if you want to start fresh start
clean make sure you don't have stuff
that's interfering like if you're going
from clockworkmod to a okp
or vice versa you want to make sure that
you wipe data in factory reset first a
lot of people say you should also then
wipe the cache partition I believe
that's done here I do both just because
probably won't hurt the next thing that
you can do is backup and restore and of
course in that menu you have backup
restored delete advanced restore and
free up an Android space if you want to
backup simply tap on backup you can
supply a name you're good to go if you
want to restore come down here in fact I
got out of that accidentally I don't
have any restore images that I can
restore from how about that so it's just
taking me back here to the front but I
can very easily go in and restore a full
system image
and be back up and running really really
quickly go back to our menu I can also
come into mounts and storage of what on
earth is that I can come in here and
mount the SD card the system I can
unmount cache unmount data I can do
formatting I can do all kinds of stuff
why is this important well if I want to
go in and connect this to a USB cable
into my computer I might want to get in
there and mount that stuff so I can get
at it if I want to do other stuff I
might need to unmount so that I can get
out of it this is really advanced stuff
you're not gonna use this all that often
I think I've used it a couple times so
just know what it is stay out of it
unless you have some instructions that
tell you otherwise and then follow those
precisely we also have an advanced
section and ironically advanced has some
stuff that I think everybody should know
about of course we still have our reboot
recovery
this doesn't reboot into system it
reboots back into recovery mode so if
you have applied something here you can
then go through and reboot back up into
recovery very quickly and easily you can
wipe the dalvik cache if you don't
remember what that is go back and watch
one of our previous episodes I'll have a
link to it at the end of this video but
that will tell you what that is wiped
battery stats for a while some people
thought that you could get your your
battery statistics confused and your
little battery indicator up here would
tell you the wrong percentage of battery
life that you have in there some people
still think that really the did jury's
still out if you think that your battery
is giving you the wrong stats I'll just
come in here and wipe that you'll want
to make sure that you have a full charge
before you do this and then the very
next run you want to make sure you don't
plug that in to to the power so that it
will recreate those battery stats and
kind of get a better idea about your
battery and how long it will last so
that that percentage indicator at the
top will more accurately represent what
your battery life is or the battery
expectancy should be you can come in and
look at error reports do a key test I
don't know what either those are I've
never used them you can show a log which
everybody likes looking at logs and if
we can partition our SD card of course
this device doesn't have an SD slot so
there's not a lot I can do with it but
if you've got an older device or a newer
device that has a an SD slot in it
you can partition that and there are
some reasons that you might want to if
you just want to go in and format it
forth for better use in Android you can
do that if you want to set up a cache
partition you can do that as well if you
want to do a an Apps partition this will
walk you through that
this is ROM manager it's built by the
same guy who makes clockworkmod recovery
and it's designed to let you quickly and
easily do stuff interacting with your
well with your custom recovery image and
it's really nice so what we can do here
is I'm running again CyanogenMod 10:00
nightly let's check for an update this
goes out checks on the web sees oh look
there isn't update available let's say
ok to that oh I also want to get my
Google Apps 4.1 we'll say ok to that
it's now going to download this once
it's done downloading this then I'll be
able to install it it'll ask me if I
want to to reboot into recovery and
install it and it'll do that really
really quickly for me there's somewhat
of an in-depth look at what you can do
with clockworkmod recovery and a little
bit of its tie-in app it's sister app
rom manager it's really quite cool very
very powerful and it may help your life
as an Android power user in just a
little bit easier if you liked what you
saw here make sure you give the video a
big thumbs up if you have not yet
subscribed to the pocket now video
channel make sure you do that I'll have
a link for you at the end of this video
when you're not gonna miss out on future
episodes of the Android power user for
pocket now I'm Joe Levi thanks for
