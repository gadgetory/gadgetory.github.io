pocket now calm the ipad mini and ipad 4
are here and in this video we're going
to box them both and give you some first
impressions let's get to it and so we're
going to start with the less exciting of
the to the ipad for although it is kind
of exciting because it's it's faster and
the ipad 3 with all of those pixels is
slaggy at times when opening apps
sometimes it stutters it's not as smooth
performance wise as it should be so it's
nice that apple finally put a 6 chip in
there of course we also get the
Lightning connector again this is a
minor refresh a lot of people are
actually pretty upset echo and at least
a fourth-generation ipad in the middle
of the year but hey let's so let's see
what we have so this is the Wi-Fi 16
gigabyte version we're going to have a
speed comparison up very soon I am so
curious to see how much faster this is
then the ipad 3 and let's just take a
quick look at the hardware another thing
that people really aren't talking about
is that the ipad 4 should have slightly
better battery life then the ipad 3
because it's got the a6 chip which uses
a smaller manufacturing process and thus
requires less power to run so that's
something I'm looking forward to the
battery iPhone the iPad 3 is pretty good
but it always could be better so let's
open this up here and we get an ipad of
course it's going to look the same
except of course that it has a lightning
connector on the bottom and it looks
like that wow we well let's just bring
the ipad 3 over here and yeah you know
it's a it's a lightning connector what
else do you want to say again the big
big story here with the ipad 4 is the
speed and we're going to come back
shortly to video keep an eye on the
pocket now youtube channel we're going
to comparison video and see how much
faster it is now let's get to the main
event here the ipad mini okay let's get
to the main event
now a problem is plagued the iPad since
the beginning is that it's just been too
thick and too heavy it's not really
conducive to reading for long periods of
time because it just fatigues your hands
the Nexus 87 came around it was thin and
light and you could really hold it like
a book for a long period of time just an
awesome experience and now we've got an
iPad that has those same merits by being
thin in life but unfortunately Apple put
a low res screen on this lower than the
nexus 7 does that matter what we're
going to talk about that in the coming
days so this is the black version I got
the black version instead of the white
version I always go with white but this
time i went with black because
apparently it looks pretty awesome with
that beveled edge so let's slice this
open i am extraordinarily curious to
feel this thing in my hands and see what
it's like to actually have a thin and
light ipad who would have thought that
we'd ever get there the next iPad Mini
is the one to get I should mention cuz
it's going to have a Retina Display you
know it and it's gonna have an a6 chip
so this is this is the first gen ipad
mini but nevertheless very exciting so
here it is and wow it is uh it's later
than I thought it was going to be and
it's thinner than I thought it would be
I kind of the urge to just try to break
it in half I don't know why it just kind
of feels like this long tiny skinny
wafer and this is against a black you
sleep have to tell you that this thing
is interesting I don't even know what to
think about this because I've never seen
anything like it obviously okay
interesting so this black edge is is
kind of a dark finish it's not it's not
metallic it's kind of like the iPhone 5
and black I like the cool metal to the
touch of course the ipad 3 and ipad 4
are also quoted touch but this is just
completely flat so it's got a nice nice
feel there we've got stereo speakers on
the bottom with the lightning connector
and i'm really curious to see how the
fingerprint detection system work so
probably you can hold it like this keep
your thumb on the screen and still
use it I can't wait to see what that is
like and I also ordered a smart cover
here in this sign and blue kind of
reminds me of the Lumia 920 and Lumia
900 doesn't it so very nice looks really
good by the way with the blue and the
black it's a really good color
combination thought that might work
pretty well and let's see what it's like
to roll it up and all right very cool
anyway so I'm going to turn this on I'm
going to load some data on here use it
for a bit come back with some first
impressions just wrap up this video okay
and some first impressions for the ipad
mini this display is burning my eyes
know if if you are going from an ipad
with a Retina Display you're going to
notice a tremendous difference I mean
this you got an annoying reflection
there this looks like the ipad to screen
because it basically is just shrunken
down a little bit you will absolutely
see pixels in everything that you do in
every screen that you're in it's it's
potentially not a deal breaker because
you're dealing with it it's a trade-off
for having such a thin and light tablet
and if you hold it away from your face
enough you don't see pixels as much but
yeah there there there besides that the
screen quality is fantastic as we expect
on Apple screens very good color
saturation everything looks good and I
can't tell you how fun it is to be able
to finally do really good portrait
typing or easy portrait typing in
portrait here so that's that's good for
emailing and if you do a lot of text
input it's kind of like using an iphone
just with a bigger keyboard whereas on
the ipad 3 and the ipad for now the ipad
2 and I've had one anything with a
bigger screen like that you're really
stretching your fingers to be able to do
portrait typing other than that it is
thin it is light it's going to take some
time to get used to and I was really
curious to see how this finger rejection
works and watch this works just like
just like advertising right you put your
finger on the screen and it ignores your
input you do it on the left you do it on
the right it works perfectly well so
we'll be back with a lot more so we're
going back with a lot more we're going
to compare this with the nexus 7 next
kind of one of its closest competitors
again I really like this black and thus
I am
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and let us know what you think
about the ipad mini you're going to get
one leave a comment that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
