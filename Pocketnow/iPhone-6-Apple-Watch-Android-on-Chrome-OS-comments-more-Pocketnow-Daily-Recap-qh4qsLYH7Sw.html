there's a ninety-nine percent chance
that you're not watching it in 4k either
do honey you look like my teacher from
school who's teaching history funny uh I
don't think your teachers that ugly man
so is he high Meadow Bavetta or a med
Lavetta and take a while pic that's
right it's that time of the week I am
high mentally there this is pocket now
and there's a program out daily recap
last week so on Monday asked you in your
opinion which is the best SmartWatch
design because we saw some leaked
schematics of the then I watch which
eventually turned up to be the Apple
watch we have 697 comments out of which
Abdul says i don't care round or square
I want better battery I would go for the
razor in Abu or well whatever that is
but anyways you are so right honestly
it's come to the point where I don't
really care that thing is round or
square what I want is great battery life
and no SmartWatch with the exception of
the pebble has figure that one out and
Kelvin via says round two day battery
life leather strap and works with every
phone just in case Apple somehow manages
to surprise me and well that was before
the Apple watch was announced and now it
will only work with iphones and how can
you survive with two days of battery on
a watch dude and laser lens says I want
a perfectly round SmartWatch with
enormous bezels but it looks like not
even Apple can figure that one right and
you're right I'm not really a fan of the
Apple watch is designed but I rarely am
until I actually hold things that on
Tuesday I asked you what were you
getting the iphone 6 or the iphone 6
plus Apple had just announced the
products and there was a lot of
pandemonium over what we saw we have a
1559 comments thanks a lot guys that's a
lot under that says I'm still staying
with the iphone 4s which is the same
cameras the six LOL and that will watch
damn it i hate the name should have
called it i watch and $350 is fine but
i'll wait for the european prices and no
the camera on the iphone 6 and the
iphone 5s are not the same as in the
iphone for us it's significantly
different dude and trust me i still have
these phones so you should give it a try
but then again the Apple watch price tag
is not really that bad i'm just not
and a lot of things that we're getting
here and what we're not getting when
darienne says I don't like the look of
the iphone 6 disappointment and you know
a lot of people aren't I was
disappointed with the look of the iphone
5 until I held it so I'm waiting to hold
the iphone 6 to give you my opinion then
I think Melinda says I'm going to get
the 4.7 and 64 gig iphone 6 and yeah
that's a good option not too big not too
small not too little storage not too
much that's a good option then on
Wednesday ask you what do you prefer
google voice or hangouts as the news are
that Google is already merging both
services we have 356 comments out of
which armor says hangouts is great
especially with the chrome extension on
the desktop and yeah a lot of people do
like hangouts I'm not on that list and
Amir says google voice of course but I
don't see anything wrong with having two
apps at once and that's really my point
why merge things with hangouts hangouts
is convoluted on its own then Dallas
says yeah i'm really interested on what
you hate about hangouts okay let me try
to make this simple number one a
convoluted you I if you want to use it
for more than one user which is our case
here parking now the second effect that
notifications arrive probably 10 minutes
later which is terrible and then the
third the fact that you get hang out
invites from people you have no clue who
they are and the process is just so uh
but that's my opinion I know a lot of
people like them then on Thursday I
asked you do you prefer the Microsoft
brand or would you prefer any other
brand as the news are that Microsoft is
ditching nokia they're ditching Windows
Phone and they're making everything
Microsoft we have 152 comments out of
which David Thomas says I hope someone
buys the Nokia name it it's legendary
name and cell phones in nokia 3310 is
still the greatest non smartphone ever
almost indestructible and no it is not
almost indestructible it is
indestructible dude I think I still have
one in a drawer but yeah it is too bad
the nokia brand still exists only thing
that microsoft bought was the handset
division so yeah the brand is still
going to exist sadly not with
smartphones which is really sad news as
well then edge says microsoft
desperation pluses my suggestion true a
lot of desperation here and then Evan
see says if you don't say Apple phone I
don't think you should say Microsoft
phone and my god that's probably the
best comment of the week we don't you
know Microsoft bone Mike
prosoft small and software what does
that have to do with the phone the same
way Apple has nothing to do with the
phone the brands are just not necessary
and I like the fact that apple looks for
ways for their products like the mac to
only be called the mac and for the ipod
to only be called the ipod i don't
really want to call this my microsoft
phone but hey that's my opinion and I'm
sure yours as well and finally on friday
i asked you of android applications
would make you want to buy a Chromebook
as google is already testing android
applications on chrome which is great we
have 545 comments out of which Aiden
says why get a Chromebook when you can
get a Windows 8 tablet not great
specifications and it will run Windows
apps and Android via program and get all
Android applications mainly because a
lot of people just want to buy one
computer and the Chromebooks are
extremely affordable so the app
ecosystem of Android plus Chromebook
pricing would make them really
compelling meaning you wouldn't need to
buy windows computer another commoner
says all Android applications and games
a feasible should be on Chrome OS
computers and I agree with you I there
is no purpose to buy a Chromebook right
now really because nothing runs on it
except for Chrome extensions and
applications and when you have such a
vast ecosystem from Android it makes no
sense for these things not to talk to
each other if you have the same
processing power from android running on
chrome then technic software says no why
buy a Chromebook if you could just run
chrome OS in a virtual machine for free
on a pc or mac there is really no point
in running Chrome OS on a Mac what can
you do better on Chrome OS than on OS 10
or on Windows the purpose of this is
really the fact that you wouldn't need
to buy these products that all you would
need is a Chromebook and that's really
the case I mean for two hundred dollars
two hundred fifty dollars for Chromebook
it really makes no sense to buy a mac
and I really do feel that this is the
way for Google to boost their market
share that's it for a park it out daily
