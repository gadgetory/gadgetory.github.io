pocket now calm if you like a hardware
keyboard on your Android you still don't
have that many options but early - is
the newest option and it's probably a
very good one it comes with Froyo
Android 2.2 a faster processor than the
original droid and a much improved
keyboard so let's get to the unboxing of
the Motorola Droid 2 on Verizon let's
get to it
alright and let's unbox the Droid 2
there you go alright here it is very
very similar box to the Droid X in fact
here's the Box to the Droid X basically
the same the Droid X box is a little bit
bigger very small boxes it's quite
interesting so let's take a look at the
box what we have here so we've got the
Motorola Droid I've there see see we
have here includes adobe flash player
built in with Froyo DLNA support which
is nice to have comes with an 8 gigabyte
micro SD card which is which is good
let's take a look at the Motorola Droid
2 and instead of looking at the
accessories we're gonna write to the
device this time in fact we actually
need to get the battery because usually
by now you know exactly what's going to
come in the box there's going to be
headphones probably and a charger and a
user guide so there's really no point in
looking at what's inside of the box no
case included I can tell you that so
let's take out this back battery cover
pop it in the Droid 2 and turn it on
while we do some comparisons to some
other devices so this is a small battery
it looks like let's see what the sizes
it's actually fourteen hundred and
twenty milliamp hours which is quite
deceiving because it looks so tiny
compared to other mobile device
batteries so pretty big size actually
which should give pretty good battery
life so here's the 8 gigabyte microSD
card slot it's a very square device like
the original Droid so it has that same
sort of look and it's got a metal back
battery cover with plastic on the back
very sturdy feeling and then let's pop
this in
okay so we got it in and it clicks up
very smooth it feels extremely
high-quality and it's already turning on
so we're gonna let that turn on let's
take a look at this keyboard very smooth
although check this out it's not
spring-assisted which is a little bit
annoying so it takes a little bit more
effort than the average slide-out QWERTY
device very big keyboard here full
keyboard has a good amount of weight in
the hand very well balanced it feels
like very solid has a lot of weight to
it but that's what you get with a
slide-out keyboard so we have a micro
USB here on the side 3.5 millimeter on
the top so we have some more plastic
here nope volume on the right side which
is the typical placement and a nice
button for the camera which is probably
dual action it is one press for focus
and one press to take the the picture so
I'm going to turn off the screen here so
that we can compare this to other
devices and next to the Big Daddy the
Droid X obviously the screen on the
Droid 2 is a lot smaller and it's going
to be a thicker device because it has
the slide-out keyboard which turns on
the screen by the way let's turn off the
screen again okay here it is next to
another Android phone the Google Nexus
One same size screen here of course we
have the five megapixel camera with dual
flash on the Droid 2 and next to the HTC
hd2 for good measure a windows mobile
device with a 4.3 inch display the the
Droid 2 can fit sort of inside the
boundaries of the HD 2 and obviously the
Droid 2 is going to be thicker and next
to the iPhone with the bumper on you can
tell that the screen of the Droid 2 is
actually taller it is indeed larger it's
got a longer aspect ratio so very good
let's go through the first time set up
real quick on the Droid 2 now you can
actually go past this start up screen by
tapping in the four edges of the corner
we posted about this on pocket now so it
should be
like that and so we moved right past
this the setup if you don't want to do
that and so it's communicating with the
server it's going to set up the device
so we'll wait a minute
looks like there is an heiress off to
look into that something I'm noticing
right away is how incredibly shiny the
screen is I don't know if you can tell
let's see if you can tell I'm gonna turn
off the screen and I'm gonna show show
you the reflection though Here I am and
then look at this device it's hard to
tell through the through the video but
take my word for it the screen is
extremely shining which may impact
outdoor screen visibility so running on
Froyo here not much we can do at the
moment because we have to activate the
phone we'll be back with a lot more
videos on the motorola droid 2 if you
are on Verizon and you have the Droid 1
this may be an awesome upgrade for you
or if you're looking to get into the
world of Android it's maybe a really
good start please thumbs up the video if
you liked it and check out pocketnow.com
