kind of disappoints samsung google to
launch a stock android edition of the
galaxy s4 an HP builds another Android
tablet with an NB twist I'm hi meri
behna and I'm I the only guy that's kind
of disappointed with the whole google
i/o thing this is pocket now daily let's
stay off talking about HP the company
has enjoyed a lot of success with their
Envy x2 obviously on the windows 8 turf
and now they've come up with a new
slatebook x2 which is pretty much an
Android tablet runs stock Android 4.2
point2 aside from a Tegra 4 processor
you kind of haven't seen in the market
just yet it's got a lot of bells and
whistles and it does include that envy
x2 design with a 10-inch display and
also a stock keyboard included in the
package now obviously we still don't
have dates or pricing point but it's
kind of interesting let's see if it
actually does succeed because the
slatebook 7 didn't now let's continue
the rest of the show talking about
google i/o and the things that we did
get at the event we do get some
enhancements to Google now we do get a
new version of google plus we do get new
search services and we also get a new
hangout feature that also works
cross-platform in iOS now be aware this
is not really bubble or available or
whatever they're going to call that
thing it's not really the new
cross-platform uniqueness of one
messaging service that combines
everything but it is a step in the right
direction all these services are
available now for free so make sure you
download them actually there are
available in iOS first so just look for
them and let's talk about an interesting
twist to google i/o that we kind of want
expecting until last minute the company
just came up with their new streaming
service it's a subscription service the
Texas stab at Spotify and Pandora in a
sort of a different way it's kind of
better than pandora kind of better than
spotify and it costs pretty much the
same amount of money just ten dollars a
month you could actually subscribe now
get 30 days for free and then get a
discount going forward of just two
dollars off i believe it is but the
point being is that the only problem
with the service is it's not really
crossed paths for man it's blocked for
the united states as well you can't
really get it anywhere else so you can
download it now give it a try let us
know what you think in the comments down
below another thing that we did get is
google play games but just listen to
this it's not the google play ground
name that
heard about and well it's not a gaming
console it's not a game it's actually a
social network with games sort of like
what we get in Game Center in iOS but
actually better and the reason why is
because you can actually start playing
game like Angry Birds on your android
phone and it actually saves your
progress there and then you can continue
playing that same game on your android
tablet and your progress will be saved
it's actually very awesome a lot of
enhancements have a lot of features that
are included a kind of cool much better
than Game Center but again it's a work
in progress so stay tuned for whenever
it's available I believe it should be
available soon and finally for the bad
and good news of the day well we didn't
get any new version of Android we didn't
get Android 4.3 android 5.0 even Nexus
hardware but we still did get something
we got a very expensive 650 dollar
galaxy s4 with an unlocked bootloader
and unlocked everything in stock Android
and will be updated at the same time as
the Nexus phones we hope at least that's
what we're expecting but obviously this
is a 650 dollar phone compared to the
Nexus support that cost only 300 bucks
so that leads me to the question of the
day are you disappointed with the fact
that Google Isle didn't bring anything
that you were actually expecting like a
new version of Android or you know new
hardware in our particular case we do
believe that there is sort of a
conspiracy theory here we do believe
that Android and Google are waiting for
able to have iOS 7 being launched at
WWDC and then bring out their guns with
whatever Apple brings out just to make
sure that everything is right but
anyways leave us a comment down below
what do you think is happening we do
believe that there is hardware in the
mix we just believe that Google is going
to make their own event because Google
Iowa's kind of law on its own and of
course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone in tableau make sure you
follow us on fire now that can subscribe
to our YouTube channel as well you can
also follow me on twitter time
underscore d better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi mera mera thank you very
much for watching we will see you
