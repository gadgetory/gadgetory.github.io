SmartWatch or a very limited fitness
tracker you decided to buy a hybrid
I'm hi Nevada with pocket now here at
Aoife 2016 with the new fossil hybrid
all of pocket now Ziva 2016 coverage is
brought to you by XCOM global
so the biggest problem with smartwatches
is that you have to charge them almost
every day in some cases and the biggest
problem with fitness trackers is that
almost all of these just serve to track
your fitness activities and not in a
very accurate way fossil has just
decided to launch the hybrid that's
pretty much a blend between a fitness
tracker and what a regular watch can do
with somewhat smarter features for this
to work you need the fossil hybrid
obviously or even the new Scogin hybrid
options that are also built by fossil
and that provide you with more fancier
options there's a new cue link
application that is compatible with iOS
and Android and controls the watches
this allows you to use them for activity
tracking sleep monitoring setting custom
goals alarms and even receiving
notifications these notifications are of
the cool part because there isn't really
a display here what you do is program
the dials to provide you a special
combination that only you would
understand in a way to keep your
notifications private and personalized
whether it's a call from your girlfriend
or the fact that you've reached the
fitness goal the watch will vibrate and
move the dials to indicate the code you
programmed all this works through
bluetooth between the watch and the
smart phone and since it uses a standard
cr2032 battery the watch works for a
crazy six months without a charge
there are various luxury combinations
for both fossil and Skagen in sizes that
no longer make women wish that
smartwatches were smaller the price
point started just 175 dollars and
definitely we can not wait to give these
a try instead of paying horrible roaming
fees when traveling abroad or the hassle
of buying another SIM why not try a
smarter solution XCOM global gives you
unlimited internet connectivity through
a Wi-Fi hotspot rental for just seven
dollars and seventy seven cents a day
follow the link in the description and
simply order your device before you
depart ex-con global ships and that
includes a return envelope along with
the fees use promo code pocket now for
$10 off your first ex-con global order
