their galaxy note 3 line up there are
some good and bad news coming from hcc
and beware nexus smartphones as
apparently they are target of a hack i'm
primarily that i am probably one of the
things I like the most about this
weather is aside from the noise the fact
that I get to give my polo some rest
this is pocket now daily let start today
off with some official news as Samsung
is offering more color options that are
Galaxy Note 3 you can now get a golden
trim for the phone if you don't want the
metallic silver one that's already
available and aside from now you can
also get the phone in full red now
what's even more interesting is the fact
that the phone is not being announced
anywhere else but Argentina we can't
really understand why that's happening
it's probably being leaked early or
something but will most likely get this
very soon we just don't know the dates
now let's talk about HTC as their 2014
forecast doesn't seem to be positive at
all as apparently the company is only
planning to sell 14 million phones
during the whole year and just to give
you an idea Apple sells 14 million
phones in a couple of weeks so this is
really I'm not really sure why HTC is
expecting this we're hoping that their
next line up is much better than the one
we had this year but anyways aside from
that if you're interested in getting
android 4.4 on your unlocked HTC One or
also the developer edition links down
below for details now let's talk about
google's nexus smartphones and i'm
talking about all the smartphones in the
lineup that our current because
apparently they're now subject to a heck
just like you had in the past with the
iphones that were subject to SMS hacks
that would reset your phone and also
block it or lock it well now we have
this problem for all Nexus devices and
we can't really understand why it's
specific to these phones just beware
most likely Google will be pushing an
update soon to fix this or patch this
though the company hasn't really
pronounced themselves about it now so
about Microsoft and their plans for
successor to Steve Ballmer as the
company has not called me yet but I'm
still waiting for them to do so but even
more interesting is the fact that
Stephen Elop is being heard less and
less in these new rumors coming from
more trusted sources apparently they
still keep talking about Alan Mulally
from Ford and it's funny because sport
against pronounce themselves saying that
Alan Mulally is not interested that he's
staying and forth and we've got some
other names in the links in the
description but it's interesting I wish
they would say that Bill Gates is coming
back at least for a year at least for
one year just to bring the company back
but anyways and finally for the
interesting news of the day we get more
trusted sources saying that Sampson will
be ditching optical image stabilization
from the camera of the galaxy s5 and
pretty much everything they'll watch in
2014 according to the source they are
more focused on making the phone thinner
and optical image stabilization will not
allow that but judging from the fact
that we've got the iphone 5s taking
great low-light photography without it
it kind of X to wonder if you really
need it but that leads you to the
question of the day is optical image
stabilization and the camera a deal
breaker for you is that something you
look for when you buy a phone in my
particular case it is but then again
with the iphone 5s i stopped thinking
about it so leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video with
spill make sure you follow us on pocket
our comment subscribe to our youtube
channel as well you also follow me on
