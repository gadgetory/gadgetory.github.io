of overkill with their new Mac Pro and
its pro display XD are they also finally
listen to the community and are giving
us an iPad OS to enhance the experience
and iOS 13 brings some new necessary
changes along with some fun little dark
mode options I'm Jaime Rivera and okay
this is actually the first time ever
that I'm actually excited for a WWDC up
to the point where I have no problem and
making a full show about it because it's
actually worth it
this is PocketNow daily brought to you
by the one plus seven pro all right
everything that got announced today is
official but the amount of announcements
are so complex that I'm gonna try to go
through them as much as I can so just
bear with me let's start with TV OS
truly I mean this used to be Apple's
hobby now it's not but the TV OS
actually still supports Apple TVs for
those of you that thought that Apple TVs
were dying it seems that they're not and
now features a multi-user support that
will work like Netflix even if we don't
have Netflix here it also brings Xbox
one and ps4 Dual Shock support for games
they also previewed one of their new TV
plus shows called all humankind
meaning Apple is getting into their own
proprietary content that goes beyond
weird iterations of carpool karaoke and
there are some new enhancements to
things like air pots now with Siri being
able to play back and let you respond to
messages all through your air pots
instantly and there's even dual play
audio finally making you not need to
share your air pots and even the home
pod now has a handoff feature from your
phone and Apple is even introducing
radio integration and even carplay got a
new update to its dashboard UI that's
now more enhanced I mean even Siri got
its own shortcuts app launched for iOS
finally even if I don't know man Siri
that needs major improvements I thought
I was gonna see something like that
now watch OS 6 finally graduated to be
truly its own operating system it does
depend on iPhones for certain things but
now the operating system doesn't
necessarily depend
i OS fully there's a dedicated app store
now along with its own SDK developers
will now be able to make watch apps that
don't depend on the phone there are new
Apple apps like voice memos audiobooks
and calculator finally there's a new
health app with a complete redesign that
actually serves for being more than just
grabbing your data and we have new watch
faces which are fine now probably one of
my favorite features has to do with
activity I love the way Apple does it
where it looks like if you're playing
game the only problem is you still need
an Apple watch for activity to work but
it's bringing some enhancements in
addition there's even an environmental
app that will help you check the noise
around you and that's all cool I just
wish they did that for air pots because
uh their audio quality may be good if
they didn't over cranked it now let's
talk about Mac OS Catalina which yes the
rumors are true iTunes is dying because
there was so much being crammed to this
application I loved how they portrayed
it they actually made that an irony but
yes there is a new TV app there is a new
music app and there's a new podcast
application syncing devices now works
through the finder but probably one of
my favorite features is this new citecar
which allows you to use your iPad as a
second display and not only that but you
can actually use the Apple pencil and
the iPad for sketching on your Mac just
like if you bought a separate Wacom
tablet voice control is now reaching iOS
and Mac OS with rich dictation and
controls for the computer which is
awesome for accessibility they also
introduced the new find my app that
works just as intended even when your
Mac is off using Bluetooth signals that
are not actually going to turn on your
computer fully there's a new photos
application reminders and even screen
time for applications which is great to
come to the Mac project catalyst is
pretty much the new name for marzipan
which was the ideal of bringing iPad
applications to the Mac now making it
even easier and trust me we haven't even
begun covering the cooler stuff so
here's a quick word from our sponsor as
we jump into the even hotter topics and
today's episode of the bargain a daily
is brought to you by the one plus seven
pro this phone has proven to be a true
game changer thanks to its notch list
fluid and
a display at 90 Hertz its new triple
camera system and its fluid software
experience all match with a very
affordable price follow the link of the
description to learn more about what
makes the oneplus 7 pro so cool now
let's move the spotlight over to iOS 13
as there are two things coming not just
efficiency as we saw with iOS 12 but
also some really cool new features as
for efficiency face ID is now 30% faster
and applications are now going to be 50%
smaller when installing and 60% smaller
when updating we finally get a dark mode
though it seems to be across the board
and not just optional for applications
reminders is now getting reinvented Maps
which you don't care about now is also
getting some enhancements there's a new
Apple login which I really really like
because uh it avoids the whole leave for
you to use your facebook login or Google
login which you can't even control if
they're gonna provide your personal
information or not and then there's a
new Photos application that actually
brings a better photo editor and even a
video editor because I'm one of those
people that all the time ends up filming
video by accident and portrait you can
now turn it into landscape Thank You
Apple there are some other enhancements
but these were the major ones now for
today I am going to indulge myself and
tell you that we've got two hottest news
for the first time ever in the parking
out daily and I am going to start with
iPad OS because I've spent the last nine
years wanting this iPad to be able to be
everything that it seems it now will be
in theory I can't wait to try the beta
and let you know more like for example
it now brings widget support on the home
screen so no audre dove icons or at
least not just them alone there's a
better multitasking support for every
application and even support for
third-party apps files now works with
USB drives like finally common sense and
the whole application in files is
getting a major revamp to be able to
make you share applications easier
within the iPad Safari now supports a
desktop class browsing which is what
Apple said and even includes a download
manager but the problem is that Apple
wasn't really specific if this is
actually going to support desktop
browsing
or if it's just the desktop-class but
not really that will keep you posted on
that one we now get new fonts and even
better navigation controls and Apple
pencil is now faster so no no Mac OS for
iPad I mean Apple was clear that they
weren't going to do that but you know
what I'll take anything right now
because this actually just paves the way
for iPads to get better over time
and then finally the second hot news
today is the new modular Mac Pro that
I'm going to call right now the cheese
shredder you heard it here first I
tweeted about it so I'm gonna patent
that name cuz that's what it looks like
but you know what matters is not the way
it looks it's actually not ugly
what matters is everything that's inside
which is the most overkill computer that
I have ever seen it supports up to 1.5
terabytes of RAM yes I said terabytes
it's got its new Intel Xeon processor
that supports up to 28 cores
there are a total of eight expansion
slots which is crazy again finally
modularity there's a new afterburner car
that assists for pro res and pro rest
rocketing meaning you can play up to
three 8k video streams at the same time
I think it was up to 12 4k at the same
time which is crazy there's this new MPX
module that supports up to 4 GPUs and
because of this cheese shredder design
you actually don't need a fan for the
GPUs there are three huge fans that
provide the cooling system for the whole
computer we hope that works better than
the trashcan Mac and even more insane as
the 6k pro display XD are mainly because
usually if you want to get these like
reference monitors they cost above forty
thousand dollars that was actually no
exaggeration from Apple the problem is
that truly this new Pro display is
gorgeous in every way but you know sure
it's six K but it starts at $4.99 and
then if you want the mount
it's another thousand dollars and then
we've got the insane price tag of the
Mac Pro which is starting at $6,000 I
can't wait to like build it up and just
see exactly how much the maxed out
version cost but yes in today's question
let us know I mean what was your
favorite announcement
from WWDC 2019 I mean I'm not gonna lie
I'll probably never buy the Mac Pro I
you know watch OS is great in iOS 13
find dark mode that's all fine that's so
great I really really wanted an iPad OS
I have been wanting to use this iPad as
my true computer my true computer
replacement for years and it never was
that and it became just more of an
entertainment product I feel that this
is what was needed I mean we had Chrome
OS and I wanted to love the pixel sight
because of that and then it didn't
deliver so Apple one of the things the
company gets right is tablets so now
with an iPad OS again it's not exactly
what we want but it's paving the road
Matt let us know in the comments down
below which was your favorite
announcement again today was crazy sorry
for the long video guys but there was
just so much to cover and I think a lot
of it was worth it let us know in the
