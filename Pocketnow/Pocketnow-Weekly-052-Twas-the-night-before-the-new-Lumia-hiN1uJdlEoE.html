anticipated announcements maybe ever
showcasing a product more thoroughly
leaked than almost any other in its
history we'll talk about our hopes and
fears for the new phone and the
challenges of covering a device so
thoroughly leaked all that plus a
handful of Android and iOS news in the
hour ahead so let's get right down to it
on episode 05 two of the pocket now
weekly the once-a-week podcast from
pocket now where we discussed
smartphones tablets and the state of
mobile technology in 2013 I'm your host
Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and today I'm joined by chief
news editor Steven leaky faucet shank
good morning there in Pennsylvania how
are you Michael I'm very well so good to
have you back in the dough thank you
very much I think we're both doing
better though than the senior editor
Taylor heatwave Martin good morning to
you you poor sweaty man good morning
good morning tale sweating yet I'm not
gonna yeah really yeah and it's doing
its job it is I turned it down I don't
know if you noticed but that turtle you
did turn it down though that's nice yeah
what's your part I was we were having a
discussion on the other side of the the
podcast and the pre-show about how we're
we're like the most industrial podcast
today Taylor has a giant fan on him and
Stevens keyboard broke so you had to
replace it with a what a Smith Corona
word processors that way you're working
with it this has a lecturing date of
1988 25 years old it's a typewriter
right but is its legit is it when I be a
mechanical keyboard you said yeah
buckling spring model n it weighs about
5 pounds you can really hurt somebody
with this if you need to I can't wait
until you start googling something in
the middle of show also I wouldn't call
my fan large it's the only one I have
and it's got a diameter of about 10
inches that ain't a large fan yeah it's
a tiny fan but it's got a punch should
I've sent you some box fans in the mail
so Taylor we want to tell the listeners
what your issue is it's not just that
you're in in carolina and july Yeah
right there couldn't have been a better
time for my hair to go out so yeah I
came home from a weekend back home with
my family
and my air was out on Sunday when I got
home and my apartment was upwards of 85
degrees Fahrenheit and it was it was
kind of toasty it was a lot cooler
outside it was upper 60s I believe
outside so I figured my unit had frozen
it was running full blast when I got
home and it's done it before so I
figured it was frozen flipped it off
lifted off for two days so I suffered
through monday with no air and I figured
it's time to turn it on turn it on and
it was blowing hot air so it was 85
inside and I turned the air conditioner
on set it to 68 and it started rising to
90 degrees yeah flipped it off told the
complex that my ears not working it's
blowing hot air and they sent my mates
in a maintenance man yesterday while I
was away and they said they were going
to try to fix it and I told them to put
it at 70 if they do I came home in my
apartment was pushing 90 degrees again
that's gotta be @midnight @midnight and
if you don't have moving air if you
raise all the windows if there's no way
to pull the air into your apartment
there's nothing but raising undos is
going to do that though the apartments
perfectly happy just to sit there and
then hook because the windows it is I
could go all the way up to the to the
ceiling yeah so I slept in 90 degrees
last night and yeah so I'm talking to
Taylor today on on google hangouts and I
realized what it takes because it's
tough to get Taylor unsettled like you
can't do it if you're an ornery troll or
you know it's like it's tough to like
get Taylor angry but I'm talking to him
this morning and hangouts and after a
night of sleeping a 90 degree weather
every what like every third word was an
f-bomb I was about every granted I know
I know like not everyone is excuse me
almost no one is docile in all
circumstances and I think we've found
would Taylor just don't get Taylor hot
that's the heat kills me man like if I
lived in the north I would be pretty
pretty darn happy but I say we got a
movie to Maine I'm probably be ecstatic
but ya know what happened was the guy
who came to fix my air left the heat own
he flipped it on to heat you have to
manually switch it to heat didn't let me
tell him that you didn't want the heat
on though because it's compelling you a
little bit oh that's right exactly and
did you tell him not to steal your
microwave oven because if you didn't
that's on You Man I would I would prefer
him for him to steal the microwave but
he instead of leaving it on auto he
flipped it over to on so it stays on no
matter what and he turned on the heat so
I came home and it probably been running
I know he leaves here at five so he'd
been running for five hours on heat in
the summer and that's unbelievable with
no air to fix it when I got back whoa
I'm hoping you know you I'm hoping he
pays you a visit later when we're when
we're off the air but listeners please
endure our feted fan noise and an hour
mechanical keyboard and and and all that
kind of stuff but I think we're doing
well I think we're in a good place to
talk mobile tech and I'd like to do that
and normally Brandon minimun is the the
purveyor of the thought thread but he is
busy having a having a baby or helping a
baby get head so so obviously one of the
weirder sentences I've said and up and
half a baby get that's exactly at least
you avoided the mini mini Ming jokes I
did I did I thankfully we've covered
those exhaustively on previous episodes
but you know and so I don't want I don't
want to steal his thunder with a thought
thread but we do have a bit of a thought
to lead us into the show and it's part
of the reason I wanted Steven to to come
on the show because Steven as most of
you will know is our chief news editor
he said heads up the news desk and and
Stevens always posting news all day long
while we are the rest of us are opening
or making videos or you know whatever
making podcasts and as a result steven
has been with a member of the team too
what when he's when he's on duty to
learn about awesome news before any of
the rest of us and the news coming out
of Nokia tomorrow which we will be
covering in a special edition of the
pocket now live so hang out with us
tomorrow is probably the most
anticipated nokia news of almost ever
this is going to blow the 920 out of the
water probably it's certainly the nine
it wasn't as exciting as this and yada
yada and I wanted to talk to Steven
about what it's been like to cover that
you know uphill Bush of new I mean
because the the 10 20 or the 909 or the
EOS or whatever you want to call it is
huge and I just I'm very interested in
how it's been to to follow all of these
leaks because it's it's been it would
you say this is one of the most heavily
leaked devices you've you've ever
covered Steven more than that I think
this is a special case because we've
been talking about the rumors about this
phone before you know there's even a
reason to before we heard a model number
or any specific leak just the idea of
there being a peer review windows phone
was it started the rumor before there
was any hardware to to go along with it
so we've been before we had a code name
this has been in the rumors but we had
es it was in the rumors and now you like
you said all these leaks it's like you
know iphone 5 over here it's it's
definitely unlike anything that we've
seen from nokia or Windows Phone and in
general I think it's true and I want to
say that I feel a bit I feel a bit a bit
foolish in retrospect if you look back
to some of our mwc coverage when you
know Lumia nokia was hosting their their
big event and like the day before Tony
and I are over there you know just
spitballing on camera I think was a
pocket out live I might've been the
weekly and we're like yeah well we're
really hoping to see a you know a big
nokia announcement tomorrow and like
there had been no leaks of any sort
anything to expect and of course
whatever we get we got the 720 and the
520 but for the for the mwc you did have
reasons to be thinking that because I
think if Nokia Russia posted a teaser
video for the mwc and it had pictures of
the the 808 in it oh and apparently it
was super you know unofficial was just
some interns or whoever without
authorization burping up stock footage
no Russia put this out and so it's like
a day or two before so oh you weren't
off base oh good thank you cuz I'm
thinking here thinking this whole time I
my god where we just like just so
excited to have maybe something to
report on no but it's felt like that
we've been really excited to see this
guy forever and until now there hasn't
in a sense oh my god it's finally about
to happen yeah yeah and you know there's
there's no doubt that this is what we're
going to see tomorrow basically and
you're right it's this has been
something we've been talking about since
since the 808 dropped like number one
nokia is going to put this on a windows
phone and number two that's going to be
amazing and tomorrow is going to be the
culmination of a lot of that but when
you're covering all these leaks Steven
um I you know it give us we don't we
don't often talk about the actual news
cycle on on the show how do you separate
the signal from the noise there's so
many leaks out there I mean you know how
do you how do you evaluate which ones
you run with and which ones you leave
alone that's tough and a lot of it is
especially with the early stuff you
don't know what's real and what's not I
mean when we first saw these the images
of the 1020 whatever it's going to be
it's um the area surrounding the lens
that little the camera bump there right
yeah we were all over though this has to
be a fake this isn't it doesn't look
right you know the shadows were right
the engraving didn't look real and
raving was uneven right yeah sure it
looks like it's that was legit and
there's this fact I don't think it was I
still think it was faked because there's
no way I mean think about it logically
how do you have two shadows in different
directions so I think somebody
photoshopped it but they Photoshop
something that was actually real ok ok I
see was based on the legit design but
yeah it does this we always have to very
carefully try to evaluate what are we
going to jump on as fact what are we
going to start treating a lot more
harshly I mean even right now when we're
seeing legitimate leak after legitimate
leak there was the surrender that like
the latest one to arrive the other day
it came alongside some very real
sounding hardware info talked about 2
gigabytes ram that's something I want to
believe make sense so I run with that
story but at the same time that render
looks super iffy and the more I look at
it the more problems I have with it but
it's a yeah you don't know what what you
can trust what you can and so I guess
the we end up doing is presenting a lot
of the stuff to you with trying to warn
you when you might want to
you know treat this with the appropriate
you know grain of salt or do not you
know take this to the grave with you as
gospel and we've up to the reader to try
to you know obviously we're going to be
the gatekeepers and keep the really
awful stuff you don't have to worry
about away from you but we wouldn't want
to present the full story and let you
know you know what everyone's talking
about even that's not eligible from
Nokia take take it with a full helping
of a poutine right shall we talk about
poo gene for a second here nobody so I
think we did talk about when I came back
from Toronto after I'd had it for the
first time I don't never have never had
it cheese curds around here trader joes
used to and they stopped and I cannot
find cheese curds saved my life oh I
can't i I've never tried it because they
just don't sir like no restaurant that
I'm aware of serves it around here if
you can find the courage you can make it
yourself but that's the sticking point
for me yeah see I don't like yeah that
sounds like a lot make your own curves
yeah I've gone to dairy barns they don't
even have the currents they just you
know turn them into cheese and we got
all kinds of dairy sources of previously
Kurds up here but yeah but now that's
that's what yes so the Nokia poutine is
going to launch tomorrow no so you know
and some of the yeah go ahead tell well
I had it up and now I don't I was gonna
read it I wish shores yeah yeah yeah
good well I switched my trackpad to
touch to click when I'm on the podcast
because I click so loudly oh yeah not so
I accidentally clicked something and now
I don't have it anymore and I can't just
simply go back so i'll keep searching
yeah keep keep searching for that so I
was gonna ask Stephen like how much does
uh does the the source of the leak play
into stuff right because at you when I
see when I'm reading news story is not
only from popping out from other sites
and i'll see like leak you know here's
this thing that may or may not be real
the first thing i do is go down to the
bottom i look at the source link yes I'm
like who did this come from this came
from efflux and I can probably trust it
if this came from you know I don't know
you know what backwater tech then I'm
probably not going to look at it but a
lot of those backwater sites or at least
the ones that you don't normally
associate with being on top
leaks have been getting a lot of really
compelling stuff lately and it's tricky
you don't know is this coming from a
legitimate source so you know you sort
of you feel it out you try and see if it
fits in with the rest of what we've been
hearing and hopefully you know
eventually gets confirmed and we get to
know learn whether it should be trusting
these guys it's like Sam bubble sort of
popped up relatively out of nowhere
earlier this year with a lot of leaks
about the galaxy s4 at first we don't
know how much faith you should be
putting in this but you get a track
record going and developed a reputation
for yourself but again it's also hard to
find where the sources are a lot of
these times you can follow that trail of
source links back pretty far but
eventually you're going to hit a brick
wall sometimes that would be you know
you get to like a Weibo a lot of the
stuff comes out of China and once we get
to the forums there it sort of falls
apart so that's you know translation
issues we can't follow exactly what's
going on but you followed as far as you
can and then it suggests you have to
decide for yourself go with it or drop
it and that brings her a very
interesting question when you hit one of
those brick walls what happens when the
brick wall you hit indicates or maybe
doesn't or you just speculate that it's
ending on a company it's ending at this
at the company that is being leaked
about I mean when do you know that
you've got a controlled leak going on
because that's tricky right oh the
Thunderbolt yeah was the HTC Thunderbolt
a control it was most definitely a
controlled leak because I wasn't around
for them like a it was like one picture
or one or two pictures was sent to every
single major site out there so they
weren't all the same pictures they were
all different pictures but every site i
can gadget when I was a phone dog we
received some divert what the verge
wasn't around but uh this is my necktie
crunch yeah yeah i think was this is my
next I mean it was just all these major
sites got like two or three pictures
they were water marked with something
nobody had ever heard of and they were
super high-res of an actual device why
were there hi res they were really small
pictures but you could tell they were
taken with a really nice camera
so we were just kind of like um so yeah
that's interesting what you're saying is
it was subtle late leak ever right yeah
it was definitely controlled so because
because two days after that um it you at
the time that was being rumored as the
incredible HD and that's what everybody
was referring to it as and right yeah
and it was it was the first LTE phone
and um just a couple days after that
like two days maybe Erin received a box
in the mail from an anonymous I think it
was HTC but he didn't know exactly who
it was from and it had all this HTC swag
I guess you could call it but I had all
this stuff in there stickers and
pamphlets and all this other stuff about
nothing really it was like clues I'm
like there was a TV I got like a sticker
of a TV which meant HD and and it wasn't
even HD but uh all these things and it
was like we've got something amazing or
incredible it was a play on words and it
was just right after after the leaks so
it was just kind of like it goes from
seeming like you had this great new
insider source to this is just some you
know marketing guys idea of a fun new
campaign to try to get the capture
attention but yeah yeah but what I was
getting to is it all kind of came at the
same time and it was just it was very
obviously a control week right and we're
not seeing that the flags like that with
this one right a not to that degree no
way but below we're seeing some some
obviously like you know minor
information leaked a little bit like in
that in the sample pics right and the
the shot of Joe Belfiore and as what was
it is flickr page that woulda had to be
intentional yeah obvious you know we're
gonna find that right of course like
that's that that that is and I don't
wanna try to find a synonym for
controlled league so I can stop you're
using that phrase but somebody a great
German word for it Greg words tram
together there probably is diverse
assignor but the thing is like I think
that's a wine but the the thing is like
those
are compelling and everyone has gone
nuts about this image in our in our
various comment threads and of job
you'll be ory ya know now what is he
holding up like this if you haven't seen
this is Joe Belfiore holding up a like a
gold medal he's wearing around his neck
and he's like standing on either a dock
or a boat what's going on is it docked
boat yeah we actually it is a doctor as
you can see the doc in the background I
can't tell if the metal is supposed to
be like a the guy looks way too happy
with his arms raised he looks like
anything it looks like he's doing like I
half-hearted like yeah he looked it
looks to me like he's trying to settle
down a group of really ordinary people
you know everyone calm down that too is
he got the like the gold medal of
mediation I don't know there's a
marathon marathon it says a on the
ribbon around his neck it says it's a
marathon things okay so you look it
looks like you just got done running but
apparently this is a great photo now it
was a running on water yeah this is
about the implication but the other
thing everybody's gone nuts about the
awesome camera quality of this photo but
like it's this photo was shot on an
overcast day it looks like I don't see
anything amazing about it but this is
why i am not a photography critic in any
case this lee it'd be difficult to
really say much of anything about it
unless it were really large like full
res yeah everything this was one of
these are the downsampled the 5
megapixel we're speaking of it's a 7
pixels cramming them into one so it
shouldn't look really good still if
that's what it's doing but yeah like I
said it sometimes it looks it looks like
a good image but it's hard to know where
I should go to tell the difference
between something done by a you know a
prosumer camera versus a professional
camera in the high end there's audio
stuff too so somebody look for a g8
somebody look for a reflection here see
if he's actually using another actually
I was just gonna say like bandits just
gonna say it's it's it's stories like
this that really bring out the gold
standard in commenters because let me
just tell you what this thread is
someone named troll has posted fake
picture just like last time nokia
deceived the picture using a DSLR and
the two responses are idiot and no
yeah he he the troll trademark guy he
comments on pretty much everything ever
I think it's uh it's it's comin coming
to be time to ban him anyway uh what's
up yeah so what I was talking about what
I found I found what I was looking for
um it was someone on Twitter I had no
idea who was somebody retweeted it that
I follow I user k I can't pronounce that
Hyori t RT Curie RT I don't know matter
anyway she says I'd pay a thousand
dollars for nokia plus 1 41 megapixel
camera plus android put windows phone
instead of android and I take it if it
was offered but i wouldn't pay now i
believe yeah i think this person is yeah
they work for droid app storm I don't
know so that they are obviously biased
here but but it's an interesting take
nonetheless they'd still take it if it
was windows phone but they wouldn't pay
so I mean that was it destroyed is
really really strange so I just felt
like I needed to share that yeah the
craziness is going to just multiply but
we've got so much here and it's um I
feel like we could craft an editorial
almost just based on all of the stuff
we've seen and you know what i am going
to say that I was a little pleasantly
surprised on a show maybe ten episodes
ago in the weekly it was it was a quite
a while ago we but before we got any
pictures of this 10 20 we got this kind
of first hand written account of seeing
one on a bus do you guys remember that
no I don't read things no no I read it
aloud on the air I don't remember if
either of you were actually on the
episode and I think I think I think I
remember you reading it yeah cuz I read
it aloud because I was like guys here's
a check that because it's not it felt
like I was reading like a Roswell letter
or something that's right yeah yeah I
listen when people read things to me but
I don't read myself oh well I'm happy to
read you goodnight moon anytime you like
oh he isn't understand that sweet but it
was going saurik uh oh oh oh they have
to slow they have to sleep yeah yeah
yeahs can get that be that one to me
yeah we'll get Sam L over here but the
thing is like you know reading that
account was awesome and I was like guys
this is probably fake but I just got to
read it
fun but I think everything that that
leak described absolutely came true from
the big circular opening to the
distinctive Lumia shape otherwise and
all this stuff so I'm gonna the next
time I get one of those in my mailbox
I'm gonna read it again and it's gonna
give it a second glance exactly exactly
wait are we I'm learning I'm learning a
little bit myself about how to do i'm
learning stuffs i'm learning stuff and
we're going to to jump into another
manufacturer here in a second because we
can only you know I really talk so much
about the 10 20 and so on do we think
it's gonna be called that by the way cuz
that 909 what do you guys prefer you
would you rather be called the 1022 the
90 90 min 20 yeah for them to get rid of
number schemes no number screams you
never schemes are great number screams
are great to happen God it just it just
makes it complicated once you get ten
generations and not that anybody ever
goes ten generations but I mean you look
at back at black berries I was writing a
blackberry piece a while back and I was
just going through all the old phones i
had and i had the 8120 281 30 day t 332
8310 Ted 9330 the 9310 that 9130 I
remember 60 the 95 my 7520 and people
would always confuse it for the 7250 and
I'm like why are we doing this yeah wow
that's that's why i say that because
i've owned 30 some blackberries and I
can't even remember all the ones i owned
and and not even that i can't remember a
fraction of them but just because it's
it's so ridiculous i will concede that
it has not been done well yet but the
idea of having like grouping the phones
into families based on a numbering all
the hundred phones are the same to
hundreds or something else yeah it was a
good idea she wanted but eventually you
run out of it out of numbers so so say
on this this 920 we decimal system is
still running hahahaha we got that 920
point to meet the dough I mean so what
do you do okay so you've got the 909 920
so you've got the 925 and the 928 what
happens when you go so maybe the next
one might be 9 39 40 you've got 9 50 60
70 80 but
that you're not going to use all those
they don't know you're a big girl we
would do this like automobiles and we
don't need a new number every or new
model every year just change its instead
of the iphone 5 it's the 2013 iphone
yeah now we're seeing with the ipad and
story this is the exact same problem
that nokia has ran into at least one
time and blackberry ran into they had so
many blackberries they ran out of
numbers and they were up to 99 99 99 50
60 something like that I don't know yes
so they didn't have anywhere to go I'm
like what are you gonna do have a phone
number ten thousand something like and
always waiting for that I was waiting
for like the 10k or something like that
no so what did they do they went back to
just nothing but now blackberry is doing
that yeah but the q10 makes sense
because the q is for the qwerty right
the z10 is given as Omega thing and then
but then they're gonna restart with a
like I think that's pretty cool that's
if you keep the numbers to like two
digits or less and put a letter in front
of them i'm generally okay with it but i
am upset right now by the issue were
facing by LG dropping apparently
dropping Optimus for the g two this is
discussing all sorts of yeah writing
articles and tagging things up we
already have a phone called the g2 yes
we did right yeah yeah right also it's
complicated by the fact that LG's own
brand name it's just two letters stuck
together so that it just sounds gross
you know it's like the it's like the
motorola x makes sense whereas like if
Motorola were called I don't know mt
like the MTX like it's like actually
that would sound pretty cool cumbia
which I'm sure each other sounds like
you should be in a George Lucas build
gg2 does yeah it sounds like a droid but
enough that's one kind of droid anyway
yeah so I'm talking about LG a bit but
go ahead yeah no I mean I I was dying
for the blackberry 10 thousand five
hundred and seventy-three but uh nobody
else thought it was a good idea yeah
well in the waning days maybe of the of
the three digit you know flagships from
Nokia I wanted to to call attention to
the fact that I would actually kind of
prefer 909 I think that makes sense
given the 808 but the fact that it is a
lower value than 920 makes it extremely
unlikely in my opinion
don't think they would do that however I
wish they would because I think that
would be pretty cool but yeah and you're
already jumping into the thousands this
is your we're going on your three and
they're jumping windows is there a
better phone to jump into the thousands
with exactly absolutely none of this is
the one where exactly and you know or
numbers or the better deserves it well
this looks to be the one that's because
it's what we've wanted for like a year
and Roberts on windows for another 10
years and taken to 10,000 yeah well once
we figure get really but it's it's not a
it's not running Android I'm just going
through the healthy so Taylor has to go
actually actually today if it weren't
pushing 90 degrees in my apartment I was
going to do a video on my thoughts on
Windows Phone and we're looking at
probably friday now but uh yeah you can
look forward to that as good we will
look forward to their I will be off on
friday but I will look forward to
watching that on Monday but I wanted to
ask about this real quickly are either
now your thoughts on Windows Phone aside
Taylor as a photographer or a sort of
one you've got to be looking forward to
the 1020 regardless of what it what else
it right I am I mean my jokes about
Windows Phone most of the time are are
nothing more than jokes right and what
about Steven I speak the truth about
Windows Phone I it's a great platform
it's just not for me you're right right
right I've been the year of a very
special case because you ever you stand
apart from the rest of us in terms of
smartphone adoption I think you to your
credit kind of exists outside this
constantly changing world of devices
because you've retained to the same
nexus 4 for a while now right it's only
been like what six months I guess it is
a lot a long time the red compact the
rest of us yeah its forms every like
week if bad yeah I do that a couple
times a week given whatever answer I get
into what i like and is really hard for
me to change it I mean I want to
experiment more with like custom roms
and things but once you get something
that's working and you're familiar with
its it's hard to take that step to you
know play around and experiment
that's what nandroid backups are for
yeah true if you're safe you're still
staying on Android but let's uh let's
not get too too far away from that
because I want to wrap it up on the 1020
like I'd say we're gonna be covering
that on the hangout tomorrow so please
please come hang out with us Steven
you're probably are you gonna be on it
who's gonna be on it made up my mind hi
my Adam doubt and I made myself and you
were gonna be on good okay even you
should be on it if I told me that that I
have to do it because of if I donuts
boring I was initially very confused in
the earlier days of this week because I
was thinking that today was the 11th oh
and it was very concerned about this
podcast clashing up against the launch
of the 80 it wasn't until I think last
night that I realized what was really
going on it would be the calendar for
the first time in so many days I don't
know I hope I'm really do news during
these big announcements but I've been
invited to join the hangout with you
guys so we'll see okay yeah I woke up
this morning and I'm like man I need to
tell Michael that I might not be able to
do the podcast tomorrow and I'm like
quick oh wait it was Tuesday happening
today yeah that's just today hey I need
to tell Michael I'm not doing the
podcast today yeah then I was like you
know what I'm gonna do it I'm gonna I'm
gonna man up I think breaking news from
the internals of the team it looks like
for all of you commenters and by all of
you i mean the few of you but they're
there have been more than one who asked
us to cover the cat b15 that super
rugged sneaker phone it looks like that
is going to be coming to me now we're
not going to review it it I think what
we're going to do is put it up against
some other durable phones just and have
some fun finding out how it stacks up do
we have to return this one or can you do
a destructive test help you know we have
to return this one is coming to us from
clove so yeah that's great so that's
coming to me tomorrow and Taylor Taylor
and I I don't think this is not at all
this is not at all under embargo because
these devices are already released both
Taylor and I are getting Galaxy Tab
review units yeah I have an xperia
tablet z in the other room and it's
still in the box with the tape on it so
get to meet these yeah yes Stephen Cheng
left a comment on what was of these that
tablet Z unboxing or the review it was
just want it's gonna get lost in the
mail coming to me let's just put it down
I adore that tablet and the tailor treat
it right i forgot why i sent it to you
but treat it right um i think it's for a
comparison video mm-hmm hey i got a full
res picture of Joe Belfiore I got the
full taken with the mystery cam yeah
yeah how big is it yeah he's got a
unibrow that happens all of us at
marathons oh ok t he doesn't um hi res
camera shows 2020 352 by 1568 which is
five or three no mams Maddox that is for
just under 4 megapixels okay and on
sample he took it with an HTC one I mean
it looks pretty good but it's hard to
tell how everything looks on my computer
because it it's just such a high res
like if you make if you blow it up big
enough to actually see anything it looks
terrible because it gets pixelated so I
to look at it later we're gonna say and
we're we're stoked to see about it let's
let's move on from from nokia to talk
about the last bit of Windows Phone 8
News which i think is actually pretty
exciting and we do have to talk about LG
in the android section so let's kick it
off with it so right right ok this is
steven story obviously uh-oh LG exec
insists windows phone 8 device in the
works single grumble grumble grumble
right now to me this is this is a good
thing because the LG has been
conspicuously absent on the Windows
Phone 8 front and I think I've said this
on the show before I actually thought
the quantum had a lot going for it there
one of their to Windows Phone 7 devices
it had one of the better keyboards ever
and I don't like landscape keyboards and
I had to like stand there in the AT&amp;amp;T
store and decide for like minutes on end
whether I was going to do that or get
the focus and ultimately the focus
AMOLED screen won me over but i liked
the quantum and i would really like to
see a windows phone 8 quantum keyboards
not coming back I know and it's it's
it's sad it makes me sad though it is I
had a woman told me that yesterday well
yeah it's actually the receptionist at
the office I'm moving to yeah she was
talking about I'm wanting a physical
keyboard again I don't know how I always
good on these conversations people about
phones but she was like yeah I really
wish I could just get my old keyboard
back and I was like gone are the days of
a physical QWERTY you know but they're
not like I mean they're they're still
very decidedly on their way up but you
can still find him I mean one of my
other friends just got a droid for for
that very reason like she was like yeah
me but I just don't want to buy a new
phone and I went to never get an update
for it right out of the box what do you
recommend but it's funny like even after
years and years and years of this like
customers not average consumers but
friends of of mine who are tend to be
tech light you know they don't even know
what an update is and you know they
don't cares on you haven't text in
google and and get map directions
they're fine one thing I've always
believed is you should never buy
anything on the promise that is gonna be
updated no of course not no she's never
ever go into something and that's when
one problem I had with the HTC one with
the shipping with four dot one instead
of four taught to write but but I mean
the difference between those two is very
small anyway but nonetheless it's uh
something everyone should should agree
with you should never buy anything on
the promise that it's gonna be updated
okay even if you know it's gonna be
updated even if the company says we're
gonna update this don't do it well
thankfully you should be able to avoid a
lot of those problems with this
theoretical LG windows phone because
windows phone has a pretty good track
record of well when it went over what
have we waited for and in the Windows
Phone world and the first update was a
train wreck a what no no I mean windows
phone 8 sorry 7 is dead i'm not talking
about seven and seven dollar got a count
of stuff work that you're talking about
no and this 18 seen its share hiccups
with the updates coming down has it I'm
earlier this year what was the one
februari or something there much
staggered problems were carriers where
Oh starting Alisa then holding back and
you never knew who was getting it you
can always buy passage sure right but
when the carriers are always gonna be
that that problem and who knows when
that fix but that's not that's not the
OEMs fault you know I don't think that
is your apple to my ear right but to my
recollection we don't have I don't as
Nokia screwed up a release his HTC held
back on an update i mean or is it has
not enough time passed because we're
still waiting on this major one that
everyone called something different
nokia calls it calls it there amber
update which is gonna bundle in what is
it GRE to ambers on top of gdr2 gdr2
okay yeah carriers talk windows phone
update GTR to arrival anyway so who
knows i don't know i don't care i don't
want to talk about updates what do you
think about about the actual hardware
that's gonna come out of this because
we've seen LG shift from an older idea
of this like squared off corner to some
of the leaks we'll talk about in a
second of the optimist to which looks to
be much more nexus for like will we see
a rounded windows phone out of LG like
an all glass jaw be what do we think i
think we're anybody or exactly it's
probably gonna look exactly like the
adidas well i don't think it's actually
gonna know you don't think it's gonna
land do you think it's it's not legit
mean this comes to us from what light
reading India well I believe that an LG
exact has said that developments going
on internally and I'm sure it probably
is I don't think LG is going to release
the phone though I have I mean we've
they're talking about working on a
windows phone 8 device for a rubber now
I'm feeling this is a project that's
long been you know designated to the
bottom of the important scale there it's
probably a couple of guys still working
away on it hoping that LG's going to
commit to it but I really can't see them
doing it unless the unless this nokia is
a you success and brings a whole new
share of the market to to Windows Phone
I don't think it's no geez interest to
release another windows phone handset so
it may not be but think about what about
the pressure that Microsoft might exert
on them because if your Microsoft what
do you have as far as Windows goes
you've got you've got you know Samsung
making windows phones that everyone's
kind of ignoring you've got a HTC making
windows phones that were cool for like
two weeks and that
now they're not as cool anymore and then
you've got basically nokia which is the
the superstar and then huawei if you
want to count count huawei four
different markets so studious nw8 yeah
so wouldn't you want to be pushing
little LG 222 rican tribute especially
since they already have Windows Phone
experience I'd be pitching samsung to
contribute more but Angie's gonna bring
anyone to the platform I agree but but
listen about I don't think they think
there's a certain amount of pressure
Microsoft can exert on samsung because
Samsung's huge right there the world's
number one the handset vendor and I'm
not saying LG is small but I'm saying I
think that they can impart more force on
LG than they could have some it's kind
of like a dual package you you and you
encourage samsung to do it and LG is
probably going to do it as well well no
but it's about that yes as sad as that
sounds so I say pressure samsung and and
get the the freebie to put it yeah yeah
I know watching doesn't necessarily
think on its own much anymore they kind
of wait for samsung to do something and
then they say you know we'll do it too I
mean if you don't believe me on that
look at the LG optimus g pro well we're
gonna look at that in a second what were
you gonna say Steven no I'm sure like a
lot of us I've been watching a lot of
arrested development with the netflix
coming out last month and say that that
one's a freebie I've got it I've sososo
got to watch that show because everyone
around me has beds been wait you've
never watched I've never watched it yeah
I know right see Steven now you know how
I feel whenever I'm on the podcasts not
bring up a Star Trek joke and everyone
it's just dead air and then one
commenter four hours later is like I got
it and like thank you thank you so much
let's move on to Android if we can
because we have burned through windows
phone and there's going to be a whole
lot more windows to talk about tomorrow
android we're talking leaks still this
is the leak show and we have seen some
leaks out of motorola which we talked
about last week with their ex phone but
we've seen leaks of to me a more
interesting device the motorola droid
ultra stephen once again bring
interesting ah yes well we will a
alright so what is in
thing about this to me is not the
necessarily the hardware itself which
looks like a basically an updated drum
droid razr it is what it carries along
with it in its wake which are the leaks
about the droid ultra Maxx yeah anything
with max tagged on the back of it is
amazing and prints principally because I
read a headline yesterday I think it was
last night it wasn't one of ours and I
don't remember who it was from but the
headline was motorola droid ultra Maxx
promises quote 48 hours of worryfree
battery life and I guess that was coming
that quote was coming from Motorola I
don't I'm sorry I don't know where that
came from i was like half asleep but
that's exciting to me now we have some
problems with these with this leak
though right Steven we have some
off-center buttons or something like
that I don't know what to think about
that someone pointed it out in the
comments and sure enough it it's weird
it's just off center and the the next
render that leaked was the exact same
way so it's consistent at least we're
talking the home back in men uk's at the
bottom they're like oh bumped over like
what four or five pixels to the left
right it just looks just weird enough to
be it's not something you didn't see
from an official officially made render
yeah um why would motorola be going back
to hardware buttons yeah there's that
too i've heard people talking about how
because these dart droids are gonna be
on verizon maybe it was the carrier
trying to push them to do this but it's
weird yeah it is weird is on they don't
actually refresh my memory guess the ex
has software buttons we're seeing yea DX
does i believe and the droid razr rim
razor maximally all the old engine yeah
the home screen yeah I know those but
but I've got motor wheel of hardware
let's look through some of these leaks
and see what we got so while we're
talking about stuff like design elements
I mean it's it is also interesting that
the droid with even though it's not
called the razor anymore but the the
razor design aesthetic is living on in
these dirty too is what these are yeah
exactly and this crit Taylor uh you but
can you mute for a second
yeah that's a little better it's funny
because like the auto the auto volume
will like gradually boost the gain if
somebody hasn't said something in a
while and all of a sudden there's a jet
engine in my ear lovely yeah but so I'm
I'm excited I'm surprised and excited to
see that these that the razor aesthetic
has lived on because I was worried it
was going to just completely go by the
wayside and I think tell me if you know
tell me if you disagree i think this is
entirely a verizon thing i think they
want their hardcore you know militant
droid heavy lifting phones and they're
not maybe as enthused about this kind of
puffy riverstone x design yeah i think
verizon's had a lot of success with the
key barriers razr and razr Maxis over
the past two years and we've seen signs
of Motorola trying to reinvent itself
the new logo there was we know it's if
it's a leak or just you know a design
suggest him but there was that whole
idea of a new campaign with goodbye moto
and then it's reborn so I can see it
wanting to distance itself from older
brands so maybe it didn't want to make
another razor this year and this is just
its way of continuing on with the same
the same things that have worked for
verizon in the past but just making it a
little 2013 given something rash if not
much but yeah the designs still there
and i really like that you see the
little stripe of Kevlar up on the bottom
on the front oh yes yes it's not just on
the back right they've brought the
Kevlar kind of finished right around to
the front and even though there's no
chin on the device it looks like it is
just a little suggestion of that pattern
on the bottom that is nice i didn't know
i guess i love the feel of it it's very
it's one of the more premium materials
that we've seen and it really is it's
it's like what i always imagined soft
touch would graduate into remember when
soft touch was new it was like 2005 I
feel like was the first time I touched
any kind of soft touch main travel time
like this is way better than anything
glossy or you know lame and I was like
where's this going to go and Kevlar has
the soft feel of that paint but with a
you can feel that I love like that you
can feel the texture of the weave
patterns ya know it's one of the nice
things about I enjoyed about reviewing
the atrix HD for AT&amp;amp;T was that nice
backplate knows about the only thing I
drew it cheddar did you find what you
were looking for um I wasn't looking for
anything what are you talking about I
thought you know hey don't way to shut
up I know I didn't actually like the the
feel of the atrix HD but but I did of
the max I'm so I don't know it's ya see
that weird well I liked I liked the max
I continue to like the max but i never
got hands-on time with it um I couldn't
deal with the display uh yeah I don't I
don't care about that pant I'll but
let's talk about ultrapixels for a
second can we cuz we're talking motorola
already we got the motorola x up I will
freely admit that I was not aware that
there were that there was an alternate
sub-pixel arrangement in a camera but
that looks like what's rumored we got a
leak out of showing some more Motorola X
hardware which you know whatever it's
the Moto exits it looks interesting
whatever or it doesn't but the camera
rumors are interesting right what's the
story on this Steven the clear pixel
yeah this leaked rom it was a guy from
one of the various smartphone sites and
forget which one he I think Google Plus
out this announcement that it was the
Moto X would have this clear pixel
camera he didn't give many details and
then all those people are Taylor
Wimberly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
he has been with the Android me they
sold it right so he makes this this leak
and then everyone's responding to it
trying to get more details and he he
gives us line it's going to I know it's
going to put an end to blurry pictures
or dark shots or something and then a
little while later one of the commenters
found that same line appearing in
advertising or promotional copy from a
couple years back where kodak announced
its own clear pixel thing and use the
exact same phrasing that he used here so
we're not sure if this is a feature that
kodak developed and motorola's licensing
or I'm kind of wondering if maybe it's
stories kind of being developed
backwards and he started with a clear
pixel name it gets kind of direction
add up so it's unclear but if that is
the case and this is the codec stuff
we're talking about then it takes the
the normal Bayer filter pattern which is
a sub-pixel arrangement that uses a
twice as many green pixels that's red
and blue and Sam have a checkerboard
pattern and it throws in these extra
clear pixels so they're not going to
register any color sensitivity but
because they're clear they're going to
let a lot more light in and so they can
have a more they can deliver a more
accurate brightness a sense of
brightness to the sensor without so much
digital noise because we're you know
company to gain up so I right so it
could end up looking and there was a
sample that someone found in it let's
look better you still get a little bit
of noise and even though we're losing
color resolution the eye doesn't really
notice it so much yeah considering that
this sample images from 2007 it looks
like this is not bad it kind of almost
looks like what might have happened if
if a Lumia device had come out back then
or it's like here's this kind of shady
grainy dark picture and oh we've
enhanced it and you let your right you
can still see noise in the second shot
but the fact that this is from six years
ago it's actually pretty impressive so I
did not I was not aware of the ties
between this six-year-old development
and this possible new clear pixel camera
on the X but it'll be very very
interesting to see whether this pans out
I love that everyone is focusing on
cameras now i love that the advancements
and optics are what's driving this stuff
because well i mean what else are they
going to do what else are they going to
do we've improved displays beyond belief
already right you processors are also
processed astley new good yeah yeah I
mean we've got 1.9 gigahertz quad-core
and we have any went seen an eight
Snapdragon 800 yet we're up to tom went
through yeah 2.3 and the 800 right yeah
I mean I mean it's just we don't need
much more than that we're looking at
moving up to three gigs of RAM soon the
only two things that are really left it
need to be greatly improved our battery
life and camera and software well all
software is an ongoing thing it's
something that's not hardware dependent
so
well not always hardware dependent so
it's it's more rapidly updated than well
not even not take that very fact
batteries a hard thing to improve I mean
developing I mean we're talking not just
the engineering like with lenses and
fabrication issues we're talking a lot
of hard science into finding you know
the right chemicals that are gonna be
able to store you know more charge per
cubic millimeter and it's a lot easier I
think and maybe more visibly impressive
to develop to work on increasing camera
technology then working on battery life
and that's you know sort of unfortunate
but at least we're gonna really get
cameras out of it yeah and I mean
Motorola has something that nobody else
is really doing and Samsung is but
really only in their larger phones and
that's gigantic batteries and phones
that are still relatively slim yeah um
so the fact that they can do that I
think they really have something that
they could run with here if they throw
the two of them together have a great
display they throw together a true
flagship phone like this ultramax maybe
yeah but you know it i but it's limited
it's always gonna be limited because
it's a specific device to it because it
is for verizon yeah but you know they
released the manx overseas as well and
this is why i like having Tony on the
show sometimes to provide this context
this balance for motorola because
anytime we talk motorola there's just
like 10 minutes of silence from romania
and I'm like tell me what do you think
is like I don't care about motorola nope
nobody over here cares about motorola
and it's true like there I think
Motorola's European presence has been
flagging or just kind of non-existent
for a long time and it's interesting
because they're going to we have some
speculation that they might be targeting
the X at some European countries or
something like the X or something like
the X yeah but so that's not exciting in
and of itself but as a part of a larger
strategy maybe it is but my thing is you
know guys you're absolutely right this
is so exciting this motorola ultra Maxx
and the razr maxx was exciting in the
razr maxx HD was exciting but mamaia
sold very well for verizon i just really
never see them out
on the street and I ultimate I didn't
buy one giant neighbor has what i have
seen I see him sometimes but I live in a
very different part of the country i
guess so i wanted it I wanted to raise
her max really really badly but I what
what did I not want to put up with i
think was verizon I didn't want to put
up with I have verizon and the only
thing I didn't want to put upward with
what's the pin tile display because I
guessed killed never I looked at then
and I don't think that made in USA this
big new campaign for motorola is really
going to help their international
presence yeah true but you know what i
think that's a good risk to take because
no one else is really doing it except
apples kind of half-heartedly doing it
Lupul was just trying to well then
goalies motor to me they are kind of the
same company yeah held the Nexus Q
though cuz it was so expensive okay it
killed the Nexus cubic as the nexus q
didn't have any simpler air in it yeah
you did not need an amp Nexus Q as a
redheaded stepchild from there for the
day come up but i reckon i love mine i
know i mean everyone know you have one i
have one but he talks about it in every
podcast one I didn't pay for it nobody
paid no yeah I were trying to do that at
the time I would have ordered what we
need to get together with a you know
Steven bring bring a Newton I'm gonna
bring my pre three over and we'll get
Taylor's Nexus Q and we'll just have a
big pity party for ourselves it'll be
fun yeah or maybe maybe I should just
take my thermostat off the wall since
it's broken and also a redheaded
stepchild and uh there you go yeah I'd
guess about that too it's right right
we'll pour a little out or minus yeah
I've got so many products that just kind
of failed it flopped this is no good for
the podcast but when we get the hangouts
going again I found going through some
boxes i found a toy walkie-talkie that
looks just like one of those old like
1988 motorola brick some giant ones yes
my favorite crop yeah i love that um
tailored the guy who shared the the
clear pixel camera stuff said Moto X
will feature and always-on system thanks
to its proprietary dedicated natural
language processor with audio sensors
noise estimators noise cancellation and
speech speech recognition technology I'm
sure this is all
is listening would can be turned off but
how does you know how does that affect
privacy but so it would be always
listening so you could see that's
amazing dreaming about for a long time
so you don't have to be in stupid s
voice you don't have to be in Google now
you just talk to the phone I don't like
mistake ok Google and search right is he
talking about when the phones on or like
the Snapdragon 800 when it's often you
can talk to it it might be the the that
because that I mean I guess with that in
the hardware which is an s4 that the
Moto X is gonna have that doesn't have
that feature so maybe it is just when
it's on he's talking about yeah I think
it's just when it's on I don't think
it's gonna be like III think that would
be a really tough thing to sell to sit
in public I you know would like your
phone's always listening to Jeff it's
always listening isn't this like people
like much fun and it's NSA connect yeah
the new photo a prison life yeah so
anyway let's uh let's let's let's let's
just kind of plow through here I i got
the rundown links disorganized but with
us return to LG before we leave android
behind we're um before we get away from
motorola any guesses about what we're
gonna hear about today or tomorrow all
right tomorrow I'm still thinking is the
11 it's the tenth and the 11th the event
is the tenth and the Olympic they said
it's got the sniper to another medal wet
but it's gonna be something that there's
an aermotor related yeah Motorola's on
display event is that what's going on
it's a google developer event that's
open to like 50 press and that's it it's
private it's a private event yeah
there's no July eleventh event for
motorola and no moto x announcement it's
a google event a young girl into google
of Bullivant google event that's
supposed to be motorola centric so
something so it's a motorola event i
don't know i don't know what it is um no
but do you know the rumors were saying
that it might be the Moto X and then
they said no they're not gonna be in the
Moto X and then they were saying it
might be Android for dot 3 but that's
not motorola centric so who
knows what it is you're going to launch
a bluetooth speaker yes I don't know
yeah what time is this thing um I don't
know well by the time this podcast comes
out we will have we will have learned I
mean we will have reported on it yeah
hopefully so I don't know yeah any to do
we want to talk about that at all
anymore I mean we can I can look it up
again if you wanted penny with any
guesses what was going on it's it's so
low profile that I actually didn't even
know about it I heard about it I dropped
on Friday that might be why you don't
know it dropped on friday what last I
got you yeah news of it dropped on
Friday oh I was around on Friday wasn't
I oh we were doing the podcast yeah yeah
last week was the weird week anyway
Google's 11th July precedent invite
hints at moto x unveiling so this is an
old this is old yeah if you find
anything interesting about it let me
know because I just want to talk about
the fact that we are going to be there
in August seventh for LG's event in New
York City I'll be able to make this one
actually I don't have to not go so
hooray and the LG invite their the
teaser for the event says great to have
you and the G in the two are comically
oversized so this is very obviously the
g2 launch event and I wanted to take
take your temperature on this guys
because I am I didn't think I was going
to be too excited for the LG optimus g2
we just gave away an optimist g it is on
its way to Julian and Australia for as a
result of our giveaway last week and a
wheel I think a lot of us really liked
the G here at Pocket now I know I
certainly did it was responsive and and
the hardware was very pretty but I
wouldn't have been very excited for the
g2 if it weren't for these leaks showing
this cool stretched nexus 4 esque design
so I'm pretty jazzed about it and I like
the volume rocker on the back what do
you leave things on Stevens not excited
rocker on the back you don't I know and
we know Taylor's opinion this because
you wrote an editorial about it so you
can chime in in a second why don't you
like the volume rocker on the back it
doesn't work for how I hold the phone
when I'm watching videos or something I
hold it by the edge and I like to be
able to fiddle with the volume control
sira do you just like to have it thumb
accessible and you don't want to reach a
finger on back I've got this whole thing
out my pinky propped underneath to hold
the bona fingers wrapped around the eggs
their their position to hold it the same
time where volume plenty to it I'm back
I'm gonna be afraid up in a drop it or
something and put on a phone call it's
it's nice on a phone call that would oh
I don't make phone calls always watch
how many of us do but David Taylor you
like the idea yeah well I was saying
basically exactly what Stephen was
saying it's a brilliant idea for those
who talked on the phone a lot because it
exists in Chile where your index finger
rests it just rest there on the back of
the phone but when you're using it for
anything else it kind of poses a problem
unless the buttons are really easy to
press or maybe they're capacitive but
then you might accidentally change the
volume and you've got a whole it's kind
of a we need to see it first like have
it in our hands and figure out how it
works more than then guess at it while
we're talking about button placement I
have a theory about those the droid
ultra off-center buttons yeah what if
it's optimized for right-handed users
because I ended and screw those guys
everyone in my immediate family is
left-handed except me it odds are
million to one don't you feel special
yeah they're almost a bunch of sinister
people I don't know what to tell you but
what if it's slightly over to the side
because most people are right-handed and
you know when you're holding a bone in
your right hand your thumb maybe the
center's not the least this phone you
know four point five five inches in size
your thumbs not going to go to the
center by depaul it's gonna be a little
off to the left right no see I don't
know I would move the buttons to the
right in that case because if I'm right
handed he was in the phone one-handed
yeah I don't want to be stretching my
thumb all the way over the left side of
the device and I certainly don't to be
doing that more than I would if they
were center this is the L and I don't
know x I don't want to believe that
Motorola would be completely ignoring
the fact that there are a lot of
left-handed people in the world this is
what I have been championing this is a
very likely hear you but you know they
are guys they are totally this is the
secret they're totally rearranged
ebinger tap and hold on them and you can
drag them anywhere device you can move
them around to the side if you want that
would be motive role as hell first to
optimize a phone for use with feet like
I mean I don't know it I think somebody
just can this Joe's taking it I think
someone had just screwed up in photoshop
so as people normally do with these
renders like a nice rest in the market
apartments like man this is gonna keep
them busy for two weeks talking about
her note a big it's like one of those
google little itty-bitty hints that
google drops yeah and and they wait to
see if anybody actually notices in three
weeks after they drop it people like oh
my god because i stared at impressive in
if I didn't wait too long you know can I
tell you weak in the star trek into
darkness screenshot likely no yeah yeah
the one right where they hid a piece of
crucial information about the film in
the same frame as the half-naked Alice
Eve that one yeah so nobody saw it yeah
um I'm sucky at EDD gent at finding
those leaks by the way cuz this LG one
that I've been talking about the g2
event like when we ran this headline
like LG all but confirms g24 August
seventh event I didn't really look at
the image all that closely it but I'm
like wow that's a really bold headline
how did they do that I don't know it's
just black velvet what's that and then
was like oh gee to grade to have yeah
it's gonna get a giant G and a giant to
on it that's pretty clever the and I
want to punch anybody who ever uses the
number two in the place of tio and I
understand what they're doing here that
is no excuse prince would kick your ass
I'm saying he's a small guy though he's
spread fierce what were you gonna say is
20 I don't remember we were talking
about 10 seconds ago
yeah it'll come by the past thought
trast um the consensus on the
speculation I suppose for this event
that's happening tomorrow so the press
event is happening tomorrow the
developer event is happening today and
tomorrow but the press event tomorrow
the speculation is that there will be
the new Nexus 7 which is likely because
it's been rumored to be launching in
July and it just pass through the FCC
last month so maybe you can do it but
though well in private yes and to why
would motorola be making a nexus yeah so
there's a lot that's kind of none of it
really matches up for me others at the
zoom was a great tablet bro yeah I had
one at 2i what the was it a cyborg when
others I bored yeah way to go verizon so
oh yeah yeah let's get close it out with
iOS before we had listener mail because
I kind of wanted to talk about this
earlier I wanted to segue into this with
their camera talk but this is something
that is exciting to me and the reason I
put it in the rundown is because I
wanted to get your opinion on it because
it's an odd cash where we talk about
things and no Taylor is going to say no
thank you i appreciate you leaving
captain troll Kevin for all TM it could
Apple give the iphone 5s a slo-mo camera
mode and news story from shut up Jeter
story from Stephen shank and there's I
guess this is based on code in the iOS 7
beta that there's a mogul camera mode
that would allow for shooting video with
frame rate as high as 120 frames per
second and normally cameras on
smartphones are shooting at 30fps and
then more recently companies like HTC
and Samsung have been throwing in this
kind of slow mo mode where it'll it'll
double that frame rate it'll shoot at
60fps and when you play it back at 30fps
it's really cool rather than just
slowing down 30fps footage which gets
kind of jagged Samsung was doing
something cool with this at the Galaxy
Note 2 launch event for the US where
they had a bunch of ping-pong table set
up Taylor you and I r at that event
together
I was not yes you were there oh yeah I
was just kidding yeah jerk you were
there and I was there working and didn't
see but like to yeah it's at the time
you know you weren't working we're
hanging out with the rest of us because
there was nothing else to report on
except the stupid verizon branding on
the button so you were hanging around
just wasting time with the rest of us
and mark that's when Marquez Marquez and
I had the ping pong game yeah I
disappeared for like an hour and a half
because it was actually here yeah I was
working actually I was working too i was
working in that pop up YouTube studio
for a minute I was like hey guys it's a
galaxy note 2 really don't have anything
new to show you but I'm in a cool studio
thank you samsung i had to shoot
hands-on videos of devices that looked
exactly the same he sure what was
different so oh yeah hard times and then
we went home because the verizon one had
a verizon button on it yeah and then we
went to go see a Kanye oh that was awful
to but I did down a lot of our viewers
that I did too I I met a David gamboa
that that night instagram personality
daveed and we had a wonderful time and i
would now we friends but anyway listen
we were playing ping-pong okay we were
playing ping-pong and samsung had a
galaxy note 2 setup to record in slo-mo
and kind of stream the feed to a TV and
you could see yourself playing ping pong
in relatively slow speed and pretty good
quality for how dark the room was so I
like slow motion video and I think it's
some pretty cool thing for manufacture
to be putting in but what is it make
sense that apple would try and play to
this thing remember when I dropped the
galaxy s4 active in the bucket of water
at the end of the galaxy s4 active
review you think I actually watch
reviewed your shirt back watch watch
thank you I want Thank You Stephen for
pandering I watched most of I dropped
this I dropped this phone in a bowl of
water and I shot it with an HTC one I
shot mostly review of my regular camera
but I shut this shut with my HTC One at
whatever 60fps and it's just so nice and
silky the gym to watch this this slow
motion action and of course if you're
not doing phone reviews you can take a
video of your kid on a swing or you can
take a video of a boat going through the
water or something you know whatever but
I why don't you think this is a
possibility Taylor or are you just being
a troll oh I'm just I'm just rolling
so do you think it's about I think it's
likely i think it's something that the
iphone is not historically had and i
think that they're gonna go for it
you're just not sure that the processor
that they're using is going to be able
to support maybe 1080p 120 frames per
second because that's where nobody's it
didn't well they all down sample the
resolution we needed at higher for it so
it's you know 720p if you're lucky you
need to go to gopro hero3 to shoot at
full res and yeah and high so basically
what you'd have to do is is dumb this
down to like Instagram status for for
super slow motion yeah but well you
wouldn't have to go that low you could
do it and they I have a feeling they
could do it in 720p at 60 FPS but this
is rumored up to 120 fps I don't know oh
yeah yeah so at 100 120 you'd have to be
at yeah I like 640 by 480 years this xga
video is super slow motion get out your
magnifying glasses right there's no
apples I got its custom chips for it
maybe it has something up its sleeve
that'll be able to handle all these
pixels yeah and she's gonna hell it's
all its handling iOS 7 to blue well you
know anything any on neon colors don't
need all that much technical process
issues aside I think idea rings very
true to something that apple would do
absolutely actually see the commercial
like I was like yeah there's so much
that happens inside a second piece yeah
another water drop all right yeah and
dots floating around all over the place
yeah random daughter so much we miss in
our day-to-day lives don't know where
will you can today that playing planes
is somebody in the background playing a
one string guitar bean we know in real
life the only thing that this is
actually going to be used for is like
slow motion video of your best friend
eating like a cheeseburger or something
oh let's go a dog shaking his head real
fast yeah oh of course when this drops
let's all like take photos of pouring
milk into serial really slowly like it's
a Kellogg's commercial you know we're
moving forward with this terrible
quality we are moving forward to answer
one piece of listener mail and then
where
we're gonna call it a show hey pocketnow
team says Alec song with the present of
the great low-light performance phones
do you guys think flashlights still
serve their purpose to brighten up the
environment or just be there to replace
the traditional torchlight so I had to
read this a couple times to write to get
the meaning this is a weird thing we ran
a new translation like issue I think
alex is asking considering the fact that
so many phones now have excuse me not so
many that a few phones now have really
great low-light performance does the
camera flash still serve its purpose
primary purpose as a camera flash or is
it going to be relegated to like
flashlights status for like finding
stuff in your dark basement you know to
man and I think it's a really good
question because I never use the flash
on my lumia or my HTC One burr cuz I
hate waiting on lashes let's now look
I'll make the camera yeah make photos
look unless you're really good at
composing unless you've got a large
distant object in the background at dusk
and you want to illuminate the
foreground you want to illuminate a
subject in the foreground with a with a
quick xenon flash blast I get that yeah
but never put a little pinprick LED
isn't going to do it right but a xenon
flash will I kind of Lumia 928 or
something like that but you're right the
dual LED spot is not going to do that
terribly well so yeah i think it's i
don't know i don't think there's really
an answer to this question I think
manufacturers are still going to ship
flashes on all their phones and people
are still going to use them for as many
purposes as they as they can but to me
this just recalled all of the the wonder
of the days of of not being able to
control your flash do you guys remember
when you couldn't light up your
spotlight on your phone manually like in
order to use it as a flashlight you had
to start rolling a video with the
spotlight on oh yeah oh yeah no you know
there's a little app or something oh no
there wasn't like they're not in the
days of blackberry or in the days of
dumb phones either like there was no
there was never any torture app you just
had to like start rolling a video with
your dumb phone or if I didn't even have
a camera on my dumb phone and it only
worked for about like 30 second right
because either one the video is limited
to 30 seconds or two you only had enough
memory
in the phone for 30 seconds idea exactly
so you still use the camera for like for
like 30 seconds stop it delete the video
and start again I still have so many old
pictures or videos on my hard drive of
like five years ago or seven years ago
with just like a dark hallway kind of
going by in the fringes of the cameras
vision because i'm using the thing as a
as a flashlight but yet so and i
remember guys when the in the app store
opened up in the i forgot which which
iphone it was that let us see the 3g and
the 3gs didn't have flashes right I
didn't the original didn't and the
throat injury just did not either so is
the for that was the first one with the
flash and when the first guy who
released a flashlight app for iOS like
previously that had not been allowed by
the App Store rules but he just decided
to try and submit it anyway and it got
through and because it had been so long
that anyone had tried to check like he
just racked up I think was 99 cents he
made like 30 thousand dollars in a week
or something like that because everyone
downloaded his flashlight out so anyway
I don't know that's it's this has been a
life nice launching point into nostalgia
but Alex I think people are still going
to use it people are not like us I don't
think I see a lot of people whenever
they're in the dark with their cell
phones taking shots with the flash and I
think people are still going to use it
equally as much if not more than as a
torch and it's good to have options it
is now you can choose to use it we
choose not to use it but there are those
situations where you want to do it for
you know compositional reasons so if you
can have the option why not exactly yeah
exactly right um I forgot to read that
email earlier the one I told you about
remember oh that one no yeah no
scrolling to my tabs and I found it
again besides I thought it was yeah I
thought it was funny because it starts
with do your purchasing manager yes dear
purchasing manager this is Jackie from
son Ryan technology in China the new
cell season is or has been coming we
recommend you
our hot selling products and model
number s are 108 portable pocket power
charger for your reference ah or other
problem for other portable chargers
products in our website for your choice
Sincerely Yours Jackie O I'll see that's
nice it's the personal touches yeah I
like that person purchasing man well you
know it's kind of like addressing a
letter to like dear hiring manager or
dear you know like yeah this is my dad
yeah let's talk about one more thing
this comes to us from Ryan by the way I
want to mention listeners that we have
some really awesome pieces of mail in
here that I can't get you on this one
because we don't have the right people
on the show Stan we Tyler robot we do
also sound horrible so we just have to
end the show as quickly as possible but
we're going to get to your really
specific Android questions in a future
episode once we have the proper people
here Steven your conditioning yeah and
arrogance yeah we got to get Taylor off
the show before he before he completely
expires but this is from our friend ryan
field again ryan recently got a galaxy
s4 and he's okay with the plastic bill
but he says i was wondering if there was
a solution to the cheap feeling that
some lows i'm writing you today to say
that i've found the solution on ebay
there are replacement backs for the
galaxy s4 that are made of aluminum here
is the link and what I'm doing in the
skype chat right now is dropping that
same link to you gentlemen and I'm
clicking on the link right now just so I
can see what's going on and yes there's
a brush metal battery back cover for the
galaxy s4 and you know what I gotta tell
you it looks pretty good it looks like
the back cover for the galaxy note 2
actually it looks like that kind of same
horizontal brushed thing it's got some
machined holes for the speaker phone
down the lower left and it even has a
nice little rim flange around the camera
to brighten that up a little bit and it
looks like comes different different
colors so that's pretty cool um I
wouldn't I if I had a galaxy s4 I would
probably buy this I would be a little
concerned about how the radio
performance would would do you know
because that's not a phone that was
designed for a metal back cover but if
you're willing to to lose a couple dbm
maybe and
feel like you're carrying a metal phone
I think it sounds like a good idea
that's not bad looking no no baby I mean
we can if you guys want will drop the we
drop the link in the in the rundown so
that your biscuit you're in town for
paying with paypal I have been dead
against them sort of it oh that's not
actually metal Oh what look at the
inside is plastic uh whoa well yeah it
is isn't that yeah it's plastic what is
this lesk what is this garbage hey Ryan
we don't know what's going on there
might look at the fight wait wait look
at the mirror image yeah features
materials metal and plastic metal and
plastic red that's what I was just
getting chromed up blasting I wonder if
it's just like this yeah like a brushed
on or I sprayed on layer of pho I wonder
if this is basically it I like thing
yeah we should get one and find out yeah
we should you know what I love I like
that the galaxy s4 branding is blurred
out on these shots even though it's very
obvious that it's one of the galaxy s4
cuz cuz it's countered and I remember
getting a bunch of was it sony memory
stick well that so we had their
proprietary memory cards for the PSP and
order it from some chinese site and it
comes with this little sticker over and
you peel it off and it says sony
underneath i have no faith is this an
actual sony product but right when a
sticker on it and everything's kosher oh
yeah of course it's just like putting
that round disc sticker over the apple
logo on any laptop on TV yes and you're
like oh let me know there is yeah your
sticker yeah those nice well I thank you
guys for for helping me Ryan thank you
for sending that in we would be very
interested to see to hear from anyone
who's bought one of those will drop the
link in the rundown and we'll we'll talk
about those weirdo covers maybe never
maybe next time we just don't know Alex
thank you also for your question about
spotlights and for allowing us to
reminisce about the days of dumb phones
as you overnight of those apps good see
final note here while we're still
talking about alternate cases here has
anyone seen this guy hooter
and a galaxy note 2 into something like
a 270 gigabyte storage 8,000 milliamp
hour handset no plea you need to share
that link i will try and pull it up he
basically just put a huge battery on it
an alternate back and a microsd to SD
adapter and bought a thousand-dollar 256
gigabyte SD card wow that is awesome
that guy doesn't need a computer it is
going large oh man please please please
share that with me because I think I
kind of want to write about that or do
something with it amazing cool well cool
thanks for that interesting note and
Stephen thanks for starting off the show
talking about what it's like on the news
side of the team I don't think we get
your perspective enough and it'll be
great to have you back on the show again
soon ain't no thing come back anytime
you want sweet man thank you and Taylor
as usual I've had a difficult time
overcoming you know the difficulties of
you being my co-host but I think we've
survived another word yeah of course um
can I just add that I had to transfer
one of the first suits transfer be first
transformer pad whatever it was in yeah
he pad pad transformer whatever get
around uh I had a close to 300 gigabytes
on that thing why is it oh wow that's
heinous like crazy so I gotta go restore
one of my old hard drives now that
talking about all these extorted
capacities I realize in bubble wrap I
have this crashed hard drive from my an
old laptop I'm sitting in my closet so I
got to take that to like a data recovery
place because now i want to see all my
old pictures none man should bring your
wallet with you I know I know oh it's
sad okay anyway while I go do that while
Stephen goes and reports on the news and
