happen that it even included skyscrapers
we go hands on the samsung focus s and
tell you all about it and tango video
chat goes live for everyone we show you
how it works all this and more coming up
right now hello everyone I'm hi I'm
Eddie Vetter with pocketnow.com and
welcome to Windows Phone view the show
we wrap up all this week's good and bad
inside the mold of Microsoft's Windows
Phone platform let's talk this week off
with what's good well as we mentioned
last week Microsoft had their windows
phone launch event in New York City and
well it seems that we're throwing
everything out even the kitchen sink
these guys went to the point of building
this Windows Phone skyscraper building
two for the event and our own Adam Lane
was there to cover it with celebrities
like VIN rock from Naughty by Nature the
event was really good in Adam even had a
chance to play with some future windows
phones in the pipeline and even filmed
some video for us so make sure you hit
the links in the description and the top
until you tell us what you think about
the Windows Phone launch events in the
comments down below and well since we
started with our weeks coverage make
sure you catch Adam lanes recent
unboxing and videos of the samsung focus
s from AT&amp;amp;T so far the device does not
disappoint it brings the iconic design
from the samsung galaxy s2 from android
to Windows Phone and well it brings
really great specs to the table the Vice
performs really well the design is
really thin and this is pretty much the
best of the best for windows phone right
now so make sure you hit the links for
the videos and hit the link of the
description for the full list of specs
and everything you can expect on the
samsung focus s and what about nokia
this week well so far we have some
leaked images of some sort of tango
champagne or champagne tango phone which
seems to bring some mid-range specs to
the windows phone arena nothing really
big now interesting enough we have no
keep probably working on bringing their
Lumia 800 with LTE for AT&amp;amp;T now don't
hold your breath with that one because
so far we know that Windows Phone 7
doesn't support LTE and we are expecting
Apollo within the last quarter of next
year to bring LTE support so we don't
really expect
to happen but aside from that it seems
that the partnership does get better
because somebody already figured out how
to hack out the music application from
nokia and bring it to everybody else so
hit the link in the description for
details on how to get it and now let's
talk about video shots so far all mango
phones bring a front-facing video camera
but no applications take any advantage
of it whatsoever but that ends right now
because tango has just brought their
free video chat application for windows
phone 7 and it actually works both a
platform with other platforms watch Adam
lanes recent video on how to get tango
on your device and how it works and what
makes it even better as the fact that
you don't really need a front-facing
camera to use tango you can actually use
the back camera though you'll have to
use a mirror or something to actually be
able to see the person that's on the
other end so watch Adam lanes video
which is really good with the link
upstairs and tell us what you think
about tango it's completely free and it
works with other platforms and while
speaking about great software making it
to Windows Phone 7 Spotify has just made
their official debut on the marketplace
the app is obviously free though sadly
you're going to have to pay 10 bucks if
you want to actually use it for
streaming on your Windows Phone device
within the spotify account you can
actually log on with Facebook or with
your spotify account if you want we
don't recommend you linking that to
Facebook but aside from that it seems to
bring a special different sort of arena
for music though again if we if
Microsoft didn't have the zune pass for
Windows Phone we could call Spotify
compelling but you're going to pay the
same money for one service or the other
we really don't see a point there but
again you have the option you have a
spotify account you can now use it on
your Windows Phone device and well you
can also use a zune pass if you don't
like it so far zune pass is our favorite
but spotify is making a really good job
and it actually works multi-platform if
you're coming from android or iOS and
want to use this on with those phone 7
that is our for the goodness continue
all with what's bad and let's begin
talking about phones now it's kind of
funny that we need this for the bad
section but sadly it seems that
manufacturers are not doing a good job
in telling us when their phones are
going to be out I mean our HTC Titan
review is already live and so far we
still don't know when the time is going
to be released but we finally dug deep
and found the dates November 20 this is
going to be your date for you to find it
on retailers but that's pretty much it
for the Titan aside from now let's talk
about the Nokia Lumia service when are
they going to come to the United States
so far nobody has any dates and well it
does seem that other people in Europe
are actually having a hard time finding
one unlocked because nokia apparently
doesn't want to sound that way not
really sure what to make of this or what
to expect from nokia in the future but
we are expecting these devices to make
it here soon at least on early 2012 if
they're not already pushed out by the
competition it's a great device but if
you're not really doing a job in
pointing it to your masses hey iOS is
really pushing this so they really need
to get their act together that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm hi Matt ivetta remember to
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
