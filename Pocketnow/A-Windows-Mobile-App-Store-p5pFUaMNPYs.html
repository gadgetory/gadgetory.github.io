pocketnow.com
and in this video we're gonna take a
look at the windows mobile application
store done by hand Ango it's called in
hand and it's actually been around for a
while now but most people don't talk
about it most devices don't come with
the program pre-installed
although the sony ericsson xperia x1
will have it so I thought it would be
kind of cool to take a look at in hand
and see how it does for an application
store now I've already installed the
program so I'm gonna go into the Start
menu go to programs and click on in hand
right here now this program tries to be
a bit more than just a application store
it also lets you get to the weather see
some traffic with real-time traffic data
and even see a report on stocks it's
trying to be kind of a hub for all kinds
of information but I'm gonna focus on
just the application store aspect of
this so this is the kind of main screen
it's not too flashy it's kind of ugly
the good thing about this whole
interface and you're gonna see that it's
it's not flashy at all throughout is
that it's fast which is which is a
really important thing to have in an
application store so I'm gonna start off
I'm going to go right into software and
here's what we get we get a menu so we
can go to Best Sellers recommended
what's new we can go by category so I'm
just gonna start off at bestsellers and
click on there and we get a list and the
list is simple we don't get the entire
catalog of Han dango software for
Windows Mobile but just certain ones
although you can search through the
whole catalog to find the software that
you want you don't get to see your
ratings on the screen like you can in
the iPhone application store if we want
to find out more information about a
particular title we just tap on it we'll
get a rating which is good although I'm
not sure if this is five stars out of
five stars or five out of six it doesn't
really tell you that and then it tells
you a little description you can also go
on to click screenshots and it'll
download them from the Han dango server
which is kind of nice you can see an
animated screenshot that will go through
different screens of the program now
unfortunately there is not a trial
functionality so you can't download a
trial although with the iPhone
application store you can't do that
either if you go to Han dangos website
you can get a trial of pretty much any
piece of Windows Mobile software so it's
unfortunate that they didn't port this
over to the in
and application okay now I'm going to
take you through the process of actually
buying a piece of software I have this
hooked up to my hand dango account on on
the computer and it has my credit card
information in there so just like the
iPhone you can instantly download
applications just as long as you log in
so I'm gonna search I'm gonna go to
software I'm going to search for chess
I'm gonna get it inexpensive chess game
just so I can demonstrate I'm gonna do
search I'm just gonna do proceed over an
EVDO connection right now so it's pretty
fast and I'm just gonna go to the first
one I see here these are all the chess
programs called rampart chess I'm going
to click buy and I'm gonna cut out for a
minute as I log in okay so here we are
and I'm covering up the screen just so
for security reasons from a year we can
press Continue and you can enter a
promotion code if you have a coupon or a
10% off code or something like that but
a click continue and it's doing an order
verification that's purchasing right now
and it says do you agree to pay this
price it's 1295 and I'm going to say I
agree now it's important to note that
Windows Mobile applications are more
expensive than those on the iPhone
platform and that's because the stores
like hand Ango and pocket gear take a
higher percentage from developers so
they have to price the applications
higher hopefully this will change in the
future if if Microsoft comes out with a
sky market platform to deliver mobile
software and charge a lower percentage
but you should expect that if you're
gonna get premium software for Windows
Mobile it's going to be more expensive
ok so here I am now no software
activation required and I'm gonna click
download now and you're gonna see it
downloads pretty fast and you can't do
simultaneous downloads unfortunately
from hand Ango in hand but that said the
downloads are very quick faster than
they are on the iPhone because I think
the applications are a little bit
smaller in most cases so it
automatically launches the file and
starts to install it which is great
seamless experience ok and it's done and
now I can exit the program or I can just
go right into the programs menu and find
the application I think it's going to be
listed up in
it's an email message is gonna be listed
up in games and yet there it is rampart
chess and here we are we're done so hand
an go in hand is a really good piece of
software actually it's very fast it's a
seamless experience that lets you search
for software pay for it download it and
install it all within a few minutes the
only trouble is that the the interface
isn't very good-looking as it is in the
App Store on the iPhone now you can get
the software by going to hand Ango comm
slash client and from there you'll be
able to download the software directly
to your phone through an SMS or you can
use the the installer for your desktop
now I should note that I tried to get
this to work on the HTC Touch pro but
unfortunately wasn't listed in the list
of compatible devices or some reason nor
was the HTC touch diamond2 I think hand
Ango needs to update their list but as
you can see here see here I'm using the
Verizon the X 60 900 and it works just
fine and I'm sure it will
on any other cube eg a Windows Mobile
touchscreen device and it also works on
Windows Mobile standard non touchscreen
so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
