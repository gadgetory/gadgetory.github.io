free application to fill in the windows
marketplace plus you search through
deals you can search through nearby
deals and can even search by stores in
your area so here it can be Target and
it has many different deals to choose
from I can go back to the home so now
all I have to do is click on the barcode
scanner here you can use my a camera to
find a barcode and when it's found that
product it will show me the best deals
online as well as locally VEVO is a free
application of L on the windows

we're able to do that without having the
meter run out we can ask or the highest
points possible and if we get major air
