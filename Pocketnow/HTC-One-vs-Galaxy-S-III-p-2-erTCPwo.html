galaxy s3 hey guys it's Brandon minimun
from PocketNow and in this video we're
gonna compare them let's get to it okay
starting things off let's talk about in
hand feel the galaxy s3 is definitely
the lighter of the two at 133 grams
coming in at 10 grams heavier is the HTC
One and the reason that it's heavier is
because it's gotten metal the galaxy s3
is all plastic which means that it feels
lighter in the hand some people like
that and some people don't but the metal
feels very high-quality on the HTC one
another thing that you get with the
all-metal back here on the HTC One is
that it deters fingerprints so
incredibly well the best we've ever seen
when we review this one we're not gonna
call it a fingerprint magnet magnet like
we seem to call every phone kind of like
the iPhone 5 the metal here really
deters fingerprints although if you get
the black version that doesn't exactly
hide the fingerprints very well on the
galaxy s3 with a hyper glaze coating on
the back especially if you have pebble
blue or the black or the red or any of
the other darker colors like brown a
huge fingerprint magnet on the back even
on this white version you can see some
smudges as I'm just touching along the
white area now something again on the
galaxy s3 you don't get on the HTC One
is a removable battery so if we take off
the back we you reveal the 2100 milliamp
hour battery a bigger battery here on
the HTC One and it really needs it
because it's got a much higher res
display we'll talk about that in a sec
we can add storage here on the galaxy s3
you cannot add storage on HTC One this
particular model has 32 gigabytes you
can expand the galaxy s3 with a 64
gigabyte card and add 2 onboard storage
now back here we also see the cameras 8
megapixels and 4 megapixels but HTC says
megapixels don't matter we don't really
agree you can go low res and have
higher-quality images but they won't
look good on a very high resolution
display like an iPad or a Nexus 10 but
we can say that the HTC One does take
very very good low-light shots but the
galaxy s3 seems to take slightly sharper
shots and wait to the full review will
have full comments and comparisons on
the cameras between these two devices
now in terms of other hardware specs
while they're on their back which one is
thicker well you can't tell by this
camera angle but the HTC One is slightly
thinner
especially along the edge HDC does a
neat little party trick here where the
edge is super slim over here on the
galaxy s3 you kind of have to go all the
way back and it's it's kind of the
entire thickness is how thick it is
whereas on the HTC one the entire
thickness is here and this is what you
feel in your hands so the HTC One
definitely feels lighter in hand
compared to the galaxy s3 now if we
stack them kind of front front ways if
that's a word
the HTC One is less wide but as you can
see it's more tall even though the HTC
One is a smaller screen it's more tall
and the way that the reason that that is
is because you've got the boom sound
this dual stereo front-facing speakers
which make a huge difference which makes
the HTC One much much much louder than
the galaxy s3 now over here in terms of
button configuration we've got the good
old Samsung button configuration with
the home button in the center some
people love it some people hit it got
back and menu on HTC One they've removed
the multitasking button so we have a
home button down here some people say
it's awkward but I don't think it's that
bad and a back button new code suggests
that there's actually a button behind
the HTC logo which would be super
awesome it would be nice to restore the
home button back to the center there but
this just feels more natural to go back
to the center another interesting thing
to notice is that the HTC One is doing a
good job at deterring finger prints on
the front as well as the back as we
mentioned the Galaxy s3 is getting
mucked up real quick with lots of finger
prints so let's do a boot up test let's
see which one turns on the fastest
they're both off right now I've got the
power button on the top here with an IR
blaster the galaxy s3 doesn't have an IR
blaster but the four will but you know I
don't think anyone cares about IR
blaster anyway so tap an old one two
three go see which of these guys starts
off faster the HTC One was much faster
it's got fastboot which we left turned
on because it's on that way from the
factory so you might as well leave it on
and the first thing you'll notice when
they come on is the screens they are
very different we've got an S LCD three
here on the HTC One the resolution is
full HD 1920 by 1080 on the galaxy s3
we've got 720p so 1280 down by seven
20 across its amoled so what we're gonna
do here is jack up the screen brightness
to a hundred percent on both of these
devices so you can see the difference in
screen quality very different screen
technologies if we go up to display here
and display there we go to brightness
turn off auto brightness max that out
brightness auto brightness off maximum
screen brightness and the HTC one does a
really good job at staying contrast II
so if we try to go to a black page
actually let's go back over there you
kind of see the blacks over here even
though this is an LCD panel it's a very
very high quality LCD panel that has
awesome characteristics and it's
definitely brighter than the HD then the
it's definitely brighter than the galaxy
s3 now something that we want to look at
here is viewing angles so let's go into
the Google Play Store you maybe get some
whites on the screen so we can compare
apples to apples here all right there we
go
whites so you get kind of that mucky
kind of white there on the galaxy s3
because of the AMOLED screen so let's go
back to the exact same screen so again
we want to compare apples to apples here
so I'm gonna tilt the screen and pretty
good viewing angles on the galaxy s3 you
can kind of see it from the side there
if you ignore the reflection over here
on the HTC one if we turn it to the side
has crazy insane nuts uh viewing angles
and we saw this on the droid DNA and I
should mention that both of these
devices are running Android 4.1.2 the
official versions that come from the
manufacturers now let's go ahead and run
some run a benchmark real quick quadrant
standard we've got a quad core Exynos
processor this is the international
version with one gigabyte of ram and of
course the qualcomm snapdragon 600 with
two gigabytes of ram on the HTC one
processors will vary by region but these
are both the international versions so
let's see how they compare in the
benchmarks and the benchmark results are
in we get 5500 on the galaxy s3 and a
smoking 12000 on the HTC one of course
benchmarks don't tell the entire picture
it's just one way we use to compare
devices let's check some day-to-day
performance stuff for example how fast
occations open so let's go to the center
panel here we're gonna launch the Play
Store for one two three go see which
opens first okay about the same there
pretty much literally the same let's
check the camera one two three camera
pretty much the same I could not detect
a difference could you actually let's go
back into a Play Store and install an
application see which installs it faster
so let's go to top three not trying to
pay for an app right now we'll go to
Instagram let's install Instagram hit it
at the same time okay they are
installing we can watch them here for
the notification shade see which gets
done first it actually looks like the
galaxy s3 might win let's see installing
installing successfully installed and
successfully installed the galaxy s3 was
actually about half a second in front of
the HTC One which is very interesting
let's go to the YouTube app one two
three YouTube faster on the HTC one
although nothing really showed up yet
yep faster on the HTC One now let's jump
into the web browser and do some web
browsing speed tests it looks like we're
already loading the same page so that's
good we're coming up on the same page
and let's see which loads faster
watching the progress bar can HD so you
want to finish first we're gonna stop
the galaxy s3 move around on the page
very smooth everything's loaded into
memory it's not really that big of a
page likewise on the HTC one let's pinch
to zoom see which clears up text faster
one two three release slightly faster on
the HTC One both of these devices has a
little bit of white stuff going on when
you go back let's go to the home page of
pocket now see what you gets there first
alright it's loading up on both watching
the progress bar here and finish first
on the HTC One now one of the benefits
of having such a high resolution screen
I know a lot of people say is there a
difference between 720p and 1080p here's
one such a difference if you look in the
web browser at the zoomed out view you
can actually read the text there are so
many pixels on the screen that text at
the zoomed out view is actually readable
on the galaxy s3 we should decide to go
to sleep you can kinda retexe but not
really and we can just see that the page
looks better here on the HTC one with
the really bright whites and the
fantastic contrast a little bit deeper
blacks just a little bit on the galaxy
s3 but that's what you get when you get
a Super AMOLED screen where a tap on
this link one two three go watching the
progress bars at the temp HTC one finish
first and look at Steve Ballmer's face
little oversaturated here on the galaxy
s3 a little more even toned
I don't think Ballmer is that tan that's
just the AMOLED screen doing its thing
so it looks like the HTC One is a little
bit faster in web browsing than the
galaxy s3 but really not buy that much
both perform very well to do a screen
rotation speed test exactly exactly at
the same time now let's talk a little
bit about software we've got TouchWiz on
the galaxy s3 and HTC Sense 5 on the HTC
one there's a lot of differences here so
HTC has added this thing called
blinkfeed which lives wherever you put
it on your homescreen and you can't
remove it which is kind of annoying but
hey it's Android you can run a
third-party launcher if you hate it
which brings forth information I've got
it set up to show Twitter and Facebook
and Engadget and some other sites that I
like on the galaxy s3 you get a more
standard Android homescreen experience
just as many pages as you want you can
pinch to zoom out well you can do that
over here too you can add and remove
home screens and then you get into the
app tray and HTC Sense does some weird
stuff with the app tray it starts off at
the top here and you get the time in the
weather and it's kind of weird to have
the time up here right because the time
is right over there on the galaxy s3 you
get a much more standard almost stock
like app tray experience and so you
scroll down here on the HTC one scroll
to the side paginate it to the side like
a nexus 4 for example
but again third-party launchers I can
can change the whole entire experience
if you don't like what you see and of
course you see these skins throughout
other parts of the operating system as
well so we've got the TouchWiz with the
thick blue bars we've got the quick
toggles no quick toggles here so in
terms of which interface feels lighter I
would definitely say that sense finally
feels lighter than everything down to
the keyboard for example if we go back
into the browser and bring the keyboard
up the keyboard just looks less 3d it's
more flat it's more contrasting than
this which kind of looks like a 3d
keyboard kind of trying to be something
that it's not HDC did a good job at
keeping sense minimal and so the
hardware on the HTC one is much much
better than the Galaxy s3 it feels
better it deters finger prints it feels
better in the hand you've got the boom
sound which really equates to high
volume audio but the Galaxy s3 is no
slouch it still keeps up with the best
of the best thanks to a fast processor
well optimized software the latest
version of Android which is just
fantastic to see so if you're looking at
the galaxy s degree and you're wondering
if you should upgrade from your Galaxy
s3 and get the HTC One it really matters
how much the hardware means to you I
mean this has a beautiful gorgeous
screen which isn't to say that the
Galaxy s3 doesn't have a beautiful
screen but there's definitely a huge
difference in quality of hardware
although don't expect a huge jump in
performance if you upgrade to the HTC
One because it's very fast but it
doesn't blow away the galaxy s3 unless
you're looking at just benchmarks and as
we know benchmarks don't matter alone so
if you liked this video please give us a
thumbs up and keep an eye on the pocket
now video YouTube channel for more
comparisons of the HTC One and the final
review which will be coming up very soon
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
