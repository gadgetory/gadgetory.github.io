typing woes however there is another non
traditional keyboard on the market hi
I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket now and
this is the menu on keyboard a few
months back we explored an idea while
touchscreen typing is better than it's
ever been before thanks to trace typing
and predictive text we're not convinced
the standard layouts that work so well
on physical keyboards are the best
solution for typing on a touchscreen so
I spent a week using the rotary style
8-pin keyboard that was built on some
interesting science by the end of that
week I realized 8-pin at least in its
current form was not the answer in the
video I also mentioned one other
non-traditional keyboard min youum at
the time the minimum project was still
seeking funding as an IndieGoGo campaign
so it wasn't available for download
yesterday however the private beta for
IndieGoGo backers kicked off and I
instantly dropped what I was doing to
install the keyboard but first what is
min youum like the creators of 8-pin the
minds behind minimum question why we
still use an age-old key layout that was
first implemented on typewriters why
should we still use this layout who says
there isn't a better faster more
efficient method for inputting text on a
touch screen there are even a few
problems with existing soft keyboards
even the ones we've come to love like
swype swiftkey and even the stock google
keyboard they're big and take up
anywhere from one third to over one half
of the display they also require a
certain level of accuracy which means
you have to choose between either
accuracy or speed unless of course
you've mastered mobile typing are living
in denial and believe mobile keyboards
don't need to be improved any further
minium aims to solve both of these
problems the layout is actually nothing
more than a qwerty keyboard smashed down
into a single staggered row and it takes
no special training to type just a min
the general area of the key you want and
tap and proceed to the next letter the
hard part is learning to type in a
single dimension remembering that QA and
z are all in approximately the same area
if you take out the vertical dimension
to space you can slide your finger to
the right within the keyboard area or
enable the spacebar beneath to type a
word
isn't in minn um standard dictionary or
inter a symbol simply press and hold
near the letter or symbol you want and
drag towards it swipe to the right and
up for the return key to the left to
delete the last word and to the left and
up for settings finally for quicker
access to symbols and numbers swipe
downward on the keyboard you have to
learn to trust the keyboard to trust
that if you hit approximately where the
letters are it will suggest the right
word and just in case it gets it wrong
which does happen occasionally it offers
some alternate suggestions as well
that's where we've had the most trouble
with men youum there have been some
instances where we've been typing too
fast to catch the incorrect suggestions
on the fly and our sentences sometimes
don't exactly make sense the upside is
that correcting the incorrect word is
done by tapping it and selecting the
proper word in other words you do not
have to worry about typing everything
correctly the first time so long as you
remember to quickly glance through what
you've typed before you hit Send we've
only managed to spend a short time
typing and toying with min youum but
we're definitely impressed no it isn't
perfect but this is only the first beta
and it's already on a very positive
track that said there are a few things
we'd like to see added such as the
ability to learn your typing habits from
Twitter or Facebook and now standard
feature on many third-party Android
keyboards but in its current form it
does exactly as the development team
promises it allows fast sloppy typing
with large fingers and takes up only a
small fraction of the display we're
excited to see where this team will take
this keyboard because of its versatility
and scalability the team hopes to apply
the same technology too much more than
just smartphones namely wearable
computers and other miniscule devices it
will take some more time to tell for
sure but minium arte seems to be a
keyboard we could see ourselves using
day in and day out
be sure to give this video a thumbs up

more videos like this one and don't
forget to subscribe and follow us in all
the typical places twitter google+ and

you can find me on twitter at casper
