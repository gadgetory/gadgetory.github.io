now calm and you've seen our coverage
this far of the dell streak you've seen
our hardware overview and our software
reviews as well as our unboxing and now
it's time to give you our final word on
the device itself so let's get started
starting off and jumping right into some
of the pros of the device the main thing
is going to be the fact this device is
big the dell streak is a 5-inch gorilla
glass screen so it makes it much easier
to use by having a much larger canvas to
work with you can fit more widgets on
each screen more app shortcuts that sort
of thing so the screen size plus the
resolution really makes this device much
more usable also as mentioned the screen
is made out of Gorilla Glass what that
means is the screen is much harder than
a typical glass screen on a capacitive
device it's a lot harder to smash the
screen scratch the screen etc so that
means that you have to worry about the
device as much and the included sleeve
that Dell gives you is also an added
bonus to keep your device safe a lot of
the more recent smartphones pushing for
the front-facing camera and then dell
streak is no exception by giving you
both the back hammer and the
front-facing camera users can actually
make video calls with applications such
as fring and quick to other users so the
fact that Del included that front facing
camera keeps you up to date and gives
you a lot more usability out of your
device itself one of the biggest pros of
the dell streak is actually going to be
the devices speed navigating through the
apps through the home screens etc was
extremely snappy very little slow down
was to be had and the overall experience
was extremely enjoyable on this device
the battery life was also great while
it's only a 1530 our milliamp battery
which is very comparable to device like
the evo 4g with its fifteen hundred
million power battery the dell streak
was able to stay power for about a day
and a half on medium to high use
watching videos listening to music
making phone calls browsing the web
basic testing and running the device
through its course summing up the
positives of this device it is a very
well-built device with a metal casing
and the fact that the screen is much
bigger makes it easier to browse the web
see the entire web page in one view as
well as look at emails pictures that
sort of thing it just makes the entire
experience much more enjoyable and now
with time a touch on a few of the
negative to this device one of them is
going
to be the size yes the size is also a
pro whoever it's also a con walking
through a store such as a Walmart or any
other retail store you get where it
looks holding this big device up to your
head as you can see here it is a pretty
big size it's like walking around with a
zack morris phone another con was
actually pointed out in our software
overview part 2 video and that is the
microphone it is a pretty good-sized
microphone as you can see here it
actually almost spans the entire width
of the device however it almost sounds
like the voices and the sounds are
underwater people talking songs are
swimming under the water maybe this
device here has a defect or it could
actually be the entire streak line has
that issue we'll have to see what
happens in out del addresses that while
del does give you the front facing
camera as well as the typical back
camera the resolution on these two
cameras isn't too good you can see a lot
of the ISO noise and images appear very
blurry with sharp edges on the outlines
unfortunately the dell streak only ships
with android 1.6 what that means is a
lot of the new applications aren't going
to be compatible with the device right
out of the gate dell has said that is
going to be coming out with android 2.1
in the next month or so as well as
freely which is android 2.2 in the very
near future so once it is able to be
upgraded to that point this device will
be a true competitor if not one of the
better android devices out there overall
the dell streak is an extremely
impressive Android tablet now it's a
tablet plus a phone together it is a
little bit big for most people being 5
inches however if you do want the screen
you do want the increased functionality
with that larger screen this device may
be for you by having that larger screen
to work with the overall experience is
much more enjoyable and a little easier
to use with increased efficiency also if
you're a gamer playing a lot of the
games of the android market will be
great on this large screen with a higher
resolution of 480 x 800 the streak will
be released on 18 t in the very near
future but is also available right now
from the gree electronics and agree
electronics com overall the streak is a
true competitor to the android
atmosphere if you can get by the small
list of negatives such as the size as
well as the microphone sounding garbled
then the streak may be for you as always
