that's the five aspects Samsung is
shooting for with the new Galaxy Note 3
we're gonna see how well they've
accomplished that in a brief hands-on
michael fisher with pocket now let's get
to it so the deal will be galaxy note 3
and this is a flip cover this is the new
version of the S view cover here which
we'll show you in a bit when it's
outside of the case you can notice that
it is quite a bit slimmer than the stock
galaxy note them excuse me the galaxy
note 2 at 8.3 millimeters it's also a
hundred and sixty eight grams we'll talk
about how it compares to the galaxy note
2 in a direct comparison video but it is
quite light this flight thin packs at
category 4 LTE on board it's the fastest
type of LT available Samsung informs us
three gigs of RAM coming along under the
hood depending on which version you get
for which region you're looking at
either an octa-core or a quad-core
processor under their 3200 milliamp hour
battery only 100 members more than the
current Galaxy Note so with some
software optimizations as samsung tells
us will improve video playback time by 4
hours compared to the current model
Android 4.3 running on top of here on
this 5.6 8 inch Super AMOLED 1080p
screen device will come in three colors
when it is released and it should be
available to everyone in October of this
year globally cover it comes in three
colors if your covers come in nine
colors there's a whole bunch of new
software features as well if we can kind
of demonstrate here samsung has built
their software experience on the what is
it the dot the circle and the box so
this isn't the air view hovering circle
I'm not sure if you can see it on the
wallpaper there nothing really new there
but when you hold the button while the
dot is visible you get this wonderful
circular menu option with a bunch of
cool features Samsung is built in here
including things like action memo which
looks a lot like the current version of
S note but say I
to save Anton no just phone number
because he's an interesting fellow I met
and I want to share some thoughts on
mobile technology with him
or maybe palinka who knows we get a box
around the text and what you can do is
you can call that number that it
recognized and maybe that tool will give
it some trouble we can save it as a
contact we can email we can do a bunch
of stuff let's try and save it as a
contact just so you can see it we'll
save it to the device I don't care
that's fine
close enough Anton's with important an
important part is that his phone number
came in despite my sloppy handwriting so
there's that Samsung is also focused on
reinventing it's multitasking approach
to degrees so if you're bringing up the
circle again you select pen window you
can draw a window now well once you get
rid of the tutorial you draw a window
describing the area where you want a
special application to pop up you can
choose from a limited number of
applications would say you want to
calculate or don't overlap a text
message or an IM conversation you're
having you can have that it's in a
little pop-up window which we're
familiar with you can move it around but
what's nice about it is that you can
actually just you can define the exact
size of the box just some added
customization that may really enhance
the look and feel of the of the
multitasking experience on this device
multitasking itself is also still here
in the traditional fashion we're used to
drag an object over there drag this up
here but the dividing line between them
is now a little less convoluted couple
fewer buttons to deal with it looks you
know it's a little just more cleaned up
which we appreciate this realize we
didn't really mention the camera the
software on the viewfinders the same as
what we're talking about but on the back
we're talking about a 13 megapixel
shooter and Samsung has improved the
flash to a certain degree it is a you
can shoot a 1080p video at 60fps which
is really cool if you want to slow down
your footage and get some of that really
smooth high-speed action going on
there's also a high CRI Flash for low
light environments and of course the
crown jewel this is unfortunately not
going to be included on every Galaxy
Note 3 model but some models will
support 4k recording in addition to
1080p on that 13 megapixel camera and in
addition to that we've got ultra-high
quality audio we have various other
software enhancements Hardware enhanced
we're going to take a very long look at
this folks but this is just a quick look
such as it is quick might be stretching
the term the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 from
Aoife here in Berlin
Anton's behind the camera once again I'm
Michael Fisher with pocket now stay
tuned for much more as we explore this
device in others here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
