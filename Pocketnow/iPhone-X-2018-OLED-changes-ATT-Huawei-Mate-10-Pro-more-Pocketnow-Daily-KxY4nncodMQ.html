iPhone 10 might bring controversy with
LG displays leaks have a possible huawei
mate 10 pro for AT&amp;amp;T making an
appearance and a signature edition LG v
30 is crazier than anyone would ever
imagine
I'm hi Matt Ravenna and I apologize for
the late upload guys the schedule is
crazy and I am just trying to make ends
meet but this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for Apple devices
probably Best Buy is a good option right
now there are some deals and iPads
iPhones and accessories even wireless
chargers the only problem is when you
look at the deals they're not too good
still it's an option it's available you
can learn one of the description now
let's talk about the signature edition
LG v 30 which is definitely not a deal
it seems like it be 30 and pretty much
everything but a new color option and
the fact that it now brings six
gigabytes of RAM and all this is great
until I tell you the price tag
apparently depending on the market it
might grow up to the point of 1800 bucks
there is no point in buying that phone I
don't understand what's going on maybe
the numbers are wrong and listing we'll
report back if we learn more
now another device that went official
today at least in China is the HTC vive
focus this is the standalone VR headset
that HTC is launching the price tag is
not too crazy though I mean remember
when you would be able to buy the HTC
vive the whole ensemble of everything
for 700 bucks and this one is 605 or 650
the equivalent obviously depending on
which Bari you pick so that's not really
affordable at all we wish we understood
why now one device that we weren't
expecting to launch in the United States
mainly because the company never gets
carrier partners is Huawei with the may
10 pro but there are some leaked images
of emu Y and it is listed as an AT&amp;amp;T
variant of emui that is rather
interesting if Huawei does figure out a
way to launch in the United States with
a partner that would be awesome
competition is great and the Huawei made
set make 10 Pro is a great device
I can't wait to verify if it ends up
happening
and finally the very interesting and
possibly controversial news today have
to do with the iPhone 10 two things the
first one is not controversial it's
about the rumors that apparently there
will be three variants of the iPhone 10
all with face IDs so expect the possible
plus and we wonder if the SE is also
going to go that route but more
interesting apparently Apple is going to
partner with LG for this display and
here's the problem I mean LG this place
have been good I mean the power the
Apple watch for ages we've seen their
IPS LCDs on Apple products forever but
they're oh let's have been very
controversial in devices like the LG be
30 where - great but other people
complain about it and now obviously
Google has been dealing with tremendous
issues with the case of the ghoul pixel
to XL so it leads me to the question
today after everything that's happened
this year would you trust an LG panel on
the iPhone 10 next generation in my case
again I've never really had issues that
I consider significant but hey I would
love to know what you think in the
comments down below because definitely
these phones are not cheap the panel
should be great all the recent batch of
rumors of the iPhone 10 delays or what
could I take a picture of friends again
