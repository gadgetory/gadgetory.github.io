pocketnow.com
and this is a look at the hardware on
the HTC Desire but first let's talk
about specifications this is HTC's
fastest Android device that they sell
right now which means that the Sense
interface worked very very well we're
going to see that in an upcoming video
where we go through all the widgets and
all the programs it has a lot of
multitasking power so it's got a 1
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
running with Android 2.1 which is Eclair
it's got a tremendous 576 and megabytes
of RAM which like I said means you can
really multitask a lot with this without
it slowing down 512 megabytes of ROM it
comes with a 4 gigabyte micro SD card
installed right into the device it has
an AMOLED capacitive touchscreen we're
going to talk more about that in a
second it's got all of the wireless
radios you need a GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi FM
radio and of course it has HSDPA for
high-speed data if you live in Europe if
you're in the US you can only get edge
with this right now but this is at its
core Nexus One so if you really want to
have the features of the HTC Desire you
can get the Nexus One which is available
and pretty much every carrier in the US
right now
it's coming up with Verizon and probably
eventually will be on Sprint too so
let's talk about the hardware it looks
pretty much like a Nexus One when you
first glance at it except for a few
changes that we're going to talk about
like the buttons let's zoom in to the
top here well here we have a light
sensor in a proximity sensor and a very
nice touch from HTC is that where these
two slits are where the sound comes out
they actually have polished edges so if
I move it in the light you can kind of
see them glisten very nice little touch
from HTC the screen is 3.7 inches
diagonal compared to other devices like
the iPhone that's bigger so the iPhone
has a 3.5 inch screen but it's a lot
smaller than the HD 2 which has a 4.3
inch display so the resolution of the
screen is 800 down and 480 across so a
very high resolution display that's WVGA
so the colors look fantastic all of the
icons are very very crisp
not pixelated the screen uses AMOLED
technology so blacks are super black and
power consumption is also improved I'll
turn it on for a sec then just see at a
quick glance how dark the blacks are and
if I take another device like the hd2
you can kind of get a sense it's hard to
see on the video but the black is much
blacker on this AMOLED display we're
gonna talk more about the software later
let's zoom into the bottom here and by
the way this is the sort of brownish
bronze color the desire comes in two
colors this kind of brownish bronze and
also the silver so you can take a look
and it's kind of a nice color nice touch
down here we have a few things we have a
home button menu back and search and we
also have an optical d-pad which is
actually positioned perfectly for
one-hand usage it has a slight chin on
it so he can hold the phone like so and
it's tilted slightly this way so it
makes it very very comfortable to use it
also presses inward to act as a selector
so very nice positioning very nice
buttons down here and this rubbery
material that surrounds the buttons
continues all the way around the device
so it feels very sturdy in hand over on
this side we have a volume up and down
rocker it uses micro USB for syncing and
charging the other side is blank here on
the top we've got 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack HTC has held to its
promise that all of its devices in the
future are going to have this the last
you know 10 devices from them has had
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack then
we have this standby button here at the
top which is also adorned and the sort
of bronze slightly brownish color and
here on the back we have the five
megapixel camera and the large HTC
branding again looking back at the HD 2
they've really become a lot a lot less
subtle with their branding we've got an
interesting metal texture around the
camera I don't know if you can see that
there are little ridges it's not as
sharp as you'll find on the HD 2 which
sometimes can scratch a table if you're
not careful we also have an LED flash
and a very loud speaker I found the
speaker on this to be fantastic
down here it says with HTC Sense let's
pop off the the battery cover here back
here we have the 1400 milliamp hour
battery there's the 4 gig
bitin microSD card that comes with the
desire and of course that is where your
SIM card goes so overall another a piece
of stellar hardware from HTC it feels
really good at hand and I think it feels
better in a hand than the Google Nexus
One thanks to the rubbery coating all
around the device and also because of
this nice little chin that tilts the the
the optical d-pad towards the user so
I've got a lot more coming up on HTC
Desire be sure to give this video a
