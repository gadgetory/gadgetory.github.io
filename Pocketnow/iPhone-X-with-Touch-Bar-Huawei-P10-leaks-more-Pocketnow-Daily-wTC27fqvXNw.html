as far as to have a virtual buttons at
the bottom Huawei has already started
teasing its new p10 and we hear more of
the plans of what HTC might bring to the
table I'm Jaime Rivera recording in one
country editing over a flight and then
publishing in another story of my life
this is PocketNow daily official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market for a very decent smartphone
that's about a year old let's talk about
the ZTE axon Pro it's currently
available at Newegg for just $200 in the
64 gig variant if you're looking for a
32 gig variant that's just a hundred and
seventy-five bucks that's actually a
very good deal that we highly recommend
now other very interesting news that are
not yet official come from the Wall
Street Journal as the company's already
predicting that the next move for
devices like the Amazon echo or Google
home are that you will be able to make
phone calls and this actually adds some
very interesting functionality let's
just say that you're cooking something
and you just tell your Anna's on echo to
call somebody it'll obviously pick up
the call from your phone and do
everything for you that's actually great
we just wonder how the Amazon echo or
Google home are gonna handle multiple
devices for example we'll see a song
about HTC we actually did not stop
yesterday to talk about the company's
results because they were terrible but
the company has kind of already teased
what to expect for 2017 apparently it's
going to make a major shift when it
comes to VR and mobile something that it
did not pioneer but did an amazing job
with the vive not on mobile so let's see
how it plans to innovate on that other
department but then in another case we
hear that we might get up to five new
smartphones in 2017 we do know that the
new ultra is not the only device that
companies launching along with au place
so we cannot wait to see what we get
let's cool the spotlight over to huawei
for those of you wondering if all we're
getting it in the BC is the new Huawei
watch - that's actually not the case the
company has already begun teasing the
fact that we are getting the p-town we
already got a teaser video and now we've
got some unofficial renders that show us
what the phone might look like and it
looks extremely sexy in its back curves
this was one device we highly praised
last year in the case of
Mehring so we cannot wait to see what
the p10 is gonna be all about and
finally the very hot news today are
actually extremely interesting they have
to do with the iPhone X and how this
device is going to be different we've
been asking ourselves that specific
question for weeks
how does Apple plan to innovate and it's
10 years of iPhone and we hear that
apparently this device is going to be of
the size of your regular 4.7 inch iPhone
but the screen size in that chassis will
be five point eight inches if you do the
math and you remove the bezels that's
exactly what screen size you get but
apparently that is not it what we are
getting is actually just five point one
five inches of usable display and then
the bottom of the phone that bezel
that's apparently going to still be
there is going to be something very
similar to what the touch bar is on the
MacBook Pro and this is rather
interesting it could mean that touch ID
will be pretty much everywhere around
the bezel it's pretty much going to look
like a xiaomi me mix only this is
actually going to be part of the display
at some point or apparently that's what
rumors claim but it leads me to the
question of the day I mean what do you
think about this whole concept of the
iPhone next do you think it's doable do
you think it's a smart idea in my case I
think that thing is going to be amazing
I'm not really a fan of what Apple has
been doing over the last couple of years
we do need something like this a breath
of fresh air in the smartphone market
