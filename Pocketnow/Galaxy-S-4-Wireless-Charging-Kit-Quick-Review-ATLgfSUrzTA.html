for the galaxy s3 was announced
alongside that 2012 flagship but it
didn't arrive on the market until long
after well this year Samsung appears
committed not to make the same mistake
I'm Michael Fisher this is pocket now
and this is our quick review of the
wireless charging kit for the samsung
galaxy s4 the galaxy s4 doesn't ship
with wireless charging standard out of
the box so the wireless charging kit is
made up of two components the charging
base itself and the special battery door
that enables that functionality the
charger is vaguely dish-shaped a far cry
from the bold angular design of the tilt
view which we took a look at last week
and more along the lines of the Nokia
charging plate just much larger
available only in grey it's inoffensive
and it'll probably get along with
whatever you have on your desk without
standing out too much the device comes
with some straightforward instructions
for how to place your phone on it but it
doesn't ship with a separate adapter or
cable you need to use your phone's
existing wall charger to supply it with
power which we think is pretty lame more
on that in a second once you've got the
charger set up and ready to go you'll
want to install the new battery cover
which is thicker and more robust than
the stock battery door due to the
inductive coil within now it does
increase the phone's thickness but it
also makes it feel better in the hand
easier to grip and there's also no
question that this is a better looking
solution than our genki do-it-yourself
wireless charging mod for the galaxy s3
after that it's a simple matter of
dropping your s4 onto the pad to start
the charging process like the sticker
warns it's finicky about alignment but
once you've got it reasonably close to
the center of the charging process
starts quickly the device recognizes
when it's in range and the software
informs you that you're charging
wirelessly and also a green LED
illuminates to let you know the device
is suckling juice also because the pad
uses the Qi wireless charging standard
you can charge other Qi enabled phones
like the Nokia Lumia 920 on this charger
as well of course the reverse is also
true charging the gs4 on alternate Qi
enabled chargers will work too as long
as the battery covers installed for
those of you who may already own a Qi
charging pad
want to save some pennies speaking of
money Samsung doesn't really break from
tradition here these accessories are in
a word overpriced the wireless charging
pad itself will run you of 4999 direct
from Samsung but the battery door which
again is required to make the whole
thing work is the real insult it'll cost
you thirty nine ninety nine that's a
total of ninety dollars full retail to
charge your phone wirelessly and
remember you don't even get an extra
charger out of the deal Samsung's not
the only one to have done this in palms
touchstone kicked off the whole sector
four similarly ridiculous prices back in
2009 but even for wireless charging fans
it sure is a tough pill to swallow
ultimately though it's more convenient
than fumbling for a cable and it'll work
with many other qi enabled devices so
this may be worth it to you as we seem
to be saying a lot with Samsung products
these days you may not use or want the
feature but it is nice to know the
option is there if you do folks will
have a few more written impressions on
the galaxy s4 s wireless charging kit
available at pocketnow.com and our
written quick review and that will be up
on July third while you're waiting go
