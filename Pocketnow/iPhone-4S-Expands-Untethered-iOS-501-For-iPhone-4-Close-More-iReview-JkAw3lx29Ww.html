more countries and untethered jailbreak
for iOS 5.0 point one is cut into 8 more
base models and apples mate for ipod
will show support bluetooth all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm hi everyone and welcome to the
pocket now I review the show we go
through all the sweets cool and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start this week off
the cool i will keep selling more phones
and services across the planet first of
all the iphone for us is now being sold
in 20 more countries around the world
which includes Brazil Chile some middle
eastern countries like for example Qatar
Saudi Arabian well it's 20 countries so
hit the link in the description if you
want the full list now the sad part
here's that Brazilians at the end up
paying a thousand four hundred and ten
bucks for a 16 gigabyte model on the
official store now now that's crazy I
mean even if I phones were built in
Brazil why do they have to face so much
for a frickin phone and while Apple has
also begun rolling their itunes store in
Latin America for those of you didn't
know in the past you can all only buy
movies and music in the US store and
some other countries so it's really good
to see that Apple is now rolling out
that to other countries and along with
the launch of the iTunes Store you can
now also get itunes match
internationally though it's kind of
started in the rocky start because it
seems that I will even begun offering
refunds to people because apparently it
wasn't ready and then eventually it was
but still it's out there and that's
what's important so make sure you pay
for that because 25 bucks a month will
allow you to legalize all your music
legalized now an interesting note
recently shows that iOS app developers
make three hundred percent more money in
revenue and selling apps in the App
Store than in the android market now the
question here is what triggers that I
mean if there are more Android
smartphones in the market therefore
there should be more Android customers
now how is it that consumption habits
are different could it be that there are
better quality apps in iOS or could it
also be that there is simply a better
app store now leave us a comment down
below and tell us if you actually
purchase more iOS applications or not
speaking of growth
Morgan Stanley recently revised their
estimates and for what they expect for
apple to sell next year they're
expecting Apple to sell 190 million
iPhones in 2012 now probably the biggest
question will be war with all that
market come from well Android is not
losing any market and Windows Phones
also growing so it could also be the
fact that smartphones are being sold
more now than feature phones but aside
from that remember that RIM just
reported 71 percent loss and earnings 71
percent in earnings for their blackberry
sales now could it be the fact that well
to CEOs can't do the job of one imagine
that now Apple has recently released iOS
5.1 beta 2 to developers and well lots
of a postive improvements though sadly
not the ones we want probably be only
interesting what is the fact that you
can finally now delete photos from your
photo stream as you for example took
some photos that you don't like you
don't want to upload it to your photo
stream and then not be able to delete
them unless you delete them all there
are also some intimate pictures that
people take that they don't want to
share like for example for you know my
space and then well sadly it's just good
to see that it's happening but what took
you so long Apple aside from that what
we do get information about an ipad 3
coming as of iOS 5.1 beta 2 sadly no
iphone 5s mentioned so that could be
later on in the pipeline no battery
improvements yet people sorry about that
not sure what to make of that seems that
Apple's not having a really good time
with iOS updates now let's talk about
jailbreaks limits however the dev team
is very close to providing an untethered
jailbreak for iOS 5.1 on any device
that's rocky an a4 chip meaning the ipod
touch 4th generation and the iphone 4
and also the ipad first generation the
depth teams own the pot 2 g came on
record and tweeted that you can now
update safely to this OS because he's
soon to figure it out now interesting
enough it seems that things won't be the
same for those customers that have an a5
chip like for example those that have an
ipad tour and iphone for us now remember
that comex also brought a nun to their
jailbreak for the ipad 2 in the past so
it could be the case that they surprises
but it's so sad to see comex working for
apple now such an irony don't you
now moving on to this week's coverage
make sure you catch Brandon's recent
video on fatbooth ball booth and aging
booth I for one am NOT interested on
knowing how am I going to look when i
get bald in the future but hey it seems
to be a very compelling application
people love it and for a book a lot of
people are trying it it's on the top 10
apps out there so give it a try kind of
cool and we'll aside from that catches
recent article on how to get background
changes ah Notification Center for those
of you that have a jailbroken version of
iOS 5 on your device looks really great
give that a try and other recent news
have apt leading up with the made for
ipod team of developers and
manufacturers because well they're
planning to expand ins currently made
for ipod is only being supported for
wire devices and all of you wanted
something wireless you'd have to wait
some of them work some of them don't
because they're really expensive
currently airplay is only available
through Wi-Fi because of the protocol
and because of all the streaming that it
has to do so it seems it Apple's
planning to bring this to bluetooth
which is much cheaper for everybody
though sadly it will only work on
Bluetooth 4.0 and able devices that's
the catch so unless you have an iPhone
4s or macbook air you're currently stuck
if the future of airplay enabled made
for ipod devices will only support that
protocol so make sure you update your
device in the future and make sure it
has bluetooth 4.0 to
that does it for the cool let's continue
on with the not so cool in an
interesting note is the fact that Apple
never releases the same version of iOS
twice or even three times for that
matter and well and let's just release
the iOS 5.1 twice aside from the
official launch to customers of the
iphone for us because they want to fix
the errors for the invalid sim problem
that a lot of customers are reporting
now well I know the funny part they
haven't figured it out yet it seems the
customers are still complaining of the
prominent just wonder what's going on
with the Cupertino gang recently it
seems that their ability to fix iOS
problems is really becoming an issue for
them it probably need more jailbreak
team members out there and allowing them
to find my exploits anyways that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm hime every veteran give us
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
