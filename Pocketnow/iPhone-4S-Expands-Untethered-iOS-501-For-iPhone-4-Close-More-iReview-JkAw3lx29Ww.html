more countries and untethered jailbreak
for iOS 5.0.1 it's cut into eight more
base models in average late for iPod
will show support Bluetooth all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm hi everyone and welcome to the parka
now I review the show we go through all
the sweets cool and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week after the cool I
will keep selling more phones and
services across the planet first of all
the iPhone 4s is now being sold in 20
more countries around the world which
includes Brazil Chile some Middle
Eastern countries like for example Qatar
Saudi Arabian well it's 20 countries so
hit the link at the description if you
want the full list now the sad part
here's that Brazilians have to end up
paying a thousand four hundred and ten
bucks for a 16 gigabyte model on the
official store now now that's crazy I
mean even if iPhones were built in
Brazil why do they have to pay so much
for a fricking phone and well Apple has
also begun rolling their iTunes Store in
Latin America for those of you that
didn't know and the past you could all
only buy movies and music in the US
store in some other countries so it's
really good to see that Apple is now
rolling out that to other countries and
along with the launch of the iTunes
Store you can now also get iTunes Match
internationally though it's kind of
started in a rocky start because it
seems that I will even begun offering
refunds to people because apparently it
wasn't ready and then eventually it was
but still it's out there and that's
what's important so make sure you pay
for that because 25 bucks a month will
allow you to legalize all your music
legalize now an interesting note
recently shows that iOS app developers
make 300% more money in revenue and
selling apps in the App Store than in
the android market now the question here
is what triggers that I mean if there
are more Android smartphones in the
market therefore there should be more
Android customers now how is it that
consumption habits are different could
it be that there are better quality apps
in iOS now could it also be that there
is simply a better App Store now leave
us a comment down below and tell us if
you actually purchase more iOS
applications or not speaking of growth
Morgan's family recently revised their
estimates and for what they expect for
Apple to sell next year they're
expecting Apple to sell 190 million
iPhones in 2012 now probably the biggest
question will be where will all that
market come from well Android is not
losing any market and Windows Phones
also growing so it could also be the
fact that smartphones are being sold
more now than feature phones but aside
from that remember that RIM just
reported 71 percent loss in earnings 71
percent in earnings for their blackberry
sales now could it be the fact that well
to CEOs can't do the job of one imagine
that now Apple has recently released iOS
5.1 beta 2 to developers and well lots
of impulsive improvements though sadly
not the ones we want probably be only
interesting one is the fact that you can
finally now delete photos from your
photo stream as you for example took
some photos that you don't like you
don't want them upload it to your photo
stream and then not be able to delete
them unless you delete them all
there are also some intimate pictures
that people take that they don't want to
share like for example for you know
MySpace and then well sadly it's just
good to see that it's happening what
what took you so long Apple aside from
that what we do get information about an
iPad 3 coming as of iOS 5.1 beta 2 sadly
no iPhone 5s mentioned so that could be
later on in the pipeline no battery
improvements yet people sorry about that
not sure what to make of that seems that
Apple is not having a really good time
with iOS updates now let's talk about
jailbreaks wonders how did the Deaf team
is very close to providing an untethered
jailbreak for iOS 5.0.1 on any device
that's rocky an a4 chip meaning the iPod
Touch 4th generation and the iPhone 4
and also the iPad first generation the
Deaf team's own the pot 2 G came on
record and tweeted that you can now
update safely to this OS because he's
soon to figure it out now interesting
enough it seems that things won't be the
same for those customers that have an 85
chip like for example those that have an
iPad tour and iPhone for us now remember
that Comex also brought an untethered
jailbreak for the iPad 2 in the past so
it could be the case that they surprises
but it's so sad to see Comex working for
Apple now such an irony don't you
now moving on to this week's coverage
make sure you catch Brandon's recent
video on fad booth ball booth and Ageing
booth I for one am NOT interested on
knowing how am I going to look when I
get bald in the future but hey it seems
to be a very compelling application
people love it and for a book a lot of
people are trying it it's on the top 10
apps out there so give it a try
kind of cool and we'll aside from that
catch his recent article on how to get
background changes ah Notification
Center for those of you that have a
jailbroken version of iOS 5 on your
device looks really great give that a
try and other recent news have aptly
meeting up with the made for iPod team
of developers and manufacturers because
well they're planning to expand its
currently made for iPod is only being
supported for wire devices and while
have you wanted something Wireless you'd
have to wait some of them work some of
them don't because they're really
expensive currently airplay is only
available through Wi-Fi because of the
protocol and because of all the
streaming that it has to do so it seems
that Apple is planning to bring this to
Bluetooth which is much cheaper for
everybody though sadly it'll only work
on Bluetooth 4.0 enabled devices that's
the catch so unless you have an iPhone
4s or MacBook Air you're currently stuck
if the future of airplay enabled made
for iPod devices will only support that
protocol so make sure you update your
device in the future and make sure it
has Bluetooth 4.0 to
that does it for the cool let's continue
on with the not so cool in an
interesting note is the fact that Apple
never releases the same version of iOS
twice or even three times for that
matter and well and let's just release
the iOS 5.0 point one twice aside from
the official launch to customers of the
iPhone for us because they want to fix
the error is for the invalid symptom
that a lot of customers are reporting
now well I know the funny part they
haven't figured it out yet it seems that
customers are still complaining of the
prominent just wonder what's going on
with the Cupertino gang recently it
seems that their ability to fix iOS
problems is really becoming an issue for
them it probably need more jailbreak
team members out there and allowing them
to find large twits anyways that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm Haim every veteran give us
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
