what we had to go through to get to this
point you'll notice we lost Brandon I
like just put this way come next week we
are going to move to another way of
doing this podcast seriously
alright can you hear me now oh yes I can
hear you oh thank god
I know for real god what a mess like I
wonder if anybody at Google actually
uses hangouts yeah I think that's the
reason why they're canceling it or
whatever it is that they're doing cuz it
pretty no it's
they just know it's trash I mean they
have hangouts meet and I don't imagine
that that would that that would go into
YouTube live but let just put it this
way I know of a different way of doing
this that might actually make life
easier on everybody it just it just sort
all the work will be on me so we're
gonna be we're gonna probably move to
like Skype and Skype actually released
what they call creator features where if
you set it up a certain if you just hit
a few settings and settings every stream
from every caller audio and video can
become a stream for apps like OBS and
xsplit basically gamer apps so you can
create those streams and I can
manipulate them so that we're all in one
screen we don't even have to worry about
it like moving back and forth and then I
just stream that to YouTube live alright
alright yeah so you know ideally we
would have it so that I just make sure
all the audio stole oh my god so your
audio just went full slo-mo right now
really yes really
oh my god restore the worst service in
history this is the worst service in
history like I God in the problem is it
actually started off well I don't I
don't understand how Google could start
something out so well and then get it
wrong eventually is your audio back to I
can't hear you
I can't hear you like for example if I
disconnect the headphones and then
connect them back in I will it will
remain stuck to the speaker now I can
hear you okay there we go
good yeah so that means I have to
restart my recording
- still recording
I've got no worries I will figure it out
later Jules this is what you had to go
through god Jules I feel so bad for you
buddy miss you test alright so recording
again back on back on track in that case
let's see what our chad is saying did
you all watch a Star Wars trailer okay I
know I have not I haven't watched a yeah
yeah I haven't watched it yet I saw it
on the front page of YouTube and I was
really curious alright in any case let's
finally get the show on the road Brandon
thank you for falling on your sword for
us hi I said that we could like do this
on Sunday I'll get the Skype version of
the podcast running but you know what
let's just it's I made myself for today
next week we will be finally I need a
day off so know you guys are like Sunday
Saturday I'm like no I've been on I've
been flying so much I'm like now I need
a day off yeah even even the well we're
gonna talk about the event later but us
being in San Francisco which is not far
from me I still am recovering granted
you know we're not gonna get into like
the fun stuff that happened during that
trip but there was plenty of it but yeah
there's recovery going on right now so I
feel the exact same way
I'm actually very self conscious on my
voice right now so if my voice sounds
extra husky or raspy right now I
apologize everybody other than the
technical difficulty of it sounding
weird border to work yes it's a teaser I
saw things I recognize and I so oh my
god Anna bong what are you doing here
why don't you join oh because it's gonna
collapse the podcast that's true
nevermind we don't miss him anyways all
I know is that the trailer is called the
rise of Skywalker and I'm like wait a
minute
so what no I feel so I feel so ignorant
right now damn it where is it that's all
I saw the title that's all I saw but
anyways we're going to get the show
going so as long as all true that's why
we're here
yes exactly all right let me give it a
beat take a quick sip of this
bulletproof to keep me going after Oh
God
okay here we go the weekly is supported
by the Oregon State University eCampus
do you want to take the fast-track to
your career in computing you can earn
your computer science degree 100% online
from Oregon State and tap into unlimited
career possibilities in any fields learn
more at eCampus Oregon State edu slash
now massive traffic to Coachella and tax
day will not keep us and even technical
difficulties we're not gonna keep us
from having a show on this week hello
everybody and welcome to the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers on this day this is it is
April 12 2019 to anybody who has watched
the YouTube version you solve just what
kind of technical difficulties we were
coming into this we are almost an hour
late for our scheduled podcast because
at some point in hangouts
I could hear Jaime but not Brandon at
some point I could hear Brandon but not
Jaime they could hear each other I was
the one who is being messed with this
entire day and it's natural fools yeah
exactly it's not even April Fool's it's
like half a month away already that went
by quick then it yeah but in any case we
have here of course the host of the
pocket now daily and pocket now a DA do
you all know him and lovin Jaime Rivera
is back but yeah
welcome back I'm a good to see you back
on the cast thank you for having me I
told you we should recorded this in San
Fran dude we didn't have to deal with
the drama of hangouts my god
I agree with you though I don't think
after having after having appeared on
all about Android that night oh that's
sure you have to drive so far buddy I
did I mean well I good thing is like
there's just something about the guys
over at all about Android that I just
can't say no to them
whenever they know that I'm gonna be in
town they asked me to come on and I
always go cuz it's a fun time
I always forget it's a two-hour podcast
so it's long
oh yeah coming back after all about
Android I was just like I just don't
know if I have enough hosts in me after
two hours as a guest I know I know yeah
so I'm good to see you back I see that
green screen in the background that's
pretty dope sorry about that I usually
film in the living room but right now
it's like so I have so Logitech cooked
me up with a ton of stuff man they're
pro keyboard they're nine oats whew
gaming mouse with like the whole would
like that trackpad that that sorry not
the track that but the mousepad that
charges inductively and they sent me the
Logitech Brio which is what I'm
currently using so we finally have a
better camera even if it seems that my
Wi-Fi stream is not great but I can't
really do much about that right now and
then Yeti sent me your Yeti caster which
is freaking awesome man
yeah I love that okay so did you learn
that from from thundery that that upside
down he does that no it's just I don't
like it the other way around because you
can't really use the table so this is
just a more practical way to still get
audio and have your table available to
you okay fair enough
okay so as you can see from our title we
are going to talk about the LGG eight
think you and I love how I'm always
saying thank you now it's just become a
habit to me back on all about Android
Jason how a shout-out to you he was the
only person that I know of that actually
referred to it as the think you and I
was like don't do that please don't do
that it's the g8 but yes we're gonna get
to that a little bit later there are a
couple of announcements that I want to
make sure we cover that happened this
week and one of them we were actually
attending while some of our friends went
straight to this other events right
after we got out of San Francisco
I am talking of course about the brand
new Samsung phone the a series that we'd
never get to enjoy here in the US though
I think it's a travesty because the a
series tends to introduce new features
to the flagship line so the a series
you saw you saw this thing right like
you didn't you this was I wish I would
have seen it live one for the ACE series
and two for the trip to Milan damn it
Milan once again my goodness one like
they're picking like every company is
picking these crazy destinations like
there's there's Milan there's Paris you
know Paris seems to be the hot one
stop complaining let's just do it again
let's yeah let's rewind the tape and
stop our whining not again
well the thing is with the Samsung aid I
keep wanting to say eight ninety I don't
know why hey eighty right so with the a
eighty what we have here is I was
already saying that the slider mechanism
from like the Xiaomi me mix three a
couple of other ones like the mechanical
sliders of the find of the Oppo find X
like it felt like they were going to go
away too quickly and then here comes
Samsung and they're like nah hold our
what's a Korean beer hold my beer I was
like what's a Korean beer that I'm
trying to remember hold my height old my
soju and and here comes a phone that not
only has a sliding mechanism but it also
has a rotating camera a rotating
motorized camera a la Oppo n1 and three
so in one and three and Oppo find X had
a baby and it came out really nice yeah
exactly
now I don't know the I don't know the
actual specs on the phone itself but
from what I what I remember of the eight
series it tends to not be the top tier
like process or internals or anything
like that but it is the radical phone
but that's the Phenom II we just came
out of an event from with Qualcomm where
they announced the Snapdragon 737 30g
and six 65 and 730 is the one that's
powering this phone and so if you
remember there are two major things at
the 7:30 and 7:30 to bring they bring
far better video support the six 65
brings a far better isp for imaging but
this one 730 brings the better isp for
both video and photos show usually the
biggest problem when you go mid tier is
not just people
don't a lot of people don't know this
and I'll admit that I didn't really
understand this until probably about a
year ago where I didn't know that it
wasn't just about the sensor it could be
the best Sony sensor it could be the
best camera lens but if the ISP on the
processor is not going to do a good job
in supporting these you know it just
throws everything down the drain and so
yeah so this 7:30 brings a significantly
better isp along with the 665 and so
you're gonna have better photo better
video but then it's a premium mid-range
err it's not an 855 it's in the middle
in between the sixth series and the and
we're already jumping topics but that's
really what makes this phone special I
mean if you remember the 730 supports 48
megapixel cameras and I believe this 880
has a 48 megapixel correct I might I
actually haven't read the spec sheets to
like it's it's weird once these rent not
the renders but once people's coverage
of the phone was coming out I just kept
honing in on that rotating camera I
can't stop looking at it it is the
weirdest thing like this this doesn't
feel like a Samsung to me like 48
megapixel camera okay so we got a
snapdragon 738 that's an eight nanometer
we're talking about let me see Wow so is
this correct triple K yeah triple
cameras 8 megapixel pixel f/2 8
megapixel F 2.2 12 millimeter ultra wide
and then we've got a time-of-flight 3d
camera and you know so you pretty much
can use that whether you're doing
selfies or using this as a primary
camera and you know even so it's a 1080p
Plus display we're talking about a
gigabytes of RAM 128 gigabytes of
storage I mean this is it's the error
it's a very very well designed very
good-looking premium mid-range err and
literally the only thing that's making
it a premium mid-range is that 730
that's powering it that's not the chump
that usually mid-range err processors
used to be so how okay I I came I came
to this thought originally that this
sliding rotating mechanism it doesn't
feel very Samsung to me like this is the
most radical thing that I think that
they've ever done
as far as hardware design is concerned
and I are you talking about Galaxy Note
edge dude I mean I agree with you I see
no like I mean I love that Samsung is
back to that root surely this is not
their idea it's somebody else's idea but
I love a company that's willing to dare
things I mean right now you like right
now whatever companies are not doing
crazy things or not just not relevant
you need that you need that Tesla
Roadster even if you're not gonna sell
it you need the Roadster to keep
people's eyeballs on you while you
launch that Model 3 in that Model S
that's the way you make money I agree
with you this is your cheapest publicity
stunt ever with the exception that this
phone is actually gonna sell and it's
actually really good
yeah indeed and the thing is like I
remember the Note edge I'll never forget
it I remember one of my friends back
home in my neighborhood actually got the
note edge and we all like meet my
brother and I my brother like follows
our content and he I remember him
looking at her and going what made you
why who who talked to you at the
t-mobile store and convinced you to get
that like like who actually got into
your head that this would be the phone
for you to get she's like I don't know
there's more screen and it looks really
it you know I kind of like how unique it
looks and we're like can you hold it can
you hold it just like but in any case
yes that is the last time that they
weren't very radical with this but what
I mean here is that this is the kind of
like the Note edge what's its own thing
meanwhile the a series has generally
been like that mid-range err line that
people can get for a little bit less
money but this is like the most like
this is the craziest thing that they've
done that the mid-range people that
don't even live in the West like they're
in there in Europe like we don't get it
and I'm like that's that's almost a
travesty but that but of course as
Samsung generally does when the a series
all of a sudden had a metal backing or
rather it had the metal frame then we
got the note for when and then it got
the the white the the the triple camera
or the at least a double camera then we
got the Galaxy s8 yes so so that that's
the other thing that I was gonna say is
that Samsung has been using the galaxy a
line for
for experimentation and so you've just
pointed it out that was the first galaxy
with a metal frame back in the day the
first Galaxy alpha was the first one and
then we've seen the triple cameras and
everything and so obviously there is a
lot less risk in the galaxy a and if it
sells well then that this is like okay
the the guinea pigs bought it let's now
pull it into the Galaxy S or into the
Galaxy Note you know III think that it's
like the smartest way to test the
product where you're not pulling all
your guns at risk here or as other
companies only have one product and
everything that either do right or wrong
can be a significant risk to everything
mm-hmm fair enough
so do you think that this is going to be
a note this do you think this is what
we're gonna look forward to with the
note 10 no no because
let me look continue looking into these
specs I'm not exactly sure this thing is
water-resistant so I don't think that
Samsung is going to bring a slider
mechanism to that that's the biggest
problem with doing sliders I mean is
there any that's water-resistant no and
there's some reason and and for some
reason these companies are not wanting
to experiment with the nano coating that
moto was using in their previous
flagships to bring in internal water
resistance so I don't know man I don't
see any water resistance here so I don't
think so I don't think so we'll see all
right fair enough okay quick shout-out
to our live chat I just opened it up I
Ambler always a homie like in there
thank you for for shouting out at my my
personal gaming channel once again but
yeah so make sure that we get if you
have any donations that of course you
can always donate you last year you just
pledged a hundred bucks
exactly yeah thank you so much he's been
very active on pocket now and on my
channel and channels I should say but
yeah I am blur like you're too generous
bro thank you so much for that if you
have any donations of course we'll give
you a shout out did for like seriously
humbled we should have you on the
podcast one day oh yeah there you go it
only 200 though I'm kidding I'm playing
I'm playing all right so you mentioned
we mentioned already a little bit in
that
last story the processor of course we
have in this particular phone work is
the ad gonna be the first one with that
7:30 because it's the first one
announced I mean I was shocked because
Qualcomm didn't really so he went to
their event and they didn't tell us that
these are the phones usually Qualcomm
will brag about not just their product
but their partners they mentioned no
partners whatsoever and then out of the
blue boom we get a phone and it wasn't
like even related like we were they're
still with Samsung the device got
announced and nobody from Qualcomm sorry
we were there with Qualcomm and nobody
from Qualcomm was like look the first
phone launch nobody said anything like
nothing so that was that was weird yeah
so um I I don't know how much we'll be
able to actually talk about the AI
aspect of that event which for a three
hour presentation it was two and a half
hours of it yes but the problem is it
was I you know for a moment there I was
like alright Matt I need to just go
register at MIT and just like the
conversation was so technical so
technical so beyond technical I'm like
shareef buddy if you're listening you're
on Twitter and we're always talking I
miss Sharif at Qualcomm because he would
do such a great job at just being like
alright humans net let the robot
conversation already already finished
human some over I'll explain to you in
human terms with everything that just
got talked about me yeah indeed that we
do miss you Sharif and you know what
though he's still active on Twitter so
it's not least awesome he's it's not
like we never hear from the guy but yes
to our to our listeners and viewers of
the YouTube channel if you if you take
anything away from this particular
episode just remember this for people
like us who are in the industry there
are two different ways of talking about
products and about spec there's high
level and low level it it'll seem
backwards but high level is what people
like Jaime and myself are and what all
of you are we know the surface level we
know what it means to the lifestyle we
know what it means to actually have a
product and and what it does for our
lives
however the nitty gritty the deep down
deep dive low
level stuff it's exactly what Qualcomm
was was presenting to us when it came to
AI all of these like I don't even know
the jargon but there were there were
questions that were being posed that I
was like I would have never thought to
ask that you know like how many how many
gigawatts like the funny part has been
the presentation finished and they they
asked for around the questions and very
few people that's like what were you
gonna ask I have no idea I mean I would
have been like I don't know like can AI
well with all of this and like because
what they're doing is they're bolstering
all of the AI cloud capabilities and
also on devising abilities with it yeah
yep yeah yeah it'll be able to process
even more there's gonna be much more
capability there's gonna be much more
power involved for what will eventually
become AI solutions but the question is
how will that actually make AI better
when are the only examples we really
have right now are these AI assistants
which I don't think anyone truly uses on
the daily I do I do man
and I am surprised I have an a device
right in front of me so I can't mention
the name
I am surprised it like for example I in
the extra couple of days that I stayed
in Barcelona a couple of friends from
Barcelona I insisted that I that I stay
a couple of days with them and so I you
know I they were so nice and so gracious
that allow me to stay in their apartment
and the first thing that we were walkin
was just walking in and the guy is like
a turn on the lights
boom a lock the door a start playing
this song and so they are not really
tech savvy people and yet I get to see
that more and more and more and so one
of the things that I did take away from
the presentation was one of the things
is my level of admiration over how much
work goes in the background for all all
this to be so natural to us the consumer
and just to realize how many layers of
work how many years of R&amp;amp;D how difficult
it is to actually get a and the G
assistant to understand very simple
conversation I was shocked I was
honestly shocked you know and one of the
things that call come announces their
whole AI focused like server based
processor
alright fine we're gonna bring this
technology now to a higher level we're
not just gonna dedicate ourselves to
doing the end part of the mobile system
but also be able to provide the
capabilities to servers and everything
and so you know there's a lot of work
but it also makes me really confident
that you know over time as consumers
we're gonna see the result of this
obviously that AI processor that's gonna
be launched later it's gonna be second
half of 2019 I believe so yes it's gonna
be late yeah for sure yeah and and so
you know I'm just I'm grateful that so
much work is happening in the background
to enable everything that we're seeing
and obviously what we need to see now
our products but I you know I think that
the way Qualcomm is taking it
particularly you know how like for
example from if you saw it's like a loop
were like first they they they showed us
in San Diego the way they're approaching
the mobile chips for these speakers to
work wirelessly and so somebody was like
yeah no but Amazon had already done this
which was actually a I believe a
Qualcomm chip but you couldn't really
talk to the product and have it listen
to you well it was on battery power you
had to press a button for it to listen
or ask this you this new chip you can
talk to it and then and so we're going
in that direction and I'm really liking
it I really am
I think it's great it's just this whole
idea that the the action that the
low-level specifications are getting so
much better that it seems so beyond the
realm of understanding we have right now
and that's a good thing
go get me wrong it's a good thing it's
just that when we were sitting there
were just like oh my god sorry but but I
am blur saying like Josh was video
flawless hymens video pewdiepie filter
oh I did see that are you using the are
you using the oh gosh blur you have to
be nine years old to get my reference
that's that that's some shade right
there has some shade PewDiePie no I
actually I actually I actually Diego
actually explained to me with that
filter means no idea the guy no but I'm
actually using the Brio it's not that
problem the problem is the the stream to
Wi-Fi actually move the route
to a different position but I need like
this apartment oddly is not small for
New York and therefore it's just too
many devices connected to it today I
called her I called FiOS and I'm like
listen that like I need a router
replacement of the guys like well it
would really help if you would turn off
any of those 48 devices that you have on
that would really help and when it gets
2019 dude come on man and like I've got
lights
I've got speakers I've got Smart TVs
I've come on man welcome to the 21st
century seriously I need a better router
and I need a made a mesh connection so
that I was about to say do you need a
mesh do you need a mesh router or really
you can pick up probably one of those
heavy-duty gaming routers I've actually
been getting emails from Netgear for
that kind of stuff I would really
appreciate one tell them that sure I
have a problem and I'll feature it no
problem there we go
oh yeah I'll email them back and say
yeah send me a review unit it's not
gonna be me though I'm not using it in
any case before we get into our first
tour only break rather before we get
into our break some final thoughts on
the processors obviously the Snapdragon
talk was what made us sit up and we have
an example now with the AAT from Samsung
the Snapdragon 730 is I mean what was
the is it six six five that was the 65
and the seven thirty G which is focused
on gaming I like this a lot because I'm
okay
you have the casual user who might
actually know and if you do know what
your specific needs are from a smart
phone more power to you it's very rare
for someone to be like that so she in
our industry so if you know that you
want a good camera period yeah hard stop
if you know you want a good gaming phone
hard stop then Qualcomm is hooking you
up and this is important that's the
reason why this is important is because
it's taking some of the features from
the flagship flagship processors which
unless you're in China you're probably
going to be spending at least 700 plus
dollars on it and putting it into a
mid-range processor that can be put into
a mid-range phone that ideally could be
5 maybe some 500 and that's awesome you
can get a gaming phone actually play
that pub G
your friends get mad at them and like do
it without too much too many problems
you could play new games like elder
scrolls blades what you just came out
and I'm just playing and I've just
pretty registered for Call of Duty
mobile which was just announced two days
ago as well
so there are a lot of games coming out
and this is actually meeting those new
games and actually like that I'm
obviously talking mainly about the
gaming one there's also the camera one
and you mentioned that this is a good
thing before yeah I you know for me
again we you and I have had
conversations repeatedly about gaming
and mobile um I'm wondering if that 730
G will enable some sort of a resurface
of like the Nvidia shield a product
that's dedicated for gaming that would
that's not a phone I mean the Nintendo
switch already proved that you know the
product doesn't need to be a phone to be
popular and people are actually willing
to pony up more money for a better
gaming experience and so and we I mean
can we get better Android games that
take advantage more of a product that
doesn't have to worry about the battery
life of a phone and the difficulties of
a phone and the fact that a phone has to
have a screen that's everything is
touchscreen where instead we can have
controls and everything that's that was
my biggest question that I honestly I
forgot to like fully asked at the event
was what's the plant with this gaming
focus processor is it different kind of
hardware or what's the plan yeah and I
think but the thing is the hardware part
is going to be up to the manufacturers
to take that gaming processor and
actually build itself around it I don't
think welcome actually has the too much
say in that kind of thing but I will say
there were a couple of videos that came
out from a few of our influence or
friends including thundery
where they had the reference device
which by the way Qualcomm come on your
reference devices actually look good
start hand those designs over to people
so that we can actually get those phones
the the reference design found performed
quite well under games that Thunder II
was playing and yeah that was a phone
that you know for all intents and
purposes shouldn't cost a whole lot of
money which i think is great but yeah
just some quick thoughts on all of that
so look forward to some mid Ranger's
that actually have the capabilities that
you can enjoy the phone
without needing to feel that phone Envy
I can't even begin to tell you how many
people I know have Alcatel phones and
then they see like I wish I could get
the Samsung but you know I'm on Cricut
like you know it doesn't make sense for
me to have an s10 plus on Cricut I mean
come on now Cricut is force or cost
efficiency and then if you're going to
get like a cheap phone plan you know
you're gonna spend the rest of the money
on a thousand dollar phone that's gonna
go away in a year and a half like it's
it's you know it's it's figuring out
where your needs truly lie yeah all
right so well that in mind we're going
to get into our first break before we
talk about the LG G eight think you okay
so I do have a mid roll here for us
shouts out to Brandon sending me the
script for our mid-roll ad for today all
right folks this episode of the
PocketNow weekly is brought to you by
the brave browser available for all
major platforms including ios and
android brave is a browser that rewards
you for just using it while it blocks
all trackers and as for a truly private
browsing experience that is up to eight
times faster than Chrome and Safari
since it's based on chromium all of your
chrome stuff still works with brave
right out of the box now I did do a
video on pocket now about the brave
browser and I've been using brave ever
since it's like a week or two before
that and then ever since then I will
admit that I don't use the brave browser
quite as much on a mobile platform
because after all everything works in
apps but on my desktop on the very
laptop that I'm using for this podcast
brave is what I'm using and one of my
favorite parts about brave at the moment
is that whenever I open up a new tab
it's telling me how many ads and
trackers it has blocked and as far as
ads are concerns I'm almost at the
100,000 mark it's a lot of that so brave
is actually really working hard to make
sure that it you're not getting
inundated with all of the crap that
might be out on the internet so it's
built into the browser and you can try
it out and all of your chrome stuff will
work with brave for more info head to
pocketnow.com slash brave all right I
have a recurring segment that I wanted
to start bringing and I started out with
I started out I started out with Thunder
e with E like okay eat one of
days we're gonna talk about how you you
expect me to say thunder every single
time but and abang yeah but he refers he
prefers thunder a that's his online
persona I suppose mr. na I asked him
when he was on the when he was on the
cast I came up with a recurring segment
called what is in your pocket now and in
his case he was wearing his vocals by
North's glasses which we all got to see
this past weekend those things were
pretty cool but I was gonna go ahead and
ask you I may now answer the question as
well you could pick anything it could be
the phone we're about to talk about it
could be a different phone that you like
using it could even be like a notebook
that's in my pocket I am one of those
people but yeah what is in your pocket
now yeah I have a notebook I always have
a notebook in my pocket what is in my
pocket now okay Oh 30 pro P 30 Pro and
this which I've been really a meaning to
test the view 23 I'm really curious
oh yeah the machine ovarian I'm really
curious over the differences in camera
technology from some of their companies
if we should call them that way and
serve and playing around on both and I
got I'm p30 Pro man I I don't think this
is a this is a tank of the phone like if
you compare it to the may 20 Pro this is
a hefty device mm-hmm FD the wise it is
I finally got to hold one thank God
and how's your red doing yeah the red
III booted it up I've put in a sim but I
am going to take it out with me this
weekend to do a real-world camera test I
don't know where I'm gonna go yet but I
have a feeling that the best place for
me to go would be an observatory of
sorts to test out that very far zoom so
I feel like that would be the Griffith
Observatory would be good that one will
be good and there's also the US bank
building or they have that they really
marketed that slide but is actually one
of the most boring things you could ride
in any case yeah I was thinking of doing
something like that so oh and also
gratitude to you for
finding a way to hook it up for that P
30 Pro thank you for that I'm gonna make
sure it's uh no are you kidding do a lot
with that over the next few days as far
as what is insane hmm I don't miss that
read I like this thank you
you wouldn't you and II were like giving
me crap for for not liking the red one
it looks like a big piece of salmon in
your hand oh we can swap if you want I
mean I'm I'm cool either way I'm cool
out of the way to be honest it's just
that like I just thought it was funny
how everybody was was getting jazzed
about the red one and I was like I'm not
I remember I want to see that anyway as
far as what is in my pocket now I I
wanted to highlight one quick thing okay
so everyone talked about the s-pen and
how it was a trigger for a camera and
this is something that I that that no
one really talks about I actually picked
up a trigger a universal trigger this is
by Joby the game of the same guys who
make the gorilla pod I think I actually
think this is an underrated piece of
tech because if you are going to be like
a solo like Instagram or anything like
that or even then if you just want to be
able to take pictures any which way
anywhere at Ruger is actually really
useful and it's super low-power you just
have to turn it on pair it to your phone
and then all the sudden you have a
remote trigger I think that people
forget that these exist so as much as we
love the s-pen for having that
functionality in there this is all over
Amazon and only four bucks I have a tile
in my keys now there you go a jump drive
a sim ejector and the keys I need to go
oh and as far as I keep the car keys
separately okay if anyone was curious
this purple pot this purple portion
right here that's my key fob to get into
Anytime Fitness so there you go finally
went to the gym for the first time last
night in forever oh my god
it's probably the one good thing I did
yesterday for myself that way last time
I finished that g8 review so late last
night but I I was planning to go to the
gym today and I'm just I'm tired yeah I
don't blame you at all I've been tired
since we got back now you just mentioned
the LGG a thank you and let's go ahead
and get started with it
I have that okay let me get this off the
puffs I'll get on the case so Silver
Edition on my end black edition on mine
because there's the locked mmm so this
is a Verizon one and yeah
gratefully the Verizon version still
works with my google fight card and with
any card really like it it's pretty much
Universal but this is the verizon
colorway so i've seen a lot of people
I've seen a lot of people on YouTube
have so many mixed reactions to this
phone
I personally on JV I did a real world
camera test where I've logged this thing
out in Napa Valley it was a great time
and I think it did a great job
honestly the video quality is still
there the bitrate is still pretty great
the wide-angle could be wider there is a
little bit of over sharpening but at
times when you need some of that
sharpening to compensate for some of the
footage it actually helps the audio
pickup is great I think I need again to
the settings to bring you down a little
bit because the audio did come in a
little bit hot so those are just some
quick thoughts from the video that I
made your your review is coming out
pretty soon
I wondered a life that's wasn't really
life on the channel it alive like a 3:30
a.m. or something like that um some hot
takes from you real quick before we get
into sort of the existential LG talk
like what no no no it's actually gonna
be all existential LG talks so why don't
we start my conclusions okay fair enough
so what were what we're did you land on
LG as a company based on this phone I
started the video with the argument that
there's always this phone that comes up
with these like crazy things every year
and every now and then it's always LG LG
is one of those companies that's not
afraid to do things that are completely
the opposite of what everybody's doing
like the wide-angle camera where
everybody else was doing either a single
camera or telephoto LG was that weird is
that weird company that still provides
us with a quad DAC for audio so not not
all the like a lot of these decisions
that the company has brought out are
still industry leaders like the
wide-angle which is now being thrown on
everything the audio jack which
is still the best there is no other
phone unless it's an lg phone that does
audio as well as LG and there are a lot
of things that people take for granted
that are unique about this phone that
are that are special like for example
this vibrating display that provides you
audio that other people can hear and it
also becomes like a sort of a speaker
all these things are are great they're
unique so a lot of people are like oh
yeah the g8 is an iteration of the g7
and I'm like no
the g7 was the g7 was more catch me up
all right here's a phone and it's
finally gonna have the latest processor
because if you remember the g6 didn't so
I think that the g7 was like that jump
into were finally on spot with the
processors that was it but then it was
the same camera sensors the same user
interface nothing about the phone was
unique the same LCD yada-yada-yada
whereas the g8 brings things that are
again what other phone has a quad tech
if not LG what other phone has a
vibrating display that also emits audio
if not LG so there are a lot of unique
things about this phone so I'm like
alright let's assume that I'm not gonna
mention any of the air gestures or any
of them I'm like it it records my vein
patterns I'm like listen either this
technology is so ahead of its time or
what I think I personally think that the
vein recognition now may not actually be
vein recognition I think that just
because you're so close to your phone
that is what its gonna that is what
compelling it but I actually think that
these air motion gestures and all
whatever you want to call them it's not
about the phone I think I said there's
one time when we were actually looking
at the phones for the first time there's
a train a second I do live in a not live
my office is in an area that's a little
bit like there's a barn not far from
here let's go that way
beyond the only train that passes by
Elle is right next to your office damnit
exactly and the only one that would
actually like pull the horn is the rest
of them are metro trains anyway that was
a cargo train that's what I'm trying to
say anyway the I think that this is a
proof of concept where they're going to
add these
motion gestures and said things like
their TVs right on your couch you bring
your hand up and then you go okay go
over right right that's and the thing
about it is these air gestures are not
new the galaxy s4 was the first device
to bring them the problem is galaxy s4
was how many years ago it was a while it
was before it was before woke Twitter
because that that presentation man the
biggest problem is not the idea I think
that the idea is great the problem is
the implementation yeah and so you know
so I walked through the review being
like you know LG is being as bold as it
has been I actually like the photography
on this phone I did not like it on the
g7 like III did a video on it and and
it's just it was okay but I'm like
alright LG we need to move away from the
g4 like I need we need for you to move
away from using small pixel sensors all
the small micron sensors and join the
crowd of you know and so they don't just
they don't do just a good job on on the
primary camera like if you use the
wide-angle it may be it may be tighter
than every other but it's just again
this is the fourth generation of ultra
wide from LG and so try to look for a
distortion on this camera whereas if I
if I grab any other phone that matter
which one I could grab the galaxy s 10
which is here I grab that I could grab
the P 20 P 30 Pro May 20 pros every
single one has barrel distortion the g8
has none hmm has 0 like I was like wow
either I need to get closer to something
like like the galaxy s 10 has the
weirdest barrel distortion out of all of
them it's just you know because it's
it's an addition for me it's like it's
great to have not the best from me the
best wide-angle right now is the g8 okay
yeah I do agree that it is still
especially for video it is still the
highest-quality one to use it doesn't
it's not as jarring as the other ones
you're right torsion could be there the
thing is the g8 still has a little bit
of distortion on the sides but it's so
negligible compared to so minimal it is
so minimal and the other thing is color
reproduction on that wide-angle usually
white angles have
they're like I believe this is the
wide-angle with the brightest aperture
at F 1.9 and so I I could be wrong but
like dude I took some night shots with
this thing usually you would never dare
use wide angles unless you're using a
May 20 Pro or P 30 Pro because you have
the night mode option and that helps you
be able to punch in better light in dark
scenarios whereas in the and this one
does a decent enough job yeah HDR is
pretty aggressive levels HDR HDR it's
pretty aggressive all that I still feel
that this is a very very good camera I
was not impressed by the v40 my v40
review was like man you know
whereas this again if we are to forget
about the gimmicks and just focus on
what the phone does right a lot of the
things that it does it does right yeah
I'm sorry I go for money actually my
complaints were different my complaint
number one don't take this phone out in
direct sunlight oh god the screen so the
screen is not bad it's not pixel 3xl bad
it's not that bad and and thank you
google for giving us the benchmark for
the worst screen you would want to use a
direct sunlight and so it's because of
the existence of the piece of the pixel
3xl that you can forgive the g8 for not
being the brightest if you notice your
your your screen is always gonna be
cranked up at like 80 to 85 percent even
if you're in a dark scenario it's gonna
be stuck there and then when you exit to
sunlight it will boost fully but then it
will like it just comes to a point where
it's just that so the problem is when
you come back from a galaxy s 10
anything is dim AF anything you know and
so that was one of my complaints of
trying to remember what was my other
complaint go for it well while you while
you're thinking about that I I was
having a conversation with actually this
was all about Android again because we
were talking about the phone
both Flo and I had had our phones so
what the LGG eight think you gets right
it gets so right and I think that that's
what I choose to focus on more than
anything
which is funny because it's so easy
Aztec youtubers or Aztec pundits to just
look at the things that it tries to do
that's different from everybody else and
because they are quote-unquote
lackluster or the implementation is not
good you end up just feeling kind of mad
about the phone in general because what
I always notice is that everybody
everybody who comes into a review and
we're all guilty of this I know I do it
as well is that once you come into a
phone like this the first thing you do
is think well what is my comparison
phone to this and a lot of people's
right now is either the iPhone or the
Galaxy S 10 plus well yes beat either of
those phones I don't think so but the
thing is so far since I've gotten the
phone and I've used in like I said I did
use it for a rear old cameras that's a
12 minute vlog where I use this phone
the entire day you know what despite
some of the quirks that are going on in
my main court my main problem with this
phone is the UI LG z y LG you gotta
update your UI men like you gotta be
like everyone used to pooh-pooh emui
i am actually giving emui a pass now
LG's UI
you're too old now like you got and it's
not and it's not just that it's tools so
there are a couple of problems with the
UI that I will I will try to all right
so I'm gonna join you in not liking the
UI from a visual perspective the only
thing that I like about the UI has
actually nothing to do with the UI but
it's because we haven't I'm a flight
camera and this is considered I guess I
guess this is an Android feature or I
don't know but the only Android phone
that was capable of doing the iOS thing
where if you unlock the phone with your
face it'll it passed the notifications
locked until it detects you and then it
shows you the notifications business
this is perfect for everybody that's
dating a Latino girlfriend you will love
this feature it is it is the best it is
the best and so think about it is okay
so that's one of the things that I like
the problem is we go back so the UI is
dated a lot of the features are like you
won't ever use them and then a lot of
things are not logical like for example
obviously the phone by default comes
with the full app tray and sorry without
the app tray and you have to enable it
but the problem is when you do so you've
got the pixel pill but then it's it's
like really we like it doesn't work
all from all edges in the display when
you swipe up you have to literally hit
the pill again to swipe and then once
you're in the app tray you don't swipe
up you have to swipe left or right them
right I'm like have you ever noticed
that you know have you ever driven a car
where you're steering this way and then
another one of the gestures is to push a
damn steering wheel like can we please
have a uniform way of interacting with a
damn phone Android figure that out a
while ago so why do we have to reinvent
the wheel with this operating system
yeah I agree
there are a lot of things about the g8
that like I think a lot of people would
look at it and think that's outdated but
I would argue that there are a lot of
things in this phone industry that
shouldn't be considered that way like
one thing coming after the other doesn't
necessarily mean that the later thing
new is not always better
alright so this fingerprint reader I
miss the days of having a fingerprint
reader like this like I don't think that
the in display finger breeders are bad I
don't think that they're that much
slower but this is not true they're not
great they're not amazing this is the
most reliable finger parameter I've used
in 2019 yet I have to agree with that I
have to also agree the face to unlock
because of the time of flight sensor
which is now us I assume that LG start
calling it secure but at least I trust
this a lot more than I trust anything
else and so I so you've got so many ways
to unlock the phone but let's jump into
the bar why I don't like this front okay
actually sit the same way all right so
here's the thing Oh head and headphone
jack I just want to be sure that we make
that very clear I went to a gym last
night with Bluetooth earbuds and I was
missing the headphone jack like I'm back
to wired wired audio it's great if you
haven't done in a while
do it again you're gonna enjoy any music
you're gonna get lost in the music video
that's what you should anyway yeah go
for it so the thing about it is all
right let's move into these air gestures
switch them off the moment you get the
phone do not activate them like right
now no other phone has it so there's no
reason for us to bash LG over giving us
an extra that you don't really need and
then you could just switch off and so I
don't I have no need to bash LG for that
I think that it's great for them to add
it but
and then I got this argument where it
was like yeah but the cool thing is if
you can't touch your phone because your
hands are dirty because you're
barbecuing or something which I like to
do then you can just interact with the
phone I'm like really so try to enable
the always-on display and the activation
of the notifications to only show up if
the phone gets unlocked and notice how
the freaking air gestures don't frickin
work even if you enabled them like if
your degree with off it won't turn on
mm-hmm it right now it's active on my
phone and it just won't turn on I see
and so so that they're they're clashing
the different features are classes
factly so their own features clash
within themselves I think that that
feature josh is actually the pickup to
wake I think that that's what is
deactivating the the hand gestures and
so and so I'm like alright are you guys
gonna either do it correctly or not like
you know mm-hmm just a real quick just
got a comment and a live chat LG is
never gonna sponsor a pocket now again
okay first of all first of all can't
wait I can't wait for them to sponsor is
the first time well this is the thing
there's there's nothing here in our
discussion that's telling you never to
buy this phone as a matter of fact there
are reasons to get this phone it's just
that the reasons that they present it
are not the reasons that we agree with
and it is for the air gestures you just
don't and even if it was I mean it's not
like if we're I'm sorry it's a review
it's not paid advertisement yeah
we're gonna provide you with our opinion
which is a subjective Josh's experience
is gonna be will in my experience it's
gonna be another um even if a company
would sponsor content they're very clear
that review weenie have never a review
dome number one and number two we have
creative freedom to say what we want or
it's just not gonna fly that's just the
way it is exactly you know which is
which is one of the main reasons why
what we sponsor is the weekly and the
daily because there is no conflict of
interest here exactly and then that
would that would be that that is a great
perspective come from Jaime in my case
like if no one
into this by now I'd never say that I
truly dislike something I just there's
no reason to like that's what I'm trying
to that's what I'm trying to get across
with this is that even if there are
things about this that I understand
people will dislike it doesn't change
the fact that I'm actually I am enjoying
myself on this phone there is still a
way to enjoy yourself on this phone and
then that's valid with any okay so but I
will be honest with you um I you know in
my conclusions from the review I was
like okay this forget about the air
gestures get Nova Launcher and you're
gonna really like this phone the problem
is that it's no better than anything
else out there yeah and as a comparison
comes in that's why I'm saying yeah
that's that's where it's like okay if I
have to put my money down would I go for
a Galaxy S 10 that has triple cameras or
even a Galaxy S 10 II that's easier to
handle I'm not gonna lie I stopped I was
really happy to not use the g8 anymore
okay I was really happy to be done with
the review and move on and it has
nothing to do with the camera or
anything else but they use your
interface like I'm sorry but companies
really if you can do something better
than stock Android put it out there
oxygen OS one UI is actually really good
in my opinion Oh what I can't believe
I'm saying this but I enjoy using me UI
more than god I hate what the way it is
now they've updated it quite a bit
oh no it's it's see this is the beauty
of reviews they're subjective matter we
can't none of them none of us has the
right answer because when you go to
China you get to understand why a
product like a new UI exists whereas if
you want to cater to the US audience or
to any other audience it's very
difficult because our priorities and our
mentality is completely different like
it's funny when you walk into countries
like you know when you walk into Taiwan
and you realize how much cartoons are
intrinsic to their culture and why
cartoony user interfaces make sense to
them where ID o cutesy things whereas we
hate them and so I mean you see me UI
and it's cutesy and I don't like it
because I'm used to more
I'm used to Boulder print and everything
but go to Taiwan and enzyme and you'll
understand why this is so popular over
there it's so you know you can't bash
products for their approach because
those products are selling a lot more
over there than they are over here
absolutely
oh I always got into I almost got into a
bit of a tiff with with shout out to
David Redick there was this whole idea
during this dinner that we were at that
LG is gonna go by way of HTC because of
this phone and I was like are you
kidding me no because there's one
fundamental difference between LG and
HTC it's that in their home countries LG
is still King and HTC is the problem
with HTC phones is that even they
wouldn't sell in Taiwan anymore when you
already had all these other phones H do
you think are buried under the the
onslaught of Chinese phones that
overshadowed them in Taiwan LG on the
other hand it's LG Samsung in Korea they
both are King and they both have such a
big market share in Asia that's not
gonna be a problem I don't think it's
gonna be and it's not just that I mean
like LG is like Sony there there's their
display business their televisions for
the longest time I would refuse to buy
anything that was not LG their display
quality is flat-out the best that to the
point where Apple has been using LG this
place like if if LG would close down
their divisions they would survive
solely on the amount of this place that
they sell to Apple they'd be a
profitable business and they are the
fact that they're still selling phones
is just like Sony they want a piece of
the pie they want for them you know when
you do when you study business smart
businesses are always uh you have to
understand that there are always
products that will be a necessary evil
if you like I'll give you the perfect
example is Amazon you think Amazon makes
money out of shipping products to you
and Amazon Prime and charging you three
bucks for shipping no but for Amazon you
think Google makes money out of Google
Maps no now why are these companies in
the business of products that don't make
money for them is because now Google is
a verb is because now Amazon controls
the retail space up to the point where
they're able to have their
own brick-and-mortar stores but honestly
where they make money out of this AWS
and none of you watching the show right
now is a customer to AWS that's where
they make their money
yeah so it's literally just top of mind
I would rather spend money on giving
inexpensive products that are high
quality than to pay for a billboard ad
in the Wall Street Journal that for me
would be the smartest marketing at some
point I was consulting to an airline and
years ago and you know so I was telling
them I would rather we drop the price on
these products than for us to pay for
billboard ads where you can't control
how much is being consumed out of that
ad whereas I can totally know how many
plane tickets I sold from point A to
point B to measure the effectiveness of
the of the campaign and so this is what
LG is doing LG's not selling cheap
phones but they're in absolutely every
market from speakers of shoot I have a
LG speaker right here which is really
good wow that thing looks gnarly
fantastic man like I have you know I
have LG speakers I've had LG TVs which
are where they're making money my god
did you see their projector technology
at CES they've got this projector which
is literally the size of oh my god the
EGP you like it's literally this size
and it projects up so you can literally
place this on the wall have it project
up and so it removes the need for a
projector behind you hmm
and it is gorgeous it is fantastic and
so you real like look at LG's ultra wide
monitors man and they're gaming monitors
you know they are crazy good so you know
there you go there you go so honestly LG
they don't care they they're in every
single business they know that they will
make money here they know that they
won't make money here oh they're battery
business they're battery division yeah I
would my main point with whether Roddick
again shouts out to David the is that if
LG scales bag phone production in the US
I can see that happening that's fine but
to say that LG's gonna go away because
of this I don't know of course not
like their even their mobile division
the mobile division
not even gonna go away not definitely
not to the level of HTC in wait a second
is it just me or does LG have their own
carrier in Korea I thought that what
they help with the LTE a right isn't
that what that there's not yeah that's a
good question and so listen LG is so
deep into the business know and and
their best so their best R&amp;amp;D think about
this Josh because we're talking about
this air gestures and what they're doing
with the time-of-flight sensor their
best R&amp;amp;D is what enables other products
that they sell so literally it's like if
they're using their phones as R&amp;amp;D to
sell this stuff to Apple to sell this
stuff to Google how many pixels were
made by LG again you know how many it's
it's it's not that simple it doesn't
work that way yeah alright so last
couple of hot ticks before we before we
call it on this episode there are a lot
of people in and our live chat agrees
with you there's a lot of talk about TVs
and LCDs and all LEDs and monitors and
whatnot everyone has a good point in
that regard do you remember that sorry
random thought there was that one LG
speaker that we got from them at one
point that looked like a milk bottle
that was nice yeah they gave us that for
I think it was like a CES presentation
it looks like an old like 1920s like
milk model like the milkman bottles ok
so here's here's one comment that I
wanted to make sure I put out there's
our final way of looking at this
t-mobile is selling this at $600
basically like you know I know there's
some I know there's some paperwork I
know there's some yellow tape on that
but at $600 compared to the thousand
dollars that you could spend for the
competitors does that change the way you
feel about like it does is this better
than the rest oh yeah for 600 bucks I
would totally go for your g8 boom that's
that's my number one thought like the
one thing LG needs to realize is that if
they're not going to meet the rest of
the market they need to make sure that
they're not over pricing it and on
t-mobile I understand that on other
carriers and if you get it unlocked it's
a different price but for people who are
on t-mobile this is kind of a compelling
this puts it right up against that one
plus 60 and I think that's a fairly
worthy
comparison yeah yeah and it's not like
if you're getting a chump you've got the
latest and greatest there are a couple
of things that LG doesn't so for me it's
odd like for example it's got wireless
charging but it doesn't support faster
15 watt so those are like the weird
things around like what the hell like
seriously what happened here you know
but other than that dude I mean I hope
that LG continues making phones that
they're not gonna stop yeah they're just
not you know they're they're I would fix
again they really just like they revamp
their whole hardware division after the
g5 we need another kind of flop like
that for their software division to be
told guys move on yeah I agree
and wasn't there a time when LG like was
working super closely with Google like
well whatever happened there like we
could have gone all right I have no idea
and we've got some Android 1 editions of
the g7 yeah I have no idea where that
ended but I do feel that LG really needs
to starts to start taking their software
seriously and again it has nothing let's
forget about the damn visuals it's about
the logic behind the design I mean come
on man I mean you can totally tell the
difference between a David Fincher movie
and any other director just because of
its style just because of that approach
there are there's so much logic to the
psychology of the way software is
designed that many companies and it's
slick of LG has become completely a if
they've like completely ignored the
importance of logic in the way the
operating system should perform should
you know how you navigate it and that's
for me that's one of the biggest things
they need to work on all right there we
go
ok I think we did it about an hour show
