calm and i'm going to show you the
update process for the first Windows
Phone 7 update so I already got a little
message that said there was an update
available but here's the settings and we
see that an update is available so what
tells me to do is plug it into the zune
desktop and there it is so I'm going to
do that by to the right way come on
okay so there's the phone
I go to settings phone update or check
for updates this is an update is
available checking for updates
hmm
when we are rebooting here
it's an interesting little illustration
on the phone
we got some more drivers coming up
select that means do not disconnect it
from the USB port and in the background
you can see that says creating a backup
zero percent don't know why that's going
to take
it's installing the update
step 8 of 10 please wait
and we're just rebooted again so that's
step nine of 10
and the phone is back
and let's see what the zune software
does still on 9 of 10
come on
meanwhile let's just see what's going on
here there we go step 10 of 10 complete
you can disconnect your phone successful
update all right we go
and that build number changed some
thousand eight well there's nothing in
the update that you can see so nothing
to show you really but that's the update
process the node 0 new update coming in
a maybe a couple of weeks few weeks
sometime in March will have some new
features but this update is just to
prepare your phone for the subsequent
updates to make things go smoother in a
way that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
