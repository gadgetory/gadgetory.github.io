you've been over to Sprint's website
anytime in the last little bit you'll
probably notice there's an awful lot of
phones available to choose from about
forty to four of them however our
iPhones and you thought that he only had
one but 19 19 of them are Androids
what's the Android that's on top
it's the HTC EVO 4G LTE we got a chance
to review it let's go take a look so
when you pick up your HTC EVO 4G LTE
from your nearest Sprint store from the
website you'll notice it comes in this
kind of a understated brown box so when
you open the box you're gonna notice
your phone sitting there right on top
after the manuals you'll notice that
we've got a really nice microUSB cable
you've also got a nice HTC branded wall
wart there just a two-prong this is a
u.s. one after all you will not find a
micro SD card anywhere in there it's not
there you're not gonna find a GSM card
because you don't need it not even for
LTE which is unusual you're also going
to notice that although the phone has
Beats Audio included in it it does not
include any Beats Audio certified
headphones in fact there are no
headphones let's talk a little bit about
the design HTC got a black guy because
all of their phones in the past were
kind of a cookie cutter they all looked
the same it was all just essentially the
same phone with different guts with the
HTC One family HTC is changing all of
that the evil 4G LTE though named
differently than the one series is most
certainly one of the family the Evo is a
beautiful device although the edges of
the 4.7 inch display don't employ the
same infinity edges that the One X does
the black aluminium surrounding it makes
the edges all but disappear the front of
the device holds an elegant earpiece
with a hidden notification LED a subtle
HTC logo and three capacitive buttons at
the bottom of the screen
the Sprint and HTC logos are on the back
they're very subtle and they help to
emphasize the phone rather than the
carrier and the manufacturer the back of
the phone is mostly a matte aluminum
giving the Evo 4G LTE a durable feel
oddly the top of the phone is a
high-gloss material
it's a removable plastic piece that's
probably the best surface for attracting
fingerprints and smudges that I've ever
seen hiding under this glossy panel is
an empty microSD card slot which will
accept up to 32 gig cards to supplement
its internal 16 gig of storage
separating the two materials on the back
of the phone is a red strip of aluminum
that can be pulled out and used as a
kickstand I keep asking myself why this
ridiculously useful component isn't
available on every smartphone and tablet
made today the Evo 4G LTE feels great in
the hand the anat eyes de luminance pace
frame as they call it has just the right
amount of grip without sacrificing style
combined with the device is lightweight
only 134 grams which is four point seven
two ounces the evo 4G LTE feels light
but not cheap along the sides of the
device are the usual components a
headphone jack noise cancelling mic and
a power or standby button on the top
which doubles as a panel removal notch
the volume up and down rocker and a
camera button appear on the right side
and the primary microphone is on the
bottom on the left side is the microUSB
connector and nothing else made from
durable materials with high quality
workmanship with its elegant lines and
chiseled edges the evil 4G LTE doesn't
disappoint and it's gonna help put HTC
back on top when the phone's only
negative element is its glossy top you
know you've got something pretty good in
hand the Evo runs a dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
and featuring one gig of ddr2 ram we've
seen phones with more cores but with
these scores I don't think you're gonna
notice much of a difference with this
combination this isn't the Tegra 3 quad
core that we've seen in some other
phones
but even the HTC One X had noticeable
lag in some elements of the UI this evil
4G LTE has the same noticeable lag and
in the same places this leads me to
believe that the lag isn't hardware
related and can likely be addressed in
future updates and optimizations to
Sense 4.0 honestly I don't miss the
beefier processor storage is more
limited than I liked but you can add
your own microSD card to this phone and
it comes with 25 gig of Dropbox cloud
storage as well team that up with Google
music and your music library is close by
it when you want it
the massive 4.7 inch 720p HD Super LCD
display is beautiful even in sunlight
the screen was clear usable and even
comfortably readable I'm not often
surprised by a screen but this screen is
the bee's knees let's move on to
software and talked about HTC Sense with
Sense 4.0 HTC has improved in almost
every area it's lighter it's faster and
it adds a level of finesse that other
launchers just don't have subtle
animations are everywhere but not
over-the-top the translucent menu bar
opens up the screen and makes it appear
larger and I don't know how I'll be able
to live without the sense 4.0 walk
screen when I have to send this phone
back like we mentioned before some of
these niceties come at a cost that cost
is noticeable lag in areas where speed
is most important like opening the
running apps list and the app drawer not
necessarily part of sense the soft
keyboard on the Evo 4G LTE also falls
short the speed and accuracy of HTC's
keyboard still isn't competing with even
the stock ICS keyboard let alone
third-party alternatives luckily
swapping the keyboard or IME isn't
difficult to do it's just something that
you shouldn't have to do so how much
bloatware does the evil 4G LTE have
there are 19 apps on there that you
might consider to be bloatware although
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich allows
you to disable apps that you
want displayed in your app drawer the
apps are still there
they're still taking up space they're
still slowing down your phone and
they're still opening you up to
potential security holes so what about
the Sprint network is it any good and
how about that LTE that we keep saying
in the name of the phone unless you're
in one of only a couple urban areas in
the country your fancy sprint LTE phone
will only get 3G even if you live right
next door to a WiMAX umbrella like I do
the only reason I bring this up is
because without WiMAX AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
HSPA+ network make the Evo 4G LTE look
snail slow let's not even talk about LTE
speeds on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T that
comparison it'll only make you cry voice
on the other hand was reliable though
not remarkable calls sounded ok but not
spectacular I was able to get clearer
calls to Tony in Romania using Skype
than I was using Sprint's voice Network
Beats Audio is nothing short of amazing
you owe it to yourself to try it out for
its primary shooter that evil has an 8
megapixel camera on the back with a
relatively small LED flash with an F 2.0
lens and autofocus the pictures that are
taken on the device looked really good
after dumping them over to my computer
they turned out to be only average the
reason for this appears to be the super
LCD screen which makes average shots
look way better than they actually are
brightly lit subjects tend to be
overexposed and low-light images are
still a bit grainy the camera app on the
other hand is quite nice its beauty is
in its simplicity
want a still shot tap the shutter button
want a video press the video button
that's it simple elegant no swapping
between modes pressing the right button
does it for you the 2 thousand milliamp
hour battery isn't removable but it's
appropriately sized for the phone and
for your normal tasks I've been amazed
at the runtime I've gotten out of this
phone all is the realest however I
have to wonder how much LTE when it's
finally available will impact the
battery in the meantime under Wi-Fi or
3G the evo 4G LTE has the best battery
life of any phone I've ever tested so
how did the evo 4G LTE finally score
after having to dock at a point here and
there we ended up with a solid seven
point seven if you're already on the
Sprint network or looking at changing
carriers you can pick up a new HTC EVO
4G LTE for one $99.99 if you sign up for
a two-year contract or five 49.99 if you
don't now it's not available just quite
yet but it should be available soon
though they did close down the
pre-orders at least at the time of this
video we think you'll really like this
phone and if you want to know more about
it head on over to the article at
