calm and today i will show you a new
program called glimpse and what this is
going to allow you to do is send your
location to either an email address or
text message for a specific period of
time a lot of these location based
programs don't really give you the
option to set a time limit as to how far
or how long someone can actually do you
so I'm just going to go into some of the
settings so in the menu and then
settings and this way you can set your
nickname I just have my name right here
set your picture add a glimpse so if you
want to if you get a text message or an
email with subtle with the glints code
on it you can add it directly into here
and view it on your glimpse program you
can add favorite places I just have a
grocery store right here general
settings so that allows you to clear
your cache or clear glimpse data can
also a stay awake when sharing location
set and feedback get latest updates help
information and about information so
it's pretty quick and easy to send a
glympse all you do is click this button
right here select from your contacts or
you can input the information directly
i'm just going to send it to myself to
give a little demonstration and click
Next you can add a message if you want
it's optional I'm just gonna yeah
there's a few predetermined messages on
here so if i want to send one like it's
pizza it's pretty easy you can say hey
look where I am okay you can click done
and you can also add a destination so if
you want to tell people where you're
going that's also an option so click
send and it will send a text message or
to an email address you can also send
the email addresses and here's my text
message so all I have to just click on
this link it'll actually launch my
internet browser and show me where my
current location is so as you can see
says d for Daniel so there's my little
icon and if I want to I can refresh this
so it'll show my speed I'm not really
moving right now of course so it's not
going to show anything but it'll
actually give a track of them
where you're going and it gives the
expired information so this one expires
in 29 minutes because I had it set for
30 minutes so I'll just close out of
this so under the menu we can also view
satellite view if you want to and that
all goes to the satellite view of course
you can also go to details which will
give us our glimpse information that we
sent so as you can see all the durations
are here on the side so if they're
expired you can always resend them and
you can also delete them so if you
wanted to delete this glimpse you can
also do that so if I didn't want to
share my location with that person any
longer I can just delete it and it will
it will not allow them to view it you
can also go up here to this little icon
which has a satellite indicator which
shows you your signal strength so this
will show you which satellites are
available and what type of fix you have
I have a 2d fix right now because I'm
just insides will go back so this is
glimpse it is a free program and allows
you to share your location with whoever
you want for a specific period of time
thanks for watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
