its highlight phone turns out even stone
can change if you'd give it enough time
with that in the rest of the details I'm
high memory better with Jules Wong on
camera this is the Xperia z2 hands-on
video brought to you by invisible shield
there's a new shine in this Sony phone
and the vast experience were sharp
cornered boxes with flat glass and flat
metals giving it a duller look here
we're finally seeing slopes and curves
making their way to the eggsy - from
corner to corner and every side in
between some may like it some may not
maybe this has to do with the fact that
we haven't seen a phone of 11.1
millimeters thick in a long time
yeah I know and if you're wondering
where all the space has gone - it
certainly is not in that 30 180 milliamp
hour battery we'll have to see if this
phone really lasts all day best sony
claims with the help of the qualcomm
snapdragon 845 I trust Qualcomm more
than Sony now taking into wider
perspective this isn't a stand out
blueprint at all but it's something
outside of this company's comfort zone
that we can appreciate at least what
hasn't changed thankfully is the IP 60 a
water and dust resistance the 5.7 inch
display isn't just extra tall it's also
just extra it can screen HDR content and
convey dynamic vibrations that will give
the front speakers a bit of oomph yeah
that's something you'd actually have to
try for yourself to understand it
certainly doesn't replace the missing
headphone jack by any stretch but it's
still a treat we'll have to chew on in
the review labs we're also looking at
some of the capabilities of this 19
megapixel motion eye camera one of them
being that it's the world's first smart
phone sensor to record 4k video and HDR
bringing more colors than ever to a
consumer recording device with that
there's also 960 frames per second
slow-motion video recording putting the
Galaxy S nine aside Sony's
second-generation technology can record
cliffs at a higher 1080p resolution and
then there's sensitivity users can
record video at ISO 12800 and snap
pictures up to 51 - let's face it we've
been somewhat disappointed with what the
camera systems shot for us with past
Sony phones and this one would have been
great with OIS which is sadly not here
nevertheless it looks as if Sony still
has an engine to push big features for
smartphone photography the Xperia z2
will come in black silver green and pink
it'll go on sale next month at a price
to be determined we'll keep our eyes on
this and have more coverage at
