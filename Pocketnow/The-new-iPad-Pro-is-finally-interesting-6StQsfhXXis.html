boring each year there was a minor bump
in specs but it has basically been the
same iPad since 2010
except for screen resolution and
performance not only that but phones got
bigger so for me and others it wasn't
necessary to have a larger touch surface
but this year it's different the iPad
pro is a true upgrade to previous iPads
and I couldn't wait to unbox it so let's
check it out I also got the Apple pencil
2 with the iPad pro which is redesigned
with a flat edge for better ergonomics
plus that flat edge lets you
magnetically connect and charge the
pencil with the iPad pros edge super
cool not only that but that flat edge of
the new Apple pencil that you DoubleTap
to perform certain actions that
developers will be able to utilize right
now for example in notes double tapping
will switch to the eraser and a writing
tool but that's pretty much all it does
for now I can't wait for other apps to
do something with this functionality
like a Microsoft OneNote or the
fantastic pigment coloring app which you
have to check out if you have an Apple
pencil and an iPad I didn't get the
keyboard case with the iPad pro because
in my opinion the iPad is still very
much a consumption device it's great at
looking at photos and watching videos
reading newspapers and magazines but I
don't buy this notion that the iPad can
be a replacement for your computer maybe
if your grandma it can work but when I
want to get true work done and it's
probably the same for you I reach for my
laptop or my PC my desktop computer the
iPad pro is just not that good at
productivity but it's great at
consumption the iPad pro itself shown
here with the 11 inch model because I
wanted to use this as a digital notebook
and so the more portable size was
important to me is physically sharper
and more flat than previous iPad I
really like this look it feels
utilitarian like a notebook or a hard
book and it's crazy thin at five point
nine millimeters which makes it
effortless to hold for comparison one of
the thinnest phones ever made is the
original moto Z which was five point two
millimeters the iPad pro is just a
little thicker than that
let's talk about connectivity the
possibility of a utopian tech future
where every battery-powered devices the
same connector is now a little bit
closer
the new iPad pros have USB see which of
course means you can use all of your
existing USB C cables and power banks to
juice up the iPad pro because let's face
it you're tired of looking for lightning
cables I know I am let's just hope the
next iPhone gets us BC to the charger in
the Box is rated for 18 watts which
charges the iPad pro at a reasonable
rate of 0.5% per minute which comes out
to 3.3 hours to charge the iPad pro
fully without a home button you get the
same gesture navigation we see on the
iPhone 10 and 10 s while this takes some
getting used to by far the best part
about this change is the ability to
quickly move between apps by swiping the
navigation on an iPad it's so fluid to
do this gesture when you need to move
between two apps and thanks to the a 12
X chip and the 120 Hertz refresh display
using the iPad no matter what you're
doing is such a fast and fluid
experience it's really incredible no
home button means that you don't have
touch ID but instead face ID which works
really well on the iPad pro it works in
both landscape and portrait which is a
cool trick I got the LTE model because I
love how iPads have an e SIM that let
you pick whatever carrier you want
without needing a plan or a sim you just
pick the carrier you want to use at that
moment and you're connected and then for
storage I got 64 gigabytes because I
rely so heavily on the cloud for my
media I don't need the extra storage the
total price of this iPad came out to 949
dollars which is a lot of money but
considering that this is the best tablet
in the world by far it's not that crazy
and then there are a lot of other
niceties on the iPad pro such as really
loud speakers with very spacious sound
tap to wake like on the new iPhones to
make it super easy to turn on the
display excellent fantastic palm
rejection so that you can hold the iPad
in one hand even while touching the
screen while swiping between things even
though the bezels are smaller another
great thing about the new iPad pros is
the camera is really good although you
shouldn't be one of those people that
use your iPad to take pictures you just
look really lame so don't do it
and also the new iPad pros can do all
the augmented
stuff if you're into that okay that's
going to do it for this quick unboxing
and first impressions of the new iPad
pro we'll have a full review of it in
the coming weeks until then you can
follow me on social media at brand the
minimun and make sure you give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw if you have any questions about the
new iPad pros I'm gonna hang out in the
comments for a little bit so drop your
question I'll do my best to answer it
thanks for watching and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
