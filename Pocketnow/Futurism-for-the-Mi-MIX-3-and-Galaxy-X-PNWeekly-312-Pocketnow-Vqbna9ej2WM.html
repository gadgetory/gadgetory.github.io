feature off with more pop up cameras and
no chips then we take it over to a
foldable phone in 2019 and then well who
knows if HTC makes a phone we're
interested in next year if it's still
making smartphones next year look into
it all of the mobile tech news plus an
overview of and drapy because there's a
better chance you'll be getting into it
quicker than you might think for
crossing wires and getting started on
the anniversary episode of the pocket
now weekly episode three one two
recorded live at 102 p.m. eastern archer
licenses this is the podcast that talks
about everything you can fancy in mobile
technology from smartphones to smart
watches tablets all the other things
that make this life so wonderful and so
possible
my name is Jules Wong news editor or
PocketNow good day to you joining us in
just a few minutes will be hard
multimedia Manager
Jaime Rivera but in the meantime we are
glad to have on from xda-developers
creative director Mario Sara Farrow
hello team sir hello thanks for having
me glad to have you on and it's
definitely a nice day to have you on as
we delve into some of the things that we
might not have done in the past several
episodes especially with Android be it's
kind of I feel like every time that we
go into developer beta phase it's kind
of it just it's always lurking around
but there's never really like you have a
whole bunch of sites that do you like
the little tiny feature mentions that
pop up as they tend to explore them but
I feel like we need to have something
more in aggregate as we go along here
that's right that's right
I mean this is a there's an important
release I think for Android it it it's
coming at a time where there are some
major kind of architectural revisions
under the hood with project travel and
ways to speed up updates we already see
some of that kind of come to fruition
with the way in which she and rupee beta
is actually being developed and rolled
out to other OEMs in a way that we
haven't seen before it's always been
limited to Nexus and pixel phones and
now you can actually try it on a phone
like the 1 plus 6 which is great on top
of that it does bring some nifty
features it does bring some
optimizations using bus words like AI
and so on and so forth so it's an
exciting release our favorite buzzwords
of course so definitely keep that in
mind we're gonna be talking about that
in the next maybe 15 20 minutes or so
and we would certainly like you to
listener the viewers participating and
in this topic if you can go onto your
Twitter account and post a few tweets
with the hashtag P and weekly maybe
contribute your thoughts to what might
be going on with you and your personal
experience what device that you're using
it on and if you have any questions
or our expert here Mario surf oh
definitely chimed in on the comments on
Twitter hashtag P and weekly otherwise
if you're listening on this podcast and
we'd like to just submit a question or
thought or just anything go on to your
email client and type in podcast at
pocketnow.com and then just say what you
need to press the send button and we'll
certainly get around to it if we get
into another mailbag episode for the
time being and now we will head straight
into the news and we start off with
another kind of sad story that we tweet
I don't know really if I really want to
get into this without like weeping a
little bit because I have a little
Taiwanese blood in my system and HTC has
been a favorite song for so long in that
country but it's well I guess the latest
news that we could say is that it posted
a monthly revenues for the month of June
and a year-on-year basis that is a 68
percent decline and it's the worst that
has happened in two years with I think
it was like April of 2016 that it
declined like a 79 or 80 percent so and
when we're given the raw numbers here
this is only 2 billion new Taiwanese
dollars which is about 73 million
dollars in the US and even back then
they were making well it was what was
the number like 20 million a twenty
billion and yeah so definitely just a
shrinking of scale here they reported
that they were going to cut 1,500 jobs
from their Taiwanese Factory and it's
just been this heavy kind of slide ever
since then I wonder what your take is on
this will we see HTC continue on as it
is in terms of just producing ass flesh
of smartphone
and maybe even being able to maintain
mid-range or entry level offerings
through the next maybe year well you
know there's been a lot of changes in
the company they also had a bunch of
layoffs in their United States division
I think they're only keeping the htc
global employees say they merge their VR
and smartphone teams as well they had a
a change in impression see in the
smartphone division it's just a lot of
volatility in the company right now
their their recent releases have been
good they just haven't been spectacular
and with such heavy competition and with
such dominance from the likes of Samsung
and Huawei it's very difficult to see
them kind of put up a fight at this
top-end this premium segment that
they've been known for that in many ways
they innovated and pioneered with their
aluminum designs and things that other
OEMs hadn't done at the time now they're
kind of falling behind in a way that's
kind of sad because like you said they
were a giant they were a favorite not
just in their home country but also
throughout the world and and they really
helped kickstart Android as a whole and
even smartphones before the iPhone so it
is kind of sad I think that they could
do better there's I think they need a
fundamental focus change that I'm not
sure they're undertaking they're getting
cash infusions from the sale of
Engineers to Google and so on and that I
think should keep them a flow for
another smartphone generation beyond
smartphones they don't have much they
have their survive and that's pretty
much it
very more yeah even then it's still kind
of we're still trying to feel out what
VR could actually do the markets in sort
of a stasis mode right now until you
figure out maybe Wireless is the way
maybe Wireless can actually get people
more motivated to buy headsets but until
then there have also been a couple of
these kind of niche projects that have
been suggested one of course is the
blockchain item that they released or
are not released but have announced in
you know talking about that and also a
potential vibe phone which I don't know
what exactly that would entail but it's
a phone it's at an actual smartphone
device and maybe that would be powering
something again the potentials on that
would be uncertain at this point I don't
know whether is this kind of another way
that they could go and just finding as
many niche audiences and super serving
them because with the blockchain and
remember them talking about how they'll
want to aim for because each phone would
be a node and they say they're going to
achieve probably twice as many nodes as
aetherium currently has and by that
count I think that was that would be
about 40,000 50,000 sales is that even
kind of a feasible or at least something
that they can grab on to for now I
really not sure like you said kind of
super serving a specifical specific
niche is something that they could do to
move forward we would kind of these new
ventures I'm not sure whether they'll
find success they found they found
success with the vibe because there is
clearly some kind of demand and some
kind of established or establishing
competition with oculus and what was
happening would be ours not just in
desktop but in smartphones so they found
an issue there with this whole block
change thing well I think that they're
they're perhaps getting undue attention
on their efforts because of the mere
word blockchain which is another one of
these buzz words you can use to prop up
a project even if it seems kind of
unfeasible it doesn't have kind of
concrete outcomes laid out I'm not sure
whether that's the way forward I I do
think that a smart phone company like
HTC I think I think the media often kind
of uh underestimates how hard it really
is to kill a company like this or for a
company like this to just die and
disappear they
we've been saying that she has been
dying for so long that I've lost track
it's been since dm9 that people have
been you know saying okay so are they
gonna be in business next year so they
somehow managed to find a way even if
they keep posting double-digit revenue
losses and if they keep bleeding money
and they keep putting off also just
people are not really enthused about if
it's only a matter of perseverance I
guess you could say one of our regular
listeners here Andrew Wallace on Twitter
has made his thoughts clear for quite a
while and he has this whole long kind of
I wouldn't say post mortem but
definitely a lot of the factors here for
one I believe that HTC's are in deep
hasn't been directed towards any
worthwhile features in the past couple
of years the squeeze feature is a flop
for the most part that audio solution is
proprietary talking about us PC and
speaker quality is less than original
boom sound HTC is manufacturing quality
control has gone down measurably the to
your point they've shut down of other
domestic factories that they had direct
control over last few tear downs from
the Zack Jerry wigs new ultra u11 u12
plus have had several issues and some of
this could be with Google's deal to get
2000 hardware engineers over so lots of
questions going on here especially as
they've declined from carrier
partnerships in the u.s. um
I don't I don't feel comfortable with
this being a post-mortem add-on like it
sounds like it it feels like it but it
just it's like there's always that last
hope that last little bit of hey
remember what this company used to do
and and how yeah and you know that fuzzy
feeling inside and I don't know how we
can convert that towards forward
momentum right yeah I think actually
that post mortem is quite accurate
specifically where it's
said they haven't really directed there
are in the doors kind of meaningful
features they've toyed around with bus
words he did toy around with sends in
their sends assistant and all the stuff
that was just terrible by pretty much
every measured he was just not not good
like it didn't help you really it was
kind of a kind of a stain in the AI bus
word to with the whole launcher widget
thing that kind of predicted which app
you would use it was it was really kind
of a waste of bus where that ends
companion who really wasn't anything
worthwhile yeah a lot of stuff like that
even like their key features like audio
quality but they were known for and
reverb for and they backtracked and
backpedal on that front LG took the
crown on that and they're kind of
running with it at this point yeah so
yeah definitely a lot of things
especially prestige pricing they're kind
of habits of just pricing perceivably
over pricing phones that and keeping
them at that price for an eternity
before they start chopping down those
prices it's just a whole bunch of it
doesn't feel good it's like Apple done
wrong so I mean again we cross their
fingers hope that the future brings them
brightness although when we are talking
about June apples to apples comparison
here because they launched the U 11 in
late May towards June and the you told
Plus also the same thing so and to see
that kind of decline is kind of very
very galling so again the phones aren't
bad I mean they are just unspectacular
no mark Alicia's saturated with good
options at cheaper prices two good
options you say kind of like the
honorton GT with eight gigabytes of RAM
and and GPU turbo technology yeah I
understand that you have a few thoughts
about how all this connects and how
always doing things and I also
understand that you have a disclosure to
make as well
yeah first of all honor sponsor sexy a
specifically parts of the XV of Porto on
XV TV and they also do engage a lot with
our developer community that out of the
way I think you'll find that I don't
necessarily have extremely positive
things to say about this it's it's a
weird rerelease so they're upping the
RAM which I don't think that people
necessarily had too many complaints
about certainly their their ROM has
traditionally had issues with RAM
management they've been a lot of reviews
in the past would mention how they would
be listening to music and it would just
kill off their music player when they
turn off the screen and so on it was
needlessly aggressive you could be was
needlessly aggressive exactly but it's
got a much better to the point where
current flagships
do the pretty good job at just keeping
the core apps you need in RAM I
personally haven't heard any of our
editors have any significant issues with
it lately so adding two gigs of RAM
would be a first for huawei slash honor
flagships in a sense and it puts them on
a more competitive footing with devices
like the one plus six the GPU Tour both
side of the equation is extremely weird
to me I've asked for a white paper and
what I've gotten is basically not much I
in fact that I ended up more confused
after reading it just because it didn't
actually have technical specifics and it
was just basically a rehearsal of the
details that we already know and some
fancy graphs possess that's it so I
don't really actually know what they're
doing and this is something that
frustrates me a bit with hall in honor
they introduce all these different
changes that they'd never done a
disclose what it actually does and how
it actually helps and how it achieves
performance gains to the point where
sometimes especially with Huawei it's a
bit misleading how they say that the MBU
can help your regular UI experience
which I don't quite see how they're
doing that for example yeah apparently
this was also featured on the honor 9i
back the wealth just a month ago
actually and cuz we go and see like the
Kiran chef that they use it's the you
know kind of an edited our reference
design but I think they also take on the
Molly she be any reference as well and I
suspect it just could be just uh they
stick characterize it as a mode so it
just could be pure overclocking but what
kind of complicated though because the
so the tragedy would tiring GPUs and
well it's the fact that they're kind of
sourcing it from from from arm is the
problem is that uh there's still a
generation or two behind Snapdragon and
Qualcomm Adreno but but that is just if
we're looking at peak performance then
the real story I think is in the fact
that in terms of efficiency carrying the
carrying this GPU of the malli the malli
line still has a long way to go
so yeah sure the peak performance
difference can be 30% from at any
current generation battle and but even
that's misleading because the audrina is
just so much more power efficient so
yeah you can keep those peak performance
numbers but you can't sustain them as
well and it certainly you don't want to
sustain or not just because of heat but
because of battery drain so kind of st.
calling a GPU Torgo on a GPU that's not
only not as powerful but also a really
power thirsty it doesn't kind of instill
that confidence in me that I actually
want to even use that mode I'm not sure
because correct me if I'm wrong because
Huawei also does a is very progressive
in terms of the adapter based
technologies for charging and I'm not
sure if they're the ones that were
marketing with your able the Charlie
found very still very quickly even while
you're gaming it could be that it could
be Xiaomi or something but I don't know
that's that's one plus dust that but
Huawei cig knology so we tested this at
XDA we are
we did like this fast-charging test
while running benchmarks and and you can
see kind of okay how much does each
charger throttle and the supercharged
while a supercharged did perform really
admirably in that test and since that it
didn't like really slowed down as much
as other standards so in that sense yeah
that does kind of work that does kind of
help and I guess to kind of wrap this
all up what does this kind of show about
the honor brand that I'm always able to
or is willing to put up or just wants to
put up something like this to have honor
shine a little bit more or is it just
just the part of the youth imaging
catering towards maybe yeah India
oriented teens or Korea oriented I think
their own spec heavy kind of thing going
on as opposed to loving like every
second with fifteen lenses on their
cameras yeah yeah one point they're just
gonna say screw everything we're doing
four cameras
no I good it will happen in any case I
think it's a really really really really
solid product I mean my criticism of
kind of GPU tool go and and all these
kind of different tweaks that they do
but they never really specify what it's
doing or how it helps data sight it's a
really really compelling package at a
price that's really difficult to beat
like if you look at the the spectrum of
of phones that can compete at that price
offering such heavy specs in such a
premium design with that level of build
quality and so on you have very few
options you have phones like the one
plus six I guess you could say the
motive see free play but that phone is
under spectin comparison and doesn't
have as many of the niceties that honor
can borrow from highway so I think it's
a really compelling package I'm not just
saying this because I've got them to
play with the phones because of
sponsorship and so on like it's it's
objectively a very compelling Hardware
package whether the user experience and
the software they do try to kind of
market it to our digital natives whether
that's something for enthusiasts in
particular I'm not 100
sure guess the media still criticizes
anything that's not stock Android
sometimes what merits sometimes just out
of some irrational love for Google stuff
oh yeah totally
and there's also the practicalities of
bringing over honor intent that it
doesn't actually necessarily work with
your carrier also just it's yeah I mean
there's also the government that's kind
of trying to squash them gently so yeah
we're gonna talk a little bit more about
all those products in just a second I
guess
well I'm just trying to make a
transition over to something that I
don't still quite understand but the a
Samsung flip phone they've been doing
this w series where they packing all the
modern Android specs it runs Android it
has two screens with a t9 keyboard but
there's a Snapdragon 835 or a 45 or you
know the latest one with all the RAM
that you need and I believe it was the W
2018 last year that launched with the
adjustable aperture feature that the
Galaxy S nine had next with the f1 point
5 2 F 2.4 settings
physically so dual cameras what do you
expect so what do you what do you expect
to see out of a flip phone and also do
you want one hmm well I guess I can't
allow myself to want one just because I
know that I can't get one first of all
it's prohibited ly if it's early
yeah sure I only product to your right
and then there's the fact that you would
have to import it I know that my boss
loves these phones for some reason that
I can't comprehend I personally I'm ok
if flip phones disappear forever that's
just me there's some kind of old phone
formats that I miss like I do like the
new blackberry stuff with the physical
keyboards but
this flip from it's a hard marriage you
know kind of getting the the the modern
smartphone format into a flip phone but
if anyone can engineer it its Samsung I
think that the phone it's interesting
it's really cool like it's a phone that
it's a head turner and it's an
interesting concept I just can't allow
myself to want it you know what I'm yeah
yeah totally especially as you know the
software links towards those things are
either just not being updated or
abandoned completely so yeah more
especially big problem nowadays so I
mean you might just have to leave it to
the likes of virtue and the audience
that that would have had if it were
still existing right now I would like to
take the moment here to welcome in our
multimedia manager Jaime Rivera hello to
you sir hello how's everything hey dude
hello pretty good I'm sad for Argentina
man I'm sorry
a lot of times I'm surfer Argentina man
the team in may morning and now why is a
we had promised his massacre stolen what
Mexico still in oh my god Mexican lost a
long time ago they did a great they did
a great time great job though I think
Mako had the strongest most difficult
they had the most difficult group and
they pull their strings man they did an
amazing an amazing feat like I was
really sad when when Mexico was out as
well I mean I'm only in it for the
consulate drinking with Mexicans outside
the embassy no no no my funny story was
right now that I was in Frankfurt I was
in Frankfurt a few days ago I was
drinking beer having the best fun at
this beer garden in in Frankfurt
obviously all these Germans just so
happy with their team about the play and
they lost so I was like oh my god how
beautiful it is to watch
World Cup game of Germany in Germany and
it turns out they lose that was that was
sad the most disappointing thing that
you could ever experience well
on a trip to catch some views with your
club a p20 prayer know that you might
have some some thoughts on that a little
bit later I do want to transition though
right now to our Android PE segment
where we kind of catch up with what's
been going on this week we just got the
fourth Developer Preview in the third
public beta stage going on and for the
most parts in terms of my you know just
top level perception of it because I've
been using it on my pixel to hear it
still kind of runs the same you still
got the annoying gesture thing that
they're still trying to do at the bottom
navigation bar I still don't like the
multitasking kind of dual paradigm that
that bag has or if you're trying to like
swipe up it's just it doesn't feel
natural but I was wondering if like kind
of the everyday experience that you guys
either of you have had with Android P so
far yeah okay um yeah III do like a lot
of the micro optimizations that they're
doing here and they're mostly in the UI
I like for example the the fact that
you've got the a bunch of menus to the
side like the volume menu the power menu
I like that you've got the screen shot
the screenshot button in the power menu
all those little things are cool you got
the screenshot editor some of that is
kind of playing catch-up because a lot
of other phones have had screenshot
editors it's just a really convenient
feature you know they're doing some
tweaks with like making Andrew always on
display more convenient like putting the
battery mom kind of redesigned
notifications as well there's a lot it's
a lot there you know they kind of moving
away from that old material design now
they got a new spec and it's interesting
I just don't think it kind of
fundamentally changes the user
experience in a way such as new get kind
of did for me at least it doesn't kind
of introduce any of this
features smaller changes up to my
stations in the background and the
architectural revision of project travel
which it's being finalized which means
that you can actually see it come to you
know bring what it was promising to
bring all those yeah definitely I will
say that I have noticed the little
improvements they have done to the
ambient display functions and it's nice
to see that kind of a basic Android
feature that Samsung into like Motorola
have done and get that brought in AOSP
and then moved on to sort of a more
mature state just didn't have everyone
be able to take advantage of it so you
know that's nice and also a project
treble which has had the best start I
mean we're talking about Android and
fragmentation and kind of the the
clinginess because this was originally
an Oreo feature or at least something
that was brought alongside with Oreo and
I guess wait am i talking about the part
no well the partitions do make it very
helpful and useful to you know
streamline the process quickly but it's
just a being able to upload your kind of
puzzle piece to an update package be it
whether you're chip manufacturer or the
phone manufacturer or the carrier and
just have that you know boom done
quickly so tell me more about the
progress that trouble has made so far
well so like you said travel is a really
texturing of Android in the sense that
and you know that om no longer need to
wait for a lot of puzzle pieces in order
to put together their ODS this makes it
easier for them to kind of update and
roll out updates but also it makes it
easier for just about anyone to kind of
flash a system image so something that
we've been very proud of a texier
something that our developers have been
doing is making these uh there's global
system images that you can flash undo
any travel enable device which is great
because you can basically grab one
common ROM one common AOSP build and
more or less painlessly flash it across
a myriad of phones with different
specifications and so on so that is
actually pretty cool and that that I
think is a testament of how powerful
project treble is because if developers
can do this and can do it so quickly and
so painlessly despite all the kind of
different hardware variations it still
works across devices it kind of gives
you a clue of just how meaningful it is
I just don't think it was kind of
finished and I don't think every develop
every OEM was onboard
last cycle so I think that now we're
actually seeing it come to fruition
especially now that we have this new
Developer Preview you already see the
Developer Preview arriving on Oleum
devices and they even come with their
small little tweaks their small little
UI features and so on and so forth and
really I think that's really powerful
interest I have actually been oh my god
so I need to visit the XDA forum again
so I wasn't aware that you guys were
building all this oh my god that is so
cool it's exciting yeah yeah I mean you
can you can even grab a Chiron chipset
phone like you can grab a phone which
traditionally have been really really
hard to develop custom wrong sport just
because the the sources were not there
in full there was no documentation for
developers to be able to bring AOSP roms
just fully working on that and it
doesn't matter anymore because you can
just flash this one image in the
developer doesn't need to concern
himself with all the little changes that
need to be made and and the user
specifically doesn't need to concern
himself with all the stuff you just
flash it and it works and it's been
working for a while now I think it was
at CES we even had a the first I figure
seemed a time Pro running AOSP
and it pretty much worked I mean it
performed really great some stuff was
more or less not perfect but it's been
being worked on and it works pretty well
it's got a lot of potential
nice nice tell me something how how have
you seen for example the you know the
progress of raw of of Android pee on
other phones that are not the pixel
because I've been reluctant to you to
load Android pee on my pixel I've been
meaning to do it on a one plus six but
then I hear that that the J's you know
just the build is just so
early implemented on any other phone
that's not the pixel yet yeah
so I tried both one plus six beta build
the first one was hot trash it's just it
was really bad it had a lot of buzz a
lot of app closes a lot of issues with
notification rendering and you could
tell that it was unfinished because they
barely had any Wampus features the
settings menu was just pretty much
borrowed straight from the AOSP settings
apk it was it was very unfinished in
that sense move over to the D injury
that the next beta on the Wampus six and
you can already see not just that it's
more finished but you can also even see
hints of where oneplus is taking oxygen
OS which is really interesting because
it not only has changes that look a lot
more different than Google's Android PA
OSP kind of flavor
it also looks different from the oxygen
OS that you find on current oneplus
devices on the stable branch which is
really interesting they have kind of a
new design language going on they
implemented a few little design sign
changes as well and more customization
options that are now making their way to
the beta branch so it's pretty cool in
the sense that yeah they're they're
adding their changes and they work with
features the oneplus features work I
think most of them work
I'm not running that bill because it
still has problems it blue just doesn't
work at all I don't know that's a
deal-breaker you know I can't really I
don't have Bluetooth but what eighty is
interesting you can see that they're
bringing the update faster I think
project travel in particular is probably
one of the reasons why one plus is
committing to software support in a way
that they haven't before just this week
they had announced that okay we're
actually committing to two years of
software support software updates oh
okay and why they're bringing project
travel to the 1 + 5 + 5 t it's already
on the beta branch and and they had said
that they wouldn't do it before I think
that seeing they're seeing that it comes
with some nifty benefits and I
definitely see that the the it's shaping
up it's not there yet lots
bugs but it's nice and it kind of works
it's definitely interesting developments
happening there that may to make things
more plug in play friendly even with the
you know just being able to intercept
the process for fans to do whatever they
would like to do with that it sort of
brings back kind of the days of when you
wanted to mod Android and when you in
some cases when you need it to mod
Android to get things to operate how you
want them to and you know as we've gone
through the years and we kind of felt
less of that need going on it certainly
does feel like a refreshing new ability
to have that back again and have it done
easier than ever
so definitely cheers to that I was
wondering if I remembered my hashtag
peeing weekly question over here from
Renato Laporte or well just a couple of
pinions here the navigation gestures are
a joke on Android P compared with what
you can achieve with the XDA navigation
bar props to you guys also interesting
I'm going to ask you about that just a
second open the window is a pain in the
ass and then there's also in terms of
Farley open Kieran for the win it's only
ashamed that many hearts are still
proprietary it doesn't work on GSI so
yeah services definitely kind of lacking
still there wondering what XD on you
should was sorry you were cutting out
there well I was wondering what the
navigation bar that what XDA has modded
that to be like yeah so so it's it's an
application people can find out in the
Play Store you get a lot of features
just from the the free app as well and
it's basically kind of like the iPhone
navigation pill which you can judge you
can customize it to kind of swipe to the
side and swipe up and so on hold and
stuff and you can set whatever kind of
shortcut you want to whatever actually
you want you know you can also customize
the the size of the pill the
transparency of the pill so you can
actually make
missable in fact there's a bunch of
settings that you can play with to make
it basically identical to the one plus
navigation system gesture navigation
system you just have to find the right
settings and that might be a mode as
well but it's really cool in the sense
that it does give you that ability we're
always working on bugs so if you if you
find an issue with it just hit us up and
we'll we'll fix it we've been working
diligently on addressing all the issues
that people have had and expanding the
feature set as well got great people
working on it so it's been great it's
gotten tons of ins tons of installs
we've surprised that kind of the
reception and it's nice because it
allows people that won't perhaps get
injured P won't get it at all won't get
it in time it enables them to experience
kind of the navigation gestures in a way
that uh gives an even more customization
two questions the first one is well you
already answered so you don't need
Android P pretty much it works on Ori oh
yeah
the second one is so one of the reasons
why I don't use the navigation gestures
on the six is because I hate that I
can't call on the Google assistant with
them yeah I mean I actually use the
Google assistant and for me it's like
okay like where's the gesture but then
again I love the concept because it
allows you to have a full display like a
foolish buy for everything and so I've
been like battling with that like is
there a solution on your XDA app yeah
yeah definitely you should be able to
kind of link just about anything you
want to it any shortcut I'm pretty sure
that that's working if it's not it'll
definitely be working in the near future
but I'm pretty sure that that's the case
just because of how customizable it is
you can just have any kind of shortcut
or to an activity or whatever and you
can do that already on other kind of
shortcuts as well so it should be
working and I absolutely understand what
you mean though like it's it's
definitely kind of a problem I think
would we've kind of the rise of
convenience keys it won't be such an
issue in the future but right now it is
kind of a pain and yeah
hashtag convenience key for the camera
everyone thank you really
these kids all over the place just have
add more buttons please like an actual
buttons not HTC buttons you know Oh My
yes
CJ I see Zak's video jerry-rigged
everything about that so it's funny
because I uh so III met with Zack in
London I already had a review units AG
hadn't seen it yet and some like dude
you have no idea how much I'm waiting to
see her video like and he's like huh you
know you know Zacks voice and everything
it just is demeanor he's like Oh
interesting it's like okay and so he
started looking at the foot and he's
like I can already see where I'm gonna
go with this now here's the thing I
buttons are like my biggest phone pet
peeve like if a phone has Wiggly buttons
it just torments me to no end to the
point where I can never I'll return
phones just because the button was a
little bit too loose for my taste but
I'm right and and so when I saw this I
she see concert I'm like okay I want
stiff buttons but you've taken it way
too far so I will be fixed it's a I have
to admire the way Apple has done it with
devices like the iPhone 8 iPhone 7 how
they do it with the the force touch
trackpad on on the macbook like you
seriously like I remember the first time
that I touched this forced to trackpad
I'm currently using by the way I hate
and I'm sorry about the webcam
capabilities of this $3,000 MacBook Pro
it's one of the things that I hate the
most by the way but like the performance
of the trackpad is legendary and you
know in my review of the you 12 plus
what I said was listen I don't really
mind of the buttons are capacitive or
not so long as the implementation
doesn't mean that I'm pressing a button
here and I'm feeling the vibration down
here like it just it makes no sense like
at all and then you have the problem
that it was it was oh my god like you
would press it and you you couldn't like
you could control the sensitivity of
that sense but you couldn't control the
sensitivity of the buttons like really
like I would rather switch at
it sends off completely on you know and
for me it's just God that is such a
great camera on such a bad phone I think
that I think that's my final verdict on
the you 12 plus it is such a great
camera but the phone is just like wowed
so much of a step back compared to what
HTC has done in the past yeah Oh anyways
definitely and that just the follow-up
thanks to Andrew Wallace for pointing
this out Jerry also has a new video
today following up with the you 12
pluses buttons seeing if they could be
quote-unquote fixed he has a tear down
of that go nuts now I'll update the post
will link that in the thing the
dooblydoo as people used to say I don't
think anyone says that anymore
let's talk quick second about the rare
and one plus six it's out July 10th and
I believe Jaime wants to have a little
pedestal for it alright so a carbon
fiber case well that ruins it entirely
that's such a cool combination man Oh
God so two things about oneplus we're
working on a comparison I'm a whole
thing to have it ready for this weekend
it's kind of a complicated one but
number one yes I do love the color and I
love this implementation of red words
not the glossy black that we had with
the first the mirror black one plus six
for me was just annoying I'm like please
don't send me that unit I don't want to
make a review of it because it's just
gonna be a nightmare to film anyone and
then and then they sent me the silk the
the matte black one the midnight black
which is my favorite so far it looks
like if they were aluminum and I love
that but I have been using this phone
for a week and I've had a really hard
time not using it because number one
it's just it's in that it's in between
like it's not as reflective and it's not
as matte it's a lie somewhere in between
I love the finish and a lot of people
would say that you know it's just a
different color on a phone it is I agree
it's just a really cool color I love the
companies are playing that that are
there
that game where we want to continue
giving relevance to these products so
we're gonna keep a couple of colors back
and we're gonna be launching them over
time just to get a little more buzz on
the product the second thing about
oneplus just to keep the short the
recent software updates I would highly
suggest you guys look at the camera
performance there have been a lot of
improvements since my review mm-hmm a
lot of improvements I I'm very shocked
so part of the comparison is gonna be
literally this phone against a $1000
phone just to show you how much the
camera has improved on this phone with a
cat with comparison to a phone that's
twice as expensive I am shocked
like the word is shocked so stay tuned
for that I mean well we already had the
oneplus 6 review outright and this is
going to be like the comparison will
serve as somewhat of an update as an
update because yes so the guy in my
review of the oneplus thinks the camera
was good like if you'd notice my
comparison with the s9 plus I'm like
alright it's not an s9 plus it's not but
it's very close like there were a lot of
shots that were very close and I guess
it was just the the you know obviously
you've got a wider aperture on the
galaxy s 9 so the performance was better
even though I would I would complain
about the shutter speed on the s9 + like
I feel that it doesn't it doesn't take
the shot when it's supposed to and so
it's really bad on moving subjects the
oneplus 6 did a better job in that but
then there are certain shots where
nothing was moving that the s9 + would
just you know it would win but not by a
long shot
but yeah like I feel that a lot has
improved in the recent software update
so look into that and I'll definitely
let you let you know more about it in
the comparison definitely an update
definitely so alright we'll be looking
forward to that
in the meantime more news of the week
and we're starting off with what galaxy
s X s 10 s maybe the S 10 x sx something
we'll try and see if we can get the
names tangled untangled but in the
meantime the foldable phone that we've
been talking about for years now we are
talking about
for every driver yeah hmm it's every
second for the past ten years I guess
you could say we've seen a lot of those
demos of the foldable or the flexible
OLED screen technology since maybe 2009
well apparently we might be seeing the
Galaxy X come to fruition in limited
quantities of course during CES 2019 so
perhaps you know around that maybe it's
time Sun does its usual unpacked thing I
personally think that they'll use the
CES sanctioned platform to show it off
because it's got a limited appeal in
terms of actual consumers but it does
make for a good show and piece so they
want to have that at their booth so
perhaps that's something to look forward
to meanwhile galaxy s 10 the more
conventional more traditional Android
flagship gonna be happening around MWC
it happened the s9 launch happened I
don't know you see so I guess it's what
we could expect reasonably and again
things might change but um I want to
know as we kind of have like a loose
time um how you're feeling towards the
foldable phone at this point we've seen
pictures and art and all the stuff in
the patents um are you kind of tired out
are you kind of excited Mario I can
guarantee you that it will be a better
flexible phone than the LG G flex yeah I
mean we've been we've been peace with
this technology for so long like I every
time there's an article on XDA oh my god
do I have to use this picture from 2010
again you know there's not even that
many pictures and the OL highlight is
outdated ugly TouchWiz on it or whatever
it we we need to see a come to fruition
we've been seeing it in all kinds of
patents we've been seeing it at all
kinds of like there's also that cringey
one
with the tablet I'm not sure you guys
remember yeah yeah I remember that one
it was not as bad as the the Samsung
gear one another gear watch one that was
the worst but we won't follow up with
you Mario but hi may your take um
alright
tablets are on decline they've been on
the klein since the iPad for I guess and
it doesn't matter what Apple has done
like companies like Samsung barely does
tablets now Huawei has done a few good
ones so I feel that whatever companies
can do to bring some limelight to the
tablet space will make sense I love that
Samsung is bold enough to use their R&amp;amp;D
and try to make some money off of it I
mean fab woods exists because of that so
I I leave it to Samsung like my my
opinion is show me what you got you know
i some people don't know what they need
until somebody shows it to them so I I
want tablets to work like I am an avid
iPad user like the party now daily and a
lot of the videos that I do are are
possible because of the versatility of
certain things that iPads do and because
I've had to do it better than certain
other tablets even Windows tablets so I
guess I really want some competition I
really want a tablet like I I know
friends that are like they're you know
cartoon artists that that they will tell
you like an iPad pro with an Apple
pencil is just so good so for me it's
always been like you know I love the
note form factor I hate that the note is
so small so if they gave me a foldable
display with an S Pen I would love that
so long as the implementation is great
so we'll see it has an S Pen need
bluetooth well I'll tell you this much
like I hate having something more to
charge but you know I I guess software
just needs the the abilities of
Bluetooth to provide certain other
features like right now you don't have
the tilt features that are available on
the S Pen on the
version of forgetting I'm trying to
remember what what tablet Samsung
launched with an S Pen and the
Chromebook like there were tilt features
but they depend on the saw on the apps
and not the software itself and the
implementation was just really bad so I
guess I don't know if they're adding the
features as long as they don't they
figured out an easy way to charge it I'm
all for it we'll see I mean unless like
you know you're connecting your Galaxy
Note 9000 index or two if it's like
connected to a projector and you're
using your pen to move slides I'm not
sure of what practically what
practicality that sort of thing has and
if the engineering yeah in the if the
engineering to make it rechargeable
easily rechargeable maybe perhaps in the
silo like there's a whole bunch of
things it's ridiculous I'm not sure what
will happen we're gonna be there you and
I will be there Jaime when we get to
Atlantic terminal on the Li double r on
August 9 yeah and as for the follow-up I
do want to get back to you just quickly
Mario I know that we've dealt with
software on the X on em and the Kyocera
echo if we can remember all the way back
there but it's you know those rigid
foldable things which are kind of weird
I I know this is going to be this is
going to require like a blood rush into
the head or something but if there's
anything that we can expect or if
there's one thing that we can expect
from the first gen software of a
foldable phone what would it be um well
I think that uh CTE did a more or less
good job with a recent foldable phone I
think that would expect something like
that I mean it's I mean they they worked
within you can very much still that they
work within the constraints of Android
for this kind of thing I think that
seems a bit more bold when it comes to
just like saying okay kind of pushing
the boundaries of what entry allows them
to do even if it ends up a big clunky
like look at the X right yeah I think I
think that if if Samson's going all-in
with this they are definitely not gonna
do kind of a a you know halfway halfway
measure kind of thing
they I mean Samsung decks it's kind of
inconvenient it's not very useful but it
works pretty well like it's it's
certainly polished to a degree where
it's usable even if it's not useful I
would expect more or less the same at
the same time if I'm not sure if you
guys follow also what's going on with
surface and that they also kind of kind
of playing with this format and stuff
doing like the whole I guess yeah it's
like they they're doing a little switch
thing or something right oh so they're I
think I think you know it might just be
kind of this bigger untapped market then
we're able to predict right now I mean
obviously like Jaime I'm also a tablet
user from a surface user it's it's more
in surface to me it's fantastic so if
Samsung can do something that gives me
the surface tablet potential perhaps by
modifying decks in some way and making
it tablet friendly I don't know while
also keeping in a phone format to me
that would be invaluable just because I
do actually use my note a lot I do use
the s-pen a lot and I do use my surface
tablet a lot because I got a pen yeah so
if they can manage that I would like
that oh I wish they came up with a
concept like this one where you have a
phone and it's got a modular connector
and you can just add another screen to
it if you want or something stupid like
that I don't know it's just for me the
unless unless this so what was my
problem with the ax on them I'm like
alright those borders are gonna rip my
jeans man it was like with the it was
like with the razor phone as well like
shoot like I get that that design looks
great on a laptop but it doesn't look
good on a phone and it won't perform
well on my dreams map
and so if why would I need to carry a
tablet yeah
with in a phone if I will always use it
I would rather they give me like a
detachable keyboard on the surface they
would give me a modular second screen
like a second monitor that I could snap
on and extend and make it a tablet when
I need to and it's just an accessory
that I buy for 200 bucks
then for me to have something that I
don't need to always be carrying so I
love the concept of the switch because
of that you can add the controls when
you need them you don't add the control
so you don't that's it you know yeah and
it becomes portable when you want to do
and it's not portable when you don't I
love that concept yeah I think they're a
little bit to invest it in through this
foldable technology I mean it's been
going on for so many years they gotta
gotta put it out there at some point and
as as much as I think that your solution
would be more practical I think that
same since just too far too deep into
this to kind of go modular now yeah I
mean there has to be a spectacle part to
it I'm not sure if that kind of modular
thing would be something that would
capture the attention and keep it for
you know the amount of time needs to
convert a sale so I mean I definitely
hope that you know someone out there is
taking that seriously and we'll have to
see we'll have to move on and just a
quick topic on iPhones in terms of who's
buying them so a CI RP which is a
research firm does rolling surveys over
the course of the year on who's buying
which iPhone B it's an iOS native you
could say who has been on iOS for a
while and just a reach of recent Android
switcher which CRP estimates that's
around 15 to 20 percent of any given
year's iPhone sales come from those
Android switchers and it turns out to
sum up the results here that iOS natives
are more willing to go for the likes of
the iPhone 10 and iPhone 8 more so than
Android switchers which tend to start
off you know with a I've owned se iPhone
7 older models are more affordable
models and I guess I just want to relay
it back to you guys in terms of I'm not
you know I'm not saying in terms of you
know your own personal personal personal
experiences but maybe like you know
people that you've talked with your
family your friends whatnot like how do
they feel if they've ever dealt with
this kind of deal
yeah I think it makes complete sense I
mean if you think about it the people
that really want to switch away from
Android are usually people that have bad
experiences with Android and the bad
experiences with Android are usually
found in the low to mid end of things so
I would like to see whether it
discriminates whether it's it's people
switching from flagship Android devices
to kind of lower and iPhones that will
be surprising if it's just people
switching from Android to lower and
iPhone so it makes sense because if they
have a pretty bad experience with a bad
Android phone that just happens to be in
the mid-range and they're in the market
for a mid-range they can't really kind
of say okay I've been I've been burned
by the mid-range therefore I'm gonna go
all out I'm gonna buy a muster up for
the best iPhone most people can't do
that and even if they're really really
frustrated with their inner experience
most people that have the vendor
experience I would presume would also be
the people that have kind of least
expensive and/or phones so I think it
makes sense to me I mean I always
recommend iPhones to people who who
really really just can't deal with
Android even though I personally have
never really used an iPhone for long
expiry time at least yeah definitely in
my case it's interesting I mean I feel I
my response would be I love surveys
because surveys depend on where you
survey people like what it like it even
depends on what state you live on I mean
I will tell you this much like New York
City is one of the most interesting
cities in what pertains to the amount of
wealth there is and just the disparity
there is as well when it comes to
poverty I have never seen a city with
older cars in the United States and
therefore in the same way I have never
seen a city with older iPhones on
subways so I think it has a lot to do it
depends on where the survey was done man
and the second thing is it like one of
the things that I feel that Apple has
played well that Android has not played
well as long longitude
I think that's the word I see people
with iPhone fours man and because for
some people a phone is just a tool it's
a communications tool that they use for
you know for making phone calls and I
feel that that's the vast majority of
the market
where people are not really interested
in coughing up 40 50 bucks a month for
the latest flagship or the latest iPhone
they just want a phone that makes good
phone calls tastes good photos and ever
since the iPhone 4 man that phone takes
good photos so I feel that it you know
it really depends like I I've noticed I
remember when the galaxy s4 was launched
so many people switched to iPhones after
that because that pho was just so bad
and so that gave like a really bad name
to Android back in the day there was the
time than most people switched to
iPhones
I remember those surveys and then the
Galaxy s5 was such a flop so I don't
know man I feel that again depends on
where you are and and I have promised
that you know kudos to Apple for for
doing a good job and pertaining software
updates to their phones way ahead of
like right now iOS 12 is gonna support
all the same phones that I was 11
supported you don't see that very often
I mean we saw Apple's support the iPad 2
for like 7 years or something like that
so no not 7 years but like 5 years I
think it was the iPads are not that old
but yeah I mean I feel that the more
Android figures out how to fix their
software update problems and just ensure
that users get a reliable experience for
a decent amount of years the more
popular Android is gonna be for
switchers that's my opinion perhaps and
definitely want to hear your comments
about that too you listener you viewer
so type in and hashtag PN weekly podcast
at pocketnow.com I think that you want
to give in through insights on this
we'll talk about it a little bit more as
well as these things typically just keep
happening they become up in cycles and
finally this week we want to go and talk
about the me mix 3 from Xiaomi we
haven't had anything teased out yet but
we've seen Weibo go all crazy with this
new leaked photo of the new mix 3
perhaps
with a uniform bezel around this huge
display and no chin whatsoever it's kind
of this me mix crusade against bezels
that start out with the top end and then
there's still been this chin that has
kept on stubbornly so I don't know does
this leak picture do anything for its
veracity not sure there's also something
that's less kind of a verifiable at this
point which is a teaser that's kind of
half-baked but apparently we might see
the light of me come out in September
and the the little silhouette that it's
showing infers our implies excuse me
that we are seeing a pop up camera and I
think I'd this not because I'm not
really a fan of what the Oppo find X did
in terms of you know moving parts servos
and whatnot like this is it's just a
spring-loaded part and well you get very
little compromise in terms of service a
service life for the device and well I
am curious what - what you think about
this though go for a motor yeah I think
I mean it's kind of expected right if
there's kind of any kind of lineup that
would do away with the chin or be one of
the first to do do away with the chin on
Android it would be this lineup so I
wouldn't be surprised if the leaks are
accurate asks for kind of the
spring-loaded mechanism so we're seeing
I can't say I'm a big fan like III stuff
like glass for example I'm super super
cautious about sand and dust and stuff
because I don't want my grass scratch I
don't want stuff getting in between
cracks of my phone and stuff I can see
this being a problem especially we
definitely a valid concern stuff yeah
but um show me who's been doing good
thing with these phones so that they
definitely feel premium they definitely
looked the part and I wouldn't be I
wouldn't be shocked at all if the leaks
are actually accurate yeah
mmm oh my god now sadly I apologize I
didn't read that part of the segment so
my knee makes two S's of the draw it's
in the it's in the other room that me
much to us was my first experience with
show me I have to tell you this much I
do not like their software but I do like
their hardware a lot I am very impressed
and I am but I don't like their software
but it took me a while to understand
just how their software plays in the
importance of the price tag that they
charge for these phones so for me me mix
2's is not just about how beautiful the
phone is and the fact that it's ceramic
it's the fact that it's priced crazy
aggressively and the fact that they use
software in order to be able to
subsidize the price tag through the
services that they sell and so it took
me a while to understand how their their
economics worked
I'm very impressed now I understand why
they are so focused on the Chinese
market because this is the place where
they get the most amount of revenue
their services don't work outside of
China so I'm gonna tell you this much
like I love the concept if this meme x3
is real I will definitely love to review
it because one of the things that I
didn't like about the me mix to us was
that camera at the bottom and having to
flip the phone around and for me that's
just an added an added step that I felt
to be you know I just I wish that they
have like some sort of a way for you to
flip the phone and for the phone to
understand that you want to use a selfie
camera I don't know something like that
through software but that you know i
i've been debating the whole concept of
mechanical parts obviously i I worked in
aviation and I know how servos work and
just the whole just the mechanics that
go into it I find that amazing and I
like the fact that companies are are
working in providing a solution to
eliminating the bezel I would prefer
that to which Xiaomi did with the what
was the phone that they launched they
look like in an iPhone like an iPhone 10
which one is the cross the reason one
that it even brought the
the March and everything he's talking
about the me ate that one that would
like for me that was like alright yeah
that looks too much like an iPhone guys
I I get that they that they use Apple
for a lot of their inspiration and I
love that they've provided their own
unique approach to devices like the
Phoenix to us so I'm I'm all for it
whatever the company does so long as
they continue with that perspective of
providing amazing hardware because it is
amazing it is a very well designed phone
it's a very beautiful phone I will make
a video on it I promise and so long as
they do that and they I don't know I did
they provide him and they retain the
listen I don't mind if they launched
those phones outside of China like if
they launched the United States
obviously their saw and be like alright
fine we can't subsidize the hardware
through software so we're gonna charge a
little more but this there's this
beautiful phone you can use and now it
has stock Android I'm all for it but
that would be me yeah definitely
suggesting that I have is to check out
Martin Bart's as video technology video
explaining how Xiaomi works because it's
definitely interesting it I mean
including the fact that the CEO
mentioned that oh we're going to limit
ourselves to 5% margins on hardware
sales from this point forward which is
gonna be interesting as if and that's
its goal and perhaps maybe its services
side will need to take time to catch up
at the very least if not well kind of
associate itself all together I mean we
are under this kind of a Red Scare in
the u.s. at the moment a new Red Scare
you could say Gen 2 of that so
definitely interesting to see as Xiaomi
kind of wants its own empire to grow as
for trying to take the time say thank
you to our friend Mario here from XDA is
there anything that you're happening to
be working on right now I'm just
directing some articles behind the
scenes mainly been trying to do a in
beautifully directed creatively
directing exactly trying to do something
with the eraser phone so maybe some
in-depth performance analysis of this I
find that a 120 Hertz display is so good
like it's like the most perceptible
performance improvement that I've had on
Android in a long time well probably
since the pixel 1 but or maybe the Nexus
5 even the satphone was so smooth but I
you know that I just want to see more
120 Hertz displays you know it's fun
because I oh my god so I I said I have a
razor throat I don't have it with me
but I didn't really notice much of a
difference like really cool it's cool
but you know it's like scrolling every
now and then which I think that's yeah
that's the thing though like that's the
feeling it's just very smooth scrolling
performance in terms of like speed like
okay it's not asked responsive as newer
phones but just a scrolling performance
and has to do with the adaptive sync
that it's going on in the background
which is is able to adapt the frame rate
so that you don't actually get stutters
like yeah you get lower frame rate some
some load some kind of a workloads but
but you don't see stutters and to me
that's great like one of the reasons why
even got started writing for XDA was
because I was really frustrated with my
Galaxy Note free and all the stutters
and that's how I got started into this
whole thing just by pointing out how
terrible it was so I got started in
parking now because I bricked the PDA I
need to go under some I use er in XDA
developers definitely yeah definitely
breaking around it there was a time
where I was I was very active an ex-dea
that I'm trying to it was it back in the
time of Windows Mobile and they have
like the coolest solutions and then I
switched to Android with the Nexus One
those were good times huh indeed indeed
I've been breaking phones since my entry
into pocket now so yep
our track record of that and I'm sure
that you'll be talking those
developments as we head into more
production of the pocket now at the area
oh yeah
so first of all thank you everybody who
subscribed to the Spanish Channel this
has been a project that's taken six
months to take off it's it's mainly
because launching a YouTube channel from
scratch is not easy and I guess for we
were very worried about the the aspect
of doing that and obviously you know
there's that element of possible failure
there's no guarantee if you have a
popular channel on one end that you'll
launch a second one they'll go well
we've seen so many examples of
colleagues that have tried and it's not
easy and we really wanted to do the
audio in a way that would not so right
now you're just seeing the launch and
therefore a lot of things are the fact
that Sam who works with us is currently
sitting on the other end you know just a
training because like we do for example
parking out daily and final cut we do
the Parana while the audio in Premiere
Pro so right now we're currently working
with the same graphics package but
that's about to change
just the approach of how we do news is
also going to change right now it's just
you know sitting like it's funny how it
it's so easy for me to report that it
was in English but then when I do it in
Spanish it's just the body who can tell
you like you know in Spanish in Spanish
like you don't do it as we say coming
set up for t-shirt and an anteater they
say I made out like I was like how's
that you know it's you go to every
single country in Latin America and
there are so many different ways to say
the same thing and so it's just that
difficulty of finding like I'll give you
an idea like recording a pocket out
daily is literally five minutes of
footage whereas if I record out the
audio it's sometimes between 10 and 15
just because I'm like yeah I can't say
that word yeah that word doesn't mean
I'm like you know he just gets stuck
with English sometimes it's the trick a
lot of the terminology is in English but
then how do you say it in Spanish like I
got this comment the other day where it
was like yeah but we say that I mean
that I'm like yeah you say better
meaning
in Spain I get that but that I mean I
love you look what if you look at the
the descriptive definition of tedamy
model it's just the computer that's
hooked up to a server but it doesn't
really have any it doesn't really do
anything so I understand that this is
what you colloquially say in your
country but it doesn't necessarily mean
that that's the correct definition of a
device and so yeah going back to the
topic it's been it's been a labor of
love I'm just I'm so happy with the
results I wasn't expecting it to have
such a great response so quickly and I
just I invite you to subscribe I we have
a ton of unique content that's gonna go
into that Channel and I'm happy that I
we have the right team of people to get
it done and it's just gonna take a
little while to unwind the rest of the
videos like the reviews and the
comparisons that are gonna go there and
there's gonna be a quick transition
period where a lot of things are gonna
look the same between English and
Spanish but the idea is not for things
to be that way so we'll keep you posted
a lot is coming we definitely have a lot
planned in store for you guys so
definitely stay tuned across I don't
think our fingers for some things to
happen in to actuate but until then
we're just gonna keep delivering the
same quality journalism that you expect
out of us were editorial content as well
