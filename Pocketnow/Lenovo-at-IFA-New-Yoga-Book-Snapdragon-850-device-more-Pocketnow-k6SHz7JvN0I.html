days at Aoife showing us the PC and the
Chromebook are still their core business
we spent a significant amount of time at
the show with all their laptops
reporting from Aoife and Berlin I'm hey
meta we met up with PocketNow and let's
go hands-on
let's start this off with Chromebooks as
Lenovo had a bit of everything to show
us at their briefing we start with
devices like the C 330 with a two-in-one
hinge design and other devices like the
S 330 with more of a clamshell approach
both Chromebooks are less than $280 with
specifications and an appeal that
matched the price tag
the biggest highlight was really their
new yoga Chromebook the yoga line has
mainly been for PCs of a specific design
but it now takes the plunge to Chrome
territory we're talking about a 15 inch
display at core i5 KB Lake and options
for a higher resolution display and more
storage price points range from $5.99 to
$7.99 depending on the configuration you
choose the yoga line is actually
changing its approach moving away from
the flip design and now focusing on
being a top consumer brand devices like
the C 930 being an example the Dolby
sound bar hinge at most software adobe
vision HDR display etc I love neat
tricks like the privacy shade on a
camera and the fact that we have the
stylus tucked into the body at the back
other cases are for example the yoga s7
30 now focused on being a very thin and
light computer with a new cooling system
that ventilates the computer through the
keyboard you have a new intel whiskey
lake processor and a little hinge at the
bottom to assist in more ventilation now
for the topics that were most interested
on let's talk about the yoga C 630 those
of you asking for an update on the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 doze 10 here it
is we have a full aluminum body a full
HD display a 61 watt hour battery and
the obvious promise that it'll s more
than a day thanks to all the
optimizations brought by Qualcomm we
have a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 4 to
8 gigs of ram depending on the storage
configuration the go theater is actually
smaller and lighter than it looks and
includes a decent amount of ports to
support it last but not least my
favorite of the show continues to be the
new yoga book C 930 this is a successor
to the former yoga book that we reviewed
in the past and weren't really impressed
by because of Android this is now
Windows 10 only computer run by either a
Core i5 or an m3 depending on the
configuration you choose I can't tell
you enough how
I love this design it's just so portable
and so practical that I really want to
give it a try for review we have a ten
point eight inch 2560 by 1600 IPS LCD
touchscreen and the cherry topper is the
secondary Ian display of the same
footprint the yang serves to become your
keyboard with the great thing that you
can actually select whatever language
you want you can also use it as an
e-reader doodling or other artistic
purposes it'll even work with PDF
documents as well so yes this is Lenovo
