an HTC tiara windows phone gets rumoured
an Apple added experts admit that
Samsung is making a dent on their
advertisement I'm hi Mary vetta and by
the time I was watching the game we were
selling losing one to nil this is pocket
now daily well after Apple launched the
retail stores more than a decade ago and
then Microsoft pretty much followed the
trend it only made sense for Google to
be the next company to launch their own
stores right well the rumors were filled
with that a couple of days ago but sadly
Andy Rubin just came on record to say
that the company is not building stores
even with the fact that they have their
own nexus products now and the reason
why is well just think about it Google
is a web company wouldn't it be an irony
for the company that's on the web to be
selling things on stores and not on the
web now let's talk about HCC the company
still seems committed to Windows Phone 8
or as the new codename HTC our could
prove because the device apparently is
on the works and the great question is
what to expect sadly the spec sheet
looks kind of terrible we have a device
coming out here with the wvga display so
you can't expect for this device to be a
mid tiered phone the question is when
will we get it stay tuned and wc is
pretty much over so we won't get it
there so probably get in the next couple
of months we'll keep you posted now
speaking of Windows Phone aside from the
cheap nokia device announcements that we
talked about yesterday nokia also
featured the fact that they've made the
bold move of actually becoming more of a
software company if any of you remember
we had the here maps application coming
to android and iOS which brought Nokia
Maps to Iowa's an Android and now the
company is also doing the same for
Windows Phone it's said that they did it
for nokia navigation no Kim maps and no
kit transit aside from other
applications which are now being dubbed
here maps here navigation here transit
and everything else the software is well
it's still in the beta stage everything
is still being tested only have a full
video walkthrough of that for Michael
Fisher so stay tuned and hit the links
in the description for details now how
many of you remember the yotaphone
remember that concept device where you
had an LCD display on one side and a
knee and display on the other the device
could actually be powered by the battery
on one side but then on the other side
you don't really need much power at all
well the device is already lie
mwc 2013 and Michael Fisher had a lot of
time to demo the unit and even though it
seems quite compelling it best to wonder
this will be a concept that will ever
actually take off I mean the device
actually looks good but I wonder how
well that e-ink display will take a
beating after you actually use it in
your pocket so make sure you hit the
links in the description for michael's
full video and aside from that we have
33 mwc 2013 videos so also hit the links
for the playlist down below because
there is a lot of content that I can't
cover on this show too much and finally
for the interesting news of the day can
you believe that Apple's advertisement
guru for almost 14 years Adam Segal who
worked alongside with Steve Jobs just
came on record to state that samsung's
new galaxy advertisement is actually
quite effective at actually making a
dent and Apple strategy and just think
about it I mean Apple is an iconic
company when it comes to advertisement
their 1984 ad for the Macintosh is still
being considered the best advertisement
in history even if you can believe that
but the point being is that apparently
the new Samsung Galaxy ads are actually
extremely effective and as Adam Segal
said they're hitting a nerve but that
leads you to the question of the day how
well or how much have you actually like
these Samsung ads in my particular case
I'll plead guilty I mean I pretty much
got the Galaxy Note 2 with the whole
unicorn but I forgot the name of the ad
advertisement I mean I do believe that
their ads are quite well I consider
myself a victim of them but leave us a
comment down below how about you and as
always if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's how the world make sure
you follow us on Parker now calm and
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm high memory
that up thanks for watching see you
tomorrow even though we never thought
that Apple would release a 7-inch tablet
the ipad mini is finally among this and
even though it's a good tablet we do
know that it lacks key elements like a
Retina display so is it still worth
you're buying dollar join us on thursday
februari 28 for the ipad mini after the
buzz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
