pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to unbox the acer be touchy 200
this is a windows mobile 6.5
professional device the very interesting
form factor it has a slide down numeric
keypad we really haven't seen this form
factor too much in the windows mobile
world it's also very inexpensive at
three hundred and fifty dollars unlocked
which is very much on the cheaper end of
unlocked smartphones that you can buy
out there so it's really targeted
towards the budget user so let's take a
look at the be touchy 200 okay so
there's a guy in a girl on the front so
you can see how the slider comes down
here to reveal with the numeric keypad
let's take a look around the box and
look at the specifications all right and
the specs are on the back and we'll zoom
in here so it's running windows mobile
6.5 professional it's got the Qualcomm
MSM and UMTS meaning you won't get 3g in
the US only in Europe so it's 920 100
bands and then it's quad-band GSM so
you'll get edge if you're in the u.s. of
course 512 megabytes of RAM for storage
256 megabytes of RAM and then it's got a
3-inch 400 x 240 s so that would be
wqvga touchscreen so not the highest
resolution that you're going to find on
a device but again this is a budget
phone and it's only you know three
hundred and fifty dollars that's what
you can expect so let's see what we got
all right so we'll take a look at the
device in a moment let's see the
accessories that come in the box I think
we have the swivel outward box design
that comes with all of the newer acer
devices so we've got here manual and
some software alright and a nice screen
protector for the touchscreen good to
have see what else we have down here
we have a mini-usb instead of micro USB
the battery is of size 11 hundred and
forty forty million power so a little
bit on the small side and let's see what
we have in the other compartment here
probably some headphones and a charging
and syncing jack and that sort of thing
alright so let's take a look at the be
touch me 200 okay so here it is it will
take off the screen protector here nice
looking device and the really cool thing
about this is that it has the slide down
keyboard something you really don't see
on a windows mobile device too often so
it's very convenient to be able to use
t9 to text people or to quickly dial the
number without bringing up the on-screen
dialer relatively thin device got a nice
rubbery coating on the back which means
that it won't be a fingerprint magnet
it's got a stylus of course because it
has a resistive touchscreen which is
collapsible so pretty cool we're going
to talk a lot more about hardware and
see how the build quality is on this
device it's nice to see a traditional
d-pad here a lot of newer devices for
windows mobile don't have the d-pad
really cuts down on one-handed usability
very small device let's compare it to
other devices like the google nexus one
which obviously doesn't have any sort of
keypad or keyboard and the nexus one is
going to be thinner we can look at it
next to the HTC touch pro2 or the AT&amp;amp;T
tilt two and again you really see the
the benefit of having the smaller screen
and makes it a much more compact form
factor than one of these larger devices
and next to the iphone screen is about
three inches on the be touchy 200 so a
lot more coming up on the be touch etude
we're going to talk about software now
the hardware holds up and whether this
is a good form factor to have since we
don't see it too often so we'll be back
with a lot more on the beat touch e 200
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
