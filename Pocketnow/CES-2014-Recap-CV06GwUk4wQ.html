Michael and we're a pocket now coming to
you from Vegas with our impressions of
CES 2014 so we're going to start it off
with the impressions of CES 2014
compared to CES 2013 and other shows
what do you think that you've been here
like four times five times now three
times and this year was just as crazy as
ever the show always something always
goes wrong and this year was was top the
charts it was crazy crazy show but it
was fun there wasn't a ton of mobile
specific stuff it's more usually kind of
a broad spectrum of consumer electronics
and this year it was more of the same
but there were some devices announced
and a lot of different products and some
very cool some yeah yeah this was only
my second CES and in addition to getting
here late and a variety of other things
going wrong I lost my voice I'm Taylor's
beginning to lose his voice and so we
had that to contend with me sounding
like an idiot on camera to contentment
but also I despite all of those
complications despite the fact that we
arrived late and are leaving earlier
that I did I was less disappointed in
this year's CES than last year's last
year's i found i didn't find almost
anything to get interested in was this
year i came in a lot of companies were
showcasing some some pretty cool stuff
and I was pleased to get some hands-on
time with it I posed to Michael this was
my first CS and I am disappointed though
I'm not comparing it to 2013's and
comparing it to mwc and Aoife I didn't
like the lack of signage I somehow
cannot understand how different
companies have different events at
different venues I'm more used to a
convention center but yeah an Internet
in the US for a guy like me who has
almost free internet wherever he lives
internet kind of sucks here well we
stayed at a hotel that didn't even have
Wi-Fi so yeah here we'll guinea a new
hotel them to literally has Wi-Fi they
had Wi-Fi but it stopped at the door to
the room yeah yeah Oh am i fi and to
explain to anyone who hasn't ever
experienced a CES or looked at a show
floor map or anything it's based I guess
centered around the Las Vegas Convention
Center but you actually have one point
nine million square feet of
rich and that spread across I think this
year there were three external venues
and then the las vegas convention center
so you have the Venetian the win I mean
if they're everywhere and some companies
who can't get their boots up or space in
these they'll you know they'll they'll
get a suite in the top of mandalay bay
or some other random hotels so you have
to hoof it or get a cab or drive to some
other location and one thing I then
whatever floats on maps in Vegas it's
like an hour away on foot and half an
hour away but I are even going to the
bathroom is always a 25-minute block
here where you are this yeah you look it
up on a map and it's one block and that
could be a 15 to 20 minute walk that's
very good luck yes right one Vegas part
that's a totally different scale I may
be mistaken boys but I think it's time
to talk about devices let us see what I
did there no I didn't get to see the
headlining SmartWatch vendor here at CES
of course pebble because i arrived late
because I was busy driving from
California Taylor and Anton though
visited pebble as the first vendor of
the show and since me talking sounds
horrendous I'm gonna let them tell you
the story listening to you makes me
clear my throat thank you yeah and I
have to clear my throat anyway bevel
yeah your tailor your awesome pebble fan
you talk about it yeah I got to
interview Eric migicovsky which is the
CEO of pebble and we get a little
hands-on with the new pebble steel the
different options and the different
features so it was a really interesting
thing I mean I knew about it coming into
it but I didn't expect it to be so nice
I didn't expect it to be such a big
upgrade from the current pebble which I
where he wears they're all plastic they
come with a silicon band and it just
never felt like it was quite worth the
product felt worth it but the materials
never felt like it was worth 150 bucks
this one's 250 bucks or 249 and it is
solid steel or machine steel I'm you can
even either get in a PVD coating or in
brushed steel and it comes with a little
leather watchband no matter which one
you get you also get a leather watch
band to go with it and
I thought that was a pretty cool it's
great it looks a million times better
the display is covered in gorilla glass
so it doesn't scratch mine I got it
scratched on day one so it's a yeah it's
not it's not all positive though I mean
Tony you had some disinvite not being a
SmartWatch fan I can I'd need to give it
the pebble they manage to up the ante as
in transform the current the last
generation pebble into a new generation
more elegant babble and that was the
idea businessmen did not want to wear a
plastic watch and I can tell you that it
looks good with the steel band it's
almost like a luxury item yeah if you
use a certain watch face on it like one
of the the old analog watch faces it
actually looks like a luxury watch not a
smart watch and that's really the other
smartwatches oh here we made our way to
the what was it at my wrist revolution
we when we made our way to the wrist
revolution which was called the risk
zone at one point is basically a
confined space on the show floor where
they were putting all the SmartWatch
companies and I was very excited this is
what I was jazzed to see at the show we
can't talk about it because we don't
have a lot of coverage video coverage of
that zone do you know why because we
decided not to cover it it was bad there
were probably nine vendors in this one
square block of the show floor and they
most of them didn't even have working
models it was yeah mock's they were they
were mock models and yeah kind of a week
showing there was a couple compelling
things in there but not enough to film
so unfortunate i was a bit of a
disappointment we gonna talk a bit more
like more about that at than the weekly
let's go back to phones and tablets
before we have to head our idea CES was
the guava event and we only had one you
phone which is the SMA to which is I
believe a great improvement over the
last year's model I like it it's I think
could be my job phone for CES aside from
the fact that it's got that slimy
samsung G hyper crazy coating on the
back way really yep
yeah it's it looks and feels exactly the
same what's up what's the battery size
on that assignment that is 4050 milliamp
hours and you can also use it as a
portable power back and then co the
company was cool enough to charge
someone's phone from the mates you so
it's it's a funny thing you'll never use
it but yeah just as a geeky stuff we all
whored our battery power so we're not
sharing it that it's a cool idea but
we're never going to use it I on the
other hand didn't like the Ascend mate
to mainly because of the build it looks
pretty good on paper but once you get it
in the hand and I actually picked it up
twice and when I picked it up I like
yanked it up because it just it weighs
nothing I don't know the weight on it
but it couldn't be more than maybe 140
grams 150 I mean it's you're saying it
feels cheap it feels very cheap it feels
incredibly cheap normally I would agree
with you and when I have to it the fact
that it has a four thousand million
power battery and it just blows me away
and the fact that it can be that light
while maintaining that kind of power
density impresses me enough to where I
can overlook that I didn't spend as much
time with it is these guys though so I
just wanted to give them props for that
engineering yeah I put that into better
perspective I think the best way to put
it is that it's like picking up you're
expecting you to pick up a galaxy note 2
or galaxy note 3 or even like Z ultra
but when you pick it up it's more like
the galaxy s4 I mean it's just it's it's
too light yeah it's it's feather-light
this brings me since we're talking
phones to my biggest disappointment of
the show
complete soni soni soni really I was
expecting a flagship last year's CES
2013 brought the Xperia Z this year we
got the z1 compact and the z1 s so no
real new phone no flagship Sony's
presentation was much more broad than
than even I think it has been in the
past you normally CES presentations by
Sony are all focusing on their entire
product on TVs and everything but this
year they spend so much more time in
that than mobile that it was I agree i
was a little bit not let down because i
honestly I wasn't surprised but I was
happy to see the compact somebody seems
to have answered the call for a lot of
people for a smartphone with flagship
specs in a very small footprint yeah I'm
he's a little thicker than I would like
it there's things that I don't
necessarily like about it but it it
looks very compelling and they finally
finally finally fixed that screen side
visibility problem by using a different
panel an IPS panel which still has a
screen protector on it permanently but
it looks pretty dang good in person yeah
surprisingly I think my favorite phone
of the show is from the most unexpected
manufacturer yet ZTE I never would have
said that before I never expected to say
that but the Nubia 5s is uh it's
actually pretty sweet it's slimy and
everything but the phone itself the the
stuff they put into the camera the
software the hardware it seems pretty
compelling to me and it's it's something
I would carry the artificial horizon in
the viewfinder yeah independently
targetable stuff for me it's the 5s
compactor no no I was funny it's not a
75 s mini yeah which which is just
glorious to hold in the hand and it has
that chalky kind of feel to it and the
middle ground they need middle ground
they lead 80 milligram the matte finish
on the back of the new bo 5s would have
just put it over the charge for me so
you know the other disappointment of
mine
lack of seeing nokia and microsoft i was
expecting to see them here though mwc is
their turf and i'm sure it will see you
next month but there was no nokia and
microsoft significant presence and yeah
i was smart phones and tablets I wasn't
expecting that much though it wasn't it
wasn't let down like you say mwc is this
yeah you know I mean I always we love to
see you live was expecting them at least
to have a show floor summer showing of
the current phones or I don't know
something the present a significant adds
at least if nothing else ads because
Samsung always dominates these with ads
their buses wrapped in galaxy notepro
before I even finest general or I saw a
bus wrapped and for was official bro ya
think the report was official they had
note pro branding everywhere and you
want to can we close it out on ya look
I'm talking about that I was about to
say lack of tablets but then Samsung
came in through Torres so uh yeah which
one's your favorite um you know they all
have the same specs by the way so they
all have the same spec to which made
filming them such a challenge because it
trying to make him sound new and every
time they all the same perspective the
same UI but that is that said I'll
answer your questions on you my favorite
one was the 12 dot too I didn't expect
to like a giganto tablet you know I've
used my Envy x2 which is 11.6 I think as
a tablet and I'm like this isn't your
big whatever 12 dot 2 is substantially
larger its way larger than that 10 doubt
one but it's still light enough you
can't hold a one-handed landscape now I
mean you can but it sucks but two-handed
you're you're involved in your work and
that new UI makes it really really
really more appealing than any other
Samsung and before anyone says a 12
point 2 inch tablet is too big in an
indoor sport ability which defeats the
purpose of a tablet to begin with you
don't carry most people don't carry a
10-inch tablet by itself and you're
gonna do the same with the 12 inch
tablet it's still gonna fit in the book
bag so it's going to be exactly the same
it's just bigger differences one-handed
use versus to introduce same but
different yep shake it for me oh can you
guys guess my favorite supper yeah
acer lincoln know is that a template no
it's the Samsung Note pro the egg-cam
pro ain't that I'm regular we got a big
ol your piece on top exactly I don't
care about that but it's a great tablet
that the display on it is phenomenal go
ahead do you know my favorite thing was
Tony we were paying a little bit of
tribute to Taylor and I were
photographing some of those thanks to
samsung's we gave us an access to the
devices in death I put out to my head
I'm like here take the shot tell you
like it there one of the Samsung PR reps
was was like oh he's don't but then
again the other guy specifically asked
me to hold it to my ear to take a couple
of shots oh really yeah so anyway though
it was the other thing um yeah again the
only thing is the middle ground on the
tab 8.4 or tab pro 8.4 there's no s Finn
why couldn't have that in a note pro
bike and I think we'll see that at mwc
home decided to unveil the node a so
they'll probably do that but I really
wanted I really hope so like that that
would just I would own that tablet I
would enjoy the no date it with the note
8 pro with the new UI with the new
multi-pane stuff you it's good stuff but
I that's a lad yo we gotta run up yeah
yeah alright yeah we have a flight to
catch rights overall you know I despite
everything having gone wrong I think we
saw a lot of interesting stuff we spent
a fair amount of time in a really
wonderful city never sleeps it's right
Oliva never sleeps and everything is way
too big and we got to spend some quality
time together as a team in exaggeration
never before seen yeah finally met Tony
after almost a year yeah only made him
want to punch me a couple times and we
will be back next year I'm not sure
whether in this configuration or not
because it takes me 28 hours to get here
but will bug and I will definitely eat
you messed up my head and you know where
else we're gonna be next month Barcelona
that is correct AC 2014 we will have
coverage as usual from the show floor
it's gonna be hi Mary Vera
me and hopefully somebody else will see
until then thank you for watching
everyone will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
