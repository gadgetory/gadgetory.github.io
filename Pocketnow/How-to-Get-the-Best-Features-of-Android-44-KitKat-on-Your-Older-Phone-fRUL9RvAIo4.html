comes out it's only natural that people
will want to run it onto their Android
powered device even if it's not a Nexus
Nexus devices usually get the latest
version of Android faster than their OAM
counterparts but there are still some
things you can do I'm Joe Levi for
PocketNow here are some ways that you
can get a KitKat experience on your non
KitKat device today this is our HTC One
Maxx the Sprint variety if you were
curious to know and as you can tell we
are running Android version 4.3 this is
essentially stock out of the box with
just our apps installed for benchmarking
and being able to show you what's here
and what's cool so nothing new or fancy
applied I do have a wallpaper just to
show off
KitKat even though we're not running
KitKat head on over to the Play Store
and download the latest version of
Google Hangouts which replaces Talk if
you've got Android version 4.0 which
this device does you're going to be able
to get SMS and MMS integration built
into the hangouts client so this then
becomes your pretty much all-in-one
communication tool and hub to talk to
all of your friends the next step we
need to install is Google search not to
be confused with voice search by Google
though both are kind of nice to have so
go ahead and download and install this
this lets us do a lot of the cool things
that KitKat enables with one more piece
of cool software next we're going to
want to replace our launcher the stock
launcher on our One Maxx with the Google
Experience launcher or some other
launcher that looks like the the new
launcher that comes with KitKat in this
case there's a forum over on
xda-developers that gives two links to
download it I've already turned on the
ability to install apks from untrusted
or unknown sources so I'm going to go
ahead and install this it's relatively
quick and easy not a lot of permissions
that you have to deal with or worry
about once that's done we just open it
and immediately we're welcomed into the
launcher there's one more thing
that we need to do if we want to make
this to stick press home it asks us what
we want to complete this action with we
are going to choose launcher and say
always now this is our launcher and
we're going to look almost exactly like
KitKat with most of the same features in
the launcher let's take a look so the
first thing you're gonna notice is up at
the top we've got our Google search part
with a little hint phrase to say we'll
try that in just a minute it's got a
nice welcome message and then basically
a tutorial that shows us how to set this
thing up we kind of already know that so
we're going to just hit OK a little bit
more tutorials and there we go at this
point let's say okay Google is it going
to snow today
and just like that just like that you
can see we have the Google experience at
least with being able to get that
information right there from our home
screen let's see what else we have
unfortunately we don't have blinkfeed
over on the side of course we switch to
a different launcher we don't have
Google now over on the side either next
up we're going to want to get Google now
the way I did that was let's come back
here to the home screen I long pressed
on my home button and it brought up my
surgeon you can see I've got an option
to get Google now so let's go ahead and
do that it takes just a moment you'll
want to be connected to Wi-Fi or
wireless to do this read and then yes
I'm in and right there now we have
Google now it's setting up for the first
time and it's automatically got all of
my information in here by the way shout
out to Marcus Brownlee Marcus happy
birthday man and of course my weather my
team's all that fun stuff so now let's
take a look we can pull in from the side
and get right to our Google now or we
can long press and get Google now by
pressing on that home button as well so
no it's not exactly KitKat but you're
gonna have a hard time telling it apart
from everything else if you found this
video helpful why not throw us a thumbs
up and if you haven't yet
describe to our channel you'll want to
make sure you do so we're constantly
adding new videos about new products
reviews news everything you can imagine
and if you're not subscribed you're not
gonna get them in a timely fashion
also while you're at it why not share
PocketNow with your friends we're on all
of your favorite social media networks
my favorite is Twitter where we're at
pocket now and I'm at Joe Levi thanks
very much for watching we'll catch you
