fameless' here to actually sell out
before launch date so if you're asking
yourself if it's worth it to ignore the
iPhone 6s plus you've come to the right
place I'm high net available pocket NAT
1 this is iPhone 7 plus vs. iPhone 6s
plus
brought to you by Dee brand pocket now's
iPhone 7 coverage is brought to you by
Dee brand to buy the best fitting skin
for your phone or tablet visit deep
brand comm the usual trend is that
pretty much every iPhone user wants to
get the latest and greatest and the
lines at every Apple Store on launch
date are proof of that now if you're
currently using an iPhone 6s plus or if
you're planning on not waiting for the 7
and buying last year's model bear in
mind that these phones are just the
similar as they are different
for starters both devices are the same
height width and depth and about the
only difference in dimensions is that
the 6s plus is a hair heavier both are
built on the same strong aluminium and
glass and even if the 7 has less antenna
lines they are both horrible you think
that Apple would even move away from the
blown-up iPhone design that doesn't
really allow large hands to touch the
power button but nope ergonomics went
out the window on both units the main
differences here are the new colors like
matte black and jet black on the 7 plus
and while cool have been met with
polarizing impressions due to smudges or
scratches and with the 6s plus you can
still steer away from that with the
Space Gray color option this play
resolution may still be 1080p but the 7
plus sports a wider color gamut that
results in more accurate colors this
improvement match with the new stereo
speakers on the 7 plus leads to a more
immersive experience while consuming
content where even muffling speakers as
a challenge while in the 6s Plus none of
that is available
laughter feature sibling yes of a
headphone jack is important to you the
success plus has your back and you'd
even wonder why Apple would not add this
as a plus feature with the thickness of
the seven plus about the only non
brainer selling point left for the
hardware department of the seven plus is
the ip67 water in this resistance where
the iPhone 6s plus has none of that
as for internals the seven plus sports
Apple's new or 810 chip with now
quad-core performance with two cores
doing the heavy lifting and 2 cores
doing average tasks where the success
plus is a dual-core processor we've got
three gigs of RAM on the seven plus vs.
two last year and a slightly larger
battery at 2900 milliamp hours versus
2750 and hey if you ask me I can't
really tell the difference between one
or the other on daily tasks graphics
intensive games and even endurance
storage options were matched at 32 and
128 gigs and starting at mid points but
if you're holding last year's models
you're probably stuck at 16 gigabytes or
you probably we're lucky and went with
64 I can't really survive without our 16
or 32 but that's just me about the only
feature left that's only visually
similar is the new home button going
from mechanical to force touch the
tactic engine on the 7 plus does a
decent job at making it feel like if
you're pressing a button but it's not
the same and we're the only similarity
lies in the insane speed of the
fingerprint scanner even the software
experience is pretty much the same this
is one of those times where iOS 10 can
do the exact same things on one phone
and on the other you'll find 3d touch on
both devices for quick shortcuts and the
speed and fluidity of iOS is clearly
evident on either device regardless of
which one you pick in porn features like
reach ability are here for one-handed
operation you can call Siri on both
devices while unattended just fine about
the only difference in software
experiences is really the taptic engine
for the 7 Plus which provides a
vibrating feedback when switching
buttons or pulling navigation menus but
that's not really what I'd call a
feature
actually now if you want a solid
difference let's talk about these
cameras where the iPhone 6s plus felt
dated compared to 2016 flagships the
iPhone 7 plus doesn't because it now
matches at 12 megapixels at F 1.8
aperture compared to last year's 12 and
F 2.2 and to make matters even cooler
you've got a separate 12 megapixel
telephoto lens at up 2.8 aperture to
provide 2 X optical zoom
now the optical zoom is not the only
benefit as this means add a digital zoom
that's now boosted to 10x compared to 5x
and photos and 6x compare to 3x on video
all those numbers and improvements are
really noticeable in broad daylight
where both devices provide comparable
results and great color reproduction
saturation and contrast will you'll
truly notice the differences are at
night where the seven plus just a mile
eights the success plus in performance
and yes in the selfie Department you do
get 7 megapixels on the 7 plus compared
to 5 but both devices share the same
atrocious field of view making the
experience just terrible video
stabilization is what I'd call
comparable on both which smooth results
whether you're walking or static but
expect more usable video at night from
the 7 plus and keep in mind the 7 plus
now does 1080p selfie video if there's a
720p on the success plus at the end of
the day even if both devices are
visually very similar
it seems that Apple finally gave the
name plus a meaning with the newer
iPhone 7 plus taking great quality
photos in addition to water resistance
and stereo speakers are actually very
important features targeted at every
consumer and sure while many may argue
that the inclusion of the headphone jack
is a strong selling point for last
year's model that doesn't change the
fact that it is last year's model and
you're getting a better phone and the
things that matter with the 7 plus from
where I stand I call the 7 plus a worthy
upgrade but the most important question
is really if you need all
those added features before you buy
