panels as they used to be called goes
way back to my Pocket PC days with
Android today you can swap out your
keyboard for any number of new panels
that do all kinds of cool things from
letting you drag your finger across to
connect the dots and spell out words or
handwriting recognition or weird things
that look like the figure-eight well
today it's a traditional keyboard but
it's got a lot of intelligence behind it
what happened my talking about
it's called SwiftKey and it's amazing so
SwiftKey specifically SwiftKey version 3
is available in two different flavors
one for smart phones one for tablets
they both cost 399 to get the full
versions but you can get the free
version for well free and again one for
smart phones one for tablets I went
ahead and purchased this here's all the
deets about it you can check that out in
the Play Store let's go ahead and open
it so one of the things about SwiftKey
that's different from other soft
keyboards it walks you through setting
it up and when Android setting up a new
keyboard isn't that difficult though
there are a lot of steps involved so
immediately after running the app we can
choose our language we're going to
choose English us because that's what I
can talk good and yes that's supposed to
be humor folks it goes ahead and
download the the language pack now the
nice thing about that is this keyboard
is not specific to any one language you
can download other language packs if you
don't speak US English or if you don't
type US English I guess would be the
better way to put it if you were doing
UK English or Spanish or Latvian or
anything else that you want to speak or
type you can do that now it does take
just a little bit of time to download
here because these language packs are
somewhat big the reason for that there's
a lot of intelligence built into them
the next thing we need to do is enable
the keyboard so we'll go ahead and do
that and it gives us a nice prompt that
says hey hit the back key after you've
selected this to come back to this
screen so we'll remember to do
that here the keyboards that I have set
up I've got the AOSP Android keyboard
since this is a CyanogenMod 10 nightly
that I'm running on my Nexus 7 here I've
got Google Voice typing which I have set
and then I've got my swift key tablet
let's turn that on and it says hey look
this is an input method so whatever you
type in here there's a potential that
that information is going to be shared
with well the keyboard I would hope so
but a malicious app could do malicious
things with it this one obviously isn't
going to do that so we'll go ahead and
say ok I'm going to turn off Google
Voice typing just for the time being and
then remember it said to hit the back
button so we're going to hit back just
like that and just like that we're back
here at this nice little wizard to walk
us through it we're going to now select
a default input language or input method
rather we've got our us keyboard and
swift key so we'll default over the
Swift key and then we're going to change
our typing style do we want to be
precise or do we want to be rapid well
since everyone likes to type quickly
let's choose rapid and then we can
personalize if we want we can have it
learn our typing style our writing style
from Facebook from Gmail from Twitter we
can even follow Swift key on Twitter if
we want to if you've got a blog that you
write you can even learn from your
blogging style by setting up your RSS
feed we won't do that right here in this
demo but know that the more information
that you supply the better it's going to
know how you type and the better it's
going to be able to predict what you're
trying to say let's go ahead and say
done and now we get this next step in
our wizard we can watch some how-to
videos we can go to some settings and
make changes if we want to and then of
course we can finish and exit the
Installer and just like that we're done
so let's go ahead and open up an app
that we can use to type stuff into so
I've fired up Gmail and over here it's
just a new email I'm composing a new one
and you notice I've got a keyboard that
looks pretty much like you'd expect any
keyboard to look like that is until you
rotate it check this out so this is
portrait we're going to rotate this into
landscape and now notice what it did
with the keyboard I now have a nice
split the reason for that
it's kind of hard to hit the keys in the
middle with your thumbs especially if
you're on a large tablet now the Nexus 7
isn't that hard I could still reach in
here because I've got big hands but
other people I'm not going to mention
any names here but they don't
necessarily have big hands so having the
keyboard split on either side makes it a
lot easier to reach the keys so you
ready for the fun stuff hi Brandon this
is Joe I'm trying out the keyboard and I
can do this faster on I'm not on camera
by the way so far it's ah some okay now
that last bit I did deliberately you saw
that sometimes I was hitting the
spacebar sometimes I wasn't and the
first part everything got really well
the next part I was a little bit more
sloppy and it just didn't get it so
let's say so far it's awesome and that
time it got it I was a little bit more
precise I didn't use the spacebar I just
kept drilling through going very very
quickly very fast you can type away in
this thing really quick and it's
wonderful again tablet version lets you
have the split smartphone version
doesn't have that you really don't need
it so there you go and know you can't
install the tablet version on your
smartphone it won't let yeah trust me
I've tried I can install any one of
these languages that I want or a couple
of them and some of them I can't even
read how about that look at all of
leaving out Romanian for Tony over there
but what I've done is I've downloaded
deutsch and I've downloaded espanol and
I've got both of those loaded up now so
theoretically I could come back here and
let's pull up our keyboard again put in
a enter or two now I've got those others
I can say
Joe ghetto is I can't even spell Spanish
I'm sir rusty and right now Hymie is
laughing at me
you'll get away in a lot oh great
I'd like the ice cream it kind of got
what I was saying in Spanish and figured
it out or how about
that one it got way off so I'm going to
try it again I can get out of here and I
don't know how to spell this right guy
so I'm trusting on spelling correction
here and I know all of my German friends
are laughing at me
so if we I almost said I know cylinder
that would have been embarrassing if
been else Landa and it got it pretty
right it doesn't know that I'm trying to
type in German emphasis on trying hey it
doesn't know that it doesn't know that
I'm trying to speak in Spanish here it
just knows that oh look I have
information about those languages I bet
that's what it is and it takes care of
it on the fly super fast with prediction
it's amazing and it's awesome
so as a keyboard just completely amazing
blows me away I love this and I'm
probably going to use this as my stock
keyboard for the next quite a long time
but there's even more that make SwiftKey
even cooler I've gotten back into the
settings and now you can see I have
themes to choose from the default is
cobalt but I can choose sky fuchsia holo
which is kind of like a an Ice Cream
Sandwich jelly bean look dark light neon
pumpkin I love pumpkin so I'm going to
go ahead and choose that and let's drill
right back into our keyboard and take a
look and now you can see I've got kind
of a an orange e theme to it there's
lots of other stuff that you can do with
it but that's all the time that I have
for in this video I want to hear from
you so head over to pocketnow.com tell
me what you like about this keyboard and
why again the keyboard is SwiftKey 3
right there what do you like about it
and why make sure you tell us in detail
what is it done how much time has it
saved you
are there specific instances where
you've used it and think that it's the
best keyboard out there we want to know
if you liked this video and seeing
alternate input methods make sure you
give the video a big thumbs up for
PocketNow showing off SwiftKey keyboard
I'm Joe Levi
