really needs to learn how to pronounce
his name and this guy really needs to
learn how to speak another language
shameful only an idiot would buy the
Apple watch you just call yourself
something that's right it's that time of
the week I am high Meadow Vanna this is
pocket now and this is the parking out
daily recap for last week so on Monday
asked you if you would pay four hundred
dollars with a two-year contract for the
galaxy note edge because it's currently
retailing for that price on AT&amp;amp;T we have
443 comments out of which is Danny
Medina says just wait two months and
they'll be giving the note edge for free
on a two-year contract you could be
right we have cases like the Amazon fire
phone but then again the Galaxy Note
edge is not really that gimmicky it's
you know a gimmick with the edge display
true but it's still a galaxy note in
essence and it is quite successful in
Oslo Lucas says wait for the Samsung
Note edge drop test especially the side
drop and let me give a call to my buddy
Joshua Vergara that's a great idea and
Michael McAllister said no one in their
right mind would pay four hundred
dollars on contract for any smartphone
up rewind that tape to 2007 for the
original iphone five hundred dollars
after to your contract and it sold like
hotcakes then until they asked you if
the delay of the Apple watch make you
want to switch the rumors are that the
apple watch will not be ready for
februari 14th apparently it'll happen
until March or somewhere around the
spring and that's really bad news we
have 275 comments out of which ali says
i watch i mean apple watch will be a
product for the dumb apple fans that
just want to spend money until the watch
is launch samsung pebble motorola would
have a new SmartWatch on that surpasses
their last product for a cheaper price
tag um I'm kind of confused with your
comment and that's the reason we like to
keep them short but then again I try to
get your point yeah a lot of Apple fans
are going to end up buying the Apple
watch the question is if there are
enough we know that there are millions
of iphone users out there but there are
more android fans out there that are not
buying into Android wear a neo and 12
says Apple still haven't convinced why I
need their SmartWatch and you're right
it hasn't convinced me either if it's
going to be just another iteration of
the existing smart watches that are
already in the market I don't find the
purpose the streetwise says what
smartwatches like the LG G watch are
already out who is really sitting around
and waiting for the Apple watch dude the
problem is the SmartWatch market is
barely selling in the hundred thousands
so yep there are a lot of people that
are probably waiting or not really
caring do you really need a SmartWatch I
have one I have to actually but I don't
really feel that I need them then on
Wednesday ask you if you would be
willing to pay five thousand dollars for
a smart watch as the rumors are that the
apple watch edition will be costing that
and then the stainless steel variant
will cost five hundred dollars and the
aluminum very into three hundred dollars
we have 1078 comments out of which i am
says if someday i became an idiot sure I
would but I kind of agree with you man i
mean i would spend five thousand dollars
for rolex it's a Rolex and Bradley says
I thought apples were fruits but in this
case they're nuts I agree with you dude
that Karthik says the answer is no but
I'm a hundred percent sure that Apple
wouldn't price the apple watch edition
to four to five thousand dollars no one
I mean no one would buy it that's the
point or what's the point and you are
right there are people out there that
are willing to spend 10 20 thousand
dollars on a watch true the problem with
the SmartWatch is that this hardware
will become obsolete a year from now not
the case with a Rolex you can resell a
Rolex 10 years from now I remember my
father sold aerobics and exchanged it
for car 20 years ago a Rolex the problem
with the Apple watches instead of gaming
value it'll lose value within time so it
makes no sense then on Thursday I asked
you how often do you use Microsoft
Office alternatives or microsoft office
on your mobile device as well Microsoft
Office had just gone for free sort of
you don't need to pay office 365 now but
then again you're not getting all the
functionality we have 470 comments out
of which my own Fisher and a
relationship with Michael Fisher by any
chance set office mobile seems useless
now especially for iOS now you can get I
work basically for free yes you can the
promise I work you know sheets doesn't
compare
I'll tell you that much I used to be a
very experienced Excel user pivotcharts
whatever you could think of and you
can't compare one thing with the other
David Hayes says I use office mobile
apps daily in my job I use my mobile
device primarily to view but have used
to edit and create I like that Microsoft
has now made it a lot for free thanks
for the video and yeah it's great to
have the option at least but then again
there are other alternatives that are
much cheaper no subscription required
you can pretty much do more you can
currently do with offers in its limited
edition then another commoner says i
just bought office 365 fum s and yeah
that's the common thing that happens
with Microsoft and finally on friday i
asked you what android smartphone were
you using and if you were expecting
lollipop to happen for you because the
news were that companies like Sony HTC
were already teasing when lollipop would
be launched for their devices we have
seventeen hundred and fifty comments
thanks a lot guys out of which one seed
law says i have a galaxy note 4 I want
lollipop and dude you're gonna have a
long wait sadly Samsung is the slowest
company to do this for reasons that are
completely beyond perlis says HTC when I
made for sure got this brilliant phone
only a month ago and I can't wait or I
can't let it out of my hands send skin +
lollipop beautiful Android experience I
agree with you and everything you say
and it specifically because HTC has been
doing the best job at updating
smartphones to newer versions of Android
then Michael best says while samsung
mobile sony xperia HTC and LG global are
prepping for 2015 release of lollipop
motorola mobility just showed these
snails how it's done well play moto well
played I agree with you Michael great
comment Motorola is the company that is
doing it best right now they are doing
it the smartest as well they're not
trying to sell you any other experiences
you know when it comes to you I the UI
is already cool they're giving you other
features like touchless controls things
that are useful beyond the software and
therefore giving you software updates
that are timely even faster than google
play edition smartphone so yes it is
worth it to buy a moto x lately the
company is doing an amazing job and
hopefully that will be the
that's probably your best buy this
holiday season if you're considering a
smartphone at least for the software not
the camera that's at for parking out
