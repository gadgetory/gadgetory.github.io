FCC for a little teaser of what to
expect the LG g5 case renders show us
what to expect from the back and we
finally get to see a probable HTC One
m10 am I met ivetta recording a couple
of last videos from the studio before we
make another change this is parking out
daily the official news today start with
Apple the company is not falling surely
its results are not at its peak but it
seems that the company felt the need to
talk to its employees Tim Cook was in a
recent town hall meeting with the
company and aside from you know
blabbering over the new spaceship campus
and where the company is headed it seems
that they needed to clarify you know the
reasons why the iPhone is not selling so
well by saying that china is going to be
a broader market they're going to expand
India is going to do the same this is
the new emerging market which just makes
the whole sense with the whole iphone 5s
ski rumors so expect a lot of changes
for this March event this is rather
interesting now let's talk about HTC for
those of you in the market for the HTC
vive there's a late user manual we get
full details of starting with the fact
that you need a 5 x 6.5 room to be able
to play with the vibe if you plan to
stand up you know the way the whole
sensors and the layout works when you
will lead wires when you won't need
wires what benefits should you have
depending on lighting or the lack
thereof there is a lot to learn about
the vibe obviously we want more
information just the manuals starting
with the price point but this is clearly
more than your average typical Google
cardboard like headset and speaking of
HTC a device that we are waiting to see
at mwc in Barcelona is the one m10 we're
expecting to see a revamp we heard
rumors that the design would look a lot
like the one a man which is not
necessarily good because of its lack of
boomsound speakers in addition to the
fact that it looks identical to the
iPhone but it seems that that is the
case famous tipster efflux just revealed
some photos of the phone and yeah it
looks like a beefed-up one a9 which
means it look like the beat the backbone
and we just have to confirm
specifications hopefully they stick to a
moet and another
competitor that we are expecting from WC
is the samsung galaxy s m we have press
invitations and everything and if you
want to know more about specifications
links in the description the device just
stop by the FCC yes the 5.1 inch display
regular galaxy s7 in addition to the 5.5
inch edge variant this is going to be
rather interesting particularly with the
galaxy s6 edge+ already in the market
and barely there for the last couple of
months I wonder exactly what Samsung is
planning here but we will keep you
posted once the event to happens and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with the LG g5 you gotta hand it to
case makers you want to see how a
phone's gonna look like you better wait
for those renters and they just arrived
we were a little skeptical over that the
g5 back mainly because we saw the offset
camera and it turns out that the penalty
we're getting dual cameras on this
design with the flash in the middle
probably the same whole concept that we
saw with the b10 where there's a
different angle lens on each side seams
are probably LG is going to bring that
to the table and that's going to be
rather interesting mainly because the
company did an amazing job with the
camera at the g4 and we can't wait to
see what they're gonna pull off with the
g5 here but anyways it leads me to the
question of the day look at the renders
tell us do you find this design to be
ugly or cool futuristic in my case I'd
rather see the phone in person to be the
judge of that but leave us a comment
down below would love to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the nose
