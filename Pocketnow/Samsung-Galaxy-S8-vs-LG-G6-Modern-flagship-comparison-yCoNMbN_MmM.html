you looking to buy a flagship large
phones are being overshadowed by large
displays on smaller form factors the
only minor detail to consider is that as
of the spring only two companies have
been able to pull it off just right I'm
Jaime to be that I would pocket now and
this is Samsung Galaxy s8 versus LG g6
brought to you by deep brand one thing
that we eeks have learned the hard way
is that specs continue to be less and
less important when choosing a
smartphone products like the iPhone have
proven that even forgettable Hardware
can be popular so long as the software
and the overall package are delightful
Samsung and LG have decided to step up
that mentality a notch because for
starters there's just nothing
forgettable about this hardware we've
got two beautiful slabs of metal and
glass that were designed to look
beautiful from every angle and feel
smaller than they really are
to achieve this Samsung and LG have come
up with the coolest trick of nearly
killing the infamous bezel this required
an aspect ratio of 18 by 9 on the LG g6
reaching a crazy 80% screen to body
ratio versus 18 point 5 by 9 on the
galaxy going to an even crazier 83%
rounded corners were also made standard
in order to assist with added durability
in case of a fall these are both quad HD
plus capable displays that support HDR
playback with LG's full vision IPS
tipping more towards color accuracy
while Samsung's infinity AMOLED panel is
more focused on color saturation calling
out a winner is a matter of taste the
galaxy does a far better job in direct
sunlight thanks to the added brightness
of its display let's keep in mind that
it's set to 1080p by default for power
efficiency with no options available on
the g6 fans of curves and shiny metal
shouldn't climb more to the galaxy while
fans of grippy feel should incline more
to the g6 fans of an ergonomic
fingerprint scan
should also stick to the d6 though the
galaxy kills it by adding some extra
ways to unlock your phone like an iris
scanner in addition to facial
recognition that I still don't recommend
because of its accuracy and ways for you
to spool it both devices have the exact
same height and pretty much the same
thickness though the g6 is a couple of
millimeters wider and eight grams
heavier both are ip68 water and dust
resistance but only the g6 is no speck
810g drop resistant while the galaxy is
already having a bad reputation for
fragile curves the reputation goes away
when you compare internals though the
galaxy sports a newer Snapdragon 835
versus last year's 821 even if Ram is
the same now the g6 compensates by
sporting 10% more battery versus
Samsung's more efficient processor with
wireless charging and fast charging
supported on both and expandable storage
is also available on both even though
the galaxy doubles the base storage at
64 gigs now can you tell that the galaxy
sports a newer processor actually no I'd
even say that the stutters are actually
more common on the galaxy than on the g6
about the only way where you'll notice a
difference is when you launch a specific
graphics intensive game where the galaxy
will launch it probably a half a second
faster than the g6 but then gameplay is
pretty much the same if anything I'd
give Samsung more props for better taste
and aesthetics of its user interface
it's far more heavily skinned than the
LG's launcher but I feel it provides a
better taste in design elements in
addition to iconography the g6 launcher
being far less cohesive and speaking of
less cohesive LG made this big deal
about the g6 serving better for one-hand
use but actually that's not true in any
way I mean if you want to reach anything
at the top of the phone it's pretty much
not going to happen where Samsung
actually then boasts that all about this
and still managed to include a
one-handed feature through the advanced
software section
but the only thing we're all give props
to LG and its software ISM being a
better partner with Google and not
reinventing the wheel while Samsung's
bixby is more bloatware than anything
and we're pressing this button that's
just hit or miss all the time and then
honestly where I won't even congratulate
either company is when it comes to
software updates as both devices are
still running last year's Android 7.0
and true by now we should already be
accustomed by these to OEMs being
terrible at updates but the problem is
that these phones you really need the
battery enhancements of Android 7.1 as
it stands it doesn't really matter if
one phone has a larger battery than the
other both devices scroll to get through
a day of moderate use and that's very
sad and speaking of said make sure you
keep your hands away from the speaker
because even to this day and age there's
still only one bottom firing speaker
across the board now both speakers are
loud I will give you that and sure both
devices did a great job when it came to
headphone audio and ones real audio
review now a very tough thing to compare
here is the camera but oddly not because
one camera is better than the other
on the contrary both of Isis for my
personal pick for the best cameras of
2017 hands-down the problem with the
galaxy is the lack of versatility that
LG offers through its secondary
wide-angle lens
see there are many scenarios where you
will not be able to stand back of a
building and wear the g6 is just the
most convenient phone to carry because
the wide-angle will provide you with
that functionality for these particular
scenarios the g6 just cannot be beat
it's also very helpful for video since
most of us don't really like the fact
that smartphone cameras push an extra
crop when you're filming
what angle shots are also available for
selfie cameras across the board and I
would even consider the galaxy to
provide less washed out results the only
problem is when it comes to selfie video
Samsung for some reason press the
horrible crop that I hate from the
iPhone where the g6 offers a more
versatile option with a wide-angle video
to conclude I think this comparison has
served to prove that newer processors or
larger batteries are not enough points
to declare a winner the spec sheet in
the end is only as good as the
experience each device is able to
provide even price is not relevant as
the hundred dollars that you save with
the g6 are compensated by double the
storage and AKG headphones bundled with
the galaxy and then the rest of
subjective those of you looking for a
more durable phone with a versatile
camera that adapts to your needs then
the LG G 6 might be the better option
for you to pick and those of you looking
for more future-proof internals double
the base storage and hands biometric
security a great camera and a more
cohesive user interface that's actually
easier to use in one hand then your eye
should be set on the galaxy s 8 what's
important is that both devices are great
size and both are smartphones that I
have no problem recommending in 2017 if
you're looking to protect the glass on
your new Galaxy s8
add grip or prevent those ugly
fingerprint smudges head on over to deep

customize the look in the feel of your
