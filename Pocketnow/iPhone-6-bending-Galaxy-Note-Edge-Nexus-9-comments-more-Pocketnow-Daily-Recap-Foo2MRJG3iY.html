pronunciation in front of the mirror
that you actually not train yourself to
learn another language I am actually
surprised by the decision of HTC /
Samson but I'm more surprised of you not
wearing a Tommy Hilfiger yeah I know
George Lopez right that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi melody
there this is pocket now and this is our
parking out daily recap for last week
last one day asked you what do you think
about Google choosing HTC / samsung for
the Nexus 9 as the rumors are that
Google ended up deciding over HTC to
help another OEM because Samsung was
popular enough we have 668 comments out
of which Philip Essex says I think that
HTC nexus 9 will be perfect and if that
k1 rumor is true plus HTC build quality
and boomsound speakers the perfect
tablet and I have to agree with you no
wonder you have so many likes that
really would be the perfect tablet and I
do feel that if Google wants to
differentiate the Android tablet space
they need something like this and John
Couture says Google boosting everybody
first it was samsung then LG then
Motorola now HTC seems legit though I
guess Sony needs more help with that
Nexus would be a good camera for once at
least and that is such a great point yes
HTC is up next actually HTC was the
first OEM to help Google back then with
Android now it should be the other way
around and I do feel that Sony would be
a good OEM for the future then another
commoner says HTC deserves it many
people consider the One m8 google play
edition the ultimate phone I hope HTC
nails it with a nexus tablet 8 inch or
nine inch both I guess and I do agree
with that yes that would be a great
option indeed then I'm Tuesday asked you
what do you think Samsung needed to do
to regain its limelight as the company
shared at drop fifteen percent just
after the launch of the iphone 6 alone
we have 1552 comments thanks a lot guys
out of which hack droid says so Samsung
lost fifteen percent I think it's good
for us consumers that mean Samsung will
now try to get the market back by
bringing new things to the table I
personally don't care who has the market
share as long as it's beneficial for us
and that is probably one of the best
comments of the week indeed that's one
of the good things when things go bad
that companies do shake up and try to do
things differently Samson's design
language has been the same for years
already and it is time for revenge
test samsung really needs to RND with
its TouchWiz else they will be soon
competing with HTC and motorola you have
a good point there Samsung has been
focusing more on Hardware R&amp;amp;D and not
really on software at least it seems
surely we've seen a lot of motion
gestures on galaxy phones fine that they
don't really work well so that's not
really good rd but youtube guys samsung
is losing because people are now
understanding they are a piece of s
copycat company that's probably a little
harsh but in a way I don't think people
notice that but you tell me in the
comments what do you think then on
Wednesday I asked you if you thought
that the Ben gate issues of the iphone 6
plus were real or deliberate as we did
see iphone 6 plus s bending but it's
because people were actually bending the
phones not really because they were
using them in their pockets and getting
bent we have a thousand 168 comments
thanks a lot again guys out of which H
reassessed so it bends will it blend and
you know that is a good question indeed
I'm sure that if you try to blend it it
will anavar says all phones bend or
wharf if you apply enough force the
complaint is that the iphone 6 plus is
bending quite easily in comparison dude
i'm sure that any phone that i would
grab and try to bend i would surely you
see those videos of people trying to
bend other phones because there are
plastic and magnesium it's obviously not
easy but if you apply enough force you
make a good point it'll happen instead
of alaska says hema did you not see Lou
try to bend the note 3 with much force
man I'm sure that I could try to grab
this iPad and apply so much force that
at some point I will end up bending it
it just happens if you deliberately try
to do something it'll just happen and
this is not trying to be fanboy istic
the problem phablets is that there is a
lot of canvas size and it is more
possible to bend that than a smaller
phone the bigger the product the easier
it is it's just basic logic but on
Thursday I asked you if you think that
Apple should replace all the bents
iphone six-plus models because yeah the
company is apparently not replacing
those that were bent deliberately we
have 650 comments out of which Abdullah
says Apple should replace the phones
that has been even on purpose because
how can you spend a thousand dollars on
a phone to be bendable so easily i am
going to partially agree with that yes
it is a very expensive phone indeed yes
we should assume
that these products should not been but
then again it's like you're dropping
your phone and assuming that it's not
going to be dented and Alex s of course
Apple should replace each unit they
should own up to the bag design you
don't see an iphone 6 bending as well as
the iphone 6 plus and we go back to the
previous segment surely the longer the
chassis the longer the canvas the more
probable it is to bend that's just the
way it is and he says they should
replace them all why not only nine
devices that are bent oh wait maybe that
was a lie true it could have been a lie
as well we have no proof to show that
Apple really only replace nine phones
you have a good point there and then
finally on Friday I asked you if you
were planning to get the Galaxy Note
edge as the rumors are that Samsung is
preparing for shortages because this was
just a concept product they weren't
expecting to sell many apparently only a
thousand phones or something like that
we have one an attorney 3 comments out
of which i can haz upgrade says i tend
to not buy something until I know
everything and it works fine the edge is
just the beta of what could come later
from other manufacturers and that's good
behavior early adopter syndrome is bad
we could tell you a lot of stories and
photographic time says I really want
samsung to push new ideas to the
marketplace even knowing the edge
probably won't sell well at all I am
sure it will benefit the industry and I
agree with that as well I love the fact
that Samsung is the company that is
willing to do R&amp;amp;D and actually sell it I
feel that is a good mentality and the
company has so much money out there
willing to do it great not everything is
going to stick as well true but at least
they're trying remember the galaxy don't
line up and another commenter says damn
well I guess I'll just edged my way to
the note for instead a real bummer the
possibilities would have been huge oh
well and I agree with that I would have
loved to try the Galaxy Note edge i mean
i wish that the company would build more
but i guess what we need to do is
support it the bone is on sale and
you're able to buy it buy it and give it
a tribe you don't like it return it i
think that's a great way to deal with it
thats it for our pocket out daily recap
