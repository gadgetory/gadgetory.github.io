streaming service from the company who's
fought streaming for years and now we've
finally got our chance to try it out
I'm hi I'm so Houston talking now and
this is Apple music so here it is this
is Apple music here you can see we've
got a front page here with what's called
new and this is basically just the the
central hub for Apple music it looks a
little bit like the iTunes app and also
sort of it's sort of laid out like the
music app down here with the different
columns and tabs so on the front page
here you can see they've kind of
highlighted you know you get these these
top artists and top albums and things
that are kind of important going on
right now so they kind of made an effort
to highlight Taylor Swift right over
here because they managed to lock her
down for her album 1989 that's kind of
become infamous for eluding just about
every other music streaming service out
there mostly Spotify and going through
here like I said this is just kind of
the main hub goes through top tracks
what's currently you know what's popular
best albums going on right now recent
releases it's this is pretty pretty
typical of a music app so going through
the other tabs we got the four you tab
over here and this is kind of what's
gonna help Apple music personalize your
radio stations and kind of make things
fit you more personally so we're gonna
go ahead and fill this out a little bit
I like rock I'm basically here you're
just touching whatever you'd like you
touch twice for if you really like an
album where Jean were that is and you
can press and hold on and on the genre
to say that you don't like it so I'm
going to go ahead and press and hold on
say Christian and gospel because that's
not really my thing you can see it kind
of does this little little jittery thing
and then it goes away after a couple
seconds and you can just fill this out
with as many of the genres as you want
to once you're done just go ahead and
hit next and that would kind of pull
that all into your little you bubble
right there and then it kind of wants
you to specify more this is actually
going into who are your favorite artists
I'm gonna go ahead and do that later
I'll set that up myself and another time
so going through the rest of these tabs
you've got radio over here and this is
again like pretty much any other music
service you know Spotify has this
are do most different music apps have a
radio streaming service of some kind now
the thing here is there is also this
beats 1 radio and this is sort of apples
approach on giving you the most personal
and live music radio going on so what
they're doing is they've got some
different DJ's curating their own
playlists on here it's always live 24/7
so should be really cool we've got some
music playing already and we're going to
stop that for copyright reasons and it's
got a lot of potential for you know sort
of sort of a actual radio killer of
sorts so we'll go ahead and check that
out in a different video here is the
connect tab and this is sort of bringing
back apples ping service if you remember
that it was sort of they're really not
successful or popular social media
network for music this is a little bit
different this is actually sort of an
amalgamation of things like Instagram
and Twitter and different platforms that
artists already used to connect to their
fans so here you'll be able to you know
follow artists that you like you can
there's a couple of them I'm gonna go
ahead and follow system of a down real
quick and basically once I do that I'll
be able to start seeing different images
from the band that they yeah anything
that they post I can see exclusive songs
or interviews things like that so this
is this is sort of a personal thing with
you and the bands that you like anything
that you find on here you can actually
share to your social media of your
choice so it's a pretty cool little
feature on there I'm not sure if that's
really gonna make or break the platform
as a whole but it's kind of a nice
addition on there it's gonna condense
different services and make it a little
bit easier to just have an all in one
place to see everything with your
favorite artists going on here the rest
of its kind of pretty typical you've got
a playlist section this is just where
you know you create any kind of playlist
with the music you already have and you
can also create playlists by searching
for music on the Apple music library and
finally you've got the my music tab over
here and this is just what you've
already purchased or what you have
installed or stored rather on your iPad
so I've already got some of these albums
and songs
here and that's basically the main gist
of Apple music you know you can go
through here pick anything you want to
actually while we're in that music while
we're in that main playing page you can
see there's a play and skip and forward
buttons on here just like the normal
music app you could start a radio
station or you can share the existing
station that you're already in you got
music controls sharing that song so
there's pretty standard features on
there and then you can also up here open
up your account you can get a username
this is kind of what's going to go with
the connect feature down there at the
bottom now Apple music is a subscription
service as we've talked about before
it's gonna be ten dollars for a single
user or fifteen dollars for up to six
users so you can really save some money
on there if you are doing a family plan
that's kind of where I think they're
gonna be tackling services like Spotify
where it's not all that competitively
priced until you get to the family
platinum this becomes significantly
cheaper so this has been a first look at
Apple music let me know what you guys
think in the comments below let me know
if you guys are thinking about picking
up a three month trial of Apple music or
if you think you're just gonna stick
with Spotify because in my case I'm
still trying to figure that out but I'll
probably stick with Spotify unless Apple
music really blows me away so we're
gonna have some more coverage on this in
neri coming videos and thanks for
watching we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
