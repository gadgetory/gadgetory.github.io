pakka calm and today machine mobile tag
for windows mobile devices and what this
program allows you to do is to scan
barcodes or QR codes and then the
application will take you on the
Internet to show you exactly how much it
costs at other retail locations online
so let's get started
okay so here we are on mobile tag for
windows mobile devices and the first
thing it's going to do is ask you which
device you are using to make sure that
all the drivers are correct for the
camera and it selected the hd2 which is
the device i'm using right here and all
i have to do to start using this program
is click here and i have a video game
that i purchased a while back the camera
will load and take a snapshot of that
barcode and now it will load onto a
website and will give us all of the web
page is relevant to that product so as
you can see click here and go to the web
store you can see that it's fifteen
dollars and ninety-nine cents on amazon
and scroll down it looks as though
that's the lowest price I'll here's one
for possibly ninety-nine cents but it
says $99 I don't see why it would be
that expensive anyways go up to the top
want to purchase this all we have to do
is click here and it will launch our
default internet browser and once the
web page has loaded we can of course go
to Amazon scroll over or whatnot and
purchase this device or purchase this
game if we like on the amazon com
website so we can go back okay so i have
another product that i found around the
house this is just a bottle of Clorox
high-efficiency 82 ounce bleach here so
I'm just going to click on the camera to
activate and hopefully it works even
though it's upside down let's see here
just work there it goes and now we'll
start retrieving the data and it gives
us a price which shows it's 82 ounces of
Clorox high efficiency bleach and we can
either go into Web Store or local store
view comments or whatnot but we're just
going to go to the web store and see
what it has to say it says it's sixteen
dollars and sixty-three cents on Amazon
but of course I don't need to launch
that again because we already saw that
it worked the last time so we can also
go into the menu and select some other
things we can view our history so let's
see we have the clarks bleach and the
roller coaster tycoon 3 we can go back
we can set up my list so if you have a
shopping list that you would like to
create from scanning various barcodes
you can do that and go back set my
alerts so if there's different prices
that change we can set alert so all I
have to do a scan
the device the product and we'll wait
till it retrieves the data and now I can
select go and share or what not end
select and alert so set price alert so
let's say that I want it to be under ten
dollars so all I have to do is click
there and click 10 and then input my
email and it will send me an alert when
that product becomes under ten dollars
or less so we can go back go to menu
again we tell us change the parameters
so we can either have in US currency
euros or the British Pound we can get
GPS localization so that's used for
local searches as a sound on or off and
of course vibrate on and off click back
get help information update information
so this is mole tag and this is free on
the windows mobile marketplace and this
is another marketplace pick and if you
like this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up and also leave a comment down
