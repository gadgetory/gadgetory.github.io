pocketnow.com we are doing a Verizon
network drive test here we've got the
drive test manager Randy here this is
the car that goes around and checks
Verizon's network to see how it how the
signal strength is and all those sorts
of things and we're going to learn a
little bit about how this all works
Randy are you how are you if you want to
tell us a little bit about what we've
got back here in your trunk
well first off is that you fasten a
Tahoe so most of the drivers have an
Tahoe great things that we need for the
run to test is when your air
conditioning in the back gets real hot
back here ok big enough proof it has all
the antennas make sure it was not
separation between the antenna so
there's no interference right
and we need a lot of for me full
realtruck get in the wintertime till we
get out of the snow we have two units
back here to step four is to have
separated between voice and data now we
can apply them into one so one of these
modules works for voice and one for data
well they do both okay right now we have
data cards sitting on the bottom here
and we have the voice bones on top so
there's literally phones up here and
then there is a some sort of data modem
on the bottom correct yeah this is
called a single board computer what they
call center SBC wise to see okay that
controls both got it now this is a
little controlled by a laptop up front
which tells us what to do when to call
routed whole hypothesis so this is
beaming to the computer sort of signal
strength quality of connections right
right and and so why are there four cell
phones connected and four data modules
do all the cards oh so you have a phone
from every different carrier with a to
Verizon thirds warfarin tell me more
about going okay
brand t-mobile real to do MetroPCS
MetroPCS Abul interesting and so we've
got some cooling equipment here
is that what that is great light yeah
it's got the other high built-in fans I
try to regulate the come true so uh-huh
but sometimes it gets hot so we need to
vent the front the gold of Pollard and
its charitable standard vents and what
are these on the windows these are
intense for the data I say so kind of
get a connection there yeah we have
cards that are up two antennas make sure
the antennas get away from the equipment
okay not get interference staying with a
roof through voices Bennett on the roof
police antennas are on the roof wait see
that can't see them yeah cutting they
look like little sort of little round
yes all right
okay let's and we have the GPS antenna
in the middle but we need to report
where we have sure sure and you want to
walk around to the to the cabin here and
tell me what happens up here well
basically this is tarnished equipment on
it okay you've got some switches there
yeah the cars a laptop controls
everything that happens in controls
through the voice bones ball
okay controls what the data model eggs
would do so when you're driving around
is the system constantly making calls
constantly connecting to the data
networks the voice calls will average
about a minute and a half that's with
the figure that was the average voice
ball they just play some sound over the
line it's actually hard word sentences
okay and Harvard sentences or sentences
that include all the sounds of the angle
fine so you're testing for audio quality
too what it does is it'll fall out call
hook back hook for crack just continue
for a minute and we'll set it down for
you okay
gain is it's pretty much the same way
you'll do upload download test check the
whole sequence stop start over upload
download test stop story okay
and so what's that what's the purpose of
this let's say you find that there's an
area on the map where the data speed
isn't satisfactory
so you mark it on a map or something and
then what happens after that it's all
reported on map any kind of if there's a
failure and kind of failure any kind of
little mall scores any kind of load data
data throughput right drop connections
that type of thing don't get mad
what we do is give that information at
the engineer's okay don't take it back
only to actually what with those Pig
back to the office gather that
information give it the engine the
actually will process it first given
things near show them where processes
where we need to have better coverage
coverage throughput might be low like a
drop tanks or whatever they'll figure
out what happened right
they'll figure out whether we need a new
cell tower whether we need a better
capacity in itself power or if it was
just a one day thing worth of despair
for what well if you were to need more
capacity on cell phone tower what
determines its capacity is that it's
connection speed or number of number of
member of a number of people all right
but if I wanted to increase the capacity
of a cell phone tower what what would
you have to do well that's kind of not
something I did I get Bob with but
Sharon Lee they can install more cards
or more equipment in IC more equipment
yeah very good okay so when you're
actually driving you're looking at a map
yeah okay and and if something happens
inaudible alarm will come on and say you
know signal dropped your site thing call
dropped now if the call dropped you know
keep private now what happens sometimes
is the equipment doesn't work right okay
yeah computers fail if that happens and
it doesn't correct itself we have to
stop find out if it will correct
yourself or doesn't stop shutting down
go back to where we started
something happened we don't want to make
sure have that influence the results of
it all okay so do you do you literally
drive up and down every street of a
given neighborhood or do you have a
rehab
I Drive about 2,500 miles a quarter
which is kind of an average for the
drivers revival
we drive all the main highways main
routes and we try to cover most of the
populated areas now new census comes out
when the new one comes out that's us
okay
yeah the census last year I'm sure we'll
have to add some route to change
major major roots in the major
population sure now let's say you cover
a certain town you've driven through it
you've determined that the signal is
good and everything does that mean it's
crossed off the map you never go back
there or will you go back there a year
later or something like that no
basically what we do is is benchmarking
which means we have to every quarter we
try the same thing Oh every quarter you
get the same thing shift results decline
results decline we know that you know
because it's the same way and the same
route something else going off what
would cause the results of decline well
capacitive oh capacity anyways you've
grown we're building new buildings right
I see very interesting very good so are
we gonna drive yeah we go for test drive
great so we're back from the drive it
was very interesting what happens is the
the laptop will give off a audio alarm
when something happens and there was one
alarm in particular and I looked down at
my t-mobile phone and my t-mobile phone
at boss service so obviously that
implied the laptop was implying that
it's t-mobile phone and loss service so
we're back here and we're parked and
tell us Randy a little bit about why you
like driving around because it seems
kind of interesting that you know you
drive around you look for dead spots
what do you like about about what you do
well one thing I'm not much of a talker
okay so when you do this job you kind of
buy yourself a lot you don't need to do
a whole lot of car Hey and I've always
wanted to be I've worked for the public
a lot I just decided no I'd rather be
some kind of a tester working at
background do my thing and let somebody
else actually worry about working with
the public so it's kind of a background
thing that I liked it I'm testing the
network I'm in my vehicle sometimes
eight nine ten hours a day
completely drive several hundred miles
I'll Drive I Drive about 30,000 miles a
year 30,000 you're not all testing but
you know get into the test coming back
from the test so a lot drives you must
be a very skilled driver careful driver
careful careful
and that's one thing about the testing
process we're not allowed to have the
equipment showing anything on the laptop
while we're driving
chair focus on the road focused on
somebody in front of me and because we
drive the same route all the time I have
to make sure that I make the right turns
I just can't drive anywhere will do so
but to me you know testing is fit for
fun I mean that's kind of what you do
for a living yeah you testing it's fun
to test on yeah I test Network I don't
testify site testing Network been doing
it for about five years used to work in
sales for wireless before this and give
me an idea of sort of the the radius
that you will cover in in the course of
a of a drive I mean we go from
Philadelphia to New Jersey or you go up
to New York sometimes or is that not
year my my specific area involves
Philadelphia County all the surrounding
counties Mercer County which is Trenton
New Jersey Wilmington Delaware Cecil
County Maryland and and well western
counties in southern New Jersey is there
any overlap between drivers yep no we
basically do by county so we meet at
cams and the other regions meet at where
we stop so we all have over we don't
necessarily but we overlap a little bit
just to make sure we have we handoff in
to the different regions but we make
sure that all the roads are driven
end-to-end
across the country to make sure all the
roads were covered sure so if somebody
works is kind of a little different up
if somebody works in a skyscraper and no
one in the in the building gets Verizon
service and they call Verizon do they
send you out in your car or do they send
someone out an engineer on the ground of
the laptop to test the conditions okay
well there's in building engineers that
will handle that okay don't come out
with their equipment figure out what
needs to be done to get that office
building covered with rider on sir
that's not something I can do now we
will have portable devices again what I
do is basically all carriers we all we
did there is a portable place that
covers all the carriers that we're
thinking about getting into that can be
in building but right now that's not
part of what I do okay
as something you mentioned on the drive
that we didn't cover previously is that
you're also testing the LTE data on
Verizon yeah does that mean you're also
testing the WiMAX on Sprint yeah I see
so you've got pretty much everything
covered we try to cover everything
question yeah there's a lot of antennas
connected to this vehicle so sure it
stands out a little bit yeah primary
thing about all the drivers and about
this whole program is safety they want
us to drive safe no matter what Sheriff
that makes sense right very good well
thank you very much Randy okay
appreciate it yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
