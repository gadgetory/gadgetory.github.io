on the motorola droid today we're going
to take a look at the software tour of
the motorola droid we're going to go
through google navigator we're going to
take a look at some of the features and
programs that come on the droid and
android 20 and then we're going to take
a look at verizon wireless's visual
voicemail application so let's go ahead
and unlock the device by swiping it over
and take a look at the software so now
that we have the home screen unlock
let's go ahead and take a software tour
of the Droid and android 20 at the top
you have the notifications bar which is
carried over from the original android
10 and if you swipe downwards you get to
see in detail what notifications you
have waiting for you on the system so
we're not going to actually take a look
at those notifications right now so
let's go ahead and swipe up the feature
we're going to take a look at right now
is the maps application google maps now
comes with a navigation feature which
gives you turn-by-turn driving spoken
directions so let's go ahead and take a
look at that by launching maps when you
launch maps it will give you your
starting point right here and if you
want to navigate just hit on the menu
button and it pulls up your your other
option so you can get directions by
hitting the directions however you do
have google voice search on this device
so we're going to go ahead and take a
look at that and search for where we
want to go and navigate to using google
voice search when we go to the home
screen you have the google search option
here which you can type in the location
or the type of business that you want to
go to or you can hit the microphone
button on the screen and speak into the
device and tell it what you want
look for so let's go ahead and look for
starbucks by using the voice search
feature Starbucks they will show results
in a web-like interface here and you can
scroll through and find the most
relevant location and navigate to it
from there the starting point or the
point of origin is actually set as your
GPS direct or your GPS position right
now so let's go ahead and go there
you do have to drive for a distance
before it will give you your next turn
directions but in our experience with
using google maps for nap with
navigation the program works quite well
it was accurate and gave loud spoken
directions speaking of navigation when
you're in your car when you dock this
phone it will actually go into a car
mode however if you want to force it
into car mode there is an application
called car home which will bring the
device into a car navigation kind of you
I so that you have quick access to the
important applications when you're
driving so that you're not fumbling
around on your phone the UI works both
in portrait and landscape let's go back
home and let's take a look at some of
the other applications that come bundled
with Android 20 the first one we're
going to take a look at is calendar
there are two calendar options the main
calendar and the second one is a
corporate calendar the corporate
calendar syncs with your exchange
activesync email account so you have
access to your exchange calendar but in
calendar it doesn't look like a lot has
changed you do have a little bit of a
nicer you I here and everything is zippy
on the fast processor let's go back home
swipe up for all of our applications you
do have access to setting up your email
and your corporate exchange email as
well we're going to go into phone next
with phone and the Contacts tab you can
actually save your contacts with several
cloud-based servers including Exchange
ActiveSync your Google Gmail or Google
contacts application and Facebook so
when you're tapping on a contact icon or
a picture caller ID there you can see
the number of different ways you can
communicate with that person you can
call that person you can go to their
contact card you can go and send them a
text message and email or navigate to
them via Google Maps or you can go to
their Facebook page
let's go back home by tapping on the
home button at the bottom Verizon didn't
bundle a lot of their applications with
this device you can purchase music
through the amazon mp3 store which
allows you to purchase tracks over the
air you can download applications
through google marketplace which has
undergone a bit of a change since we saw
it on 10 you don't have the carousel
that you do on the sprint hero so let's
go ahead and take a look at marketplace
on the hero
so on the hero you have the carousel at
the top here you don't what Verizon did
include is their visual voicemail
program so that you can actually listen
to voicemails voicemails are downloaded
using verizon wireless's evdo connection
or over Wi-Fi you can play the voicemail
by tapping the play button and you can
Tago if you want the voicemail played
via the speaker on the phone so it's
unload or if you just want to hear it
through the earpiece you can go ahead
and do so as well so let's go ahead and
play this voicemail and once you're done
if you don't want to save it you can go
ahead and delete the voicemail which
brings up a confirmation and we're going
to go back home the browser actually is
a little bit faster now we're going to
go ahead and go to the pocket now page
which you will see as being faster than
it is on the HTC hero so we're going to
open it from our bookmarks
there is still no multi-touch in the
browser you do have to use the Google's
zoom in and zoom out icon on the bottom
once the page is loaded you'll see the
zoom options right here but pages do
load a lot quicker than they do on 1.5
on the HTC hero or even on these sprint
samsung moments so this has been a quick
tour of some of the new software and
some of the new updates that come along
with the motorola droid and Google
Android 20 thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
