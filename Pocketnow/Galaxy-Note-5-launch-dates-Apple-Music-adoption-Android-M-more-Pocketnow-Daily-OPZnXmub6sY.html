will get an early launch the contrast
the next iPhone the Apple watch I only
gets the more secure than its
competitors and Facebook is getting much
smarter about its newsfeed I'm high in
metairie meta and since we already know
what date it is how about have you share
in the comments what you'll do tonight
this is parking out daily let's begin
today with the official news as Google
has just pushed its first update to the
Android and developer preview we know
that Google is working hard on giving us
this next version of android and now
they're pushing out the teeth necessary
for developers to start building
applications that are compatible with
Android M now we still don't have a
specific date as to when this will reach
the public but it doesn't need to reach
the public free to give it a try you
know how makes the description on how to
do that and the many of you are joining
me in Haiti those candy crush invites in
addition to the crazy viral links of the
top 10 something on Facebook seems your
the company has just picked up the memo
and there is this new update for the iOS
application that will allow you to
define which people you don't want to
follow which people you do want to
follow again and particularly what
people you want on your feet at the top
and which you want at the bottom
discover new pages etc something very
necessary for facebook let's just hope
that the ad base content also moves to
the side there are some interesting
analysis that's kind of confusing
regarding iOS 84 and Apple music
according to some analysts iOS 84 has a
40-percent adoption rate something weird
they're calling it a high number but the
problem is that's not really common for
Apple usually it gets a lot higher
seventy percent stuff like that so we
really confused that they just didn't
know how to put the words together and
say that Apple musics adoption rate
would be forty percent which makes a lot
of sense since right now it's currently
free or at least for the next three
months we will look for more official
numbers later on and speaking of Apple
one of the things that the company did
not mention on its keynote has just got
launched with watch OS to beta 3 now
you're able to apply activation lock to
your Apple watch meaning if you lose
your watch if somebody steals your watch
all you have to do is activate it on
your Apple ID and
it becomes pretty much useless something
really cool and you'll be wondering yeah
well I'm not going to be able to claim
my watch back true but it also drops the
desire for anybody to strut try to steal
your watch if they're not going to be
able to use it afterwards which is a the
whole reason for the kill switch this is
pretty much the same thing only for
watches and finally for the very
interesting rumors up the day some
trusted sources close to Samson claimed
that yes those other rumors saying that
Samsung is going to launch the galaxy
note5 before Aoife apparently will
happen it seems that it will happen in
mid-august and the biggest reason why is
because Samsung is interested in
overshadowing the iphone 6s plus with
its new phablet and obviously project
zero or project 02 or whatever they're
going to call is going to be very
important for this as the galaxy note 5
is apparently getting a major revamp but
it does lead me to the question of the
day so if Samsung would launch that
galaxy note 5 in mid-august then we
would have to wait for the iphone 6s
plus until September would this make you
want to buy the note lineup in my case
it would particularly in the United
States because I'll just be able to
return it if I don't like it but leaves
