to find out how you can get in on the
simple way of going Wireless
the Google's new Nexus 6 smartphone is
many things but despite appearances one
thing it's not is an oversized Moto X
what does that mean to you let's find
out I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
and this is Nexus 6 versus 2nd
generation Moto X it's understandable
why some might think these are more
similar than they actually are size
difference aside many of the cosmetic
cues are identical from the aluminum mid
plate to the curved chassis from the
camera's ring flash to the front facing
speakers right down to the signature
motorola finger dimple around back and
yes in the hand these do feel similar
again with the exception of the Nexus
massive footprint but those similarities
are only skin deep that skin is the
first major difference here using
Motorola's Moto maker suite the Moto X
is available in 520 different color
combinations in everything from plastic
to wood to 2 types of leather the
customization extends to personalized
branding on the back and special
greetings up front if you want them and
it all comes together to make the Moto X
feel well personal
by contrast the Nexus 6 is available in
just two shades of somewhat slippery
matte plastic even some parts of the
hardware that seem identical aren't and
here's where the Nexus 6 makes up some
ground
the Nexus enjoys dual front firing
speakers instead of just a single one
and it's camera bares optical image
stabilization where the x's does not the
Nexus 6 includes a bundled turbocharger
in the box and Qi wireless charging
support while the X always requires
wires and if you want a turbo charge it
you need to shell out 35 extra clams and
aside from the obvious differences in
display size and density the Nexus 6
also brings a nice touch with its panel
the ability to go super dim for
nighttime readers movie theater textures
or the super energy frugal it carries
the penalty of a pink tint at that
setting at least on some units and you
can accomplish a similar result with an
app like screen dimmer on the Moto X but
it's nice to have this out of the box
on the Nexus 5 of course part of the
Nexus promise is faster Android updates
than any other smartphone so you can
count that as a point for the larger
phone to Motorola is pretty quick to
push updates to its X line but as you
can see here we're still waiting for the
official upgrade to the latest version
on two separate Moto X units so the
Nexus continues to win here which is as
it should be still even without Android
lollipop the Moto X user experience just
feels more complete and at the risk of
repeating ourselves more personal - you
don't realize how often you use the Moto
X's wave function to wake up the display
until you don't have it anymore on the
Nexus 6 you don't realize how handy it
is to launch the camera with a flick of
the wrist until you can't and you have
to rely on a finicky touch target
instead and you don't fully appreciate
the little things like asking your phone
what's up with a custom program to
trigger phrase or getting your texts
read aloud to you while you're driving
until you can't anymore while owning a
Nexus device still feels like being part
of a somewhat exclusive club owning a
moto X feels like being a member of a
more fun Club and that's a feeling
Motorola bolsters with seasonally
appropriate boot animations and
spotlight stories that land like little
surprise gifts on the Moto X every few
months
let's talk optics though they offer
identical resolution the Sony camera
sensors in use here are not the same the
Nexus 6 packs the newer sensor with a
wider aperture and OIS and it's powered
by the Google camera viewfinder instead
of the Motorola written version on the
Moto X neither is our favorite software
for shooting but the Nexus is probably
the easier one to adapt to and the Nexus
camera is also the one we prefer overall
even in the balanced lighting of the
great outdoors the difference here is
obvious the Nexus 6 color reproduction
is consistently good whereas almost all
of the Moto X results feature a greenish
yellow hue that's
not attractive the Moto X is also
quicker to lose focus and more likely to
produce noisy photos especially in
low-light in both standard and HDR
shooting modes the Nexus 6 does much
better when the lights go down and the
phasers come out
strangely things seem to flip around
with the flash enabled the Moto X
reproducing colors accurately while the
Nexus shows a kind of salmon tint but
that's not enough to dam the Nexus given
its excellent performance elsewhere
including on the front-facing camera the
Nexus 6 superiority is further
demonstrated in video mode it's
authentic colors make for a less
exciting video but the amount of yellow
and the Moto X output just makes it
appear almost clownish the Nexus
auto-exposure also adapts more quickly
to changing brightness and the optical
stabilization helps smooth the shot some
as well more Nexus 6 video and photo
samples coming in our full review later
this week the Nexus 6 also brings
practical superiority over the X in a
few ways if first of all two speakers up
front are certainly better than one and
also a bigger newer phone means bigger
storage newer specs and a bigger battery
with neither of these offering microSD
expansion you'll want all the storage
you can get and the Nexus 6 goes up to
64 gigs while the Moto X maxes out at 32
but in specs it's a mixed bag with a
Snapdragon 805 versus an 801 and three
gigs of ram versus the two you might
think the Nexus 6 better at some high
demand games and you might think it's
snappy or on the whole than the Moto X
but by and large you'd be wrong
running Android KitKat the Moto X is
smoother on a day-to-day basis than our
Nexus 6 is on lollipop that said the
Nexus suspects do make it more
future-proof we have yet to experience a
lollipop on the Moto X and we expect
quick updates from Google to fix some of
the performance issues we're seeing in
any case so we should see performance
parity but
these phones very soon what we probably
won't see his endurance parity and this
will be our final point so we'll make it
quick on average we've managed to get
about an hour to an hour and a half more
screen on time from the Nexus 6 than
from the Moto X to be clear we're not
ecstatic about the figures on either
phone each of these should be capable of
much better endurance the Nexus
especially but this is a comparison not
a review and the Nexus 6 does better
than the X in this regard so the Nexus 6
brings on the major points a better
camera better endurance better speakers
and a bigger higher res display and
further it carries the cachet of the
Nexus name with all the quick updates
that name implies for the kind of hard
core Android devote a the Nexus family
has always served it's likely the better
choice and it's unquestionably the more
powerful device overall if that's what
matters most to you get the Nexus 6 but
the Nexus is also a hundred and fifty
dollars more expensive than the Moto X a
phone that brings much more customized
ability in hardware and many more
thoughtful conveniences in software
convenience as you can't find on the
Nexus the Moto X is also more
comfortably sized for one-handed use and
yet it still packs a display that's
plenty large for most folks and of these
two it's the device we'd recommend for
most folks for a well rounded Android
experience one more time everyone our
full review of the Moto X is available
at pocket now in the link in the
description below and our review of the
Nexus 6 will be live at the same place
