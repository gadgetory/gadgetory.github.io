we're gonna do a quick software tour of
the Nokia n8 so let's check it out the
first thing we got this is our home
screen and it's got different panels or
screens that we can scroll through so
similar to Android you see the little
dots down here you can swap through like
that or you can swipe and to edit them
tap and hold then it goes into edit mode
so we can you know add widgets here's
our catalog and we can change the
wallpaper the interesting thing here is
that the wallpaper changes for each
screen independently so I changed it
there but it's still something else over
here so it looks best when they're all
the same but you know if you want you
can put different pictures out each one
so that's the home screen we've got
different widgets you can put them
anywhere really and this button down
here gives us the menu the application
menu so you got some there you can
rearrange them you know drag-and-drop
them and you got applications here it's
the previous one is not scrollable but
this one you can roll through look at
settings real quick
yeah profiles themes blah blah blah
conductivity let's look at themes so you
can change the screensaver a column is
general here we go
so this will change you know the buttons
a little bit you can see the some lime
there now and it's for background
so those are the home screens let's look
at messaging so I want to create a new
message now you're going to see the
keyboard so I'm gonna type something in
there and Ellaria
it's a t9 based keyboard we can turn on
predictive text and it gets a little bit
better but the only way to change the
keyboard and I get it Cordy let's go to
landscape and that's a little bit better
but doesn't really have much prediction
and trying to edit some of these things
this can be difficult you got little
arrows to move your cursor it's the
numbers and symbols view so next you
gotta press the check mark and that goes
back to here which is alright but it's
kind of weird in other areas for example
let's look at the store
let's tape something
and the prediction is not on
so I press check and then I have to
press go now instead of just directly
searching that's a little bit of a pain
let's show you the store for a little
bit so you can get all sorts of apps
here categories it got searched the
usual
all right pictures it's pretty cool
a bit slow rotating
a little bit slow with the multi-touch
and if you can see that that's extremely
detailed really great camera on this
thing and look we got landscape for the
home screen let's show you music
music player is pretty bare-bones
nothing terribly special and what's
annoying is that it also gets it also
picks up any any kind of audio file on
your storage card in your memory
so ringtones and stuff like that are
going to play in here too which is kind
of annoying say we get ringtones there
um we also have some cool little news
apps comes with here's the e online
well that's taken too long to load so
now they're National Geographic
so that's cool app
it's a nice video there
now you want to see the browser I bet
we have some mystery meat buttons over
here
and I'm trying to type a URL but it's a
little difficult
so I had to press the checkmark in the
night at Crisco
let's see type is really really small on
this but it does support flash so here
we have a flash movie
come on rotate there we go sometimes it
plays good okay that's enough that
and here's the Maps application and this
is really good because it's a free
turn-by-turn navigation program but it
looks like we are not responding
so we're stuck on that but it works good
when it does work
well we also get a social app a video
editor photo editor some cool things
there you got YouTube I installed tick
and frame and Foursquare and some of
these games comes with these new little
news programs those are cool the music
app is not for the US and it's just a
webpage
really
so lastly let's just look at the dialer
you have auto correction or autocomplete
rather so that's a good thing come down
please Lee so that's about it for the
Nokia n8 software at tour hope you
enjoyed this video give us a thumbs up
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
