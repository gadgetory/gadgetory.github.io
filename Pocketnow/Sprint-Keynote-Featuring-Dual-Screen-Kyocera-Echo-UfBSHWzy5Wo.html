smartphone it actually change the
orientation to so it's tilted you notice
it works in both both the viewing area
Styles both portrait and landscape one
of the things I'll actually show you is
how an everyday allocation productivity
applications like email actually works
on this device so what I'm going to do
is I'm actually going to go into the
email client simply engine and will
notice it's just like a normal email
client that you'll see on an ant or
Android phone but what's unique about
this fight was to select an email like
this one from Stuart you'll notice that
it has a preview pane that shows up on
the right hand side and it has the inbox
still on the left hand side so I can
actually manipulate things on the left
hand side I can switch between different
emails in the inbox I can actually view
them here look at attachments if I'm the
great thing about this is that this is
very similar to the way we view things
on our desktops with Microsoft Outlook
you get a preview pane and then you get
the inbox the other great thing is if I
change the orientation again I can also
do this in both landscape and portrait
even if you're really stealing from the
pc industry in terms of that look and
feel this bill screen yeah I mean how
many of you or you all work in reporting
industry i'm sure a lot of your editors
a lot of the people in your offices have
two screens to sit side by side and
they're they're doing multiple different
things whether it's somebody's doing
photoshop somebody's surfing the web you
can do those both you side by side the
other thing I'll point out is one thing
you'll notice is that this is a very
thin bezel between the two devices if
you notice that that was one of the
other
Aaron feats we had to really overcome
there's been other types of dual touch
screen technology that develop but the
big problem has been creating a scene
that actually visibly it doesn't take
away from the profile in the product and
what you'll notice here is that this is
a very thin scene that's only able to be
visible when you really look really
close up to it you're I actually gets
very used to this the more did he use it
so one of the next things I'm going to
do is I'm actually going to show you a
couple more demos so that was one mode
we saw tablet mode we saw some
optimization for the application you
just saw let me just go into the picture
gallery and show you how this looks on
the echo videos gotta be fantastic yeah
one of the things david is like you can
actually look at video you can look at
pictures here are some pictures what you
can do is you can actually select them
sort pictures here at the bottom as you
notice it's actually displaying them at
the very top as I change them I can
actually scroll through the top as well
and gets you the same thing that's
really an optimized use of that girl
scream yeah so up here you mentioned
video let me show you a video here's a
actual video that will play a top and as
that video is playing I can do the same
thing again I can actually scroll
through my pictures this early becomes
great and say right the Super Bowl and
you took 80 different pictures and you
want to scroll through them and kind of
manage them this becomes a very
practical application where I want you
and as you notice when how you do that
this video is actually pictured
I've seen scenes reset this pleasure he
says we're turning it around you'll see
it's actually playing simultaneously as
I change pictures he on pull up to it
matt cassel yeah so one of the great
things that a lot of people like to do
is I like to send these pictures off so
what I things I can do there yes we
kinda scroll through your library and
uploaded facebook yeah I want me to show
you that so I'm going to go to share I'm
going to go to Facebook and as you see
it just now uploaded it and one of the
things you'll notice is this huge
keyboard just popped up below this is
one of the largest keyboards that year
we're going to use on a device it's
actually bigger than a physical keyboard
you can see in a slider type product if
you'll notice now I can actually type on
this thing upload the picture there it
goes so yeah that's it so you're really
getting this bold 3.5 inch screen for
that keyboard that's bigger than the
physical screens that using today
because you have a keyboard you see to
that yeah absolutely let's see view cube
to talk a little bit about obviously
this is a great device versus before
YouTube what can you do you need there
yeah so one of the applications that was
developed by kyocera is this YouTube
product Wonderland allows you to do is
you can watch a YouTube video in top
very similar to what we just saw from
the gallery and while you're playing
that video you can actually drag other
videos and have them queue up now below
in this menu system you can see as I'm
dragging these across you'll actually
start the bumper while I'm using this
product while I'm using this application
and so when i'm done with this
application i can automatically move
into the next one and have it start
playing also i can actually
move them as well by just selecting the
app hitting delete I understand you
could I can queue up to 4 and then
delete them if I need to that's right
absolution test it ok you talk a little
sis I'm captain can you explain
simulcasting because would you show so
far seems like you're optimizing in the
tablet mode yeah so let me show you an
example simulcasting tasking we're
probably excitement asking red string
let's see I'm going to go in and I'm
going to actually launch email and one
of the things that you can do is there's
a special gesture that's been created
for this product so what you do is you
put a finger on the top and the bottom
screen and what happens is to get a task
manager that allows you to actually
manipulate what's on the top screen and
ones on the bottom screen so you see her
I have a browser at my address book
email a gallery messaging phone and a
new tube these are actually what ninety
percent of people do with phones is
within these categories of applications
and its really where you get the most
benefit from doing a simulcast in type
out so for example let's say I wanted to
dedicate the bottom to text messaging
and my top I maintain his email so you
notice the screen is actually at the top
it's got my email I can actually go back
to my inbox ton of great things about
text messaging is really kind of
intermittent
communication so what you do is you send
out a text message and then usually wait
for someone to reply so for example
let's say I just sent a text message my
friend here ask me where we whenever we
meet for the game so go in hit son
there it goes and then what i can do is
i can actually go back to my email while
i'm waiting for that response and i can
actually answer an email on doing that
the same thing i can go in hit reply and
you'll notice how responsive this is so
being powered by a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor and see I can
actually move back and forth and you
know one of the other things that you
can do up to is you can actually pinch
if you hit this middle button what it
does it reverses the order the screens
so you can actually put your text
messaging at the top and your email
right at the bottom thank you can rotate
yeah and you can also get you can change
orientation again for both of these and
the same same thing happens now I notice
of you ought to have a project yes old
yeah let me actually show you that
because this is actually one of my
favorite features so a lot of us are
actually probably in the crowd doing
Twitter probably also facebooking at the
same time now typically unless you've
got two phones or you got your laptop in
front of you it's very hard to
accomplish what I'm about to show you so
one of the things you can actually do is
you can actually bring up a web browser
and the web browser that can actually
live in both screens as one large web
browser so i can actually large it so
here's mine here's my facebook ha but
the other thing i can do is i can
actually click on this button in the
very corner what it does is it actually
brings up a second while browsing so i
can actually
pendant lee 12 web browsers of the exact
same time so what are you going to use
that for right well let's say i wanted
to bring up twitter down below and i can
actually tweet what i'm doing down here
and i canna facebook at the top all of
the same exact time I mean this is a
social networking multitaskers dream
come true that's not David Blaine but
that's not back
so you can also swap these you can go to
any other website you'd like you can
actually go up and put in any other URL
while you're doing this there you go
again you'll see the speed at how fast
this thing really moves tell me hmm ok
so we've shown him email we've shown you
multitasking between different types of
communication we've shown you video one
of the things I really want to show you
is is what we do with game yeah so
first so there's a game on here its Sims
but it takes a few minutes to load
because it is a very big game so what
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
start with the game loaded so this this
is sentence it's a game many people know
it's something that actually takes full
advantage of the stool touchscreen so
for example this is where you go into
the game you actually create your
character take a dance and if you notice
i can actually manipulate the screen and
the character from here at the bottom
then i can also touch here at top i can
change orientation you know this is
actually a hairstyle i don't know what
kind of person I'm making their stuff on
yeah if I was going to say you might
want to move off of it yeah so let's
let's go ahead and go back to the game
let me show you actually in game mode
with a slip slide so once you've created
your character it loads and while it's
loading actually want to tell you about
what we're doing we're actually going to
be releasing these api's and a software
development kit to our developers in our
developer program with kyocera so that
we can actually have people actually
create games and take advantage of a
full do a touchscreen environment so you
notice this is a it's night time here at
the same house and I can actually zoom
in zoom out i canna as a new furniture
i'm probably play this for wall so i
actually put on and i'm gonna quit like
i said but i think that you get the
point this is really a power of what you
get with google
so think beyond even games other
applications within their social
networking whether the productivity
tools once you have both screens you
really have a whole new avenue how you
can create products that are very
innovative and so we think the developer
community is going to think of all kinds
of ways to take advantage of this so pre
talk a little bit about better yeah so
one of the things that we noticed is
that there's not a lot of innovation
that's taking place in the last you know
probably 50 60 years in battery life and
so one of the things we really wanted to
make sure that we did on this product is
said you know people are going to use
this and makes different types of forms
whether it's single mode dual touch mode
bolt simultaneous evaluated so what we
decided is that because we didn't want
to hold up innovation and releasing this
product it has a very good battery life
and mixed usage mode meaning whether you
use data and text messaging the phone
but we realize that some people are
going to be heavier of the use on the
usage when they're in castleton moans so
one of the things that we're doing is
we're actually including this charger
with an extra battery with every device
so what this allows you to do is this is
a special charger it actually allows you
to charge the phone battery as well as
the battery in the device simultaneously
pretty much way the same way the device
works also you can leave the battery and
while it's connected to the device you
can actually plug in the other battery
doesn't lose your connectivity and then
third thing is you can actually use this
almost like a power boost its they can
carry this with you and you can charge
the battery and the device on the fly
from the battery discharge in the
product all that you know is included in
the box with the product you don't have
to buy additional accessories to do that
that's fantastic that's probably a
50-dollar value just and so so it's to
screen to screen and true batteries
really two experiences and so at the end
of the day for you whether two or three
things you want people to take away from
because there that goes how it's
different in the marketplace yeah well I
think the most important thing is that
you know this is an innovative product I
think it's something that's in a long
line of history products that Dan and
highlight that sprint has been a leader
in and what we really want to do is we
want to bring something to the market
that was pocketable affordable so that
you could carry it with you but also
gave you the real estate to operate an
adult touch screen mode and very
effectively we want to make sure it was
durable we also want to make sure that
we enhance some of the simulcast a nap
locations so that you could go out and
be productive right away and the way to
utilize these things actually I probably
say most people with SCI will test are
probably a little bit hyper so we
actually also refer this as hyper
tasking penny night so that's really
what we want you to take away from this
today we really want to thank you guys
for coming we're going to show you a
short video yet that's going to give you
silence on the highlights of the product
and then we want you to you know play
with this device for yourself so there
is a vent staff all the way upstairs but
if you go up there you can actually play
with the device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
