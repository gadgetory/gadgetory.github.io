tech geek nation with its first Android
wearable the Moto 360 was a round-faced
anomaly in a sea of squares a
distinctive wristwatch that actually
looked more like a timepiece than a
piece of technology its sequel updates
the originals underpowered processor and
brings additional sizing options but
leaves other controversial aspects
intact at nearly twice the price is the
new moto 360 worth the premium over its
predecessor i'm michael fisher with
pocket now and i've spent about a month
finding out join me for our moto 360
second generation video review the new
moto 360 packs a number of hardware
improvements a few of which are obvious
right out of the gate there's the two
sizing options to start with motorola
finally heeds the call for smaller
watches for smaller wrists with a 42
millimeter addition of its watch which
we took a look at back at Aoife for our
review device we selected the larger
option a 46 millimeter casing with a
commensurately larger battery you're
also permitted to style your watch how
you like during the ordering process
which is handled through moto maker
casing and chamfer color and texture are
all customizable and you're also free to
choose between leather and metal bands
of course the more premium you go the
more you'll pay whichever option you
choose all the hardware is ip67 water
and dust resistant just keep in mind
those leather bands won't hold up to
immersion nearly as well as the metal
ones on the wrist the basic silver and
black leather configuration feels much
larger than last year's 360 thanks in
part to those pronounced lugs at top and
bottom they make the watch less
space-age and more traditional looking
which motorola tells us was exactly the
intent company wants the new 360 to
appeal more to wristwatch people than
SmartWatch people the strategy everyone
seems to be using this year the lugs
carry an added bonus too they allow for
simple catch mechanism so you can swap
in any 22 millimeter band you want this
one is from the pebble time steel the
back panel is a single piece of glass
punctuated by a Center mattered heart
rate sensor and it's mirrored on the
front side by a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3
protecting the one
Finch 233 PPI display that screen is
brighter and offers better color than
the previous generation but it's still
an LCD rather than an OLED and it still
bears the curious hallmark of Motorola
watches the so-called flat tire
the latter doesn't bother us much
because it allows for an ambient light
sensor and slimmer bezels overall but
Motorola's use of LCD is a minor letdown
OLED screens tend to have crisper
contrast and deeper blacks which is
perfect for a SmartWatch finally the
single Hardware button has been enlarged
and moved from the 3 to the 2 o'clock
position and it now offers a much more
satisfying almost chunky click it all
comes together in a package that's very
comfortable well made and quite
attractive in a big bold kind of way the
new moto 360 runs on Android wear 1.3
which is based on Android lollipop and
functions much like prior releases at
press time we are expecting a major
revision to the Android wear platform
basically any day now but for now we're
stuck with wear 1.3 notifications are
stacked in a vertically scrolling list
of cards in theory they pop up when
they're relevant they disappear when
they're not for incoming alerts they
work quite well
texts hop from the phone to the watch
with a short haptic buzz and replying is
a simple matter of choosing a canned
response dictating a message of your own
or drawing an emoticon which is awkward
but kind of fun app support has gotten
much better since Android wear debuted
using Shazam to quickly identify a song
without ever taking your phone from your
pocket is one of the best examples of
how useful a SmartWatch can be and games
like dragon laser show off what's
possible when you don't need to be
useful but also don't want to be bored
these notes are all exclusively based on
using the 360 with an Android phone by
the way while you can use it with an
iPhone as we did for a week
the experience is significantly hobbled
and we don't really recommend it
motorola switched from its ancient TI
silicon to a more standard snapdragon
400 for this watch and it shows in the
software responsiveness it is faster
than its predecessor
maybe more importantly it now allows you
to leave the display on all the time so
you can see the watch face had a glance
and despite the common wisdom about LCDs
being less power efficient than OLED we
left the ambient display on while we
slept for nine hours and it lost only 3%
in battery life sure we weren't wearing
it and it was a dark room but that's
impressive nonetheless
unfortunately the ambient lighting
sensor is much slower than it should be
to adapt in brighter environments
sometimes takes upward of 4 or 5 seconds
for the watch to brighten the display in
direct sunlight for an Android wear
watch battery life on the whole is
acceptable for all but the most
notification heavy users this is a solid
2 day device our days were an average of
15 hours long and we ended most days
with an average of 53 percent battery
remaining keep in mind these figures are
for the larger Moto 360 the more petite
model has a significantly smaller
battery with either size replenishment
is as hassle-free as it was on the first
gen the 360 is still the only Android
wearable to come with a wireless cradle
right in the box and it uses the Qi
standard so you can charge it with any
Qi charging pad you've got lying around
if you need to at a starting price of
$2.99 and 349 for the configuration seen
here the new moto 360 lens smack in the
middle of the pack when it comes to
Android wearables it's not as pretty
from some angles as the pricier Huawei
watch and it also has a somewhat less
impressive display but it does have
better battery life it's much more
expensive than the newest Zeus Zen watch
- and the first moto 360 but it's also
more stylish than the former and its
internals will aged better than the
latter's where the 360 shines is in
customizability few of its competitors
offer so many hardware options at this
price point and the fact that you can
now use your own bands only adds to the
versatility it's not as groundbreaking
as its predecessor and like most Android
wearables it's pretty expensive for what
you get but if you're sold on Android
wear and you're looking for a watch
that'll turn heads the second generation
Moto 360 should make you happy just keep
in mind that the discounts are probably
coming right after
the holidays for more details see our
additional moto 360 coverage at
