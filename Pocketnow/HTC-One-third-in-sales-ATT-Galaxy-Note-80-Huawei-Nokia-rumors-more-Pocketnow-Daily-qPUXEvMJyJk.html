best-selling smartphone in the u.s.
samsung an AT&amp;amp;T to launch a galaxy note
8.0 soon and believe it or not huawei is
seriously considering buying Nokia I'm
hi Marietta and whether we win lose or
draw today drinks on a Tuesday is always
a good idea this is out daily
let's say off with some product releases
those of you curious of the galaxy note
8.0 from Samsung well it wasn't cheap to
buy it necessarily unlocked out there in
just a Wi-Fi model now it's gonna be
available on AT&amp;amp;T for 399 after a
two-year contract which is still not
cheap but you can also inquire it as a
bundle of you buy any galaxy s4 galaxy
note 2 you can also bundle the tablet
for 199 dollars after the typical
two-year contract obviously this is
probably not the best talent in the
world but it is the best form factor for
note input so links down below for a
full review then let's move over to Sony
and t-mobile as the carrier has now
confirmed that they'll be the exclusive
partner to be launching the Sony Xperia
Z and sadly that's it I mean there was
no other news on specific dates pricing
points they just said that they'll be
launching the Xperia Z in the next
couple of weeks and it's just sad to see
that it took so knee six months to land
a carrier and not the biggest carrier in
the US as well but still you know the
Sony Xperia Z is a good product Lynch
down below to the review and we'll keep
you posted as soon as they consider that
the weeks are done which there are 52
weeks in the year now let's move over to
HTC and specifically the HTC One is
we've got some good news analysts at
barons are already claiming that this is
the third vessel smartphone in the
United States apparently the company is
selling as many as 1 to 2 million units
every month and it's really good to see
that HTC is finally getting a break
after so many years of that results
obviously the third place is this the
first place is the iphone 5 in the
galaxy s4 and even though these numbers
you know between these two phones in the
HTC One are dramatically different you
know it's great to see that the HTC One
is getting the glory that many of us
expected after our review so stay tuned
for more now speaking of HTC and some
odd news that make the headlines today
as 2x marketing and deploys that have
left the come
bunny after the full Exodus that's been
happening recently have just started
their own smartphone company and it has
nothing to do with Shaquille O'Neal but
it's called Kazaam yeah I know the image
is not related but still Kazaam what
does this mean they're not specifying if
they're actually building smartphones or
software but apparently their intention
is to offer the vices for the European
market which does mean smartphones
anyways but still it's kind of hard to
see how this could ever succeed if as
marketing employees they could never
make the company you know hcc actually
sell smartphones more than they actually
already did but let's see how that goes
and finally for the interesting news of
the day Huawei yeah that is a smart
phone company that I rarely talk about
but they're making headlines today and
I'm willing to talk about them because
well first of all that we're in London
today announcing their new and
incredibly thin ascend p6 and that's all
I'm gonna say about the phone even more
interesting is the fact that after the
event company executives were claiming
that they've been in serious
conversations with no get to acquire the
company and apparently nokia is
extremely open to being bought by Huawei
and just think about this I mean years
ago this would have been the other way
around nokia was in the power of buying
a lot of Huawei's not just one but
another interesting point is that
apparently and east company executives
have nothing good to talk about Windows
Phone even though they do sell windows
phones apparently if they do make the
acquisition or merger they will also be
ditching Windows Phone for Android but
that leads me to the question of the day
what do you feel about Huawei acquiring
Nokia do you think that that would
actually benefit huawei or benefit Nokia
I think that it would actually benefit
huawei more than it would benefit Nokia
I'm not sure this is actually the way
that Nokia could strive if they would
actually continue to strive after being
acquired but leave us a comment down
below I have my reserve thoughts about
this but anyways of course it's always
for an earlier scoop of everything

tablet roll make sure you follow us on
