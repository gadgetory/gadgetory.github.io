of rooting your Android device are I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and here
are a few reasons you should root your
android device two common terms you hear
used a lot in the Android community are
root and rooting they're used all the
time this app requires root your device
needs to be rooted first does it require
root but what does root mean exactly
think of it as being similar to
administrator privileges
the act of rooting is giving yourself
access to the root directory on the
system partition in other words you gain
total control over your device this
control enables you to allow actions to
take place that otherwise couldn't for
instance back in the day there was a
tethering application that float around
that required access to the root
directory but that feature is now built
directly into the Android system so why
should you root first and foremost if
you have no other reason to root your
Android device you should do it for the
power of backups setting up a new device
is fun for the first time but if
something goes wrong setting it up a
second or third time is painstakingly
boring and repetitive using various
forms of backups you can restore your
device to exactly how it was before one
application by the name of titanium
backup for instance gives you ultimate
control over your applications
application data and much more when you
set up the device again simply restore
your backups and pick up where you left
off even better or nandroid backup s--
which create backup images of your
current system in other words you can
wipe your device restore an android
backup and your exactly where you were
when you started
the major benefit here is when flashing
custom roms or other customizations to
your current ROM make a backup first so
if anything goes haywire all you have to
do is restore and you still have a
working phone exactly as it was before
everything turned South phones these
days come with a ton of bloatware
applications wallpapers services and
other storage hugging content out of the
box what are the greatest aspects of
having access to the root directory is
the ability to remove said blow air and
free up wasted space using titanium
backup you can uninstall any pre
installed applications that you don't
want for example the ROM I'm currently
using came with a help application that
I don't want or need removing it is as
simple as finding it in titanium
selecting it and hitting uninstall
custom roms and recoveries are one of
the most popular reasons for rooting
when you root your device you often
flash a custom recovery in the process
this replaces the stock recovery with a
more robust version that generally has a
lot more features and options these
custom recoveries are how you perform
your nandroid backup s-- and flash
custom roms custom roms are various
builds of Android that offer an endless
list of features such as near stock
Android on the galaxy s3 or since like
and touch was like features on a stock
like build there are popular strains
such as CyanogenMod or me UI which are
rapidly updated me UI offers a robust
steam engine that allows you to
practically make the interface look
however you want and CyanogenMod
implements a host of new useful features
atop jellybean such as a DSP equaliser
these custom roms come in various forms
and sizes all across the internet there
are some devices with hundreds of custom
roms to choose from one of the benefits
of these custom roms however is the rate
at which they are updated the team of
developers behind CyanogenMod have coin
determined Knightley's for the daily
builds of the ROM this means if you
really wanted to you could flash an
update to your phone every single day
other arms may not offer daily updates
but they do provide much more frequent
updates than official versions of
Android such as weekly or monthly
updates the important thing is you can
update whenever you feel like it updates
are there for the taking and if the ROM
you're using isn't updated simply choose
another wrong the best part of custom
ROM
though is what they can do for an aging
device if your phone is beginning to run
a little slow flash a new ROM and
breathe some life into it it will not
only likely provide a performance boost
but it can also make the device feel a
little more new speaking of performance
boosts overclocking the CPU can provide
a nice power boost if you feel your
device is slowing down or doesn't run
fast enough or if you're burning through
your battery too quickly you can
undervolt the kernel and underclock the
processor the device will run slower of
course but the battery will almost
certainly have more stamina toying with
different kernels can result in major
performance changes and it can allow the
user to get exactly what they want and
need out of their phone
lastly there are a ton of applications
out there that require root access to
allow you to do things to your phone
that you couldn't do before such as ad
free Wi-Fi kill network spoofer root
explorer GMD speed time etc some of
these applications come with a lot of
power so be sure to use responsibly so
