should not be compared against the g5 or
B 20 the company wants to rewrite the
rules and that's what we're here to have
a look at at MWC 2017 i'm hi never be
better with pocket now from barcelona
and this is the LG casing the LG g 6 is
a very interesting new approach to
making a phablet the company claims that
users want two things a large display
and also improve one-handed use but we
know those goals are both a
contradiction the result of the g6 that
looks nothing like its predecessors and
even current competitors the polarizing
micronized aluminum is now gone in
favour of a thick aluminum trim and the
glass front and back and those of you
complaining about the trend of thin and
light phones can actually put those to
rest with the g6 as the company has even
made the glass back plus with the dual
camera lenses now most of the story is
on this display years ago we saw LG fit
the same screen of the first Galaxy Note
onto a smaller frame with the g2 and
history repeats itself as we see a large
5.7 inch display fit into a body that's
far smaller than the devices like the
iPhone 7 plus with 5.5 inches on the
display it's the first time that we see
an 18 by 9 aspect ratio on a smartphone
but it allows for the device to become
narrower all with the intent of
improving one-handed use with less
horizontal finger travel the result is
quite striking at first glance
given the whopping 80 percent screen to
body ratio LG is dubbing this it's full
vision display
they call this qhd+ at 28 80 by 1440
resolution and it now supports both HDR
10 and even Dolby vision they can get
ready for HDR content from sources like
Netflix or Amazon video
now the rounded corners on the displays
play a very interesting role not only do
they differentiate the device from
anything else we've ever seen but the
Quail G these also help improve
durability and their testing is proved
that they do a better job at
withstanding 70% more false than
counterparts with regular sharp quarters
the upside is that 18 by 9 is closer to
the common movie aspect ratio for
certain content consumption and it also
fits pretty much two in one territory
meaning you have two perfect squares at
the top and the bottom for multitasking
and LG has even enhanced its user
interface to 50 squares with enhanced
content now the downside is that while
the screen is narrower the menu elements
of the top are now at a taller position
just throwing one-handed usability
enhancements down the window oh and you
better get used to the pillar boxes
watching video for most other sources
that stick to 16 by 9 like YouTube for
example we also reminisce on the g2 in
the death of the removable battery which
became a need to provide ip68 water in
dose resistance though LG compensates
with growing the battery it now 3300
milliamp hours and operating quick
charge 3.0 and even while I was charging
under all existing standards though the
latter is only available in the United
States markets and this is not the only
market restriction as the very much T's
hi-fi audio decks of this phone it's
pretty much only available in certain
other markets like Korea expect wise we
have a snapdragon 801 processor with
workings of RAM and 32 gigs of
expandable storage and yet even the 64
gigabyte option will only be available
in certain markets as well and for those
of you asking why not an 835 on this
processor keep in mind that the phone is
plan to ship far earlier than Qualcomm
will be ready with the 835 according to
LG the dual camera system has found some
major improvement now providing the same
13 megapixel sensor for both cameras
being the standard one at 71 degrees and
also the wide angle in 125 degrees this
pretty much allows for the concept of
true optical zoom to be achieved and LG
claims to
enhanced the software to make this
possible by removing the harsh
transitions even though the software is
not final to prove that in the case of
the selfie shooter we have a 5 megapixel
camera with the wide-angle 100 degree
lens we will have to leave the software
talked for later as this unit is final
hardware but the software is still not
final LG told us that we should expect
the final version of the software as we
get closer to its launch but yes this
phone is running to Google assistance
even though it's still being powered by
Android 7.0 nougats at least on this
pre-production unit so yeah this is the
LG G 6
definitely a very interesting approach
to a phone and my personal first
impression so I will have to say the
phone feels a lot smaller than it looks
