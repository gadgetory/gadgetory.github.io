Galaxy Note 10 is not just something
optional but actually a perk of a
specific variant that X is suing the US
Department of Commerce over some
confusion with Huawei packages and
Samsung wants Apple to pay them as
they've ordered iPhone displays that
aren't really selling enough I'm Jaime
Maradona and clearly in Japan the fact
that you've got alcohol in every single
7-eleven has proven to not be a good
thing
this is Parkin out daily the official
news today begin with deals once again
more Apple deals coming from Amazon if
you're in the market for any iPad the
iPad air is currently up to 40 dollars
off which I feel is a significant drop
considering the fact that this is not
the most expensive iPad and you're still
actually getting a really good product
think about it as if you're in the
United States B&amp;amp;H will actually match
those discounts so you can follow the
link in the description learn more about
them now let's talk about vivo obviously
MWC in Shanghai is currently underway
and we've got a couple of really
interesting announcements of everything
that's happening starting with this
company who well recently teason 120
watt charger that would take your four
thousand milliamp hour battery from zero
to 100% pretty much in 13 minutes we saw
the teaser everything was nice today got
announced with the funny fact is we
don't have a name for the product nor do
we know which phones are going to get
this technology just yet they just
announced the technology so yeah let's
see how soon we get it and how it works
exactly because I want it on every
single one of my products and since
we're talking about product
announcements that happened at them WC
in Shanghai clearly yes I am here for
something that we're doing with Oppo but
there was a separate announcement happy
in Shanghai of it's under screen camera
we're talking about there USC and once
again just like at MWC in Barcelona we
get the technology announcement that
eventually came to the Oppo Reno but we
didn't really get to see a product we
saw the concept and the whole idea is
that you have a full blown camera under
the display it doesn't affect display
quality and even if they're kind of
saying that it does affect the camera
quality apparently it's not gonna be
some
Africans up to the point where they
claim that it's going to be just as good
as every other mainstream smartphone the
question is mainstream obviously so I
can't wait to try out that under screen
camera and tell you more
I wonder exactly where we should expect
this technology to come I mean what
other phone announcement do we have from
Oppo coming up that's gonna be
interesting now let's talk about Samsung
and Apple as we covered recent rumors
over the last couple of days that there
was a possibility of Apple either suing
or going into a little debacle with
Apple over the fact that the company
hasn't really sold as many OLED panels
as the plan was and now we've got a
specific number it turns out that Apple
hasn't sold half of their orders for
OLED displays half when you look at the
amounts of money and trillion wanteds I
believe 5.6 tumors 2.7 toons it's a
number somewhere around there which
means that Apple Samsung 170 million
dollars it has already confirmed now
numbers follow the link in the
description to learn more think about it
is yeah apparently Apple is going to
solve this by ordering more outlets for
other products which is good actually I
mean as consumers if we get more ohlet's
on Apple products that's great but my
god half the amount not sold is a huge
deal that's how bad things are for the
iPhones NS and speaking of bad things
you know that recently there was this
whole debacle between huawei products
FedEx and shipments to the United States
in the US Department of Commerce the
reason why I chose not to cover those
news back in the day even if we've
pretty much been covering everything
that's Huawei related is because it was
a little too political and at the same
time I used to work in UPS so I know the
way packages get routed and I was like
well it's all the time that UPS will
just route a package through Louisville
if there's no direct flight it happens
all the time think about it is now it's
come to the point where now we've got
some serious information apparently
FedEx is suing the US Department of
Commerce because it seems that they were
being required to route these packages
to the United States and inspect them
and apparently according to the lawsuit
the FedEx is claiming I mean come on man
we're not
law enforcement agency we can't be
expecting your packages just because you
want us to check what they are obviously
this is just developing I'm surprised
that a private company would want to
participate in something like this why I
understand why they're suing the US
government this is getting weird and
obviously we'll be covering more
information as it evolves and finally
the hottest nish today I have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy
Note 10 Pro aka DaVinci 1 and DaVinci -
we've known these code names for a bit
but the most interesting part is what to
expect for the 5g variants or variant
and how this is going to work as in the
past we cover that there were up to four
different galaxy notes at - with 5g in -
without 5g but as it turns out if you
look at the list of accessories that are
being listed they have some LED covers
leather covers clear view covers and
more on the DaVinci one of them in g2
but the interesting part is that only
the Vinci one which is the Galaxy Note
10 to be a regular phone and the other
da vinci 2 is the Galaxy Note 10.1 with
the pro variant or that this is going to
be the 5g variant obviously things
evolve over time it could just be that
because they might share the same size
we're actually getting to Galaxy Note M
probes and both of these one is going to
be normal and the other 5g there's no in
the comments down below
if you were to buy any of these galaxy
notes which one would you pick first and
who would you actually want there to be
a distinction between the note 10 Pro
and a toe 10 profile G in order for one
of these to be listed less expensive
than the other because in my case I
think that that would be the smarter
approach to Galaxy Note empro is one
with and without as I know a lot of
people don't really care about this yet
but if it were up to me I'm really
looking forward to the small variants
having all the experience of the Galaxy
Note in a smaller footprint for me would
be awesome but that's just me leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us I'm talking
about comment subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
