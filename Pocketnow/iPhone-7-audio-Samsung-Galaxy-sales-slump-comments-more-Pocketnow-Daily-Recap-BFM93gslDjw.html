when hi my love's mondays what for I
mean if i were to win powerball jackpot
i would give you a million dollars and
please go buy that ticket like now i
want to rub peanut butter on your
nipples and that takes the cake for the
weirdest comment i've ever gotten mad
that's right it's that time of the week
i am home it'll be better this is pocket
now and this is the parking out daily
recap for last week on Monday the topic
was Villar we heard HTC CEO chair Wang
claim that the ABR is more important
than mobile right now and I asked you if
you feel that VR is truly the future
because it's still a work in progress we
had 552 comments me on is the feature it
just needs to get cheap and VR can
actually be cheap you do have google
cardboard and the you know that whole
gear VR option problem is it's obviously
not as good you get what you pay for the
r is for the very rich 599 is crazy
expensive price them like a gaming
console and i'm in and i agree with you
i feel that that would be the sweet spot
the price tag of a gaming console or
just provide this as an accessory of the
gaming console which is what playstation
is doing some time vr means virgin
reality in 2016 every first stage
innovation or product is never a great
Buy and you do have a point but the
thing is if there aren't any early
adopters then how will this ever take
off kind of need them then on tuesday
the topic where smartphone speakers we
heard that apple is working on a patent
to improve the quality of iphone
speakers and I ask you exactly how
important is that to you we had 981
comments I don't care as long as it
sounds okay simple and you gotta need
quality for that anyways Apple can
always improve the sound of their
iPhones but while watching youtube or
movies our hands will always cover the
speaker on the phone making it sound
muffled and not as clear just move your
hand man but I do get your point I value
phone speaker quality because I need to
be able to hear what hi ms says and his
videos while I'm taking a boom sound for
the win yeah true i agree i do
stereo speakers because of that on once
they we started hearing rumors of the
Apple watch to making its way to a
possible announcement in March or
somewhere around there and I asked you
what would you change from the current
Apple watch that you'd like to see on
this new variant we had 774 comments
round classic look thinner design with
great battery life and you know what I
would keep the current thickness if they
gave me better battery life and yes of
course around design will be awesome
make it more affordable round and less
phone dependent and you know the Apple
watch is probably one of the few watches
out there that can be less phone
dependent if you wanted to particularly
for fitness so I kind of do agree with
you but again the a crown design is
definitely on my book number one price
number to make it round number three
make the software less confusing number
for everything else too and yes the
software watch OS is of K but it is
extremely confusing I would get rid of
the whole purpose of that button and use
the digital crown to select things like
scroll wheels have always been able to
just avoid the confusion that we
currently have with the Apple watch just
get it Apple will never use that thing
for making a phone call in its current
state Thursday was rather interesting
for the first time in the history I
phone sales have surpassed pc sales in
the world and i ask you exactly why do
you think it is that people are buying
phones more than they are pcs and
particularly iphones would chart at all
cheap we had 950 comments i have eight
year old computer is still able to run
Windows 10 without any problems and you
know that is a very important point the
fact that you don't really need to
change your computer every year I mean
my Retina Display MacBook Pro is about
to turn four I think and it is still
like new China Chinese are now buying
iphones and record numbers and weren't
exactly buying windows licenses in the
first place we were actually talking
about computers not just licenses i do
get your point yes people in China are
buying their iPhones like crazy not
necessarily computers but it turns out
that has a lot to do with the fact that
your phone is most like your primary
computer in most cases and I just find
it funny i do get that in emerging
countries where yeah you can't afford
two things but then again Wi-Fi iphones
which are the most expensive nowadays
you can do everything on your phones and
the email is calling what browsing and
gaming can all
be done on an iphone with much more
portability true whatever they figure
out a way to fix that battery life it
will be even better but in that case as
well even computers have terrible
battery life either and then finally
Friday the topic was Samsung we heard
that the company's profitability and
also market share in the galaxy line of
had the client again and I asked you
what do you think happened what happened
that went wrong with the galaxy lineup
from 2015 as we're talking about the
whole year by the way we had 1487
comments thanks a lot guys we start with
simple Samsung has lost its way yes the
company has lost its way the things that
we cared about which were expandability
but then again they've done so improving
the user experience when it comes to use
abilities so I don't necessarily agree
with that but I think it's just the work
in progress I think that they need more
than one year for this to take off so
glad i'm watching on my white galaxy
note 428 gigabyte card and i'm happy for
you man i just i never liked how funky
that thing was Samson did wrong nothing
people aren't paying over six hundred
dollars on a phone with minor upgrades
anymore upgrading every year that is
debt and you have a tremendous point
here particularly because analysts are
already predicting that iphones will
begin to decline next year and they're
also predicting the same for every other
smartphone they predict that we're gonna
be in a case in 2016 where people will
be buying more phones but these phones
will be less expensive so i think that
the next thing that samson needs to do
with the galaxy s7 is work on the price
tag price it a little lower and they'll
be more competitive now that people are
looking into the premium mid-range
instead of building this galaxy alpha
line if it just confuse this thing in my
opinion that's it for the parking out
