pocketnow.com one of the cool new
features in Android jellybean 4.2 is
quick toggles you know where you pull
down your notification shade and toggle
over to where you can turn your Wi-Fi on
or off or bluetooth on or off really
quickly its built-in now but you can't
customize it well unless you can let's
go take a look see how you can do that
this is my nexus 4 it is running a
cyanogenmod nightly and what we're
talking about is right over here these
are your quick toggles now you'll notice
right off the bat I've got a lot more
quick toggles then you probably do on
your stock jelly bean wrong why well
that's because you can go in and make
changes to these what do I mean by you
right now as far as I could tell there
are no ways that you at the end user and
come in and make a change to any of that
now of course I think that's going to
happen in the hopefully not too distant
future where we'll be able to get in and
and you know make changes here maybe
move stuff around or at very least have
some kind of a control panel like we do
with the power widget up here where we
can make changes to the order and to
which ones up here that's not there yet
I predict it's coming in a future
nightly so if you want to actually make
changes to what these are right now and
you don't know much about cooking your
own custom rom you may want to hold off
for a little bit if you do know about
cooking custom roms head over to our
article at pocketnow.com we've got a
link that will show you how to do this
it requires modifying your system UI
which you'll need to compile and flash
over and yada yada yada it's a
complicated process but will take care
of getting that information to you at
the article of pocketnow.com so you can
make your own or at the very least if
you're running another custom rom and
your room doesn't have this you can talk
to the
developer and say hey what do you think
about adding custom quick toggles here's
a link over at pocket now it shows you
how to do it pretty cool huh I think so
and there's only more stuff more goodies
coming in the future regarding quick
toggles mark my words to make sure you
don't miss out on what that is when it
happens make sure you follow us on
Twitter we're at pocket now tweets if
you want to follow me i'm at Joe Levi if
you liked the video give it a big thumbs
up if you want to see more videos like
this make sure you subscribe to our
YouTube channel we got videos coming out
there all the time and of course please
leave your comments your questions your
feature requests over at the article at
pocketnow.com so we can keep all of the
discussion all together there at the
site rather than splitting it between
the site and YouTube because that just
doesn't work for anybody 4-pocket now
showing off custom quick toggles I'm Joe
