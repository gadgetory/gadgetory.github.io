know it seems like we never have enough
battery capacity in our current tablets
and smartphones that didn't used to be a
problem because almost every smartphone
had a user replaceable battery we could
either pack around a second battery or
even get an extended battery if we
needed just a little bit more juice to
get us through the day well now a lot of
devices come with non-removable
batteries so what can we do to help
extend our battery life that was what
one app developer thought he came up
with an app called deep sleep battery
saver I tried it out yesterday does it
work let's go find out this is my nexus
4 and as you can tell it has a non
removable back plate and a non removable
battery so when I'm out of juice I'm out
of juice I've gotten around that by
staying pretty close to a charger I
charge up on in the car on my way to
work and when I'm at work I charge up at
my desk and I always keep my battery
somewhere around 70 80 percent and that
works pretty well for me but we got a
tip about this app it is called deep
sleep battery saver and it's really
quite an amazing utility when it works
right so it's this app it's very simple
you can turn it on you can turn it off
just as easy as that and you can set
whatever profile you want gentle being
the least amount of battery saving and
slumber err being the most amount of
battery saving yesterday I ran the whole
thing in balanced mode now balance mode
means that it's controlling your Wi-Fi
and your data and it's deep sleeping
rather than just regular sleeping
whenever your screen is off then it
wakes up every one hour for one minute
to go ahead and check check what well
when you are in deep sleep and you have
those connections off not only is it
suspending your background apps so
they're not chewing up space but it's
also turning off your wireless radios
your Wi-Fi and your 3G and even your 2g
so you're pretty much disconnected for
anything but phone calls
while your deep sleep and of course as
you get deeper and deeper your battery
savings goes up because it's not turning
those back on as frequently to get
status updates that may or may not be
okay with your you cycles if it is okay
it's great how did it work well I went
my whole day you can see I've got my
little status bar icon up there I went
my whole day running this and didn't
plug in at all went to work in the car
without plugging it in once I was at
work I just kept it sitting on my desk
not plugging in at all I made it through
an entire very long day about 11 hours
at the office and worked just fine came
home and then plugged in and yes I was
on low battery and work I had about 14%
left at home when I put it down on the
charger I had about 2% left but it
worked great lots of things that you can
do in here in settings but most of them
are only available if you have the pro
version which I did not I just ran with
the standard free version so you could
see what you could get you can do a
whole bunch of other things including
hiding your notification icon up there
so some downsides what I ended up with
is on the way to work I didn't have any
wireless settings at all I had no
wireless connection and that I couldn't
figure out why once I got to work in
troubleshot it I was able to find out
that my mobile networks were not enabled
while the screen was on this was turned
off it took me about five maybe 10
minutes - it's a troubleshoot to this
point find out oh well that's why and
check that checkbox and turn it on since
then I've found that off a couple other
times and it's just kind of one of the
side effects of the app it may not
toggle that back on in a timely fashion
for you but you have something to keep
in mind other than that other than
getting notifications every hour instead
of as they arrived I didn't have any
problem and it might definitely be worth
the extended battery life as well but
this isn't about me this is about you
what do you think have you tried an app
like this have you tried deep sleep if
you
have we want to know about it over in
