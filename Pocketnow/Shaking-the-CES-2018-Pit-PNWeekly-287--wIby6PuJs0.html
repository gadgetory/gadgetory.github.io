is kaput besides a little rain a little
flooding and a little power outage
appears that most of us in the tech
media have gotten out with little to no
scarring so to congratulate ourselves we
took to a room high up in the Mirage on
the Las Vegas Strip and talked for about
an hour on the biggest advancements that
were brought out at the show from an
experimental laptop named Linda two
fingerprints going where they have never
gone before
it's episode 287 of the PocketNow weekly
recorded Wednesday January 10th at 6:30
p.m. Eastern this is the podcast that
talks about the technology that makes us
move from smartphones to tablets to the
latest attempt at wearables it's the
show that's trying to get into 2018 as
if we were all kids in the candy shop
and we could pay for our sweets with a
tap of Google pay
I'm Jules Wong news editor and producer
of the weekly hello we actually shared
space and audio this week with Miriam
drawer and the mobile tech podcast so
the next hour of conversation you'll be
hearing comes from that session and it's
our thanks to her and her team for
letting us share the fun with our
listeners that out of the way he is
Miriam to start us off hi and welcome to
the mall tech podcast I'm your host
Amira and today is Wednesday January
10th 2018 and wefts yes and I'm
surrounded by the most amazing bunch of
folks I'm gonna let everybody introduce
themselves this is gonna be a raucous
crazy podcast probably about an hour
long and we're gonna talk about
everything we liked and didn't like at
CES we've got some topics there's more
going on still but I think we can say
that the CS is pretty much in the can
for most of us all right so who wants to
start nicole yes' nicole scott
you can go back to whatever you're doing
I never had a pocket Mouse so good to be
here thanks for being on Nick Nick gray
high-tech traveler hey Nick can make all
of you guys have me on my podcast except
for Jules
well yeah Jules long pocket my hey you
haven't been on so she first name hello
to the person that is listening to this
may sound horrible but
Michael you want quickly yeah it's just
Michael Fisher aka mr. mobile and I'm so
happy
yeah I know it's great so um you guys
are the topics I'm gonna go one by one
we're gonna start to talk about it I get
first of all cake let's let's talk about
some ground thing like ground rule type
things what was the thing the theme for
CS in your opinion so far someone asked
me this the other day on the floor and
it was really hard to sum it up cuz
there's there's rehashes there's some
new important stuff there's a lot of
stuff that's never gonna make the market
it's like what's the theme is it it's
just it's CES again yeah I think I think
that the theme was personal assistants
are now in everything have you seen the
monorail that's in our product right now
true I to me the theme was Google
assistant all the things yeah basically
Google assistant and and Alexis gonna
show up the weirder places in cheated
before
yeah well yeah yeah why is it trying to
sell you diapers and a couple of other
things Street subway station like get
you pregnant
[Laughter]
anyway so okay we've got an agreement
that AI and assistance are kind of a big
thing right yeah you say that's pretty
much it
what is the thing that you felt stuck
out and in either good or bad way that
you felt was really like the thing of
the show from perspective well not just
anything
yeah there's any CS I can't just be
mobile tech I have to be pretty broad
but yes forms of course yeah but see I
feel like every time I come away from C
yes it's usually like well it's a
mid-range phone show and then a couple
things well somebody certainly proved
that absolutely but I don't know if you
wanted to jump to this yet but like the
thing that will absolutely touch every
single phone that that launches from
from here on out is that under display
fingerprint sensor that we have gotten a
chance to play with from the synaptics
what are they calling it clear touch
clear out your IDs such a small tiny
little sensor not even like even like a
parts wise like that's great and - but
it's like it's such a tiny conceptual
thing because we've been talking about
this on the iPhone 10 and you know it's
been nearly three years yes and with
this you know this was the big thing
that we missed out our on the 10 and no
one is brought yet why vivo this is the
company that is yeah it's weird because
like Bebo is is what is a top 5
smartphone well I think they can iterate
quickly as far as getting products out
and when we were there I was talking to
the PR lady and she was saying they've
been working with vivo for a while -
like with prototyping for a device so
that's why I think they vive lism but as
you said it's not really a device it's a
component that's gonna be changing all
of the devices in the coming year let's
hope yeah exactly because it actually
works really well we all know the
product demos that are kind of janky and
like down
like this this will be this is
pre-production this will work better
later but this was great you pick up the
phone it projects that little
fingerprint graphic on the display you
drop your thumb on it and it takes what
about half again as long so I still need
to move to it but was it was it a
production phone yes it's a real it
doesn't have a name but it's all action
but it's gonna ship it with a second
quarter
pretty much yeah you too yeah I think
they're going to do the full
announcement of the phone itself at MWC
and if you've seen the 1 + 5 t the
design is a little bit different they'll
like it the back is has a different feel
to it so it's not but like basic specs
are gonna be the same yeah but like vivo
opal and oneplus are all are all from
the same factories they basically have
the same design set across the block at
the sheriff same same Factory but it's
not the phone right that people I mean
the phone is this because it's the first
one we get to play with yeah that's why
it's important at the moment but I I'm
just so looking forward to seeing it -
seeing what phones are possible when a
manufacturer doesn't have to say add in
a bigger bezel on the bottom for a
thumbprint sensor on the front or move
it around back and sacrifice battery
space or do whatever Samsung did this
game just bezel down bezel down bezel
down at this point because yeah dude
look at the iPhone 10 man I mean what
more example do you want that's the way
things are going look at shammies be
mixed phones I know they're even less
than the iPhone right I mean it's cool
thing you know you get it's more
immersive and the user experience is you
know exponentially better but it's just
that's where we're going in terms of
just looks of smartphones I am where
else can you go it's not just the look
so this is with a usability thing has
anyone ever been trying to train maybe a
parent or a grandparent to use an iPhone
or an Android phone and the first thing
they do is win that thumbprint they put
it on look they put their limbs right on
the screen is so true oh my god that's
gonna make it so like just that little
bit easier yeah I'm looking forward to
seeing phones this yeah and I've talked
about this on the podcast last year at
the end
like kind of like reminiscing 2017 is I
really think we're gonna see all the big
players come out with a face ID
competitor because we thought anybody
who's used it for any of your engine of
time agrees at least I think it's it's
it's changes the game
it's like continuous authentication if
you don't look at it it stops with
advocating you can pass the phone to a
friend they're screwed they can't see
anything I think to me that I'm actively
actively authenticating I'm trying to
say that I think that I also want the
fingerprint I'm expecting that I prefer
expecting like the guess nine for
example it'd be amazing if faking your
face ID as good as Apple yeah I was
reliable and it can be useful Google pay
and it's now called Google pay on the
screen they're gonna do retina they're
gonna do face ID no don't pick the iris
scan here's the thing in the case of the
iris scanner I I guess I was okay with
the iris scanner until I started using
face ID now every time I pull out the no
date and I try to use the iris scanner
I'm so used to the concept of not having
to align align my face in a specific way
now and I just don't deal with that I'm
with ya you know and so I guess I'm
spoiled by the iPhone 10 so much so that
I don't know what the feature of the ire
scanner will be Nicole's like stupid no
and I'm reading my notification
something obvious different thing open
[Laughter]
it's so annoying that's unlocking my
phone on the parade of the synaptic
sensor but I actually had a little bit
of time hard time actually using it
because it is so small man you don't
have the physical alignment of a metal
ring where you're putting your finger on
and you have to push a little bit harder
but to get your finger to align with or
so it reads it more if you have
let less because it's optical yeah okay
my point ain't no nearby 520 meters
square and you're there using the OLED
to a light to reflect the image data
from the print down to the sensor so
it's sorted so I asked so I asked the
the rep there and she said they can't
make the sensor larger so that you have
a larger area and you could technically
put in multiples so you put one out of
the bottom you could put one in the
middle it's all up to the OEM how they
want to implement it sure the OEMs what
I was saying I was like yeah you just
have one the whole bottom half of the
phone well division you charge anywhere
there
yeah but then money yeah money exactly
what's crazy is you can actually see it
at high my network talking about a rap
or the podcast like if you angle the
phone just right
yeah the macro is either sitting under
the under the oullette but when you fire
in the display and get a big role in
macro shot right on it you can just in
Cara's like the selfie camera should be
under there or like oh yeah other sensor
that you want under the display and look
if you think about it it's an optical
sensor so what what limits the selfie
camera to fit there in the future
well you just have the just can't be lit
to peak between them it has a ring to
pixels and then you have to pull out
that data between is amazing to be
things difficult like you know you know
so the the touch sensors we use
fingerprint sensors are capacitive high
resolution passive and to me that they
managed to make it work optically
through a screen and you the lens issue
- how do you focus the light properly
like there's no lens at all it's no idea
has always been optical so yeah
touch ID so JP has always been that
everybody else the capacitive the touch
ID al was always a camera well in the
Apennines I saw they was using the
bouncing off method was using the pixels
going back up and then down bouncing it
down to the center again so I mean I
don't know you know I just remember that
I forgot to remove my fingerprint from
the demo yes
I'm fingerprint number five all right so
should we move on to another topic so
the people thing is definitely the thing
that we're most amazing with I haven't
seen it yet but I'm pretty excited go
look
yeah is there anything else that stands
out oh my god that razor project okay
I'm sorry I'm sorry like so I had to
like download old footage from Michael's
previous reviews on the PadFone on yeah
from we've been covering so many you've
been covering this forever the whole
concept of your smartphone being more
powerful and you know I guess my biggest
problem with things like Dex is how much
it costs to get in it's like and then
you need a monitor plus a mouse plus a
keyboard and your mobility just goes
completely down the drain right there I
like the concept of a pad phone because
it was still a mobile product it was
just a different form factor but Android
was just not ready and so I mean when
when I saw a project limit I just walked
in I was like is that a trackpad with
speakers and like you know it's the
razor phone I'm like you're kidding me I
thought it was genius just the placement
of where it is in the whole class I've
always said that somebody needs to put
replace the trackpad
of a laptop with a phone and I guess
that's what they did yeah and I did the
only thing that's missing is for the
phone to vibrate the moment you press
things because it you know myself all
the time just trying to press the damn
screen at least six months before he
hits the market and it's so far off but
the problem is I would buy the product
just as it is without whatever it is
that they want to have so wanted they
wanted to be a touchscreen they want
they want dual screen functionality I
don't care about those things right I
want that thing to be a laptop whenever
I want it to be and for the photo system
that said that would be me for the
listeners who haven't seen it and they
might have seen it on various covers
that you guys did but I'd be like what
does it look like this is basically the
trackpad is replaced by a razor still
has is a radio still has the keyboard in
the display it doesn't have hardware
acceleration for graphics then No
Karin has is well and they gave you the
information I saw your video they give
you information on storage yeah and give
me anything yes like 56 whatever battery
and then I than 200 gigs of additional
store I understand why the haptics
because the phone itself would be bright
vibrant because if you take the phone
away it's just a pit and you know
otherwise would be shaking at the pit
but that USB C port you know you press
the button and you know insert it in to
the bone and it's like really rolling
noise like yeah yeah I think that's so
smart because I don't think I
necessarily would have thought of that
but that you hit the button the USB C
port goat that the port goes into the
connector and then you can turn the
thing upside down and the phone's gonna
stay in there yeah yeah and it's the
phone goes right to the edge and there's
a gap in the casing so to sign in you
just drop your thumb on the fingerprint
sensor is it six out the side it's so
thoughtfully designed that is amazing
you rip the phone out yeah I was like oh
it was oh right so I was like oh I love
it but I was like oh this isn't working
anymore and then I realized that I just
change the phone the phone right out did
you make the connector Wow
no and I didn't I didn't afterwards I
was like wiggling things around we were
talking to the product engineer that
they only brought a handful of them here
that he had like personally put together
and he was saying the thing that I was
most worried about was not the press
breaking them but the other people that
are here at CES but of course Nicole
would beYOU know what
well if the Razr PR folks on this thing
I still need my review unit number one
Nicole broke I feel waiting I'm hoping
you know if Huawei is gonna do their
thing with the may 10 so that you can
use it as that as a computer
I mean if Samsung is gonna do it I hope
that Razer goes beyond just having this
be a concept than price and aggressively
I mean if they told me that the whole
package of the razor phone Plus this
thing would cost me a thousand bucks I'd
pay for it
would you I'd go for it rather than
buying just like an $800 really good
let's just well think about it I mean
but you get your phone you think about
it so the biggest problem with
Chromebooks is just how Pat they
launched Android apps it's you can get a
PC for seven yeah but you wouldn't want
to go back to Android and you know how
prepared it is for this kind of yes they
had a custom launcher you know
well that's very much does a fuchsia is
the way to go here if they're merging we
don't even know if you know know but
that's a really good point that was
raised when I was in there there was
just a bunch of people bounced around
talking questions stuff is like well in
two or three years maybe when that
confluence happens this could be a
really compelling product until then
it's like it's a really well-executed
Atrix again yeah the issue I have is
Razer is new to the smartphone market
how many devices have they sold and
they're creating a device that only
works for their unique phone so I was
talking to Sean last night about there's
like you have maybe 50,000 phones sold
your maximum market share or maximum
sales for this product is maximum fifty
thousand if a hundred percent of your
razor phone owners buy this
that's that's not a like it's an
engineer's product if we're not it's not
a company's marketing like this is how
we're gonna make a lot of money yeah
like someone came up with this idea and
said we could
yeah it's great but how are you gonna
sell it who are you gonna sell it to
yeah
are we sure it's really gonna come out
in basketball you may not just like oh
we got like like what assisted with the
patent but they put 10,000 units under
like real product soos has like markets
of scale and they're like 50,000 times
bigger than race no no no but like I
would like put like legit suits just
like made yeah
like remember the ek finish it up all
the time like they have money to burn -
oh sure razor has a track record of
doing this - si si si have a Disney show
where they're like here's crazy keyboard
PDAC acted like oh she's a green laptop
is that all the other types got stolen
yeah clamshell PV a Windows machine
appears back with ladies or build the
cheesehead like le or LED screens in my
what yes yes like all that all the keys
were OLED screen I can you can probably
look for the next blackberry you can
reprogram it oh well great but that has
that makes sense in gaming world because
you can control whatever the heck you
want I don't see as it is with Android
and with that kind of I don't see it I
don't see where the target is well
that's this is a concept prototype thing
will it actually be a product that yeah
that will actually hit the market
factors may be a limited selling razors
razors track record is zero
possibilities a single concept that
they've brought to CES has never yeah
it's just to get us to show up with
their boots it works
Thank You razor for helping sustain the
publication I have to admit it was my
favorite thing on the show was it yeah I
mean I liked the idea I feel that with
Android we're not even close to the
implementation I get it it's just I
would never be caught dead using Dex it
just won't happen do you only see the
simple solution is what I always doing
with the honor the matin Pro agree just
plug it into an MHL or or disable there
but you don't need the doc for Dex like
the doc is an option like you've got
Club I do told you can't you have to
like hock something to make it work
yeah just to make you feel better my
friend I'm thinking what else stood out
right see I've got a Bible TV yeah yeah
that's order one huh yeah that's not it
like honestly I stopped caring about
making youtube videos after I did that
when I was like I just don't care about
any other products anymore I actually
don't think I've posted a single I maybe
after after see yes I'll get back to it
this is like a million views that's cool
it doesn't look like it should be able
to bend rolls up you're like my god it's
magic
I didn't see it so for those who haven't
so it's like basically it's a 65 inch
glorious
right now and then like it has tiny
maybe like one centimeter slats on the
back or you can just see them kind of
like fold around right
in most demos they don't let you they
didn't let me take off the box but you
can see it like rolling down X I think
Fox me you've got it so that's around a
roll around that's the rigid component
that keeps it like yeah so it just it
just rolls away and the plastic front so
it's like we can't tell you what it is
plastic yeah right but like when it
comes back up and you're looking at it
it doesn't look like it should be able
to curved yeah it looks like it's
actually tiny little slots it kind of
goes in around a probably pretty big
spool but it's very controlled the
motion and the bending and but it was
black there's no waves there's nothing
it's perfect and the idea is that like
it is just for different aspect ratios
roll away the bars yeah unlike and then
III know like in Asia most people I know
don't have TVs cuz they're like ugly
right this apartment is so small you
don't want to come at all I mean if you
have a big TV it's gonna be the focal
point of your living and maybe that's
not sure you want as part of your life
unhealthy its unhealthy that have like
such a big but you like so you're
totally like we like putting it away
when they're not watching it's a piece
of furniture rolls down into a piece of
furniture it's like so nice like
short-throw
4k projection yes a piece of furniture
and you know you have it up against the
wall and then it projects 80 inches onto
the wall and it's right on the wall
smart homes more furniture I know have a
projector in my place in Portland and I
have a 105 inch image it's fantastic
alright and I can put it away like it
just disappears I still use the ZTE SPRO
- yeah it's so it's perfect for karaoke
yeah I still hate the the velcro sounds
they include
an unboxing video though uuugh I'm not
the wise I thought you were afraid of
the knife that I used you guys heard
that ain't that anchor Nebula know what
the US only got it really it's a
projector made by anchor huh and it's
like a little a little bucket it's okay
I gave up my apartment in all of my
worldly possessions and is one of the
few things I own the UI sucks since were
on TVs and projectors did anyone see the
little robot at pep calm that had
Android TV projector that was yes Oh
like egg-shaped robot that has a
projector built-in that's Android TV and
it follows you around the house
projecting TV on the wall watch this
commercial they actually had two of them
like side-by-side and they were like
competing to where they were projecting
I'm like what the heck is going on I'm
sorry I don't know the actual things do
things like that cost in japan reaiiy
yeah the iPhone used to be like $1500
years ago yeah
but there was that thing that really
heartwarming thing at one of the one of
the shows within the show where it's
like it was the Aflac duck yes Oh
I didn't go over there cuz I was like
that yeah yeah hey let's give you one
right like it's intended for kids who
are you don't have brakes are serious
serious health problems and like need to
do injections and stuff and you can do
like the Aflac duck or whatever like
that and it's like it's it's meant to
like be scarify right so they can just
get more comfortable I didn't expect to
like no idea I look for three hours like
you are but I have a new one is lovely
but I didn't see a particular journal
that I like to the show but I saw right
across the hall from where all the drums
are being demoed in their cages and
flying they have this like super
military looking booth with these dudes
in like all the combat fatigues and this
very intimidating looking piece of
equipment that looks like it's from the
top of a tank the biggest tagline on the
drone is what will bring them down
well and so I've seen a lot of devices
like that like drone security like yeah
and they've been out for a while and but
they are illegal well they're illegal
because drones are governed by the FAA
yeah it's a terrorist attack if you take
a drone out of the sky
really yeah all of these products like
in the United States
no no they to be FAA owns the sky
there's you why whenever his town tried
to pass an ordinance like governing
drone drone flies over beaches the
aphasic can't there's actually an
airspace to find for it it's just
because it's Class G I mean it's
anything below 1,200 feet is available
covering but yeah yeah
so this booth it's crazy like I wanted
to go back because I was like oh yeah
because there's a TV screen off to the
side and on this TV screen it's personal
trike okay so you can okay forever they
call it but basically if we're all
walking through a crowd it can follow
you oh it's almost like the talker
thanks you're a recognition on a drone
in a crowd yeah over a crowd oh there's
hime a facial recognition or is it like
her body's body ready yeah person so I
saw someone getting a demo and I was
like figure out it to get that because
then he like tapped on the person and
then there's like this guy like was like
ducking behind other people drums follow
no no the the image is falling in okay
right so it was it was it was a
demonstration camera DJI has the
tracking and you'll a draw a little
square but it loses you all the tips and
listen speaking of the junior I mean
I I was at their booth two things well
three I mean what is that huge drone
that they have it's it looks like a
freaking airplane I mean oh then I'm not
drone probably with the reversal drug
that was one number to tell me that it's
true that their new DJI Osmo is just
costing 125 bucks so the DJI Osmo the
the hem stable as you have smartphones
is the new one is 129 dude yes are you
sure $300 and I was like no yeah and
three people told me yesterday that that
was the price day I doubt that I don't
know it could be the old one that got
discounted day which would be great time
you'll be awesome Oh in the or the old
what is good enough pretty good I mean
I'm getting a little annoyed it doesn't
well oh my god well and it doesn't work
with large devices what you love the
road saw the Ronin it's just for a full
blown camera yeah gimbal for a full
blown Cameron they've got two one for
like mirrorless cameras one for dslr's
yeah but and it's even got feet and
everything for you to set it up so it
becomes a monopod if you wanted to it
becomes ever it's a blogger tool Indian
like what 1,200 bucks or what is this
thing I mean they're not the first on
the market for with with a stabilizer
like that with for DSLR there's a couple
other Chinese brands and do it but the
DJI does it better than everybody else
they're more unique them yeah well until
it forgets what zero is and all of a
sudden all your wait a second it never
knows where zero is from the moment you
unbox it anyway so it's like fair first
couple shots parts that you lost the
tiny one DJ I guess does 101 that they
did
[Laughter]
you're like in the city responsible
close close calls like I'm flying in I'm
like return to home lost signal and like
yeah it's like two miles away oh it was
within like no it was not within life I
know he's like sunset getting dark and
I'm like I'm in a small town and but I
was trying to get like this football
field in the high school it was like
beautiful sunset and like return home
crap we're like 30 seconds of like blank
screen I'm like yeah and then it comes
back I'm like dude you know to be honest
that is the thing my thing with teacher
like they make an incredible hardware
those drums are nearing perfection err
their app is it's crashed on me say is
that garbage I mean it crashes on me
regularly yeah Thank You Lee the spark
is like his actual is actually smart
enough to just hover there and wait for
the me to restart the app yeah but boy
it still you're like what are you gonna
do up there huh the app will fail but if
you're recording video it's still
recording video and so it's recording
you frantically trying to
[Laughter]
at least you don't have to worry about
being able to portray how bad it is you
have no idea you're like so they're
surprising thing it's failed more on my
pixel the app then on a Samsung and HTC
know they're to crash the attic so it
crashed under I have it for me it's only
possible a strobe now I've never used
the drone yeah I guess but it's just
hilarious when yesterday like I was like
but do you have any experience flying
drones and I'm like no but flown
airplanes does that help so let's see
what else we got here on this list I
want to add something really quickly I
got to went to the fear booth you know
the thermal-imaging folks and I saw some
cool stuff there that's like prototype
II they had a pair of glasses like when
clearly for like industrial or you know
work like workmen type glasses safety
glasses and they had like a thing that
looked like Google glass on it made by
some company whose name I completely
forgot but it basically has a FLIR
thermal camera on it and it did the
Google glass thing of showing you the
thermal image superpose whatever you
pointed at and it's really small and I
match to get if you go on my Twitter
feed right now you'll see I'm I take the
photo of from inside the lens like it
looks really great with a pixel of
course which is the best phone ever made
the entire planet with cameras make sure
the Panasonic Toughbook tablet a tough
pad I guess is called a small one like
iPad Mini size and run on Android
Windows 10 and he had built-in FLIR
imaging and it was glorious like rugged
droppable water-resistant step on it
break it doesn't break so kind of for
the reinforced construction sighs yeah
barcode scanner he had like a studio
camera on the back ahead like I was just
like Oh
like the most extreme
yeah we have to send it to Adam it's not
bad right focus it isn't everything I
never saw Fleur was maybe like 8 or 9
years ago it was a CTIA and I was just
like hanging out with the guys and they
had the camera pointed out at the crowd
and then do that but also like you know
in public and they're laughing at me
this young guys with the doughnuts
it's a FLIR enabled drone other things
that we're cool Michael do you want to
talk I think you were the one who wanted
to talk about this YouTube channel check
it out
yeah so what do you think so what's
interesting about this thing is that
it's not a smartphone replacement even
though it could be but they're very
literally not marketing it's one like it
is much more like a laptop that stumbled
its way into a shrinking machine right
but it's not likely and that like it is
literally a Sony Tablet P like eyeglass
shaped thing that splits along the
longitudinal axis you open it up and
then there's this keyboard inside that's
not a BlackBerry keyboard it's not a
MacBook keyboard it's like like a 1998
IBM chiclet keyboard yeah yeah and
I think I'm saying it like it's ugly
it's not it's really pretty good
photographs well what she and then you
lay your fingers like wait wait wait
why my is the spacebar not like these
keys direct rental force so I was like
okay at CES we're looking at
pre-production stuff right so I'm like
hey dude sir how close is this to
production he was basically like these
are frying all production set and I was
like oh no cuz I love the idea of a
modern-day PDA I don't think a lot of
people would buy them I think it would
skew toward an older demo but there
isn't probably a market for it but
you've got to nail that keyboard and I
really really hope that he was wrong and
then the one if that's the selling point
it has to be Gunnar Finn you've gotta be
gotten it right on yeah yeah but they
have what they have a Wi-Fi version of a
40 version the screen is really nice it
runs Android still boots and Linux for
the 4G and and you can get a candidate
pay 50 bucks put a camera then it'll own
you make it but can make voice calls and
because of you I wouldn't spent 25
minutes because of you playing with it
yeah so I went there I think that you
can get the keyboard if you try and I
questioned your dedication really yes it
see you do you aim away from it and you
were like you could write after 45
minutes of like people coming and
talking to me the table and being like
them take it back I'm not done yeah
she's like writing her review on it yeah
well kept on chatting and I'm like don't
take it away I still haven't finished
filming and so like by the end of it I
still couldn't figure out how to open
the stupid music video but but I was
getting I think the spacebar is the
hardest right but the keys once you kind
of get that so it took me maybe like I'd
say like five or six hundred words like
she rolled her hands on
people came and chatted and I just kept
on practicing since all right that's
really cool because that's what I mean
the people who have ordered this and by
the way it's like one of the most
popular and you go-go projects 2014 it's
like it's 230% buy it and then they're
like well alright now I'm gonna write
everything on this very well stays until
I'm what is it running Android yeah
Android and they you can do anything
like that you know there's another a
successful crowdfunding project is that
Windows 10 super shiny yeah yeah who's
it like that but cheaper and jankier or
is it as good no I know I think the
hardware feels really nice feels good
nicer yes board works really well when
you set it down on a table it real it's
it's top-heavy if you're holding it in
your hands and you're trying to go with
your thumbs so just that keep that in
mind like if you have to put it down and
use it as a lab it's not meant to be a
little the original Windows CE PDAs do
you know what I figured out how to type
on it when the guy was showing me how to
type on it I'm like oh he types like a
grandpa
maybe maybe maybe four remember tiny
tutor right there yeah kind of like
tapping with his fingers maybe
occasionally the thumb yeah there's not
enough room but then like when I saw him
like peck away at the keyboard I was
like oh it'd be like my grandpa typing
that's how much I altered my style okay
right and then I was like oh this this
works I can hear the normal people being
like but why am i right why not buy like
a 400 other laptop like we were talking
with before and just do that but here's
my thing I'm always on a plane I'm
always on a train and every single time
the guy in front of you recline the seat
and that's fine I had no room but you
have no room for a big laptop
I guess maybe bless we need the perfect
don't you take the cafe car no but for
me economy I just want a landscape
slider back like I love it you don't
even know I want I want
no one would that was exist that I never
used them because your thumbs have to
track it was too much travel I loved I
loved it I feel like very key one I
always wondered why nobody came up with
like something where it was a slider but
then you don't want such a you know
ample keyboard and so just put a d-pad
on the left and something on the right
and a numeric keyboard it's just my
biggest problem with using phones for
gaming is not having keys to play with
word so if somebody would come out with
a slide-out keyboard that in the middle
would be the QT and then on the sides it
would have like a control like a like a
d-pad that could be used for gaming and
then the other one but there was a Sony
one with Windows Mobile back in the day
that was built by HTC that had that no
no it was an Android one I have it the
Xperia Play I have it was shitty
whatever I have a question that's not on
the list pros anybody see yeah since
we're talking my keyboards anybody see
in the Moto mod with the QWERTY keyboard
no I think this game it was one of my
clients when they were working on this
not anymore but it's fine I'm just
saying like I just need to be in fear
that if we talked about it it was one of
my clients to help them with a lot of
their you know strategy around this
product because I kind of know what you
guys would all want right yeah so so
Sean Sean Hollister of Cena you know
what's kind of like the guy that I knew
would be be really into it and and and
you know the only thing I couldn't get
them to do at least on this first gen is
a staggered Keys which I think really
need to have alright but just got the
backlight and it's also a little sicker
than we wanted but I think they had so
many issues getting the Moto mod
connector the pins you know like and
everything to to fit in the right space
so it's a little bulkier than I expected
it to be and not staggered but I think
they're working on it also if you played
with them these are 4th gen prototypes
on 5th gender so I don't why they bring
those but anyway I don't remember the
price but it's yeah no I didn't play
with I haven't seen I went up to go try
and do it and set the Lenovo yeah I know
sweetie which we're gonna find the
Gemini thing oh that was another the
words that yeah their hands yeah I can
give us a booth number sweet but oh that
was the thing that you guys talked about
pack lights and the Gemini doesn't have
a backlight no I won't do not understand
that decision the higher quality key
captain Lee cool but I want to talk in
the darkness I want Harmon to talk about
his most loved keyboard of CES evidence
they're not even at CES today oh yeah oh
so so they they want us to do a review
on the product they sent one friend Adam
Lane did the that our text review but
they they would like a video and I you
know I was like okay sure I love the
surface form factor but I got the chance
to see it today for the first time and I
was like wait a second so you're telling
me that you pretty much did everything
that the surface should be yeah really
really literally created a computer that
is absolutely everything that the
surface should have always been and then
you also came up with a keyboard that
looks almost identical to it oh and you
can also unsnap it and use it wirelessly
it also has that function but it's got
all the ports that we wanted it's got
all the specs that we wanted there there
are no fans there's a core i7 variant
with 16 gigs of ram two USB ports out of
it which one of them is Thunderbolt 3 2
USB a ports a pen pen I'm like I just
wanted to say that the keyboard is also
backlit and it also works when I change
and it changes colors together shoot a
drop what's wrong with it
wait so base level is 99999 959 959 if
you and we're talking about an m3 with
everything but they're thinking about
ditching the m3 because it's pointless
yeah the price tag the price tag between
that and the i-5 is just insignificant
and they're not doing fans anyways and
so you know you look at their whole
profile just this is just the product
look I just wish the keyboard came in
like red or blue or something like that
but an absolutely everything else I'm
like you realize that this is a you know
daily driver potential for me I need a
surface for work I actually rely on pen
input for my scripts and but the
difference is I could actually edit a
video on this thing I mean I mean it's
powerful enough it's a seven point five
water TPU but it does perform like I was
very impressed yeah Mac's back nine
seven which is the dual core but it was
Sarabhai gigs of ram six is you Hannibal
store 1895 512 512 gigabyte solid state
drive got me well there are numbers yes
oh the numbers resolution is play 18 so
it's an it so sharp XO display just like
on a razor yeah looks gorgeous
I bought one myself by five but not
really the pocket just to be clear oh
it's this is not here at the show right
it's it's at the Intel booth it's
because so they had it and they had a
Kickstarter campaign yeah raised raised
nearly three million bucks and you talk
to these guys and these guys are very
passionate people you know they're young
they actually they can tell you they
finish Finley yeah yeah and they can
pinpoint like absolutely everything that
the community asks for in this could be
a gas liquid and how they figured it out
how they added the fingerprint scanner
to the button to the power bud just
about everything Oh in the display they
has no reflection as well I'm like holy
crap a magical unicorn they launched
texts and I went to look for it at the
Microsoft but it's there it's there I
walked around I couldn't find it because
I'm like because it looks so there's
actually a good segue because I think I
want to talk about that Lenovo device
that the welcome based Windows 10 the
leaks mi IX 630 from the reason I'm
bringing it up is because I was in
Hawaii with a bunch of you yeah for the
reveal the big the first two products
that were revealed with running Windows
10 on Snapdragon 835 and I booth at
Illinois was 835 still not yet given
five yet and of course we saw then Anna
sous laptop form factor and we saw an HP
detachable floppy keyboard is what I
like to call them form factor and
because to me the surface book is also
detachable but it's done right you know
I'm saying and then and then of course
this this lenovo is also a floppy
keyboard detachable tablet and so a
couple of things you know at the time I
had expressed my concern saying like you
know it's a good start and I understand
that we're actually waiting for probably
Computex and Snapdragon 845 versions and
I Suz to really jump in and give us a
Zen book style device but the thing
that's interesting to me is that when I
looked around how ananova was
positioning this device it's very
obvious to me that they're afraid of
pissing off Intel and a normal laptop
that these things are going to be tablet
derivatives and it's pissing me off
because all I'm asking for I have a
MacBook on the table here recording you
guys all know what it looks like you
guys all seen a Zen book the super slick
super thing I want a laptop not a tablet
detachable or otherwise convertible I
want a laptop running Windows 10 it
doesn't have to have a touchscreen but I
want to stop dragging 845 LTE huge
battery and super thin and I'd and even
an even thinner and lighter than Ezra
Zenbook give me that and what and I
don't think we're gonna get that because
they're gonna say well it has to have a
touchscreen because you know because
it's not driving why would we throw away
the stud screen because everything
like well but here's the thing though
like we've been asking for that because
those who like Chromebooks we've been
asking for that for Chromebooks as well
because you can get a nice Chromebook
true but it's super expensive right and
so I think the the manufacturers are
afraid of pissing off Microsoft by
creating an awesome you know
$300 Chromebook that looks incredible
when they can do that for Windows there
are devices for it so they can do it
yeah as you said they're afraid that you
see I'm not sure willing to pay 1500 oh
this was a 1799 fully loaded MacBook
when I bought it two years ago I don't
care it's a work thing I don't care I'll
pay for it so for me it's not the price
so much it's just I want the super light
super thin great battery life LT and
snapdragon brings that to me in Windows
10 and we understand is the only u.s.
that's full-fledged enough for me to
actually work on yeah but here's the
thing there I don't know at least my
opinion is for example things that they
were showing off like 20 hours of
battery life I'm not awake for 20 hours
unless I'm so nice for flights I like
yeah for a flight to China that's great
but it's nice to see yes yes you don't
know when you're gonna plug in so I like
the concept but I was like okay I would
like the option where there is your
regular form factor but then I would
love for somebody to experiment with
this like really thin crazy computer
that will weigh one pound and fit
anywhere in my best acne and fine just
give me ten hours of battery because you
can't fit a larger battery in that I
don't care I just want it to be really
thin anyway you know the other thing I'd
be willing to do if it wasn't a laptop
is a Lenovo yoga so I'll come back
convertible yeah because I think the
engine is awesome yes and and I don't or
like the pixel book the pixel book is
probably the best laptop design of all
time I'm sorry but I think it really is
associated so light it runs really long
and battery it's a really fast the only
thing that I wish I had is it more less
bezel yeah but here's the thing the yoga
book last year remember that yoga book
yes yeah imagine you put a real keyboard
and trackpad on that instead and you
keep it that's in in light and you give
me Windows 10
bezel las' and you put like a
fingerprint reader and now it's got 15
hour battery life LG that's what I would
it's tiny you throw it in your bag
you're done you're gonna work anyway you
can edit video anywhere there's nothing
like that would be a truly aspirational
like category defining product and none
of these manufacturers seem to want to
create that I was asking at Lenovo the
same thing I asked both what Asus and HP
it was like why are you using the same
old brands why does every manufacturer
seem to want to hide these behind like I
don't not that I'm saying mix six thirty
is not memorable just sound like a
Saturday night Lenovo to its credit was
the only one to actually answer me in
their answer was hilarious there's a
well we haven't really we haven't done
it's you know the 630 we haven't done it
even numbered six before I think it'll
come it's just it's an unproven category
as it right now so there and I think
they're really they're just taking their
pinky toe and stepping in and like we're
not trying to make anybody mad and we're
not trying to make something incredible
if people buy this will make a second
one but is it is it because I questioned
this sometimes we're all content
producers with a very specific the
average consumer does not do what we do
they serve little babies or how do you
look so how can we criticize them for
not building us our dream machine
there's probably what five thousand but
was so influential
you know Microsoft has been dealing with
that I mean they've been wanting I mean
there's a program where they reached out
to us particularly because they actually
want to start changing the thing where
they noticed press events and all they
see are Apple logos being lit during the
press events by all the press that's all
we use and why because these computers
actually address some of the true needs
of creators regardless if we're such a
small niche touch bar number one oh my
god please have a MacBook without touch
bar that's more powerful yeah that's all
I want
I'm going to go all USBC and speaking of
all US PC haha the Segway has been made
touch bar some more we go that's good
for is going back and forth scrubbing
between Instagram videos it's not good
Instagram but why are you watching
Instagram videos on I think for me the
biggest I mean my MacBook is the
original not beat slightly flashed a
revised version and it's it's I struggle
I mean a 5s more than five times I can't
really use it and I do basic video
editing on it thank God it's not that
bad on iMovie especially the new version
of iMovie is really optimized so it's
really optimized it's incredible I
render faster with this when then with
my Elgato stick when I used to have
another stance which is incredible again
it's less powerful than when i use an
elgato stick on the old version of
imovie on my MacBook Air which was a
faster computer anyway I want a MacBook
Airs macbook 13 like my GoPro 13 I want
the high-end version without the touch
bar and the fingerprint reader though
yeah see I'm saying yeah but I know
that's gonna go in there gonna put a
face ID and all the interest right just
I want can somebody please you know
Apple it's about time for a quad-core
13-inch MacBook Pro yeah please because
I've been I've been always wanting to
move back to 13 inches I hate carrying
that behemoth it's a month of the 15
inch computer and I can
because I need quad-core performance for
the amount of video that I do yeah it's
just night and day when you hit that
render button it's like shoot I can't
you know so I want to talk about the Dex
mr. Chan real quick all usb-c all the
time what do you guys think I think it
was just hot because of the white and
gold rose gold somehow that combo really
works and I'm really fascinated by the
the fiber carton it's not carbon fiber
its glass fibers believe that they
custom-designed that where the white is
embedded in it so it doesn't get dirty
and they have a nano coating on top of
that so it doesn't stain it just thought
it was really cool is it just as soft as
the previous XPS 13 I love that feel
it's so the feel is a little bit
different so it has a different feel
than in the previous another previous
one yeah it's a little bit smoother well
it's smoother as in like glossy err yeah
it's not the soft touch it so um the
read is that he has nobody play with it
I did not I mean I touched it for a
minute it's it's it's the same we got
the new color option with the white my
complaint is the camera still at the
bottom oh that's sort like you
redesigned the thing you're calling it
new and then you stick things they put
the camera in the middle now at least
but it's like I need a manicure every
time I want to make like even if there's
these major things wrong with it it's
still didn't gonna be my number one
recommendation for job tough for anyone
yeah and I want to go excited about it
it's just the price point for the design
for the durability you know these -
awesome you just can't beat it like I've
unfortunately stopped recommending
lenovo's because after one year everyone
know they just died right yeah so like
like I start to look at like when you
recommend something and you're not gonna
recommend an apple mm-hmm you have to go
with the XPS okay yeah - look your
friend in the eyes there's what I'm
bringing up I think it is one of the
most well sorted Windows 10 pcs you can
buy because you have to look at all the
angles not just the good design but yes
your
yes to be you know world potentially
with you for a couple of years or more
you know I keep my max for a long time
most of them five years or so and and
you know this one probably not because
it's a little underpowered but I just
bought a brand new iMac for the holidays
I was like Oh tax deductions for 2017
but you know I mean the reality is I
haven't set it up yet but I can't wait
because I'm running on an old Mac Mini
and it's painful but let's talk about
one before I let you out for each of you
very briefly because we really need to
get out of here by in the next four
minutes I wanted to ask you I just
mentioned really quickly Alcatel had
