g3 multiple times now but last month LG
announced a new version the cat six so
what's different what's new I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the LG g3 versus the g3 cat
six before we get started I want to
thank our friends over at 28th mobile
for lending us the g3 cat 6 for review
if you'd like to g3 cat 6 to call your
own simply click the link in the
description below or go to 28 mobile
comm where you can find the cat 6 as
well as dozens of other smart phones to
choose from
so what exactly did LG change with this
cat6 model of its g3 handset externally
there are only a handful of minor
differences one this is a South Korean
model meaning yes there's a DMB TV
antenna found in the upper right corner
and of course there's LTE a branding in
the middle of the back side and the new
g3 cat6 emblem near the bottom under the
battery door the micro SD card slot has
been moved to accommodate for the new
modem which we'll get to in a second
other than that as far as appearances go
this cat6 is identical to every other g3
out there including the AT&amp;amp;T model we've
been testing likewise it comes in the
standard white gold or black color
options and even the spec list of the g3
cat6 is almost identical to the AT&amp;amp;T
model on hand and the g3 we originally
reviewed both have 32 gigabytes of fixed
storage 3 gigabytes of RAM a microSD
card slot for up to 128 gigabytes of
additional storage a 13 megapixel OAS +
camera a 5.5 inch 1440p true HD IPS plus
display and a 3000 milliamp hour
removable battery inside there are only
two notable differences between the
standard g3 and this cat6 variant
instead of the Snapdragon 801 founded
the g3 the cat6 has a newer Snapdragon
805 this 805 comes with newer Krait 450
CPUs clocked at 2.7 gigahertz and an
Adreno 420 GPU the ADA 1 on the other
hand has create four hundred CPUs
clocked at 2.5 gigahertz with an Adreno
330 GPU also as the name suggests this
cat6 is capable of much faster data
speeds provided you're on the right
network the new modem is capable of up
to theoretical speeds of 225 megabits
per second one of the more unexpected
differences between these two phones are
the display temperatures and color
reproduction the display on the cat 6 is
dramatically warmer with totally
different color reproduction even
tweaking the accessibility display
settings didn't seem to matter the cat 6
is display is just warm and we prefer
the look of the AT&amp;amp;T models display all
of these changes amount to a mere 5 gram
difference in weight otherwise these two
phones are blow-for-blow
the same goes for software both the AT&amp;amp;T
model and cat6 are running Android 4.4.2
with the same version of LG UI atop the
notable discrepancies here are that the
AT&amp;amp;T model comes filled with about two
dozen AT&amp;amp;T applications and the cat6
comes with the same blow found on most
other SK Telecom variants of the g3 you
can find in-depth coverage of the
software in both our LG g3 review videos
obviously we can't test the cat sakes to
its fullest capabilities here on AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile in the States the
infrastructure simply isn't here and
both models seemed to gather practically
identical speeds through network speed
tests although our time has been very
limited with the cat 6 better life also
seems to be similar between the two
models we weren't able to definitively
test how the Snapdragon 805 effects
battery life and we were unable to
discern a difference in call or speaker
quality these are for all intents and
purposes the same phones so the real
question everyone wants an answer to is
does the Snapdragon 805 really make a
difference well not really we ran a host
of different synthetic benchmark tests
and found that at best the two phones
were back and forth the graphics prowess
of the audrina 450 is apparent when
running something like the 3d mark test
or a graphically intensive game
especially due to the number of pixels
the g3 has to push in heavy gaming and
graphics benchmarks the cat 6 has an
ever so slight edge switch that over two
other benchmark tests and the results
are far less definitive the cat 6
consistently scored just lower than the
original g3 in Geekbench 3 but completed
the SunSpider javascript test faster and
in standard tests the cat 6 appeared
marginally faster it didn't seem to
hesitate like the AT&amp;amp;T model when jump
at home or switching apps in other words
the cat 6 definitely has better graphics
performance but the rest is negligible
so unless you're a heavy gamer the cat 6
is Snapdragon 805 won't really benefit
you all that much
worst yet modern combat 5 which I
installed and played on the AT&amp;amp;T g3
isn't compatible with the cat 6 sad day
the Snapdragon 805 also brings some new
camera capabilities but as far as we can
tell the original g3 in the cat 6 g3 at
the exact same camera hardware and
software there is no discernible
difference in output quality so should
you worry and fear that your new g3 is
already outdated not at all if you're in
South Korea and have access to LTE a the
cat 6 g3 might be worth buying over the
standard g3 especially if you're into
mobile gaming
otherwise you should be perfectly
happy with the original LG g3 form or g3
