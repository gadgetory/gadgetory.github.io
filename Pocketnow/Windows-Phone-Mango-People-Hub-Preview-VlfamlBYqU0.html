and you're watching a windows phone
mango previous next up we're going to
look at the People Hub but really first
I want to look at the me hub well mute
I'll so this has changed a little we
have our profile page there's less
latest messenger facebook update and can
post a message and I can choose which
networks I want to post it to Twitter
does not show up there yet I can check
in this is a cool new feature this is
going to let me check into local places
and post it on Facebook or live
messenger you think foursquare will be
in here but I don't see it yet and i can
set chat status available and look at
that notifications this is where all my
facebook notifications are going to show
up and i can tap it to go to that
section and here's what's new with me so
that's still there I can see the
comments
now the live tile will flip over when
there's notifications so it won't like
pop up a little message at the top but
it'll show you what's new when somebody
replies to something you posted or
whatnot so that'll happen over here in
the meat aisle now let's look at people
so here's our list that changed a little
bit the search button is down here now
as well as the new button and there's a
little menu you can get to settings so
that's a lot better a lot easier to find
the settings for the people here's a
really good feature filter my contact
list now this is not as robust as
something that would you know on Outlook
where you can filter by all sorts of
stuff including categories which would
have been good but we can shut off
things that we don't really care to see
in here and then the contacts will
disappear and right here we can say only
show posts from people visible in my
contacts list so if I shut off facebook
their facebook updates for people in my
exchange or LinkedIn contacts list will
still show up in the woods new feeding
if I want to see everybody on facebook
i'll just leave that on or shut that off
so there you go and there's the what's
new feed and up here I can tap that and
I can just show them from whichever
account m1 and you still have you can
comment and everything everything like
that is still there here's your recent
people will show up just fine and when
you first get into the contact list
you're going to see this family group by
default when we first set it up it's
going to suggest family members to add
to this group based on your last name
that's a really cool thing and now I've
added a bunch of family members and here
they're all showing up and you can see
all these live tiles are bouncing around
if it's showing their pictures showing
their status updates sometimes they'll
show pictures that they post and all the
way down here I can text all of them or
chat with all them well the ones that
are on messenger or I can send email to
everybody down here i can edit it add
different people
and to swipe over here there's the
what's new feed and this is going to get
what's new with everybody in this group
only so it's only getting a post from
family members or on family members
walls through Facebook or Windows Live
or whatever other social networks we're
going to support here and then there's
pictures she says pictures of family and
these are all my family members well 20
of them it only supports 20 people per
group so if you've got like hundreds of
cousins like I do you're going to have
to pick the 20 coolest ones and there's
some family pictures it's all piled
together but we can see a nice selection
there so those are groups and as you may
have noticed you can pin groups to your
Start menu and here are some more groups
and you can see those are flipping
around showing new status updates
showing new pictures showing little
contact photos lots of activity going on
in these groups okay there's a small
group something else that's new so when
we go to a contact you can still see the
what's new feed for that contact but you
can also see their picture albums
so now I'm looking at all of her photo
albums and i can download thumbnails and
i'm just going to all appear here
and you'll be able to post comments or
add tags there's tag so there's some
extensive Facebook integration in the
people up and this groups groups feature
is really new you also have a history so
this for each contact you'll see
conversations and with text messages or
windows live messenger or facebook
Messenger or phone calls you'll see all
that right here just for this person in
the history so that's about it for
what's new in the People Hub on windows
phone mango be sure to check out
pocketnow.com for our full preview of
Windows Phone mango with a lot more text
and pictures and more videos that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
