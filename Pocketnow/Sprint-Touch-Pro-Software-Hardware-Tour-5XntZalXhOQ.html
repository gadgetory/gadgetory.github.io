pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
and software tour of the sprint HTC
touch pro
that has been released in the united
states there are going to be two more
touch pros coming up on AT&amp;amp;T and on
verizon so let's talk about the hardware
of this particular device and look look
at it in comparison to the original
they're very similar like I said in the
unboxing they're about the same width
although if you look really closely I'm
going to try to do this right it turns
out that the that the European touch pro
on the right is actually about one
millimeter thicker than the u.s. sprint
touch pro so that's good news we have a
lot of chrome on the touch pro and it's
funny if you think about the Titan to
when it came over from Europe to the to
AT&amp;amp;T as the tilt it just had a lot of
chrome on it apparently Americans like
chrome and I and I can see why I mean
chrome is flashy chrome looks good
chrome looks high-end so we have this
chrome stretching all around the device
and and because of that it just looks
really great if we look at the european
version it's completely black okay so
looking at the front of the device we
have a light sensor here with a speaker
plus a few different buttons down here
only one of which is programmable we
have a home button and okay or back
button here call end and call start and
also if you run your finger around the
outside of this edge it will zoom in and
zoom out of web pages and that sort of
thing over on to the side we have a
volume rocker and there it says HTC
innovation again going over to the top
we have the standby button over on this
side we have the stylus and like the the
original touch pro if you take out the
stylus it'll turn the phone off from put
it back on from standby I should say and
if we look at the bottom we have the EXT
USB port that's proprietary to HTC
although it works with mini USB ports if
you have those we have a soft reset hole
and a microphone and fortunately HTC and
sprint have included this adapter which
will allow you to plug it into the
bottom and use the the pass throughs for
3.5 millimeter 2.5 millimeter and you
can even keep charging or sinking your
device while you listen to audio
it's a little annoying having this
hanging off of your device but but if
you want a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
built in you're going to have to look to
other devices if we turn over to the
back we have something that really
differentiates this device from the
original touch pro we have a rubbery
kind of silver metallic backing which
really makes the device feel good in
hand compared to the faceted backing on
the european version which makes it feel
kind of boxy so that's a really great
thing about that if we take off the
cover we see the 3.2 megapixel camera
sensor and the LED flash and we also see
the microSD slot over here behind the
battery cover unfortunately the battery
is thirteen hundred and forty million
Bowers just like the original and that
provides a pretty good amount of battery
life okay let's take a look at the
software on the sprint HTC touch pro the
first thing I want to compare is
touchflo 3d on both versions on the
european version if you slide your
finger you get the you know the icons
show up on the screen like so and if we
do likewise on the sprint version we get
kind of fluorescent looking icons which
is kind of cool actually and also the
icons along the bottom are slightly
different so if we go over to weather
and over here to weather it just looks a
little bit different sprint kind of
dressed it up to to match their own
colors and you'll see throughout the
operating system on the sprint HTC touch
pro that a lot of yellow is used because
Sprint's colors are black and yellow
okay so let's take a closer look at
touchflo 3d on the sprint HTC touch pro
on the first tab we have just as the
regular version we have the time plus
any voicemail notifications and we can
also get into call history if we flick
our finger up we can see some more
appointments that are coming up if we go
over two favorite people we can add
their pictures and flick through them
kind of like album art and and call them
just by tapping on their picture if we
go over to mail if we have mail a mail
account setup you can flick through your
messages kind of in this 3d like fashion
that looks really great if we go over to
messages it will show you your text
messages and again you can flick through
these it'll show you how many messages
you have
on the right side and you can just flick
your finger to get through those if you
go to internet pressing on launch
browser will launch opera mobile 9.5 if
we go to sprint music again you can
flick your finger to go to previous CDs
and the device will automatically search
your phone for music you may have
installed on a storage card now this is
a little different there's a button and
a link to sprint music store and what
it'll do is take you to Upper mobile to
a not so well a mobile optimized sprint
music store layout and from there you
can buy tracks for ninety-nine cents
there will be downloaded to your device
and that sort of thing and if we go into
pictures we can do that really nice
flick where we just flick through our
all of our pictures if we like what we
see you can tap on it it will bring it
up full screen and it has the
accelerometer of course so you can flip
it to the other way and it will follow
and then if you want to zoom in you do a
little circle and that sort of thing so
let's get out of that okay if we go to
the next one sprint TV this is a little
bit different and i'm going to show you
this i'm going to launch sprint TV by
just pressing on the center there and
this is a subscription service prices
start fifteen dollars for basic channels
you can get you can get sports channels
and a lot of different kind of
entertainment packages with sprint TV
and basically it's a rebranded version
of mobitv it probably looks familiar to
you by now and what you do is you can go
down the line some of these are live
channels while some of them are kind of
on demand type programming so if we go
to CNN that will actually be one of the
live channels and what's kind of weird
is you actually have to double tap to
select one time to select two times to
actually get it to go and I'm going to
go to CNN mobile live so you can get an
idea of of how it looks when you're
streaming TV and I'm right now I'm ovary
video with a kind of a weak signal but
it should work pretty well still let's
take a look okay here it is and if you
rotate the device we can get a full
screen view let me shake a little bit so
that it registers or screen rotation and
it goes full screen the quality is
pretty good you know it could be better
over a video and to show off the vga
screen of
yeah of the touch pro would really be
great it's not very high resolution but
it looks pretty good and it sounds
pretty good if you're on the road and
you want to get some entertainment it's
a it's a good program if you're willing
to pay for it ok so here we're back in
touch both 3d I'm going to go over to
the next one which is weather and again
in touch flo 3d you can swap your finger
to the right or to the left to move or
you can just click on an icon on the
bottom so here we are in weather and of
course you can have multiple cities here
you can flick your finger up to change
the city just like you're used to in
touch flo 3d over in settings we don't
really have anything unusual here it's
the same settings as found on the
european version finally if we end up
over in programs you know we can add our
own list of programs and that is very
flick friendly in fact the entire
operating system is flick friendly so if
we go into the programs and i'm going to
show you the unique entries and the
programs i can flick my finger or just
kind of move it slowly like so ok so
here we are in programs let's take a
look at what we have we have a full
version of Office Mobile 2007 we have
adobe reader for pdfs a camera
application let's see what else we have
clear view presentation sweet
communication manager let me just show
you what that looks like it's it's a
little bit different than it is on the
original touch pro let me just show you
the Communication Manager here a little
bit different again the yellow and black
theme is prevalent here going down the
list we have live search already
installed we have instant messenger
which is actually 0 Z messenger client
which is really good at lets you get on
live and yahoo and aim going down the
list we've mp3 trimmer we've seen that
before it lets you make ringtones from
songs that you have on your device
pocket Express it's a it's a free
program that you can get for any device
but it's actually pretty nice it allows
you to get a lot of information for free
so we have breaking news and opinions we
can go to stocks maps entertainment look
up movie times we could do weather and
get a a forecast for the area like so so
a pretty good pretty good addition
going down the list we have sprint
software store which is actually just a
internet based store it's nothing like
an application store application that
allows you to easily download
applications right to your device it's
not that great we have sprint navigation
sprint music all this proprietary sprint
stuff if you want to spend more money
okay going down the list we have the
YouTube application that we are seeing
on all the HTC touch devices and it's
really fantastic it's a great way to
look at youtube videos while you're on
the go okay so let's take a look at
settings now okay here in settings we
have a full version of microsoft voice
command belton which is really great
voice command is one of the best voice
recognition programs out there let's see
what buttons we can customize I think I
mentioned this earlier that you can only
customize the hold action of this call
start button and right now it's set to
launch voice command so if I get out of
here and I you know hold hold the button
what time is it so there you go if we go
over to system we can take a look at
some of these things we have the g
sensor calibration wizard which which we
know is on other HTC devices let's take
a look at how much memory we have now
the specifications of this version of
the touch pro are almost identical to
that of the european version let me just
show you for for comparative purposes
the eight the sprint version actually
has a little bit more program memory
which is kind of interesting we have 203
over here and 200 megabytes on the
european version and we also have a
little bit more of storage space but
only about 6 megabytes or so other than
that they both share the same processor
so they're pretty much the same inside
except for of course sprint version is
running on cdma and the european version
is on GSM let's go down the list this is
interesting we can turn threaded text
messaging off I don't know why you would
want to do that but there are some
people that are kind of bothered by
windows mobile 6.1 threaded text
messaging so you can
turn it off here and going down the list
we have the video out setting here but
we can't access it until we actually
plug in a video out cable which you have
to buy separately it's one of the good
things about the touch pro is that you
can do video out but they don't include
the cabling for that unfortunately and
that's pretty much it for for system
settings and over in in connections
nothing's really unusual here so overall
I think sprint did a really good job at
bringing the touch pro to their network
they didn't cripple it with a bunch of
software the specifications are similar
it's still a fast and powerful device
that I think a lot of business users
will really appreciate and by the way
there's still no touchflo 3d and
landscape you just get a bunch of icons
but we kind of expected that so if
you're on the sprint network and you're
looking for a really powerful windows
mobile phone then the sprint touch pro
is really a great way to go if you want
the keyboard of course you have the
option of the sprint touch of diamond
which is the same exact thing just lacks
a keyboard and of course that makes it
thinner as well so that is it on the
sprint HTC touch pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
