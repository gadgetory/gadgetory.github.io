but you want the best on a very small
budget odds are you'll gravitate toward
the life one or life one XL i'm michael
fisher with pocket now at CES 2015 with
a quick look at these just announced
smartphones as you might have divined
from the naming conventions here the
blue life one and life one XL are
actually just variations on the same
design with a 5 or 5.5 inch IPS display
depending on what you're looking for
regardless of size each one tops out at
720p the industrial design is straight
forward with restrained metallic accents
Gorilla Glass 3 and several color
options including a grey sandstone
that's essentially lifted directly from
the 1 plus 1 in terms of look and feel
and it feels really good in large part
what makes the life 1 a flagship
offering is Blues use of a Snapdragon
processor granted it's a Snapdragon 410
and it's only backed up by a gig of ram
but at 64-bit and allows for goodies
like LTE not available on the rest of
the media tech powered lineup there's
also a 13 megapixel primary camera a
5-megapixel selfie shooter microSD
expansion and the clever software skin
here isn't just a bald-faced lie yes
this is 4.4 kitkat but blue tells us the
life one will get lollipop at some point
how well all this works together is an
open question as is how well the battery
will hold up to daily use it's a choice
between 24 twenty and twenty eight
twenty milliamp hours depending on
device and those are questions we'll try
to answer if and when we give it a full
review in keeping with blues' budget
targeting the Blu live one and one XL
are due to go on sale on Amazon in March
for a very low 179 and $1.99 unlocked

Vegas and we're bringing all the mobile
apps to you at pocketnow.com and here on

Rivera
