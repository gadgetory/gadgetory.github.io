talking about high-end and luxury
smartphones but there's a whole other
side to the mobile market a more
affordable sector often dismissed as too
laden with underperforming products to
warrant much attention well this year
Motorola and Nokia have done a very good
job surprising us in this area
delivering the low-cost Moto G and the
Lumia 520 we've reviewed each one
separately now it's time to put them
side-by-side to see which one is truly
el cheapo supremo I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow and this is moto G
versus Lumia 520 now what these
smartphones are each very affordable
from most perspectives there's still a
sizable gulf in price between them here
in the States the Moto G sells for
between 179 and 199 depending on storage
option while you can get a Lumia 520
right now at the Microsoft store for
less than half that cost just $59 out
the door of course everyone wants to
save as much money as possible so the
question becomes what do you give up if
you go for the Nokia phone over the
Motorola 1 and is the sacrifice worth
the savings let's find out out of the
box probably the first thing you notice
is the difference in design philosophies
at work here as a simplified version of
the high-end Moto X the Moto G exudes a
pebble light feel with rounded contours
pleasing to the hand and also Motorola's
characteristic finger dimple on the soft
touch casing around back the 528 keeps
the soft touch paint job but appears
more like a soap dish in profile with
harsher edges up front in a more
straightforward casing that makes it
feel thicker in the hand even though
it's over a millimeter thinner the 520
also packs a much less impressive
display the 4-inch WVGA panel looking
pixelated and washed out next to
Motorola's larger 720p screen the lumia
screen is also much more reflective
meaning it's tougher to read outdoors
and internally Nokia makes a processor
sacrifice as well the 520 s dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
not as modern as the new quad-core
Snapdragon 400 in the Moto G with only
half as much RAM on the Nokia as well
pop open the back plates though and the
Lumia starts throwing punches of its own
while the battery is significantly
smaller on the 520 it's also removable
meaning road warriors can pick up some
$5 replacement packs from Amazon or Ebay
or wherever and just swap them in as
needed not so for the Moto G's embedded
power plant also the 520 offers microSD
expansion to augment its 8 gigs of
on-board storage with the Moto G you're
stuck with either 8 or 16 gigs depending
on which model you choose the
commonalities return when we return to
the basics neither phone packs 4G NFC or
anything more fancy than Bluetooth 4.0
and some multicolored battery doors
these are impressive budget devices but
remember there's still budget devices
unfortunately neither one really acts
like it on the software side now the
differences between Windows Phone 8 and
Android jelly bean soon-to-be KitKat
have been well-documented to boil it
down rather succinctly Android will be a
fit for you if you're a gmail user who
is heavily invested in Google's
ecosystem and Windows Phone will be a
better match if you're an Outlook user
but more interestingly each of these
phones is a solid performer for what
I'll call general use by that I mean
something like the daily use test I
conducted with the Moto G last week if
you're the kind of person who reads a
little bit texts a bunch keeps up with
friends on Facebook Twitter and
Instagram
shoots a snapchat photo every now and
then watches the occasional film on
Netflix or YouTube needs to catch a bus
needs to drive a car needs to pretend to
crash a car loves gaming loves music
stays organized stays in touch and
generally uses a smartphone for all the
things a smartphone can do each of these
does a splendid job on the software side
the limited system memory makes
multitasking a little
bumpier than usual on both but overall
responsiveness is spot-on and each
device delivers taking the phones out of
the lab for some testing revealed much
of the same parity in terms of
capabilities callers came through clear
as a bell on att's Network here in
Greater Boston with both phones
delivering excellent sound both via
earpiece and speakerphone callers said
the Lumia was a bit clearer
while the Moto G offered better noise
cancellation firing up the five
megapixel cameras reminds us of the
low-end nature of these smartphones
neither has what you might call knock
out features with the bare minimum in
terms of shooting options each is
expandable with third-party software
lenses or apps but shooting with default
settings reveals that the cameras are
capable of beautiful color and depth in
some shooting situations and milky noisy
output in others side-by-side and
moderate lighting they're comparable
shooters but get them into low light in
the Lumia is the winner relatively
speaking
also we prefer shooting with the Lumia
thanks to its two-stage hardware key
which makes focusing easier so while
we'd naturally rather have a high-end
camera phone with us if we had to choose
one of these four optics we'd pick
Nokia's product even given Motorola's
advantage of the LED flash that might
seem like a slam dunk for Nokia in the
outdoorsman Department but hold your
horses there lumberjack the Moto G
features Motorola's water-resistant nano
coating meaning it can hold up to
nature's splashes and even though the
warranty probably won't cover it it'll
even hold up to a shower even if you get
it in the spray a little that's in
direct opposition to Nokia's own user
manuals advice for the 520 so phone
abusers take heed the Moto G may be the
better fit for you compromises aside all
this leaves us with a pair of phones
that have no business being priced as
low as they are the Lumia is outstanding
voice quality expandability and superior
camera will appeal to some while the
Moto G is better display
a more robust ecosystem and all-weather
ruggedness will make it worth the
premium to others we think the Lumia 520
is probably the better value for someone
free to jump between platforms but
really that's just a function of its
absurdly low price point both will make
you reconsider what a budget phone is
capable of and each is an absolute steal
if you live in the right market that's
going to do it for this one folks we
hope we've made your budget phone
shopping a little easier this holiday
season if you want more details on each
of these phones don't forget we have a
full review of the Lumia 521 that's the
t-mobile version of the 520 and the
motorola moto G full reviews of each at
