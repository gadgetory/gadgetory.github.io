live and now we need to figure out how
to make fun oh I've got it I've got some
embed code oh no I got a URL ah ok just
then better than and whatever in the
back I'm going yeah I'm just gonna put
it on that on the site and we'll put on
a post we are such amateurs ma'am so
supposedly nouns am i understanding
we're supposed to look at the camera and
actually talk I'm yeah I say hi to
everybody who's watching and most likely
everybody's watching out there and
making fun of us as well let's see let
me see if I can find ourselves somewhere
here yeah no tell me you wanna you want
to see this broadcast yeah I want to see
I want to see this broadcast and make
fun of myself honey you wanted yours on
I wish I brought my cigar um smoking's
bad for you kids well anyway so we're
definitely let me do a little bit of an
introduction you're just so it has some
structure and then we'll throw a
structure out the window so we're doing
this just as an experiment our hope is
that we get some people on here to ask
us phone questions totally informal just
a Friday afternoon you know three
friends just just hanging out and you
know we would probably be doing this
anyway but this time we decided to
record it so um for posterity yes for
the and for those people that have
always complained that they want a video
podcast which we will not do this is
like the closes that will get closest
but we might have something different I
really AM you know I I was you remember
I was really into starting a video
podcast and then tony was like
completely against it like and it is
roughly agreed agreed agreed i really
have no complaints about that but really
Tony aside from the fact that we are
completely ugly to the rest of the
outside world what what other reason
then why don't you want the living
that's not enough yeah it's not enough i
mean a valid reason come on for for
starters we do stuff which others
shouldn't do it look just look at me oh
we've got iced tea and a transit packet
cigar that makes smoke actually it's a
wafer which is the
with chocolate hmm well let's prove it
good thing I'm l ike a bite off at the
end with the ashes this one right yeah
yeah no way okay so the question is are
where are we actually broadcasting
because I see us featured in the channel
can you see us random there is a link
that I've posted to arrow specials vdf
and here I'll put it in the chat all
right I see yep there we are whoa yeah
it's live if you have the link is there
a possibility to see actually how many
viewers we have or or if there's anybody
watching decide from us you know we look
at this youtube link you should but you
can't i'm a total amateur when it comes
to we are such admirable really source
speaking of amateur before you came on
Tony I was telling hi Maeve that I I did
something strange recently I am I bought
this and I'm using it as my daily driver
it's the AT&amp;amp;T oh my god that I'm still
gonna take this over once you get rid of
it I'm never getting rid of this that's
a night one okay so i really want to
understand i mean you guys both Michael
and you praise that phone so much but
I've never really used it or held it or
anything so you neither what what is it
I mean I didn't like the Nexus 4 i mean
i remember you showed it to me I was
like that's exactly the point that oh
we've got someone joining us and then
we'll talk about the optimus G welcome
whoever it is his name well he's not
here he was here and you okay so let's
talk about the optimus G okay after this
JP the optimus G is like the Nexus 4 but
it doesn't have the touch sensitivity
issue and and we have a new avatar--
hello sir i cannot I'm not war my lady
ne ed to stop drinking Tony I think
youse better avatars I think it's a guy
when we only hear him I don't want to be
rude the ya-ya avatar is a look at me
anyway so the nexus 4 is awesome it's
fast it's got the
for pro 2 gigs of ram it's got a great
screen but the optimus G fixes what's
wrong with the the nexus 4 except it's
not stock Android but LG has done a
killer job with the software and it's
running Android 4.1 kind of sucks but
it's it's fast it's got the s4 pro like
I said and and also another thing is
that you don't get the bottom row of
buttons here so you get the full 1280
thing in 768 where's on the nexus 4 it's
like a little bit less than that so I'm
gonna plug it back in I don't know I you
know I we've tested so many LG phones
with Tony at mwc in it which was it the
optimus 4x and the guy was like oh and
look I love to play these games in the
phone was like the guy was moving his
fingers around and the phone was like a
kilometer behind as you remember
although the DL 5 and the l7 oh no I
remember the start we started filming we
started filming the l7 and then Tony was
like eff it and that is this this is me
this is crap just let's go let's get out
of here this is what the LG has had some
problems with a like they figured out
something with this Optimus G it's
really weird I mean they figured it out
so much the google made them they're the
partner for the nexus 4 so agreed but
still I mean Ellie's not going software
wait what what how did you read the link
to our hangout excuse me did you tweet
the link to our hangout oh yeah I've
invited like 20 people so far but
apparently people think that it's
happening later and they're like it work
at school excuse me do you have the
porridge no no but I do have coffee the
best coffee oh sweet mother any I know I
know it looks really good trying to roar
I got it why are you the devil yeah yeah
I don't know I just I like the look of
these horns by the way do I have any
other accessories aside from the hair on
my head and my cigar as well you don't
need any more accessories than the fact
that you're actually wearing your hair
this time
is something you guys controller I
control because I can't see any buttons
here for horns or for classical go to
the left and get this kick out of my
face go to where it says google effects
and you know there there's some really
nice heads of hair there there's a bozo
10 here's here's something for me Oh
Marilyn I'm just given doesn't stop
looks good let's give this one a try all
right this is this is old people finding
out new stuff I'm serious man you guys
was easily cool chain us up he lets us
plexus yeah he left them there oh there
this one so check this out this is
Samsung's 840 pro SSD but look at the
chamfered edge like Samsung is kicking
ass with everything look at that it's an
SSD that sits inside you could be r you
never see again but it's got this like
iphone like chamfered edge around that
the entrance is crazy that's nice you
want to see that you don't want to bury
that inside your computer now twith the
SATA cable that's good sit how much do
you pay for that I've been trying to get
an external SSD but they're just crazy
expensive yeah I guess if you if you
look at it like compared to a hard drive
but um this was like in the high to
hundreds and it's 256 gigabytes and its
really i think pretty top up their
performance so um well you can just buy
a hard drive enclosure and use it yeah
or you can just dangle it in your case
or just it's a 2.5 inch so it can go
into your laptop or um if you guessed up
interesting I don't know I one thing
that i have really like is I had totally
underestimated USB 3.1 till we went to
see us because this this hard drive that
I that I bought and connected to the
macbook pro just rocks I mean I I
actually keep no footage no raw footage
anymore in the macbook pro I keep
everything in the hard drive and I can
actually just do everything from the
hard drive as if it was a local part of
the of the computer and it's not calling
anyways I'm gonna hang out yeah somebody
somebody's been calling me from the same
number but I've told them I'm busy so
anyways I I think at least media is
going there I would really love to try
Thunderbolt but then the adapter for
Thunderbolt is like a hundred dollars
just for the adapter and then the hard
drive is another money hmm and that
doesn't include the wire so it's a
hundred dollars for the adapter + like
forty dollars for the wire plus the hard
drive that's not cool that's not cool at
all and you get twice the speed I mean
sure but I usb3 when I was working
really good for me man it's so funny
because USB one was huge and then us two
point O was massive and then usb3 like I
think is the transition with with two
wireless people don't like it as much
but it's it's good to hear that it's
actually significantly better you know
there will be a follow up at us before
even higher speeds that's interesting I
don't know there should be I mean you
think about a USB has been around for
what it's 50 years already but the bus
was so well designed that there's really
no need to change it they could probably
just make the kick the connector smaller
or something right I guess I probably my
only issue with USB 3 is for example in
this macbook pro you can't choose um it
only has USB 3 and so there are certain
adapters that really don't work with the
computer at all like for example i had
my my my data modem that doesn't work
with the computer at all at all it's not
even detected let me post a link to our
facebook page with this ongoing hang out
I did that brown you did really hell
yeah that's nice you think of everything
that I know fo really you're like you
ain't no fool you're using those gargles
back come on riff okay how about this
hmm that's fitting you're the King never
looked better how do i get rid of it
click on it again nice okay so you are
going to make your daily driver the
optimus g
yes amazing I find it amazing I mean I I
would have never thought that about LG a
year ago exactly a year ago I was like
LG is such a waste of time the thing is
that as I said yesterday on a podcast I
think I don't think there were two
people on this team that were advocating
for for LG I think I was among the only
ones you want to be only one actually
yeah he has in his seven which was like
five years ago yeah and people said that
the build quality is bad that there is
no support for the phones but now with
the Optimus G and with the nexus for LG
proved that they are right there I mean
as far as I'm concerned I have not yet
touched the nexus 4 because of
availability issues but from what i see
it is better built than some other
android phones made my companies which
are better regarded than LG yeah and if
they continue to do that and to follow
on this trend then i think they will be
a player this year not if they keep
doing stuff like oh oh yeah that oh god
the winner by midnight remember do you
remember WC oh god I was like what am I
supposed to do with this I'm staying
side awake be do you guys know that
there will be a LG 5.5 inch phablet on
display this year at MVC oh please now
look here maybe let me put it let me put
it to you in perspective there was an LG
Optimus view to at CES yeah to and we
were like uh we save us huh you see the
view to se yes I I didn't really see it
but I remember you guys just came up and
we're like should we I was like forget
it yeah that wasn't such a good idea
maybe because you get four by four yes
but you you haven't you haven't got any
software updates to correct the spelling
mistakes permanent I haven't turned this
on since today and it's going on if the
problem is is just so wide like it this
misses the point of a mobile device like
I won't even want to put us on my coffee
table and yes and it's so weird because
i was so turned off by this phone
because of the interface you almost look
like this go ahead you met you make that
ipad mini look small man yeah but they
deal with
hmm man you met you make that ipad mini
look small you can calm it for sure
seriously it's just so different than
the optimus G it's it's remarkable I
don't know my opinion of phablets have
changed I still using the note 2 I I
can't put this thing down are you know
okay so here's the deal I am really
disappointed at the fact that this is
really just the galaxy s3 with a bigger
display meaning there's really nothing
different if this were debating teaser
processor in a slightly faster processor
yes but if this were a 1080p display
then it would make sense because you
could have more icons on the screen and
for example you you did the best out of
the first generation node Brandon with
rooting and installing I don't know what
rom was it that allowed you to change
the pixel density to change the pixel
density exactly so I feel that the only
thing that i would change about this
note it is seriously the fact that you
know it's really just the gs3 with a
bigger display but that said you know
even though the S Pen is really not
something that I use a lot here's the
reason why why I like it I like the
multiscreen thing I really liked it a
lot I use it a lot what do you use it
for I'm playing videos at the top and
and got either looking at Twitter or
eating an onion at the bottom yeah let
me in that scenario where there's a
video on the top and there's email in
the bottom what does the keyboard look
like when it's on the boat it's terrible
you can't work all right I really I
really haven't let me get let me look
for something I really haven't tried it
with the Samsung keyboard I immediately
installed swiftkey on any Android phone
that I could get but let me try to get
by the way I think I just did while
you're doing that I think I invited
people the wrong way because I've had
gone in and I've invited like 25 people
by now but it doesn't keep track of them
which makes me think that you can only
add them at one time so actually wanna
do that now I'm going to add them all in
one turns though that they need to be in
our circles or at least and I think so I
don't think so I wasn't able to see your
guys video because this account didn't
have you guys in my circles it's cuz
it's nyoka
oh well that might be the case but I'm
trying just in case there's a there's a
bug in the matrix okay so see here goes
a CS behind the scenes which will take
forever cuz i have Wi-Fi turned off
right now all right hold on a second
I've got this green earth say yours I
can't I can't see hold on i'm in the
ayat and white screen okay he just
minimized you guys I just I just
minimize your face mofo Oh interesting
yes what I did it's a total uh okay
almost done let me see on Twitter's a
couple minutes on that okay uh hang out
okay I step all right I should do it now
we just sit now we just sit back and
listen and let the let Brandon do his
magic uh yeah Simon let's see what you
got okay hold on I lost I lost something
here so Twitter works fired because it
creates a pop up over the window like if
I if I'm playing a video at the top and
then I want to post a tweet it'll throw
the pop up on top and show me the full
keyboard got it and still play the play
the video at the top but then let me try
to get rid of okay so I want to do this
I want to keep the video and I want to
pull whatsapp and whatsapp let's see if
I can see here's the video so here I
have whatsapp at the bottom but I can't
see anything that I'm typing oh right
because the keyboard covers it exactly
hmm that's cray so the good thing is you
can actually resize but then again it
becomes pointless because you can't see
the videos so if there were much better
pixel density then this would not be an
issue or a higher resolution yeah the
other thing about Swifty's you can
actually resize the keyboard but you
have to do it every turn so that's when
it becomes point that's annoying when
they increase the resolution oh god no I
was about to say that you cannot write
an email while you're watching a video
on youtube not really but but but but
like in memorial nah mobilizers and CES
navigating while being on Twitter that
was cool
that was cool um but what manufacturers
are doing when they increase the screen
resolution they're not increasing the
pixel density they're just making the
icons and stuff have more resolution
like apples done with the ipad 2 versus
the ipad freiburg yeah what they what
they do is is is quadruple the pixels if
that that make the the icons and
actually they they they duplicate the
size of the icons it's like this Retina
Display MacBook Pro is a real you know
aside from everything that's cool about
it what really annoys me is when I want
to take a screenshot so for example if I
if I want to take a 1280 by 720
screenshot for you to book for one of
our videos it will tell me that it's
1280 by 720 but it's actually only
hypothetical because that if that
whatever it gives you have to multiply
that by 4 so once you once you export
the image into Photoshop it you get this
huge image that you have to resize drink
yeah so i don't know i think i think
that they I think manufacturers really
have to figure out what they want for
retina display graphics because sadly we
are still though I said in so many so
much time ago when the ipad came out the
third-generation ipad I mean the
internet is really not ready for retina
display graphics very few websites are
off to my sport it's true if I want to
take it so what's the point about having
a retina display on this macbook pro if
every website that i visit almost ninety
percent of the websites that i visit
look jagged because only the text looks
good intent yeah hey hey Tony what phone
you're using is i'm using the iphone 5
and the drumroll do I have drumroll here
ah of course you're using that quinta
we're gonna call you captain to phone
speaking of Captain do phones where's
Michael Fisher get him on you he should
be having breakfast with one of his
colleagues so I'm not sure we will be
able to reach him but I'm gonna try let
me just shoot him a short game reckless
isn't it like 1pm in the United States
right yeah maybe he cannot join over his
phone all right but I don't think you
can do a hangout on a Lumia 920 no
that's a low blow Hey oh he's got most
probably he's got you know to me hey hey
hey we got someone nicely there somebody
wants to see us yeah I just wanted to
say hi Saudi invited from the facebook
and signed it so I just want you to see
all guys and tell you that um the

it's lagging at times or is project
butter and jelly bean doing its job as
it should know it's really snappy uh I
can I can show you if you can see this
yellow first try yeah we can see that
sort of stopped off Israel let me see
his camera i'll just select just select
this icon oh I'm such a noob uh yeah
you're an amateur you're a mature man
look at that that is amazing yeah it's
it's running you know it's a bear phone
only only jelly bean from access and

getting back to the hd2 because i'm
really interested how much time does it
take you to boot up the phone if you
shut it out out overnight so a cold boot
into android hmm hold on Proxima or

I haven't raised there look at that III
think that's faster than my fricking 8x
that's fast seriously do you guys
remember to calm manager Oh God oh you
know I was so tempted and I'm not gonna
lie to guys like like oh like a month
ago I was really tempted to buy one of
those phones on amazon and the only
reason why I didn't you know it's just
the relic just something to keep but the
only reason why I didn't is because it
doesn't have any 3g band so I would
seriously not use it at all hey hi my
check out the reason why you're not why
you did not get this phone check out the
icons at the top I told you the radios
busted Oh true true oh yeah yeah yeah so
the problem is that phone doesn't have
3g in my country so you know if i'm
gonna be using that phone rocking edge
it's not worth it not if I can go tablet
no actually guys I don't have an 8th 1st
up to be honest and of yeah i'm just
using ps3 for to play my media I listen
to music like for four hours per day
five on my headphones on a lunch break
love and that's that that's the main
purpose and the rest are emails chat
clients hang out with my friends and
multitasking multi-window support on gs3
is really great huge hobbies yeah yeah
yeah I got the update it's official
over-the-air updates we are my courier
they have been really really really fast
in Serbia for pushing helping it out
like one month after I read about you on
the naughty nice and you know you make a
really compelling point about tablets um
how often do you use your tablet Tony
for example because I love my ipad mini
but I honestly used it very little I use
it every day
I use it every day and for like two or
three hours per day really when I wake
up in the morning well I have breakfast
or while I drinking my coffee my tablet
is my computer obviously I cannot bring
my huge computer to the kitchen then
again don't worry if I go have lunch or
something outsider at the fast-food the
tablet comes with me and then of course
every night before going to sleep the
tablet comes with me into bed which is
very lame but yes it comes to me
replying you like and you hug him
everything and you're like no and then I
just throw it throw it and it lands
somewhere in the in the in the room and
sometimes in the evening or at night
when i wake up to go drink some water i
usually step on it yeah I I think that's
the prob what about you Brandon it's
slowly dim for me actually I hope my
wife's not watching because I'm don't
when I'm hanging out with my wife at
night and we're like you know watching
TV or whatever it's really not
acceptable that I would take out my
laptop and start working away but if I
take out my tablet then it's like I'm
not really working I'm just browsing the
web you know but I'm sitting with my
psychic yeah I'm the guy with the
special offensive Monaco brings out the
emoticons really really really I I don't
know for me I think you've made a point
Tony when I had the imac i would use the
ipad more but you know but the thing is
i had the imac i had the macbook air and
i had laid the ipad so I got rid of the
macbook care i got rid of the imac and
now all i have is the macbook pro and
that i don't know it's just it's merely
i literally you guys difference true i
can't bring this to bed but i can bring
this to Ben and I sold my full-sized
iPad for the mini hey Marco what's your
next phone I don't know probably

well Andrew welcome Andrew we can't see
your face it's all shadows you would
pick a shadowy figure your back lit yeah
you have to move the camera from the
window turn around turn on and I can't
hear you but anyways here's thank you
for joining us Andrew what phone do you
use iphone iphone which one is that no
audio from missing i cannot hear you
maybe there's your microphone might be
muted or something like that yay hold on
you then somebody somebody take the
keyboard away from Tony yes please do so
it's brain control where you where you
from Andrew Oh Pennsylvania me too where
are you from in Pennsylvania oh I love
in their town not too far i'm near
philly oh yeah it's not far at all not
far off so you use the iphone
interesting why to use the iphone oh
well i should i've been an Android user
for a couple years now and i decided to
switch over to a little while was it was
it hard to make the transition like did
you have to rebuy apps no not really
cause everything on android astray
that's true doesn't it anyway
interesting interview that I know that
actually switches from Android to get an
iphone i was about to say exactly that
yeah it's rare that a cute it's usually
the other way around people get an
iphone and then they switch to android
yeah i'll be going back to enjoy pretty
soon but you know i wanted to try it out
is how is it so far it's good i mean
there's a lot of apps that I'm used to
being free but i'd pay for and that's
kind of annoying yeah yeah it's you
gotta make the adjustment yeah how about
you
margot have you ever tried an iphone oh
well let me put it this way i'm not a
big fan of apple products uh but let's
just keep it that way okay all right all
right and what's happened to you use
Andrew I don't have any tablet right now
nice I mean I'm use well did you get ah
Polly their nexus 10 into the ipad 4 hmm
interesting we're all moving into
smaller tablets but then usually first
adopters would prefer to go for the
bigger tablets for some reason even if
the smaller ones are cheaper that's
interesting yeah mark is back yeah
Arabic huh my hands are here finishing
touch their products they don't consume
will help the deer hunter you know yeah
yeah um ok we think it's really feels
good in home I front of my friends and
above average phone but you know I'm
kind of Korea Ivan fan yeah yeah and i
think you know android is like the
windows mobile of these times anyway so
yeah you're pretty much a bad yeah
you're pretty much in your territory hot
guys it's just that i'm personally not
much into 2 i'm uh i don't like that
kind of talk you know that Apple housing
really and he froze and we're frozen can
you guys hear me yes mar get up or soda
so going back to what i was telling you
guys Tony I can't believe you freakin
paid 25 bucks for everything nice okay I
pay seventy five dollars for cable plus
the internet MN I paid $25 for the data
plan of each of the phones that I use
and I carry two phones so I pretty much
pay hundred twenty-five bucks to be
connected and I get like the crappiest
connection on the planet and then you
get like the best connection on together
for 25 that's I leave that come on hey
you
don't hate the player hey are you are
you drawing your galaxy note 2 at the
camera guys before before I get a refill
on this I have a question for Marco
because Marco and I are very close
actually if I go dry of two hours I'm in
Serbia so Marco all right have you ever
had the opportunity to play with a
Windows RT tablet because i have only
managed to do that at Eva no actually no
and I wasn't even looking at the
opportunity to do are they are the
younger market sure you have huge
retailers or carriers as they're an
offer no well you can't really go into
shopping mall here and just buy one or
sisters or or go to a carrier store and
buy RT tablet they don't have such thing
bring some mana not much we go stuffed
yeah yeah most how many windows RT
tablets are in the market I mean do we
have like three or four currently being
sold I think this is just a surface yeah
yeah i think you know i am truly i think
you're right i think it's the surface
and then they've got the achieve smelly
tee you ready at teeth get cancelled
actually i know they're actually selling
it on AT&amp;amp;T that the smart pc no it's
been it's been the RT running when a
samsung tablet is not going to go to the
state so it's just canceled in the
States but not everyone else but we we
actually saw the AT&amp;amp;T version on at CES
remember Brandon yeah yeah we saw it I I
know they sell it on AT&amp;amp;T I've actually
even speed it on on the website so i
don't know i think it's that a TV smart
pc and then it's the Microsoft Surface
that I terribly hate don't ask me why
yeah hey guys I don't mean to cut this
short but we wanted to do this for about
an hour we're gonna have to wrap it up
here um does anyone have had last two or
three minutes anyone have anything to
say to do this video you can like dance
around and Rick you
ah well whenever I know hang out just to
say say again two guys that you can
stroke and I'll be following you every
day you know twitterfacebook yours
websites pocketnow.com and brothers
reviews for 38 years over thee and now
when you have all these guys know
Michael Fisher and you guys here and
everyone I'm written a lot about it and
just oh yeah we lost him beef and these
guys thank you what about you Andrew any
final thoughts make us feel good I've
been watching you guys for a while but
I've been working a lot so it's kind of
hard to follow up you know yeah sure
sounds but keep up the good work thanks
madam thanks for thanks for joining us I
keep doing this after the buzz oh I
enjoy watching them oh well have will
have one next week so stay gonna be just
for you will have one next week alright
next week we have the windows phone 8x
and I think that's not much like yeah I
had to fish around so I'm gonna enjoy
that one yeah so I've actually got it
i'm gonna be doing it and it's gonna be
a really interesting one because it's
actually my first Windows Phone 8 and
not really happy they have been the boss
wore off they haven't improved the app
selection at all happening exactly i
mean and everybody's like oh the app
selection isn't everything and I'm like
well yes it is it with the phone I'm all
right in this day and age it is very
important I mean if this were like five
years ago I'd understand that point but
right now that's not the way things work
well most phones didn't even have an app
store five years ago exactly exactly but
the problem is once you taste I mean if
once you taste the the beauty of having
apps it's it's really hard to go back
its crew that's apples fall I think it
is I think it I think it really is I
mean and think about I mean as I've
exist that ever since the palm days and
everything I mean it's it's not
something new i just i think apple just
figured out a way to distribute
better and people can really access it I
mean the only be only to be honest with
you guys the only reason why I'm really
fond of the iphone is because I hear a
song i like it and i buy it it happens
right there instantly and you doing here
son I like and I Spotify it well I do
that now I do that now but but the point
is you know whenever you're with a
windows phone and you have to actually
choose or you get an alternate option
for a third party app that really seems
you're like whatever all right well I'm
gonna I'm gonna boot off thank you
thanks again Andrew an open so you thank
you pleasure all right so guys I have
some news first or what I see are we
stuck here or is it my connection that
is stuck or what's going on I see four
