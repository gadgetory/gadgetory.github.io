the Samsung Galaxy S and no you're not
on the wrong video just stay with me it
took the first edition galaxy s and told
Samsung that had wanted to add a slide
out qwerty keyboard and that's how we
got the first iteration of the epic then
when the galaxy s2 came around sprint
ditched the keyboard and added a whole
bunch of words to the name with
motorola's photon line sprint is done
just the opposite it started with a
simple slab with the first photon and
for its sequel it has added a slide-out
QWERTY keyboard as well as LTE support
and a few other things how does this new
phone fair on the whole well let's find
out I'm Michael Fisher this is
pocketnow.com and this is our full
review of the motorola Photon Q 4G LTE
for Sprint let's get to it
at first glance the new photon seems
almost identical to its predecessor with
its jet black body and motorola's
trademark cut corners that illusion
vanishes when you pick up the device
though I'm compared to other modern
smartphones it's very thick at thirteen
point seven millimeters but for good
reason there's a slide-out surprise
under there that we'll get to in a
second but given that added bulk the new
photon feels lighter than you'd expect
in the hand in fact before I realized
that the 1785 milliamp hour battery was
embedded I thought I was handling a
device without a battery inside it's not
featherweight at 170 grams but it's
certainly lighter than it looks up front
here the display is a 4.3 inch 540 x 960
TFT LCD with motorola's color boost
technology and displays images at around
256 pixels per inch even though it's not
an HD display it looks gorgeous with
brilliant colors and for an LCD at least
relatively deep blacks Motorola doesn't
call out the glass covering it as
Gorilla Glass exactly but it does say
it's scratch resistant it's also quite a
fingerprint magnet more so than on other
devices we've tested above it is the 1.3
megapixel front facing camera which
shoots in 720p HD and beside that above
the Motorola branding is the earpiece
which also contains a large LED
notification bar that for me only lit up
when the device was charging on the
right side here are the hardware camera
key and the volume controls on the back
is the lens for the 8 megapixel camera
that shoots 1080p video with an LED
flash right next door a speaker fill
speakerphone grill down below and though
there's no mention in Motorola's
literature of crystal talk noise
reduction there is a noise cancelling
microphone up here in the corner on the
left hand side not much to see except a
micro USB port and HDMI out there's
nothing going on the bottom here and up
top a headphone jack and the center
mounted standby and power button which
is very easy to access with a finger
very easy to get used to the real fun
part comes when you slide the unit open
to reveal that 5 rope
the keys are LED backlit with adjustable
side lighting and Motorola says the keys
themselves are laser-cut I don't know if
you'd be able to tell that or what
benefits that provides but it sounds
cool more important is the keys click
and travel typing on the photon ques
keyboard is luxurious you've got nothing
but space on this wide board and each
key delivers a satisfying little click
when pressed the dedicated number row up
top really really helps with input speed
in all it's one of the best physical
keyboards we've ever used packed into a
device that feels equally comfortable in
either one handed or two-handed usage
scenarios Sprint customers considering
this device will want to know how well
it's going to hold up over the course of
a two-year contract so let's talk Ross
specs for a second the phone is powered
by a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor running at 1.5 gigahertz
backed up by a gig of ram and eight gigs
of on-board storage with the usual
microSD expansion up to an additional 32
gigabytes the phone also brings
something interesting to sprint
customers on the radio side in addition
to domestic support for CDMA and LTE
that gives the device part of its name
the Photon Q also offers international
roaming with quad-band GSM and HSPA
radios that said there's no user
accessible sim it's embedded just like
the battery so it's not quite as useful
if you want the freedom to use it on any
overseas carrier you wish aside from
that radios include the usual Bluetooth
40 Wi-Fi b/g/n and support for NFC the
last time we checked out Motorola
hardware was on the atrix HD which we
liked a lot on the hardware side but the
software left us wanting more so how
does the new photon stack up in the
software department in short not too
shabby Motorola's running their sneaky
phantom skin that's not really a skin on
top of Android 44 it's subtle but it's
definitely there and most of its tweaks
are very useful like the unlock to app
shortcuts on the lock screen and the
motorola bubbles widget that we've
talked about before and which we like a
lot there's also the pop-up preview
windows for some stock apps
which helped out in a pinch and also
Motorola's Smart Actions suite which
allows you to set rules for different
battery saving conditions location-aware
scenarios and so forth there's also
support throughout the OS for landscape
based orientation when the keyboard is
deployed that's something we saw a lot
on early build of Android like on the
HTC g1 and the original motorola droid
and it's really nice to see it again
here swapping between landscape and
portrait still takes a few beats and the
phone is sometimes a little slow to wake
up there are drop frames and animations
especially when you call up the launcher
but overall performance is perfectly
acceptable if you're not a UI
perfectionist in the real world the new
photon performed as well as it could
don't get me wrong that's not the knock
on the device the device is solid but
it's really hamstrung by Sprint's slow
evdo network testing the photon 4G LTE
was an exercise in frustration in the
Greater Boston area where download
speeds never got above 600 kilobits per
second I don't know that I know that
doesn't sound too bad for 3g but speeds
even close to that only happened a
handful of times most of our time with
the new photon was spent in the 100 to
200 kilobits per second range with very
high ping times sometimes network
communication issues were so bad that
speed test wouldn't even run in a
practical sense that made regular use of
apps like pandora spotify and instagram
painful if not impossible already laggy
apps like facebook timed out often and
sending email attachments was hit or
miss it's a stark reminder of just how
far behind Sprint is in network
build-out and how quickly their LTE
build needs to happen thankfully on the
voice side things couldn't be better
Motorola has a history of providing some
of the best voice calling in the
business and that continues to be true
here speakerphone performance was okay
but as usual we wish it could have been
louder sadly another Motorola staple is
an underwhelming camera and we found
that to be true here as well it's
certainly isn't one of the worst cameras
we've tested but it has the same
problems we see on a lot of mobile
phones where you're taking photos that
include regions of both light and dark
other phones like the galaxy s3 and the
HTC droid incredible 4G LTE compensate
for this by including an HDR option in
the camera software sadly Motorola does
not in good light the camera does pretty
well but in lower light situations
there's not much good to say here and if
you happen to be listening to music on
the Photon Q via headphones which sounds
good by the way while taking pictures
congratulations you've found an audio
bug that's quite annoying the music will
for a split second come out the speaker
phone as the phone makes the shutter
sound finally while the hardware camera
button is nice it doesn't wake the phone
up from sleep it doesn't feature half
press to focus and is accordingly so
useless we almost forgot it was there
the battery powering all this actually
does pretty well quite a surprise given
its relatively meager milliamp hour
rating I was able to eke out about 14
hours on one charge with moderate to
heavy use and the power saving rules I
set up in Smart Actions definitely
helped a lot when I turn power saving
off performance plummeted there's no
telling how this performance will fare
once the device is using LTE but on 3G
battery life on the photon should be
good to excellent for most users so if
you're on Sprint or thinking of moving
over to sprint and you want a device
with a slide-out hardware qwerty
keyboard should you get the new photon
maybe if you're in a big city that's not
getting LTE anytime soon maybe
reconsider if though you're constantly
going to be on Wi-Fi or if Sprint has
announced that your market will be
getting LTE in the near future
absolutely if you live in an area where
sprint's 3g coverage and data speeds are
good then also yes go for it I mean your
other options for a keyboard packing
device on sprint are a handful of data
to Android devices some blackberries and
high-end Android phones from two years
ago but it's not just that the
alternatives are kind of weak this is a
really really solid phone
and it's backed up by modern software
that might lag occasionally but in
otherwise does its job quite well the
keyboard is great the battery life is
great and it's available at sprint com
for 1 99 99 on a contract not the
cheapest phone around but we think it's
worth the price we give the motorola
Photon Q 4G LTE an 8 out of 10 it's
going to do it for me i'm michael fisher
