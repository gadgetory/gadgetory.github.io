with this ultimate guide to switch to
android apples 2014 lineup is hinting a
larger more professional iPad and
believe it or not they're already
talking about the LG G flex equal I'm
primary data and as much as I try to
love mondays there is just no way for me
to budge but this is out daily
letters they offered some official and
non-official news as we've got the HTC
One golden edition being announced and
not the gold phone that we talked about
recently there's actually a golden
aluminium HTC one which we wonder why
they're announcing now when they're
supposed to have their sequel coming up
very soon and speaking of their sequel
we've already got some leaked
specifications of the HTC codename m8
you remember the HTC one was the m7 so
obviously we are expecting this to be
their next flagship but it's got a
snapdragon 800 processor so it should be
that way if you want the full
specifications link down below now let's
talk about Apple as we've got some more
leaks of their 2014 lineup and we are
hinting two things number one is a
bigger more professional iPad which
apparently will be getting by march
though we still don't know if this
tablet will still be running their phone
operating system or if they're going to
take the leap of making this device run
OS 10 it's gonna be kind of a hard
fetched rumor here we still don't know
what to expect but other than that we
are expecting the iWatch which is now
being hurt again though apparently we
will be getting this device at WWDC in
june which kind of makes sense since
obviously we're getting a new version of
iOS running this watch apparently we'll
see what that goes and for those of you
dreaming of Windows 8 merging with
Windows RT as we were expecting with 8.1
Willa Microsoft executive just shot that
down her name is Julie larson-green and
according to her there is a market for
underpowered tablets which we know about
that I mean we've got the android
tablets and ipad to prove that but still
you gotta wonder why the surface 2 and
surface did not sell it all let's see
how that goes and for those of you
interested in the LG G flex which we're
already working on it's kind of
interesting and seems the company is
already working on their sequel even
though they haven't really launched the
first phone and apparently what this
phone will do is actually been 90
degrees thanks to their been the
foldable battery technology I just don't
understand what the usage scenario would
be for me to be able to fold the phone
and actually do it for any particular
reason links in the description for
details and leave us a comment why would
you want to bend your phone and finally
for the interesting news of the day
Google's Eric Schmidt has just decided
to take a stab at apple with their
iphone which is interesting since he was
a member of the board when the first
generation iphone was announced and as
it turns out he says that a lot of his
friends are switching from iphones to
android with the new devices coming out
and he feels that he should tell people
how to switch seamlessly which is great
it's fabulous but that leads you to the
question of the day out of your friends
how many of them have been switching
from iPhones to Android devices because
in my particular case it's actually been
the other way around most of my friends
actually started either with a
blackberry or galaxy phone and they're
now switching to iPhones after the 5s
yeah I don't understand that either but
leave us a comment down below what's
your case scenario and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
