pocket now as to whether the Moto Z
design truly represents a modular phone
when we know devices like project ara
are likely to start shipping the
developers in a couple of months we'll
leave that question up to you in a
viewer poll but what we found from using
the moto mods for a week this is one of
the best consumer facing accessory
systems we've yet seen for a phone not
only does this work well but Motorola
was able to get a trio of compelling
options ready in time to launch with the
phone which is what we'll be checking
out today the JBL speaker dock the
lenovo inste share projector and the
Tumey battery case we had some time to
play with pre-release moto mods at
Lenovo tech world and not a lot has
changed in the implementation moving to
a release product the bottom back panel
of a moto Z is adorned with 16 pins a
dimple and this strip which works with
the pins and magnets on each mod to snap
the two together and launch applicable
services at their most basic we'll see a
collection of Moto mod simply to
customize the look of the phone's
backplate moto includes a wood panel mod
with each phone to get you started
given how busy and techie the Moto mod
system is using at least a style mod
will likely be the norm for most folks
it helps tidy up the look of the phone
and you'll probably want to keep all
those pins clean now style is all well
and good but we want to see some
function with that form and these mods
deliver that in spades the most basic
concern people face is runtime there
will be a variety of battery mods to
choose from but the to me was sent along
in our reviewer kit this moto mod adds
an additional 20 200 milli amp power
capacity which is used before draining
the phone's built-in battery it's sweet
delicious overkill to pair it up with AC
force which already has a sizable 3500
milliamp hour battery on our first
Saturday fielding a couple calls playing
about an hour of Marvel future fight and
keeping up with Twitter and Instagram I
never touched the phone's actual battery
a light 12 hour day was handled
completely by the to me it's also pretty
neat that we get power indicators to see
if each Moto mod is charged without
having to pop it on to the phone one
small note though this combo does run
warm when used aggressively after an
hour of gameplay the phone was not
throttling but it wasn't the most
comfortable
to hold of course sometimes just want to
set your phone down and jam some audio
where the JBL comes in to supercharge
the phone's audio playback this mod just
about triples the girth of the z-force
but include substantially larger
speakers and a 1000 milliamp hour
battery a nice touch there's the idea
that if you're slapping on a speaker
dock you'll probably be engaging in some
kind of multimedia activities and that
extra battery helps take the edge off by
powering the speakers without increasing
the drain on your phone the JBL's are
significantly louder than the front
facing speaker on the Z and pack quite a
bit more Rumble they're plenty powerful
to fill a small room or hang with some
beach blanket bingo sound quality is
solid this is definitely a solution
focused on power six suite watts of
power and bass helps that audio travel
especially when there are no walls to
reflect off of but the mids are a little
weak
you
on the whole though this will handily
compete with many smaller Bluetooth
speaker solutions
lastly we get to the Lenovo insta share
projector Lenovo is delivering one of
the more ambitious mods of this first
batch this 50 lumens projector displays
a WVGA resolution image at up to a 70
inch diagonal though you'll need to keep
your surroundings dark obviously handy
little stands slides in the angle you
need even straight up at 90 degrees long
pressing the power button activates the
unit which mirrors the phone display
this little wheel focuses the image and
the insta chair uses some pretty nifty
auto Keystone adjustments to keep the
image from becoming a weird trapezoid
give the phone a second to scan and it
should correct the image to straighten
everything out this mod also packs a
small battery 1,100 milliamp hours to
power the output without killing your
phone this should add an additional hour
of video projection impressive
considering that there is an active
cooling fan built into this accessory
for how ambitious this mod is though we
do have one small issue with the fit and
finish on our review unit where the
bottom corner doesn't quite snap flush
with the phone like other mods do a
small blemish but one we can't unsee for
the price in addition to the power
indicators the JBL and projector mods
also have their own charge ports and
we're happy to see they're also USBC to
share with the included chargers
definitely a hardware option we'd like
to see on future mods especially battery
packs of course the success of a system
depends on whether the novelty and
convenience of these add-ons is
appropriate for the pricing we are
talking about features specific usage so
while it might be fun to own a projector
if you don't need one then the $299
launch price will probably be a turn-off
the JBL speaker option will sell for
$79.99 which is more expensive than
competing Bluetooth options but again is
more convenient than carrying around a
separate audio solution the battery mods
will range in price between 60 and $90
at lunch depending on capacity and
branding many third-party battery case
solutions might be cheaper but they
won't be as sophisticated and how the
phone recognizes the battery nor will
they work as seamlessly or be as easy to
put on or take off this is an
interesting first step in creating an
ecosystem of products and accessories so
not only should we expect prices to
slide if this idea
gains traction we also wouldn't be
surprised to see the system showing up
on other modo lines in the future
the current moto G 4 for example already
closely follows the form factor of the
Moto Z a moto G 5 plus next year might
be a solid candidate for some moto mods
as well just a bit of wild speculation
to wrap up this review so there you have
it folks the initial trio of moto mods
we're seeing a lot of potential for the
system it's easy to use and requires
very little explanation we're curious
what else moto might be able to
accomplish with this setup a point of
sale systems maybe a high quality audio
interface or a project tango augmented
reality add-on we've already seen some
mock-ups for a camera back mod which
could be really compelling the sky's the
limit as always folks thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full moto Z coverage and
hit that thumbs up button for a little
extra positive reinforcement for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos fag now some gadget
guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
