second impressions and we've compared it
to another budget-friendly phone but now
we need to wrap up our time with this
inexpensive aluminum handset can any
company make cheap stylish there's only
one way to find out I'm Juan Carlos bag
now for pocket now and here's our full
review of the Huawei honor 5x walking
around the hardware we've got a
collection of specs which would have
been high-end flagship territory around
three years ago the 5.5 inch 1080p IPS
display is respectably bright and easily
viewed in outdoor light a 1080p on the
screen size is plenty capable for
accomplishing your daily smartphone
tasks it's a great screen at this tier
of the market especially when being used
at reasonable distances from your face
and it only suffers in situations where
magnification is involved like sitting
in a VR headset above that screen we've
got a respectable 5 megapixel
front-facing camera and the whole affair
is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
bytes of RAM and there's 16 gig of
built-in storage with the option to add
more via microSD card that's always a
help as after formatting and
partitioning users will really only have
access to around 10 gig my standard
collection of apps and services has
grown to around 4 gigabytes of storage
so 16 gig phones are starting to feel
really claustrophobic without the
ability to move files to an SD card
unfortunately there doesn't appear to be
any USB OTG support for external storage
or audio devices the right side holds a
power button and volume rocker
borrowing' button placement from some of
my past favourite phones power under the
volume rocker and both are easily
reached without dancing the phone around
in my hand the left side of the phone is
where we'll find a pair of pin tool
doors to access sim and SD cards the
bottom edge has a pair of vents but the
honor only has one loudspeaker a
somewhat unimpressive performer while
it's loud enough for alerts when in your
pocket music movies and games sound
hollow at best and shrill at worst
the rear of the phone holds a 13
megapixel main camera and a fantastic
fingerprint scanner we'll talk about
both in more detail later in this review
this look is familiar with some design
accents seemingly borrowed from other
popular phones which stops just shy
about right copying rivals the rear
casing is a lovely brushed aluminum with
a subtle curve to the plate and nicely
machined edges tapering to prevent any
corner from feeling too sharp the front
is basically a Samsung - the home button
forehead and chin bezels feel larger
than they might need to be but the
screen - front face ratio is over 70%
which is my threshold for getting cranky
so I'll bite my tongue there it's an
attractive phone at any price point but
our review unit did suffer from a few
seams which weren't pieced together very
well in a small blemish on one bottom
corner which looks like it could have
come from a drop or lacks QA when
manufacturing none of these issues
impacted our ability to use the phone
but I did find myself often absent
mindedly running my thumb over some of
those seams this camera has a
respectable 1/3 inch sensor with a
maximum resolution of 41 60 by 31 20 or
12 point nine million effective pixels
and an aperture of f2
this phone software the camera app is
obviously inspired by the iPhone we have
the same sliding action to move between
photo and video modes and the upper
right corner of the app is home to a
collection of filters which I refused to
use we don't have the ability to save
raw output but we can adjust white
balance in ISO not quite the same
in-depth manual options at big brother
Huawei fund receive and these options
are buried in the settings menu but we
can tweak exposure a little we also have
a great collection of options for
post-processing our shots before the
camera creates a JPEG file dial back
some saturation or increase contrast
it's all good while sensor size and
resolution are similar to what we might
find in the current iPhone actual
performance and output won't quite reach
what the 6s can produce which really
shouldn't come as a surprise given that
the honor 5x costs 1/3 what Apple
charges for the iPhone 6s overall we
produced a healthy collection of shots
with punchy colors and decent dynamic
range for this tier the better the light
you have the better you can harness it
the better your photos will be so I've
always thought it's silly when reviewers
say things like well in good light
you'll get good photos it's kind of like
saying your car is really fast when you
floor it going down a steep hill but I
digress
in good light you'll be able to take
advantage of faster shutter speeds and
you
should produce pleasing images weather
was uncharacteristically cloudy over the
last couple days in LA so moving the
shaded shots I'm happy to see that the
white balance isn't too aggressive and
color tone and hue stay appropriately
warm indoor lighting situations start
taxing this hardware though ISO starts
climbing and detail starts to degrade
through longer shutter speeds and more
aggressive noise reduction the single
LED flash will help fill in closer
setups but it's not a particularly
powerful spotlight night shots also
exhibit the same image degradation but
the camera responds well to different
hues of street lights like this creepy
gate where the color temperature here
does a great job reflecting the ugly
yellow light illuminating this white
gate macro performance is also
respectable getting to about two inches
away from the lens for some nice
close-up shots but this 1/3 inch sensor
means we won't see that really pretty
background blur which more expensive
phones with half-inch sensors can
produce for an inexpensive handset we do
have a few fun features beauty mode for
our selfies for example turns me into
all kinds of plastic but I'd happily
trade this beauty mode position for the
HDR panorama modes both of which are
very good for a phone at this price HDR
still takes on a bit more of a shadow
brightening mode and won't always pull
in highlights but you'll get a bit more
color pop out of it the panorama mode
processes quickly and does a great job
of stitching elements together in your
shot you'll rarely see seams as long as
you give the phone a slow and consistent
pass video largely mirrors photo
performance in terms of color and
exposure but this Qualcomm is processing
a pretty low bit rate a 20 megabit per
second data rate means we'll be looking
at dull colors and contrast and blurrier
details thankfully the frame rate never
dropped below 30 frames per second night
shots might come out a bit dark but they
won't suffer from the streakiness we
might see from cameras that drop down to
20 frames per second the audio also
suffers from slow and aggressive noise
reduction the beginning of each clip
will spike in volume and is then reduced
to a warbling dull fog of background
sound
lastly without any kind of image
stabilization that I can find the video
here will be functional but unimpressive
while audio performance from the bottom
firing speaker isn't particularly
impressive headphone playback is
refreshingly punchy I'm not aware of why
way using any fancy branded solutions
for their headphone audio but it's loud
and bacey the EQ color here is a bit
aggressive for my taste with that bass
there's also a bit of a presence bump
for highs and that can sometimes sound
brittle electronica and hip-hop sounded
full classic rock started to lose some
of the fun distortion on guitars in the
mids
but jazz and classical suffered the most
in losing detail and clarity around
acoustic instruments still this was
better headphone performance than I was
expecting
especially after listening to the
speaker moving the software we're
running android 5.1.1 lollipop which has
been skinned with Huawei's emui custom
launcher the general idea is to pack LG
or Samsung style features while
providing the organization scheme of iOS
we've seen quite a few of these options
on other handsets motion control
settings allow you to mute calls by
flipping them over if your home screens
weren't messy enough you can shake the
phone to rearrange them there is a tap
to wake feature which doesn't work quite
as well as the fingerprint scanner and
while the screen is off drawing the
letter on the display will launch an app
directly but this feature doesn't clear
the lock screen so I'm not sure how
useful this will actually be drawing ac
for camera lands you here when double
tapping the volume rocker will actually
get you into the camera rearranging the
bottom navigation bar a la LG is greatly
appreciated with the option to add a
notification panel icon though I do kind
of like the fingerprint sensor swipe
better for pulling my notifications as
for navigating the device I didn't like
this user interface while unboxing the
phone I didn't like it during my second
impressions and I still don't like it
now we see a concerted effort to pay
homage to the iPhone throughout this UI
your app drawer and home screens are the
same thing which leads to a really
cluttered scattering of shortcuts and at
a glance notifications from widgets the
divided notification shade doesn't feel
like any other Android I've used and the
phone can be a bit naggy in how it
alerts you to updates I don't understand
the strategy if I'm being honest if I
wanted an iPhone I would get one at
least on Android we can install an
they're launcher like Google now or Nova
but I actually spent half of my time
using this phone in simple mode just to
avoid this mess of an interface while
the honor software is a bit of a mess
the phone is a capable performer you'll
rarely be kept waiting for the phone to
catch up to homescreen slides or menu
scrolling and over the last week I only
had one bad redraw of the homescreen
which I couldn't capture on camera
the Qualcomm 6-1-6 handles daily tasks
easily and it only gets bogged down in
aggresive multitasking or when playing
games with intense graphics Skyforce and
Riptide gp2 performed well but Marvel
future fight often becomes a slideshow
of your favorite superhero wasting bad
guys the most impressive part of this
whole equation though is Huawei's
terrific fingerprint scanner quickly
unlocking the device it's faster than
most power or home button mounted
solution in the training process does a
great job of reading prints even when
you're turning significantly from how
you trained the phone it really is a
shining gem of a feature - included a
phone at this price point it's also
exciting to see more phones combining
low-power processors with larger
batteries the 3000 milliamp hour cell
here is good for all-day operation under
medium to heavy workloads and my best
run managed just over 5 hours of screen
on time using auto brightness and a
healthy mix of Wi-Fi performing a
playback test streaming 30 minutes of HD
video over Wi-Fi at 50 percent
brightness resulted in 7 percent battery
draw which is really good when compared
to flagships with more powerful guts and
smaller batteries the battery capacity
comes in handy as the honor doesn't seem
to use any fast charging that I could
find I was only able to charge the phone
about 20% after an hour on a proper two
amp quick charger my car charger kept
the phone battery in place while I was
using the wall way for turn-by-turn
navigation and streaming podcasts so
where's that leave us with the Huawei
honor 5x this is a slick budget-friendly
mid Ranger and there's a lot to like
here for the savvy or folks in our
audience a few simple software tweaks
can really step up with this hardware
has to offer though I'm a bit torn on
whether to recommend this for people who
aren't at the same level of tech
awareness I think people coming from a
more traditional Android device will be
frustrated by this UI and I think folks
coming from an iPhone will just see this
as being a cheap knockoff what is
exciting though is watching huawei step
up
unlocked offerings here in the United
States with some killer options at a
variety of price points above all I'm
always going to be happier when there's
more competition at all product tiers
the honor 5x raises the bar for
inexpensive phone design and security
and now we'll get to see how competitors
respond will 2016 be the year of the
mid-range er can less expensive phones
pull market share away from flagship
devices I'm sure you have thoughts on
the honor 5x so I hope you'll share them
down in the comments as always thanks so
