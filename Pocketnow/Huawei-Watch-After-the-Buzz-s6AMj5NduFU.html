over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's take a second look at one of
the most expensive Android wear
selections in the markets and see if
it's still worth its additional premium
I'm high memory that I will pocket now
this is the Huawei watch and this is
episode 54 of after the buzz
according to Michaels review no other
smartwatches simplified Android wear
more than the Huawei watch and in that
sense he was right even today this is
one of the few alternatives that offers
an elegant design and premium materials
for less than $1000 in all of its
variants the whole idea was indeed to
de-emphasize the geeky and turn this
into a timeless piece of hardware into
that extent some of its features have
met the goal and the others not so much
as an owner of a legacy moto 360 that
still looks like new today I had some
high hopes for how the Huawei watch
would stand the test of time and that's
where things are rather mixed the 316l
cold form stainless steel is strong
against the usual Nicks and scuffs
you'll see in Cheaper materials but the
story is different when it comes to how
it handles scratches whether you're
looking at the brush side rails or the
Polish front this watch looks pretty
beat-up
even if I can't really say ever struck a
wall with it or something as I'm sure we
all have with watches this roll
scratches are even more noticeable in
the chrome ring that surrounds the front
making it my regular pet peeve every
time I glance at the watch - always the
fence though the scratches are mostly
noticeable in warm lighting and this is
something that even premium stainless
steel analog watches deal with whenever
going for a polished look and the main
reason why a brushed finish looks better
competing devices 21 millimeters sutra
stitch leather band has h more
gracefully though I've never really been
a fan of leather bands given how much I
sweat but aside from some D coloration
at the bottom it still passes as a new
band from the front making it a good buy
if you're ever looking for the more
affordable Huawei watch a sapphire
display is really what makes this device
stand out from most when it comes to its
price point and as expected it simply
hasn't aged at all sapphire was
definitely a great choice overall from a
durability standpoint giving users a
true scratch-free experience overall and
the peace of mind that you really don't
have to baby this watches display for it
to continue looking good
something you currently can't do with
every other Android wear SmartWatch
another thing that's H well here is
Believe It or Not Android wear
Google has done an amazing job at
improving the overall experience of the
operating system and things that
actually makes sense
or devices like the Apple watch still
struggle with things like notifications
Android wear now groups them in a very
intuitive way if you hated all those
Google now cards that clog your feed
well now you actually have the option to
have this centralized than just one
notification that stacks these into sub
cards if you hate it not being able to
find applications now it's a simple
swipe Android wear is clearly still a
work in progress that's matured a lot
over the last year and slowly making
this my go-to platform even if I can
still choose to use a pebble timer and
Apple watch any day and something I
really couldn't say in the past about
the original Android wear that we saw
years ago now to be fair one of the
major reasons that I'm really enjoying
using Android wear lately has a lot to
do with the Huawei watch per se the
Snapdragon 400 processor blazes through
everything you throw at it making this
one of the most fluid experiences I've
ever had with a SmartWatch period
something I'm sure everyone will valley
while on the go the Huawei watch is also
the best device to make Android wear
come to life with its 1.4 inch 400 by
400 AMOLED display with
or just color reproduction an amazing
contrast in detail
an elegant timepiece is meant to be a
head-turner and I've never gotten more
compliments in my history of using
smartwatches
than with the Huawei watch even in its
basic always-on mode which is one of the
few that actually includes color and
some of its 40 watch phases about the
only problem with using this premium
watch and day today uses well it's lack
of a flat tire I know I know what's
wrong with me right but believe it or
not there is a lot of importance in that
particular feature with this watch this
is one of the few Android wear offerings
that lacks a flat tire for an ambient
light sensor which is great for improve
aesthetics but sadly not so much when it
comes to usability mainly because of the
use of sapphire if you're indoors you
really only need medium brightness on
this gorgeous display for everything to
look crisp and dandy but try checking
the time whenever in direct sunlight
yeah I know you really can't the
Sapphire film makes the display
completely unreadable in brightly lit
conditions and where an ambient light
sensor would have done an amazing job at
boosting the brightness whenever you
need it
now if you did choose to solve that prom
at maximum brightness you'll be happy to
know that this is the battery life king
of Android wear it's probably the only
watch that I've ever been able to take
for more than a day and a half of
moderate to heavy use though I will
disclaimer I did that at medium
brightness not the only thing that I
don't like about the battery experience
is how terrible it is to align this
watch to its charger but everything else
about battery life is just peace of mind
overall and I guess the word peace of
mind is the perfect segue to end today's
video surely our basic variant of the
Huawei watch hasn't really aged
gracefully when it comes to some of its
fit and finish the Huawei has been
rather smart about it this once was one
of the priciest Android wear offerings
but we've seen the company bring some
major discounts to the watch and making
this a good buy for a very important
reason and that's really the fact that
as an Android wear SmartWatch this is
pretty much one of the only future-proof
devices see the Huawei watch is not only
the best alternative when it comes to
its specifications but it's also the
only
Android wear watch that houses an active
speaker something which we hear will be
a big deal whenever Android wear 1.4
becomes ready for download yes you still
could wait and see what events like MWC
could bring to the table next month sure
but if you really want to try Android
wear right now this continues to be one
of the watches we'd recommend most
hands-down folks just like in the case
of the Huawei watch every single
SmartWatch comes of age and we've got a
ton of episodes of after the bus to back
