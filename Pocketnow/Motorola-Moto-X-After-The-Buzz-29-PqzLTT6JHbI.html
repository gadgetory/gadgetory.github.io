new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all onto the next big
thing already so let's do something
about it let's take a second pass at the
smart phone that took Android to the
next level of consumer friendliness
i'm michael fisher with pocket now this
is the Moto X and this is episode 29 of
after the buzz it's the first smartphone
from the new Motorola the device that
told the spec sheet to take a back seat
and to some it's living proof that
Android has finally grown up it's been
over five months since the Moto X came
onto the scene nearly a half year since
the disappointing initial sales that may
have prompted the price cuts we saw
earlier this month is the Moto X still
worth buying given that rocky start the
answer starts under the hood
anyone could be forgiven for doubting
the staying power of a device
specifically built to avoid the spec war
for many a smartphone is a 1 to 2 year
investment and the Moto X is custom
innards art is powerful on paper as
those on the rival Nexus 5 which can be
head for $50 cheaper unlocked so why is
the Moto X even in the conversation in
short because of the software features
that the phone's unique hardware enables
the Moto X got Android KitKat very
quickly as you might expect and on the
whole it's still just as snappy as the
day we unboxed it it runs games just as
well - more importantly you probably
remember the touchless control active
display and moto assist features from
our initial review features which have
mainly grown more useful over time
that's especially true of moto assist
which recently got an update that allows
you not just to hear and
contexts when the phone detects your
driving but also to dictate replies to
it all of it hands-free it's not a
perfect score you still can't change the
cumbersome okay google now key phrase
for touchless control Google's new
hangouts app bogs down somewhat if
you're using it for SMS and it's
annoying when moto assist thinks you're
driving even though you're on a bus or a
train where it reads your texts out loud
for everyone to hear but those
shortcomings are easy to forgive once
you get used to the comfortable
convenience
Motorola's special features provide
these plus little touches like seasonal
boot animations and the occasional
surprise augmented reality game landing
on your home screen out of nowhere make
using the Moto X special it might sound
cloying but picking up the Moto X after
some time away really does feel like
coming home it's very nice that sense is
helped along by the phone's build after
five months the X's pebble-like
construction with its addictive
dimple and soft touch finish is a
welcome reprieve from the competition's
relentless pursuit of bigger badder
designs and of course the customization
makes it feel even more your own
especially now that the wood options
have landed just be sure to choose
carefully when dealing with Moto maker I
chose a white faceplate and I've never
quite warmed up to it use that exchange
period to your advantage you also want
to be careful not to drop the X it can
handle shower spray or the occasional
rainstorm just fine thanks to Motorola
special nano coating within but if
you're a dropper you might want a case
even though it will bulk up the phone
Taylor Martin will have more in depth
analysis and a forthcoming durability
report but one chest height drop onto a
sidewalk rendered my device scratched
pretty badly
finally there's that display if you
don't like AMOLED and/or you think 720p
isn't a high enough resolution you still
won't like this panel if you don't care
about that though and you value bright
brilliant colors instead you'll still
love it
and the 4.7 inch screen crammed into a
chassis this small will still make you
feel like you're getting away with
something wrapping things up with the
day-to-day now nobody's perfect and the
Moto X is mediocrity still lies in its
camera the wrist flick activation
gesture is awesome it should be standard
on all smartphones it's so convenient
but the output from the camera even
after a software update is still pretty
blah colors just don't pop the way they
should and pictures have a fuzzier
quality overall low-light is just well
we don't need to go on now it's
certainly not impossible to capture a
good shot I've snapped a few shots I'm
actually pretty proud of in the right
light and under the proper circumstances
but overall this is a camera for
Instagram and Facebook and not much else
countering that is voice and radio
performance and battery life we still
haven't found a phone that sounds as
good or does as good a job with noise
cancellation as the Moto X and that's
true of its reception as well according
to a recent report from fierce Wireless
tech which gave the Moto X quote top
honors by a country mile unquote when
compared against rival devices from
Samsung HTC and LG and it's battery life
while not astronomical is still more
than reasonable given the phone size so
after half a year can we still recommend
the Moto X to those looking for a great
all-around Android experience absolutely
Motorola's attention to detail its
emphasis on customization and its focus
on intuitive features / top-shelf
specifications has produced a really
nice package here if you want a more
powerful Android and get the Nexus 5 if
you want something cheaper get the Moto
G if you want a great camera get
anything else but if you want something
special
get the Moto X I doubt you'll be
disappointed and as I said folks Taylor
Martin is completing his durability
report on the Moto X as we speak be sure
and check that out as soon as it goes up
and of course you can see our original
review of the Moto X here on YouTube and
