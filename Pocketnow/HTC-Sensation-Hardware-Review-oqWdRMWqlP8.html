pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to cover the hardware in a detail of the
HTC Sensation which is HD C's
top-of-the-line
flagship phone for 2011 let's get to it
now this particular version is the
European version of the HTC Sensation
it's coming to the US as the t-mobile
Sensation 4G this happens to be the
Vodafone version which actually will
work on t-mobile interestingly enough it
has the band's necessary to do 3G on
t-mobile but it's not really doing the
4g HSPA+ that you'll be able to get if
you buy the t-mobile version in the US
and it'll be at a cheaper price in the
US right now if you want to import this
device it'll cost you about 750 bucks
you can get it from Negri electronics
dot-com expensive yes but that's the
price to pay if you want to get
something early although we're only
about two weeks or even less from the
release of the Sensation 4G in the US
and it's already starting to roll out on
carriers across the globe so a lot to
talk about here this is the first
Qualcomm Snapdragon dual-core processor
shipping on a phone 1.2 gigahertz just
like we get on the samsung galaxy s 2
although the Galaxy S 2 is running with
the Exynos Samsung processor we're going
to do a full comparison of both the
galaxy s 2 and the HTC Sensation in an
upcoming video it's very interesting how
different they are and yet how they're
they're very similar in terms of being
very high-end very fast devices
besides the 1.2 gigahertz processor we
have 768 megabytes of RAM the same
amount of RAM that we got in the
previous high-end HTC phone the Desire
HD which also came out as the inspire 4G
and several other variants around the
world so 768
megabytes of RAM which is definitely
plenty of space there we've got a
front-facing VGA camera here and in 8
megapixel camera on the back capable of
recording 1080p video content we'll have
some video samples coming up soon as a
preview this thing takes great video and
also takes great photos it's got a
screen that is 4.3 inches that seems to
be the size for these high-end
although because it is qHD resolution
which is 960 by 540 across it's got a 16
by 9 aspect ratio like your HDTV what
that means is that you get a more true
to life better aspect ratio when you're
watching movies and looking at photos it
also means that the screen is taller
then you've got on other 4.3 inch Q or
WVGA display is like the Desire HD or
the galaxy s2 so that kind of means that
you get the same effect that you'll get
on a device with a bigger screen a
little bit more reaching towards the top
if we line up the bottoms of these
phones it's kind of hard to do here but
you can see that the sensation extends a
little bit beyond where you go with a
regular 4.3 inch WVGA display it's
really interesting to see what HTC has
done with the qHD display text is super
sharp and they've really modified the
key applications like mail and contacts
and calendar to take advantage of all
the pixels the mail application on the
HTC Sensation is killer it's the best
we've ever seen it takes full advantage
of all of those pixels on the screen to
make it really nice the screen type is
super LCD we found this to be the case
on the Desire HD it's a great screen
technology it doesn't provide as much
contrast as Super AMOLED or Super AMOLED
plus that we get from Samsung but it's
very very good and we're gonna do a
comparison in an upcoming video
what's a walk around the device a little
bit let's go up here to the top so we've
got the same HTC look-and-feel here
generation after generation HTC has been
doing phones that look about the same
which is not so bad if you have
something good stick with it and people
are recognizing that that HTC look and
it's good for the HTC brand so again
we've got this speaker grille with kind
of a chrome look there's also an LED
notification light and there is the
front-facing camera up here on the top
we've got the power standby button and
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack we've
got a curved display here and by curved
I mean on the edges on all four edges it
kind of tilts outward a little bit and
that just gives it kind of a
high-quality unique feel something you
really
get on other Android phones it really
doesn't impact usability that much just
look score and it feels kind of cool
we've got these four capacitive buttons
along the bottom just as with most of
these HTC phones the buttons do not
rotate they are static over here on the
side we've got the volume up and down
rocker we've got the micro USB port here
for syncing and charging on the bottom
we've got the microphone hole on the
battery release we're gonna go behind
the battery cover in a sex there's some
interesting things going on there
nothing on the right side and then we've
got this really unique tricolor design
here on the sensation so we've got three
different colors the top and the bottom
parts feel kind of soft touch plastic
this is kind of slick and smooth very
strange design element here on the back
again the 8 megapixel camera can shoot
in 1080p video 1080p video got the dual
LED flash and the speaker we've got a
lot of these little dots what are those
dots well let's take off the back
battery cover to help explain what the
dots are for so to take it off you just
pop your fingernail in here and this is
really really weird so it kind of
separates like that and the case
actually wraps all around the device so
you kind of get to see the inner
workings of the phone which is sort of
cool but as you can see with just two
days of use I'm getting some Pocket lint
around the speaker and around the camera
lens which is kind of kind of annoying
and if you look at the other side of
this you can see that the there's
there's no piece of plastic covering the
camera lens so presumably after a long
period of time you're gonna need to blow
this out with compressed air to keep
everything clean
but anyway up here you can excuse all of
that pocket when you get the speaker
camera the the LED indicator kind of
hard to see but this is really weird
because you just get to see every aspect
of the phone and if we kind of turn over
and look at where those holes are they
all correspond to these metal parts
which is part of the antenna system so
it's a function they are functional
holes they're not microphones or
anything like that they're just part of
the way the phone is designed so this
back battery covers kind of flexible
it's plastic a lot of plastic used on
this is used on this phone but the
enhance feel the build quality is is
very very good back here we've got the
hots
palpable micro SD card it comes with an
8 gigabyte card you've got the SIM card
here and the battery and you can also
see the other stuff back here just
really cool to spend some time and tilt
it around to get it back on pretty easy
just put it in headfirst you just saw
the light blink snap it down and there
you go so that was a look at the
hardware on the HTC Sensation in hand it
feels great on paper it sounds great
with really high specs for this high-end
device what's really important of course
is how it feels day-to-day how the web
browsing speed compares to other phones
with the battery life is like what the
Sense 3.0 interface does for the user
experience HTC has really done a ton
with this device probably more so than
any other device in their history to
make the interface interesting and
unique to make it easy to launch
applications right here from your
lockscreen all of the major applications
have been redone to make them take
advantage of a qHD resolution and
there's just a lot of visual elements of
Sense 3.0 that make using the phone
really enjoyable we've got a lot more
coming up be sure you subscribe to our
