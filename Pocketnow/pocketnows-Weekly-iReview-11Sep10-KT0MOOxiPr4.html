bad things to talk about it the ipod
touch gets released positive reviews so
far and the dev team is a tad closer to
getting iOS 4.1 jailbroken all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm gonna practice saying it's slow
again I'm high metal be better welcome
to the pocket nail I review the show we
go through all the week's cool and
not-so-cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start off this week as
always with the cool iOS 4.1 is out and
for the most part things are cool iphone
3g owners are not complaining anymore
their devices are not sluggish proximity
sensor issues have been dealt with and
sadly no you're not gonna get in the
antenna gate issues fixed if you have
this problem apparently this is not
going to fix that issue but game centers
out a lot of people are saying that it's
cool even though we probably want a
couple of more games in there HDR
photography is there for the most part
though there are things that could be
improved and well you can upload HD
videos over Wi-Fi and also TV rentals
are there for a buck even though TV
visor there on amazon too so you have a
lot of new choices a lot of cool things
not everything is perfect but for the
most part iOS 4.1 is considered by many
to be a success so far well the next
generation ipod touches out and a lot of
cool things have been said about the
device and pretty much of the whole new
ipod lineup including the fact that you
can use your new ipod nano as a watch
kind of cool but regarding the ipod
touch which is the one we're interested
on things are cool retina display is out
facetime videos over Wi-Fi are out HD
video recordings with the backward
camera or cool even though sadly still
images are not that cool because this is
a dot 7 megapixel camera which is pretty
much just video stills you know even
camcorders can't really do a good job on
that so we're not going to hold it that
bad on the next generation ipod touch
and as things are going with facetime
becoming mainstream with the ipod touch
the iphone 4 positively the next ipad
coming out next year and even max with
their eyesight cameras let's see what
happens to phone calls eventually so
yeah in general things are cool with a
next generation ipod touch great
impressions a really good steal if
take advantage of it continuing on with
the cool it seems that Apple is
loosening up a bit with the restrictions
on what tools can be used to generate
apps for iOS if you remember months ago
Apple became really restrictive about
this because they said you can use paid
tools to generate apps like for example
flash they were stuck on the fact that
html5 was free and the developers should
stick to html5 what the problem with
that was a lot of developers had to
regenerate their apps and come up with
html5 versions of their apps and this
really made things difficult for people
that are already invested on these tools
so Apple is really opening the door
again and just letting developers do
what they do best and bring their stuff
however they want to win this just
smells like apple wants to fit things
for competition because you know it
developers can use anything for Android
and it's gonna be the same deal for
windows phone 7 so you know how
competition is considering all with more
cool stuff it seems iOS 4.1 is getting
closer to being jailbroken according to
hacker pot to G apparently there's an
exploit that is so big within the
bootrom err I don't know somewhere I'm
not a developer to know these things but
apparently it's something that's so big
that it's gonna take apple a lot of
stuff to get this fixed and probably
this could be as big as to be able to
get iOS devices to be jailbroken even
with future releases this is just a
rumor not really confirmed let's see
what happens from here on and let's hope
it's as simple as jailbreakme.com though
we can't hold our breath on this one
let's see what happens
and let's start off with the not so cool
let's start talking about the things
that did not make it to devices with
iowa's 4.1 first of all nothing was
mentioned on the keynotes but for some
reason gamecenter did not make it to the
iphone 3g HDR photography didn't even
make it to the iphone 3gs so
fragmentation is getting really bad here
and it was totally logical that HD
videos over Wi-Fi we're not going to be
available for these old devices with no
HD video recordings but we're still
trying to understand which are their
hardware limitations for the other two
things to not have made it and even if
there are you know the cool thing is for
Apple to tell us things from the start
and not to release an update and then
for people to eventually know that this
is going to happen Apple really you know
the cool thing is for you to tell us
things just like you did with iOS for
not bringing multitasking to the iphone
3g and telling people these things on
the keynote we do expect for you to do
this for new future releases and for
people to know what they're expecting
once they get their upgrade continuing
on with the not-so-cool Sony's PSP ads
are at it again now they're called
Marcus doesn't play that and they have
this little kid Marcus was probably 9
years old telling kids hey I'm not gonna
play this runner i could not gonna play
that but the problem is they had really
lame games in the ads I mean Sony grab
your marketing dudes go get Marcus and
give him a game called nova or I don't
know there are so many cool games within
the app store and ask mark as if he
wouldn't play that I'll bet you he would
that's it for today's I review thank you
very much for watching any questions or
comments you have about this video let
us know at twitter.com slash parking out
tweets or youtube.com slash pocket nail
video that's it for now
