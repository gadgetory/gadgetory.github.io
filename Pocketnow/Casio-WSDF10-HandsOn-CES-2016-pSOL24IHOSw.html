Casio on your wrist you might have also
wished for the company to one day decide
to make a modern SmartWatch until they
actually did I'm he might be better with
pocket may are here with some late
coverage from CES 2016 with a Casio wsd
f10 Cassie was pretty much the pioneer
of the classic old SmartWatch from back
in the day with calculator watches to
the old data banks that we all drooled
about when we were kids the company has
now announced its first Android wear
offering at CES but this is not your
typical SmartWatch in many ways for one
even though this is an Android wear
SmartWatch it is dramatically different
to any of its competitors it's probably
the largest unit out there at 62 by 53
millimeters with a crazy 15.7
millimeters in thickness but then again
there's a purpose for all of this it's
meant to actually be an outdoor
powerhouse for those of you desiring a
truly rugged product overall and that
shows everywhere from its bill design to
this rubber straps to its metallic
finish it's just about everything when
you hold the watch second is that well
we're struggling to find the typical
specs of any Android wear SmartWatch
here it doesn't have a heart rate sensor
like most and if you ask anyone what the
processor is there is still no solid
responses this is apparently a
proprietary processor from Casio and the
reason why this is so important is
because this is one of the fastest and
most fluid experiences I've ever had an
Android wear and it shows all around
when you're using the watch through this
320 by 320 LCD display and then when you
look at all the proprietary software
that's built tend to take advantage of
all the pressure sensors magnetic
sensors and just everything else that
this Android wear SmartWatch includes
it's really hard to ignore that this is
one of the coolest experiences that
we've ever had with Android wear period
you can program what applications are
launched by the separate buns included
through an application that works both
on iOS and Android and again it really
isn't until you dig within the operating
system that you notice that you're
actually running an Android wear
SmartWatch even the charging mechanism
is
unique to Android wear where you don't
really require a separate module to
attach to the watch this Casio watches
mil-std 810g compliant for water
resistance up to 50 meters and to top it
off if you ever run out of Bury it'll
turn off the Android wear portion of the
watch and behave like your regular Casio
SmartWatch and yes even with the lack of
a heart rate sensor Casio is targeting
the Fitness crowd out here where you can
use it for running cycling and believe
it or not even for fishing if that were
ever a fitness activity but hey you tell
me pricing and availability seems set
for the next few months with four color
variants and so far I wish there were
more companies that with such a bold
approach to Android wear this is
definitely one of the parks that we'll
look forward to reviewing in the pocket
mouth in this segment very soon for now
