Paul calm and this is another episode of
the windows phone 7 app roundup in which
we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
application is called flash cards and
it's free on the windows marketplace the
cool thing about this applications watch
to learn various things by quizzing
yourself with these various flash cards
so let's say I wanted to learn the trig
identities I'll have to just click on
here and it will load the trailer
energies of course you can always load
your own flashcards so of course sine 2x
plus cosine 2x equals one and I can just
flip over to the back to view that I can
also edit it if I'd want let's say that
I wanted to change this value I'll just
click there and I can change the flash
card tricks and vixens is a free game
available on the windows marketplace
that's somewhat similar to Angry Birds
so what I want to do is first zoom out
and I can aim my cannon here aim it at
these vixens which are of course boxes
and we can just shoot them the birds
over there and didn't do to the two
great that time so let's shoot another
bird and when I've accomplished my goal
I move on to the next level this game is
still in beta stages and only has 15
levels flixster is a free culmination
between the flixster site and the rotten
tomatoes website so the great thing
about this you can get box office
information get theaters upcoming movie
releases DVDs search and also change
their settings so let's say I wanted to
view a box office some of the movies
that are out right now just click on
here and we'll wait for it to load and
as you can see the right has seventeen
percent on a rotten tomato scale so
that's not too great I'll just move over
to the right to get theaters upcoming
information and DVDs watcher is a fast
pace game in which you can use up to
four points on your screen to move your
crosshair social you how this works
using just one point and then I will
fast forward and show you how it works
on multiple points so the game becomes
rather involved when you move to
multiple points here's two and as you
can see it becomes very tricky to try to
attack these enemy
before they reach the center and if they
reach the center than you lose the game
and here i am using four points on the
screen and it's very hard to do you know
it is a free game that uses the
accelerometer the object game is to move
these silver metallic balls next to each
other and cause them to fuse together so
what I want to do is to move the larger
metallic ball until I complete this
level and this is the first level and
it's rather pretty easy so I'll just
move on and I'll show you how the other
levels work so here's a much more
challenging level in which you must move
your pieces across and avoid those
propeller type objects and the game
continues on like this until you pass
all the levels so this has been another
episode of Windows Phone 7 app round up
