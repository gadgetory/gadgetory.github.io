Samsung Galaxy S 9 that proved that we
have ultra slow-mo features on the
camera Nintendo plans to launch Mario
Kart Tour for mobile devices someday and
the LG G seven seems to have gotten
pushed yet again I'm Jaime Rivera and
for those of you that complain that I
say my name too much fine
I'm Jaime Rivera I'm Jaime Rivera oh and
did I tell you that I'm Jaime Ravana
this is PocketNow daily official news
today begin with deals if you are in the
market for an iPhone and you don't want
to pay so much money that's kind of hard
but the iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus continued
to be devices that we recommend so long
as you buy them new because they won't
be getting throttled anytime soon and
they're currently available for close to
$500 refurbished obviously there are
different prices depending on what you
get but you can learn more about them
and the link in the description now
let's talk about the one plus five and
notice I'm not adding the tea for those
of you that wanted that facial
recognition technology to unlock that
was so good on the five tea well it is
now available on the one plus 5 as of
oxigen iOS 5.0 point 2 obviously it's
gonna take some time to deploy we can't
guarantee that it'll be as fast but we
assume it should be as this is really
just software and it's pretty much the
same hardware with the 5 t again you can
learn more about that in the description
now let's talk about the LG G 7 as now
we pretty much have sources from the
company that claim that the g7 will be
delayed exactly when we don't know but
you know see why Kim from LG has already
confirmed that we should expect an
update to the LG b 30 whatever that
update will bring us still hard to tell
but we'll keep you posted we'll be
covering the show live now let's move
the spotlight over to Nintendo the
company made a lot of fanfare with the
whole Mario jump on the you know iOS and
Android it's suddenly not one of my
favorite games mainly because you need
data for it to work which I consider to
be really stupid but there is apparently
going to be a new Mario Kart tour the
company has announced that the problem
is that we should expect that anytime
between March and April of next year
that is probably the longest timeframe
Nintendo and
better do a better job better do a
better job sound than weird but yeah you
should do a better job than what you did
with Mario Super Mario jump or whatever
and finally the very hot news today
continuing to be the samsung galaxy as
anion as we've got some leaked
components out of which well we see the
fingerprint scanner in addition to
others but the most important was the
camera obviously because we've got a new
and improved face detection autofocus
technology which is great but the
hardware components also confirmed that
the phone will be able to record 720p
video at ultra slow motion 960 frames
per second just to give you an idea the
camera that I'm recording this video
with is capable of recording 120 frames
per second in ultra slow motion HF are
pretty much is what I think they call it
high frame rate yeah so that's gonna be
a lot for phone it's an insane
capability it leads me to the question
today I mean what do you think is this a
feature you ever use I mean right now
most phones can do slow motion video how
often do you actually use it in my case
almost not at all so I don't think
that's going to be a major feature for
me but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
