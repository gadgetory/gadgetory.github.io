simplicity of Windows Phone that's a
combination that didn't exist until
recently but now Nokia has brought it to
us I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
let's unbox the Nokia Lumia 1520 so here
it is in all its glory folks and we do
really appreciate our friends at AT&amp;amp;T
and Microsoft and Nokia AT&amp;amp;T as well but
we pick on ATT a little more often
because of their packaging which is
pretty Dell but look they've done
something different here that this kind
of pull tab here for the 1520 the color
is printed on the side it is going to be
a black unit spoiler alert and I believe
this is probably going to be a second
wave device so not and I might not have
a screen protector here we'll see we'll
see bigger box than usual as you might
expect because say with me bigger device
than usual upgrade your camera app by
scanning this QR code Nokia camera that
recently renamed Nokia pro camera I like
the new name I like the new
functionality it's good times if you
haven't seen it check out one of our
more recent Windows Phone pieces I
believe we covered that there's our
Quick Start Guide just giving us the
lowdown on the device configuration no
real surprises there we can put it aside
hey we got a screen protector this is
great okay good we can do the peel I'm
very excited so let's pop it on out of
the box here and let it just impact us
with its its its mass and what a big big
device let's put it aside here we hope
you love your new Lumia 1520 well we do
two SIM dorky right there excellent pop
that out of there this is going to be
all of our literature inside this pouch
here and a wall charger unsurprisingly
nothing else in the box kind of a shame
that we no longer getting fun toys like
the headphones and or even the the pouch
that we remember from the 925
kind of no-frills but at least the box
is a little bit of a step up in terms of
quality so kudos AT&amp;amp;T Nokia Microsoft
bring the device back into the center of
the frame here looks like the sim tray
got ejected and shipping there let's see
if we can get a close-up there see if
the SCIM is installed a way over is this
round this is nano SIM have I not been
paying attention to the affairs of the
world what is going on with this I
didn't know this was nano sim so that's
very exciting I mean it's going to be
either exciting or annoying to you
depending on what you use for your
personal device is a six inch IPS
display device quite large now just for
comparison's sake here is a samsung
galaxy mega I believe this is taller by
maybe a millimeter or they may be
exactly as tall who knows where they are
around the back the mega obviously a
very large unit if you remember our
review 1520 not falling far behind I saw
this device in 18t store several weeks
ago it'll be launching on 80 on November
22nd pressing hole to power it up here
let's see if we can get that there we go
texting and driving it can wait good
advice as always no jokes
it's not a good idea to text and drive
let's bring the mic down in help very
very very nice glass display here under
the hood is a Snapdragon 800 welcome to
your windows phone thank you very much
let's get started it's English is what
it's going to be I accept your terms and
as we wait for our sign-in to complete
with our Microsoft account we will come
around the back here we can peel this
off but just to use it as a little guide
we saw the nano SIM before also micro SD
expansion on this device very awesome
our usual side buttons for volume power
and camera auto launch we do really love
that big old camera lens in the center
also has a protector on it that
protector keeping that lens clean for
the 20 megapixel PureView sensor also
optically stabilized back there and this
back this paint job just so very very
smooth on the back here reminds us since
we're doing off the cuff device
comparisons reminds us a little bit of
the paint job on the pre three very very
similar texture very comfortable to hold
sharp corners
but the the soft touch paint job really
does a good job of mitigating that a
little bit come around back to the front
looks like all the apps have finished
installing well that's great news that's
it next held have fun well you know we
will we will try to have fun boom
there's our Start screen with all of
that space look at that high Windows
Phone Nokia pro camera is asking us to
open it up and learn all about it we're
not going to do that right now we're
just going to have a look at this vast
homescreen with its massive amount of
acreage that's pretty cool
guys I am gonna just I could I could
talk about this all day but really I
forget to work getting to know this
device so here is the Nokia Lumia 1520
unboxed for your pleasure stay tuned for
a lot more folks or thank you for your
patience you know it took a little while
for us to get a hold of a 15 20 but now
that we have one I'm going to do our
best to do justice might be a couple
more days than usual you're you're stuck
waiting we do have a lot of devices in
the pipeline right now as you will see
shortly but at any rate please leave us
a comment down below if you have
something you would like us to cover
specifically follow us on social media
