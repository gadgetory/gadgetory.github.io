when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappears
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say other devices they
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device when it's a couple of weeks
after release and not shiny and new
anymore
I'm high memory matter with
pocketnow.com this is the HTC One X and
this is episode four after the buzz
my first-ever Pocket PC was made by HTC
even though was brand at the compact I
pack back in 2002 the design was so good
and so well thought-out that it became
the reason why most of the devices I've
owned ever since have been made by HTC
a decade later I was fortunate to be in
the audience when Peter Chao announced
their new focus with the one series back
at MWC 2012 I remember liking what they
announced that even what I felt when I
held the One X for the first time in the
press booth but a lot of which shall
claim them the keynote felt unfinished
in the demo units we used we also got
that same feeling in our review units
since but the Vice looked great but the
performance didn't live up to the
quad-core processor had boasted after
almost a month of using the One X as my
daily driver we're back with episode 4
of after the buzz to answer the question
that everybody's asking is it still
worth the buy 1x after a couple of weeks
of usage so let's talk about it when it
comes to hardware it's tough for me to
recommend any other smartphone HTC's
design proved did a great job in making
this one of the most iconic smartphone
designs of the year I'll admit I was
initially dismayed by their use of
polycarbonate instead of the metallic
finish that they gave to the 1s but once
you hold it in your hand
everything starts making sense the
device feels at times like a
contradiction since it's just as big as
the HTC Titan but it feels a lot smaller
and lighter in the hand and it even
passes our well instituted pocket tests
with flying colors all the machining and
precision used into manufacturing this
phone will do a good job in making you
look good when showing it off no matter
what device your buddy has now that
doesn't change the fact that it's a big
device that wasn't designed for
one-handed usability but then again so
are the rest of the flagship Android
smartphones in the market I got the gray
model out of the fact that the white
variant is good at picking up dirt from
your hands but that was a big mistake
this one is also great at picking up
hand oils and becoming greasy all around
so I guess you'll just have to pick your
poison the only thing I don't like about
the design is HTC's departure from the
single unibody back that we saw with the
Titan and with the sensation where all
you had to do was replace the battery
to make it look like new again if you
dented it make sure you either buy it
case or simply don't drop the 1x as
there are no visible screws in the
housing if you want to fix it yourself
later on I recommend getting a good TPU
case to cover the phone but make sure
that it somehow protects the camera lens
as it'll show minor scratches in just a
couple of days of use now the trick with
these TPU cases is that you clean up the
phone before using the case dirt and
lint will not scratch the phone but the
problem is that your hand oils will
become a permanent coating with the
phone if you slip it into the case and
leave it there for a couple days without
cleaning it up so make sure you do that
now it's far about software since 4.0
has a ton of things to praise and a lot
of things to complain about I'll admit
it's one of the most elegant and
polished user interfaces in the Android
ecosystem and it does a great job in
matching with the phone's elegant design
but sadly at a price you can easily
switch off if we start with the good
stuff the email application is second to
none
great use of the screen real estate with
intuitive filters that make your way
around quite simple and productive since
also has a great selection of widgets
that lots of manufacturers are still
struggling to replicate the fact that
contact cards filter the person's social
network email activity feeds and
everything you care about also raises
the bar when compared to similar
competing devices small little details
like the ring lock screen and the
different filters in the app tray make
the user interface unlike any other
sadly as much of a fan as I am of HTC
Sense the problem that everybody has
with it is how it slows down the device
sense for is far better when it comes to
how it performs when compared to the
past iterations we had but it's still
not as fluid as the stock Ice Cream
Sandwich experience that it plans to
improve upon it packs a quad-core
processor that benchmarks better than
almost every phone in the market but it
feels no faster than any dual-core phone
and day to day use things like the
multitasking UI look nice and unique but
if I had a choice between quad-core
speed or flashy eye-candy
I know a lot of you would agree with me
and sticking to the basics the fact that
there's always a persistent menu button
covering a good portion of the pixels
just makes you wonder if the
I will start out enough all these
features made sense when Android didn't
look as cool back in the Froyo days but
things are very different with Ice Cream
Sandwich and what's broken shouldn't
have been fixed unless ACC was capable
of improving it now this comes from a
power user standpoint many of you won't
mind the device takes one more second to
load a folder to launch the app tray
some of you don't even like the Tron ish
and blueish design that stock Ice Cream
Sandwich and jelly bean brains so if
you're looking for the device that will
probably bring you more out of the box
and you don't need to be installing
stuff you get the best widgets and
everything since 4.0 is definitely for
you so let's talk about the rest of the
user experience the 1x being one of the
top smart phones in the market delivers
in a lot of places it should the camera
for example is one of its high points
it's extremely quick to launch in the UI
allows for quick video recording and
even taking photos while you're filming
which is really awesome the resulting
photos are in simple terms very good but
you'd have to get a Galaxy s3 or an
iPhone 4s and you want the perfect
camera on a smartphone I will praise its
low-light performance when using the
flash though as I find a far superior to
any competing device so far video
recording is also very good
where 1080p does a similar job to any
mid-tier consumer camcorder you no
longer need to buy now what makes the
photos look even better than they really
are is the super LCD to powering the
display I have yet to find the better
screen on any smartphone in the market
and I'm really not exaggerating great
viewing angles great visibility in
direct sunlight and it just seems like
if everything was painted on the screen
it's just hard to go back to a Super
AMOLED pentile display after using the
One X for more than a day as a phone it
provides great cloth quality and great
data speeds over HSPA+ and Wi-Fi and I
haven't had any drop calls to complain
about battery life will get you through
the day but it depends on your usage if
you're a heavy gamer you'll notice that
the back of the phone is prone to
heating and drops your battery life
significantly once you start playing
word of advice leave the hardcore stuff
per good room temperature unless you
want to see your battery meter take a
quick dive
speaking of gaming the 1x is one of the
benchmarks to beat when it comes to
performance
sadly Tegra 3 brings a feature you'll
all join me in Haiti see none of the
game loft games that I've already
purchased on the Play Store compatible
with it
you can't even install them EA games do
work but if you want to get the Tegra 3
punch in graphics you'll have to buy an
extra copy from the Tegra zone which is
pointed fortunate your only other option
is to get the AT&amp;amp;T Snapdragon s4 variant
of the One X which is the one XL but
you'll lose 16 gigabytes of storage and
remember there's no expandable storage
here now the keyboard is something that
I do recommend you replace when you pull
the phone out of the box and no
exceptions for some reason the past HTC
Sense keyboards were actually good when
it came to text prediction not sure
what's wrong with this one as much as it
does add swipe functionality it's size
is so big that it makes finger travel
uncomfortable or even straining to the
rest of your fingers to keep the phone
in plays while you're trying to type my
best advice to you is to get swifty or
any other keyboard substitute that's
smaller and handles prediction a lot
better
another sad reality of the 1x in year
2012 is the lack of a voice assistant
many of you may not care about this
feature but a lot of us that come from
syrian s voyage do it's sad to know that
you won't get the feature on a device
that's in the same price range as other
devices that do include it so bottom
line what I still recommend that you get
a 1x after a couple of months of use
this is a tough one now that the galaxy
s3 is in the market at a similar price
well the faster quad core Exynos
processor expandable storage and a
replaceable battery I still feel that
the One X has a better design a better
screen and believe it or not a better
user interface when compared to the
nature UX in the galaxy s3 let's just
say the One X will surf both the regular
consumers and non-demanding power users
just fine and the Galaxy s3 is more than
the device I'd recommend for the most
demanding of power users I was one of
those that chose the One X over the
galaxy s3 because the whole package
suited me fine but your mileage may vary
believe it or not the only thing that
this device needs to go from good to
great is jellybean it would bring
performance where
should be and a voice assistant needs
will be solved by the new voice search
and Google now now HTC has been
relatively good at bringing updates to
their phones but the longer they take
the more the galaxy s3 gets sold this
has been Jaime with Parker now calm
thanks for joining me in episode 4 of
after the buzz be sure to share your
experiences with the One X and the
comments down below and also leave us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
