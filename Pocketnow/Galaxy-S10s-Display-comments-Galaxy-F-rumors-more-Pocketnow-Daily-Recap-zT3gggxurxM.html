read them in your voice I know dude I do
the exact same thing word of the day is
Vanguard Vanguard Vanguard Vanguard
Vanguard Vanguard fine I repeat it a lot
I know I'm the type of guy to look in a
mirror and call himself daddy really
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hi Matt leave it up this is
PocketNow and this is the bargain out
daily recap your comments for last week
so on monday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy F there were rumors of the price
tag was somewhere around 1750 1750 yes I
asked you what do you think about the
price tag we had 664 comments I would
fold that amount of money into my pocket
like seriously I I true like seriously I
I truly mean what is the purpose of a
product this expensive I mean is it
gonna replace a laptop like a full-blown
powerful laptop hmm who was expecting a
budget folding screen anyways the same
people who have seen tablets decline
when it comes to price tags because
people don't care about them so that's
the reason I'm like what
hope Apple doesn't sue Samsung for
stealing their price tag all right that
is the comet of the week but on Tuesday
the topic was the samsung infinity Oh
display as the rumors are the galaxy s
10 is bringing a cutout in one of the
corners up as a notch and I asked you
what do you think we had 556 comments
infinity oh no dear Samson I'm
officially firing your marketing
department I would totally second that
actually I prefer a small bezel with a
complete display than a notch or a hole
cutting out the display yes and Samsung
is probably the king of small bezels I
mean and still figuring it out I I just
I understand why Samsung is doing this
their market share has declined they're
not selling as many galaxies as they
usually have so they're looking to
figuring out new ways
no notch no ohh display stop trying to
fix something that isn't broken listen
it's not that it's broken but truly we
all want and all displays or interface
that's gonna be weird like watching a
video in full-screen
having that like cutout that's gonna be
funny but I'm not saying it's a bad idea
I'm like tani just give it a try then on
Wednesday the topic was Huawei there
were rumors of always foldable product
and then the possibility of four cameras
one of them with 10x optical zoom which
I'd love to see 465 comments I asked you
what do you think can we just get Huawei
to the United States and I'll be happy
oh my god like seriously like May 20 Pro
right here review coming next week
probably one of my favorite phones of
the year true why we will be a top dog
in phone business because it's from
China and they sell quality devices for
much cheaper than iPhones and such they
are not greedy pigs uh I don't know man
true but they've been top dogs for a bit
like it's just the thing is you don't
see it in the States but out of the
United States were always huge Huawei we
all benefit from competition and
innovation true that for me that's
probably what Huawei has been doing best
they've been really attacking the market
with great products at a reasonable
price may 20 promo is not so reasonable
but not so expensive either
then on Thursday the galaxy effed up the
stage again and I'm kind of getting
bored of this whole foldable thingy
there were some concept designs I asked
you what you thought we have 300
comments the Galaxy F is a great idea as
long as they don't pitch it as a
cellular device a compactable tablet is
a much safer more practical approach at
least for now oh I don't know
the a non connected tablet why not have
cellular connectivity why at a time when
you could get data plans for up to 10
bucks in the States I don't know if
you've got a point there I really like
the idea of the Galaxy F or whatever
it's a step in the right direction for
merging smartphone and tablets in my
opinion I feel that it's still it is
like a solution in search of a problem
we are happy with our phones phones have
done bigger and therefore that's the
reason why a blitz have stopped selling
tablets pretty much took over and so is
my tablet whenever I want
but I don't want to be carrying the bulk
of a tablet so I just I guess I want to
see how they figure out how to how to
you know fix things like weight
thickness which are things that you
would be willing you're not gonna be
willing to give that away just to be
carrying the tablet that you'll rarely
use I still feel that the galaxy F has
at least 12 to 18 months to go before
its close to being able to be released
as a marketable device I do too I you
know I love to see their their groups
and just how they came up with this
whole idea of a foldable tablet don't
get me wrong it's just it's been done
before I get that the technology when it
did wasn't there I just I feel that the
need for it isn't there either
and then finally Friday we go back to
the Galaxy infinity Oh display patents
are in I asked you what you thought we
had 549 comments a thin chin is better
than any knotch oh my god I'm sure that
anybody that's using the Google pixel 3
Excel right now will agree to that the
cutout for the camera looks indeed
better than any notch implementation but
I would still prefer a very thin bezel
at the top in the bottom and the
front-facing stereo speakers that see
that's the biggest problem the moment
that you give away the you know those
small little bezels at the top you lose
these stereo speakers unless this
company figures it out we'll see I would
prefer this design any day over a notch
and it's a step towards new infinity so
there's that fine true again I I'm a fan
of it's not that I'm fan of notches I
just I don't care about notches because
they are better than bezels in my
opinion so a cutout for the camera for
me is fine but it would be great if they
figured out how to power those pixels
and have that camera only be available
when you need it but that's just me
that's it for the PocketNow daily recap
