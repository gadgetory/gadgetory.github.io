devices are going away from like the
touch pro two are going away from the
hardware keys do you think that that's
going to be going away from hardware
case um on the front facing device like
in terms of like a directional pad and
whatnot okay so we did eliminate the
navigation but we so did keep the
important hardware keys and the reason
we eliminated the navigation was because
we think that we have really good answer
just in terms of finger creminis on the
screen when you have obviously no
touchscreen than you need navigation but
when everything can be done with your
finger it really becomes like this whole
duel know thing that it actually it
provides like this extra decision time
oh do i touch the screen or do I use in
navigation like that kind of thing so do
you really need that I personally don't
think you do yeah yeah I mean with
there's still the important things you
need right you need Hardware cage for
legs have been that kind of thing
because they need to be available to you
as HTC ever considered selling their
touchflo 3d to third party companies I
don't know but why don't you tell me
like why why do you think we should do
that to have more of a uniform platform
or around the windows mobile well so
touchflo 3d is something that we develop
to be like our advantage it's unique HTC
identifier so if we start selling that
to other companies and what makes HTC
unique
are there any works for a front facing
Courtney keyboard phone with a
touchscreen on like the samsung epix or
the trio's that could be something that
we could look into in the future we
haven't said will never do all the phone
like that but we have it we definitely
haven't like announced a phone like that
or done anything to that sort has HTC
ever considered building their own
operating system we always investigate
like what's going to be best for like
our you know our customers and not just
like our current customers but what's
going to help us expand we definitely
don't have our own operating system yet
but that doesn't mean that we don't
investigate it that we don't try it and
who knows what's going to happen in the
future like if we find the right thing
then it's possible that we could totally
do that do you think that HTC will be
moving on to a better chip sense or will
they say with a Qualcomm like that let's
say like the the NVIDIA Tegra or the
saturation oh well I mean so some
platforms may require us to use like
iron ships that's like that and you know
there definitely are some phones that
may require us to go to higher and
chipsets like that does it make sense to
put a Tegra on something you know like a
snap no but you know as higher end
phones become higher and higher end we
probably are going to have to go up
along with that but it's just going to
have to be appropriate on a phone by
phone basis
it's unlikely that you would see us move
like our entire line to you no one
anything you know just like you I don't
think you'll see us move our entire line
210 us I don't think you'll see us with
our entire line to you know like a 14 in
fact I don't think you're going to see
is what very entire mind Oh one single
chick and on that note do you think that
HTC will be incorporating graphics
acceleration on some upon the onto their
newer devices because I know that like
the Titan to had issues with graphics
well yeah what's so I hope Qualcomm I
think I mean when when you take a look
at the graphics performance of say the
touch HD or you know the this year's
bones the diamond to you in pro 2
compared to our older phones that it's
definitely more impressive and so there
may be you know we try to optimize our
software so that the graphics are as
good as possible whether we use hardware
graphics acceleration in the future or
not is going to be something again
that's up to the is it appropriate for
the phone you know is is this thick type
of foam that we think needs hardware
graphics acceleration as opposed to what
we've been able to do with you know
optimized software and on that note do
you think that HTC will be developing
newer battery technologies to help save
and conserve power we don't develop
batteries we develop cell phones
so we still have to buy batteries okay
so if I'm finally free parking exactly
just like almost everybody else um you
know a so as battery technology moves
along we absolutely are there you know
we have a team dedicated to researching
basically the cutting edge of technology
that's available for us to integrate
into our phones so if new batteries
technology battery technologies come
along will absolutely be there
investigating them and you know as soon
as we think that they're right and fit
our costs and everything like that I'm
sure that we'd be on it but we don't
develop batteries okay do you think that
HTC will ever come up with another flip
phone like the Star Trek I would say
this look at this smartphone market or
even the feature phone market today you
don't see many flip phones do you know
but do you think that H do you think
that the smaller form factors are going
away and that the larger devices are
coming back into play that certainly
seems to be the trend across like you
know the entire market and I don't think
that HTC would want to develop the phone
that very few people want to buy you
know you we want to appeal to enough
people to make it with us manufacturing
the phone and also something that the
carriers want to buy from us don't
forget that all of our phones are
generally sold through carriers with
carrier partners which means that they
have to be interested in buying it and
when you look at the vast majority of
phone static carriers you're selling
these days they're not the you know
old flip phone Paramore and so to to go
that route may not at least at this
point of time may not be the most
appropriate thing I don't think I don't
think that that's what the public is
looking towards is a trend okay so some
of some questions I have so when do you
think that the touch pro 2 will be
available in the United States under a
current carrier I think we're looking at
very soon okay we've uh we've always
said that it would be in the second half
and I think a lot of carriers are
excited to get it out the door so I
think it should be soon do you think
that um it'll go along with AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile Verizon and Sprint I can't
comment I guess I better check amount up
will HTC be manufacturing the zune HD
for Microsoft HTC does not manufacture
any devices for other companies outside
of a few navigation devices at this
point in time what about sony ericsson
with the xperia that was something that
we did but i don't believe that we are
manufacturing any further devices forth
and i don't think so and one final
question which device to use on a daily
the hero I have mine this is mine
customized for me oh wow so
that's a that's the 1 i've been using
and rocking out on a daily basis while
it was really thin I didn't realize help
it oh yeah see it when you put it
against like all the nice thin snap
platform phonies yeah it doesn't look
that big does it oh I think that's
definitely one of the things a lot of
people thought that we were trying to
hide a thickness with it it's just not
there but in I i would say that so I was
always an insane gmail addict and which
is why hero has been like the best fun
for me because now i get my work mail
and my gmail on the same phone and i
don't have to worry about like of like a
half-baked solution yeah for either you
know having a gmail with full labels and
everything and then having our exchange
client where I still get like all my
exchange calendars and everything and
being able to flag exchange emails I
don't know about you are you like a
flagger start kind of guy um sometimes
if I if I think it's really important
yeah see like that that is I'm not a
subscriber to anything getting things
done in time I systems or anything like
that but i will say the flagging and
starting is like the only the only way
that I kind of emulate that like I'm not
an inbox zero guy my inbox 5000 kind of
go at it is mmm but uh but I definitely
like everything is kept like flex if
flag der start and you know being able
to just check my starred email or just
check my flag females were added fiber
stars like super important to me because
otherwise like otherwise I just never
been do you think that carriers in the
United State
start utilizing the front-facing camera
over there data network like in europe i
can almost like a video call yeah you
know i would say hey that almost nobody
makes video calls if you look at the the
actual usage rate on video calls on
networks around the world uh-huh it's
pretty love it's pretty small yeah so I
mean now granted they're you know
they're definitely or some East case
with cases for it but uh so AT&amp;amp;T has
video sharing right yes their biggest
sharing but it's pretty much all you can
do is record something and then send it
I thought mms it doesn't actually record
live and that they have a live video
they had true video share right which
which is a one-way video call to my
knowledge I tried using out my phone
other devices and I hoping able to
afford because it that well that may be
a testament to you I think you know I
think it's a there may be a future for
that but in the in the near term I don't
think anybody has come up with the
really with enough like positive
response on it for us to see a lot of
development on that in the US maybe it's
possible when the bulk of carriers
switched to LTE and I just started
piecing that unified technology we might
maybe see something like that because
it'll be easier to do cross network
stuff but right now you're pretty
limited to like one network and then
tulman do you think that sprint will
kind of go to the y maximan like
eighteen t and other companies
LTE um I I mean I only know what they've
announced well so if you look at it
almost well whatever ATT and Verizon
have been vocal about LTE t-mobile
because of their of you know their
international cause have said things
about a LTE but haven't been like as
quite as vocal about it and sprint has
talked a lot about why max but not said
anything about whether that's the only
technology that they expect to use so I
think that we'll have to see I'm which
which Annette you know which technology
which network everybody feels that
they're going to they're going to bet on
you know it's possible that if you know
everybody in the whole world chooses
healthy except for a couple of carriers
that those carriers will eventually move
to it but we'll have to see because who
knows right now LT sounds really great
but you know they're there it's still at
that sort of early why next stage like
if you can remember back to them when
like there was this wimax and they like
had all agreed in on the basics yeah but
nobody could agree on whether they would
use like 80 to dot 16 a b c d e f g you
know whatever and and so we we got a lot
of if you look at all the early one max
networks right they're all totally
incompatible exact gray um and it took a
while of working through that before we
got to compatible in wimax networks and
it looks like right now we're at that
same stage with LTE okay where
everybody's decided what the LTE
technology is but now like you know
another all you know there's debates
over which voice compression technology
or which you know what
like you see all kinds of differences
going on so it's still going to be a
little while I think before we we see
like something for everybody to settle
on but that time you know the general
that you'll see people's side on the
standard and whether that standard is
wimax or LTE or you know some future
technology will be up to each curve here
we have this is the touch pro two so I'm
now have you what have you gotten a
chance to use or not use yet I don't
know have you gotten a chance to see any
of these no all right or so and then
these are what will call the staff
platform so we've got the ozone the snap
from the dash 3g all of which you can
see are very similar but you know again
this goes back to what i was saying
about you know us having it like working
with carriers having a history with
carriers even though all these are based
on like the same platform similar chips
that's everything form factor or lay how
all that stuff is slightly different
from the device to device because that's
what they carrier bunted in order to
customize their their experience let's
see
yeah some of these have a church some of
them I'm not really sure I grabbed him l
as I was running oh that's cool looks
like all dying to go ahead that's what
happens when they sit in a suitcase for
email years years huh hey where'd you
delight far far away my friend there's a
reason that we only let the press into
the very front of ever every we have
time to tackle he won't get to the new
stuff you know I think than that like I
think you should definitely this one has
a full charge because i know i just
charged it up i would invite you to take
a little spin funerals i think that uh
it now has done plenty of reasons pretty
right now but we're happy to turn what I
let you take a spin through it and check
it out see what what we've done you know
that sort of thing you can kind of I
think maybe you know the more you the
more you get to see what we have
developed tomorrow I think you can
almost start answering questions about
the products for us in terms of like
where we might be going or you know what
we see as as important that's
