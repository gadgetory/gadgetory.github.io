cameras but not the way we want them to
be Alice claimed that there shouldn't be
delays for the next generation iPhone
and we get benchmark claims over what to
expect for the 1 plus 5 I'm Jaime Rivera
known very well for how much I enjoy
Fridays and starting off my weekends
let's get through the news this is
 out daily let's begin today with
rumors as official news are really hard
to come by on Fridays
remember the whole topic about the Apple
watch next generation including some
sort of a monitor for glucose etc well
there are some trusted sources claiming
that Tim Cook has personally trying this
device now notice device because
apparently this is an accessory for the
next generation Apple watch it is not a
functionality that's built into the
watch now right now it's kind of hard to
tell it could just be that the company
is testing something out just to be able
to add it to the Apple watch later we'll
see what we get letter this year I want
to spotlight over to the Google
assistants as we continue trying to find
value to AI Google thinks that Android
pay would be really benefited by the
fact that the Google assistant will
allow you to pay for things apparently
now you will be able to have
peer-to-peer payments by just using your
voice and Google assistant will be smart
enough to detect it that's your voice
and transfer your money obviously there
is a lot of security concerns here I
hope that they include some sort of a
fingerprint scanning option I could be
wrong time will tell I thought about the
oneplus 5 those of you wondering exactly
how oneplus will innovate in
specifications we've got some benchmarks
to claim the snapdragon 835 which is
expected 60 good bytes of ram which is
great it'll start at 64 gigs of storage
which is awesome but those of you
waiting for a better display not that
the previous one was bad but apparently
the company will stick to 1080p you know
what I'm not complaining I use the
Galaxy s8 on 1080p and it is enough but
anyways we'll see and for those of you
that have been tracking all the rumors
of the next generation iPhone iPhone 8
iPhone X whatever is going to be called
one of the major topics was the fact
that apparently it will be delayed
because Apple is struggling to figure
out displays and the whole embedding on
the fingerprint scanner valley with all
the changes that Apple has made this
phone will be on time analysts trusted
zone will be available at launch states
usually as a typical timeframe that
Apple does late September so it could
just be that we won't find any delays or
just Apple will tell us the phone is out
and then we'll have the same issue where
the phone is not available for sale
we'll see and finally the very hot news
do they have to do with the next
generation Galaxy Notes which we're
already dubbing the Galaxy Note 8 it
seems that this phone has to bring a
dual camera according to analysts there
is no way that Samsung is going to
compete with the stone unless it
includes that feature the problem is
that according to their sources this
dual camera will bring 3x optical zoom
which well we've got 2 X optical zoom in
the iPhone 7 plus and I will tell you
from my experience I never use it never
use it so I'm sad to hear that it might
not be the wide-angle camera that we
love from the LG G 6 or the fact that we
get that monochrome camera for huawei
but it leads me to the question of the
day tell us do you want optical zoom on
the next-generation Galaxy Note or would
you like some other feature and like
they see us I would prefer the
wide-angle but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinions

video is filmed but levels I'm talking
