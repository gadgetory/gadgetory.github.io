OLED is definitely happening Google has
just made a bevy of changes to its
services ahead of its event and Lego is
clearly invested in launching seriously
in the United States I'm Jaime Ravenna
and I was clearly invested in going out
over the weekend to the city and it's
pouring rain make you fall
this is Fargo Nell Daly the official
news today begin with deals those of you
in the market for an HTC smartphone and
I highly recommend the HTC 10 device is
currently on sale for the next eight
days you will be able to get it for $150
off and if you can't afford that one you
can also go for the one a9 which has
significant deals as well that's
actually not such a bad phone deals that
have nothing to do with your particular
pocket one thing that we hear is that
Spotify is very interested in acquiring
SoundCloud now this is a rather
interesting shake up because of
SoundCloud is currently being valued at
a 700 million dollars and I wonder
exactly why these companies that are
valued and so much money but then again
imagine the potential of Spotify and
SoundCloud matching together let's just
hope that this in hinder would
soundcloud is famous for right now and
speaking of companies that want to do
something interesting Lego has pretty
much just teased the fact that as of
October 19 we can expect full-blown
United States presence and what this
does involve well it could involve the
company bringing us some of its
smartphones which is great but that
doesn't change there you have to know
that Lego is also working on buildings I
don't know vehicles bicycles and the
teaser actually shows us a lot of that
so stay tuned that's gonna be
interesting let's move the spotlight
over to Google as the company has just
announced a couple of major changes to
its existing platforms ahead of its
event happening next Tuesday so for
example in Google Maps now you have
voice commands invitation for you to be
able to navigate hands-free addition you
can also integrate Google Calendar to
Google Maps in a way for you to know
where you're supposed to be how long
it'll take you to get there etc etc we
also notice that Google just changed the
name of Google
and there's a broad list that you can
learn more about on the links of the
discretion and finally the very hot news
today have to do with the iPhone 8 and
sharp
remember Foxconn acquired sharp and the
rumors were that the company was going
to invest in OLED and according to
trusted sources the whole purpose has
been confirmed or they say that it's
going to be about the iPhone 8 we know
that Apple plants make some major
changes in its next iPhone it'll be the
first time that Apple adopts OLED we see
it in the Apple watch everyday but it
seems that it's finally ready to bring
it to the iPhone and remember the next
generation iPhone is supposed to be 10
years of iPhone major changes coming but
it leads me to the question of the day
do you believe that OLED is crucial for
this feature iPhone do you think that
it's a major thing that should happen in
my case I do believe so the at a
coloured gamut of the iPhone 7 is great
but it's still not at the level of
AMOLED leave us a comment down below
