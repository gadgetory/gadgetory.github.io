be manufactured closer to home the one
plus 3t is set to take over in certain
specific markets and HTC and Google have
just partnered to give the vive a whole
new meaning
I'm hi melody vana and don't you just
hate it when you're just too confused to
know what day that is this is pocket out
daily the official news today begin with
deals as Amazon always takes the cake
when it comes to its Black Friday
offerings the company has just announced
35 days of deals starting today ending
on December 22nd there will be a new
deal almost every five minutes
that's insane but yeah you should take
advantage as well the spotlight over to
Qualcomm as the company has announced
two things number one its first ten
nanometer processor the Snapdragon 835
forget about the 830 and all the other
monikers it seems that this is the
future it was made in conjunction with
Samsung the other thing the company
announced is its new Qualcomm quick
charge for which apparently will give
you up to 50 percent charge within 15
minutes that's great but even more
interesting is how the company touts
that this is a safer protocol than quick
charge 3 yeah that's interesting let's
talk about HTC and Google obviously the
HTC vive continues to be pretty much our
favorite VR headset of the year if you
call it a VR headset because it's so
much more than that but well Google just
took advantage of that companies have
collaborated with apps in the past but
now we've got Google Earth for VR and
pretty much the experiences immerse
yourself in the vibe and travel
everywhere you want it is really cool
you can learn more than the link in the
description and for those of you that
are impressed with everything that
oneplus announced with the 1 plus 3t I
am too we are already working on our
review that phone screams but for those
of you that are wondering exactly what
will happen to the 1 plus 3 that
actually depends on your market if
you're in the United States or Europe
the 1 plus 3t will replace the 1 plus 3
and then you can get the 3 in every
other markets so yeah you'll be paying
30 bucks more in these markets but I
think it's worth that and finally the
very hot news that they have to do with
Apple and the possibility of building
iPhones in the United States these
than talks that have been happening for
the past six months and apparently
Foxconn has come to the realization that
yes the company can invest in the US and
it's now going to be economically
feasible in the case of Pegatron
apparently that's not going to be the
case or at least it's not confirmed yet
but this is really awesome it's also a
political topic over how many iPhones
are manufactured outside or smartphones
per se which leads me to the question of
the day what do you think do you like
the idea of iPhones being manufactured
in the United States in my case I will
be honest with you I love it
number one it's great for Apple to use
its own talent to build products that's
great but second is the fact that Apple
is always struggling to meet demand so
the more the company can build in
different countries the better leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know

goes if you want to get the news earlier
