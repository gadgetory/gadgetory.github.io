pocketnow.com today I've just got a
quick little video to show you
launcherpro an alternate launcher for
your nexus one or any Android to device
let's go take a look alright this is a
watcher pro beta it is in beta right now
its version 0.3 point zero this version
lets you do a couple cool things I'd
like to spend a little bit of time on a
little bit later on in the video now if
you don't know what a launcher is it's
basically your home screen it's what you
use to launch your applications in this
case it replaces the stock launcher and
i'm using android 2.1 cyanogenmod flavor
in fact launcher pro beta comes
pre-loaded with the latest cyanogenmod
rom you do need android 2.0 higher and
it adds some benefits and features and
just some overall polish to your
launcher scrolling between home screens
is a lot smoother a little bit more
animated you've got thumbnail previews
of all of your screens just like with
HTC sense you can configure your home
screens right now I'm running five but
you can have as few as one or as many as
seven you've got some more interesting
flying effects in your app drawer and a
shortcut doc that's the really cool part
about this app so let's take a look at
that first of all you get to it by
hitting the home button and you can see
this is just a regular looking screen I
can scroll between screens really quick
but down here at the bottom you'll
notice I've got my app drawer icon
there's that fly in effect fly back
you'll notice that instead of just
having the dots over on the left and
right hand sides I've got little app
icons and if I scroll over to the next
screen you'll see that those remain
stationary these are the most frequently
used apps that I use so I've gone in and
I have reconfigured what comes installed
by default with my own apps and to do
that it's really easy you tap and hold
comes up with a shortcut selector and
come in and pick an application from the
applications list and there's all of
your preinstalled applications you can
choose a bookmark you can choose just
about anything so it's really neat now
the reason I like that is in previous
versions they had your messaging app or
your SMS app that was just stuck there I
don't use that I use google voice so now
i can have google voice right there and
i've got access to all my voicemails and
my text messages really close to the
touch of a button you'll notice that
this is very similar to what they're
doing the Froyo but with froyo you've
got only two icons and as far as I can
tell they're not configurable you've got
phone and you've got browser that's it
well in this case I like contacts better
than phone because I have access to my
phone from my contacts app and what if
I'm using a different browser in this
case I'm using fake chrome which is just
a chrome icon that launches the default
browser but if I were using dolphin or
some other browser I might want to have
that shortcut in there instead so I can
configure that it's really nice you can
also pinch to zoom and it will show you
thumbnails of all of your current home
screens you can even configure which
home screen is the home home screen or
the default home screen in my case I
always put that right in the middle so I
have equal number of screens to the left
and to the right but that's really neat
you can just tap to quickly go to
another screen and tap to navigate back
really cool little app you can try it
out and if you don't like it that's cool
you can uninstall it and go back just be
advised as with any launcher you're
going to have the default number of and
the default type of icons on your screen
so if you want to switch back to the
other one no problem you uninstall it
you're good to go but you're going to
have to reconfigure that new or the
default launcher at that point with all
of your icons you're going to have to
put them back in put your widgets back
on the screen which really isn't a
problem it's just a little bit
inconvenient last but not least I want
to show you the prep
here you can set the number of screens
currently at set to 5 and the default
screen if you change either one of these
you'll need to reload the launcher app
again inconvenient but not a big deal
you can enable rotation so you can have
it in landscape mode a lot of the
launchers they're stuck in portrait you
can't turn your screen which if you're
in a car with a car dock that's
inconvenient to have your maps in
landscape and then your desktop in
portrait it's just not not that handy so
like I said this is launcher pro beta
version 0.30 and giving you a hands-on
look at it I'm Joe Levi for
