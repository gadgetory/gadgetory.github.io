windows phone 8 device for America yeah
you do ok so this is the atif Odyssey
for Verizon Wireless we reviewed its
high-end sibling the atif s last month
but Samsung hasn't been able to get that
one on to retail shelves in America yet
so the mid-range atif Odyssey here is
actually the first Samsung windows phone
8 device to see a stateside release
let's have a look in the back of the box
here it gives us a little spoiler as to
what might be inside that's very nice
let's pop up in the box it is very cold
in the northeastern United States right
now there's the attivo de sea and it was
so cold when I took it out of the FedEx
truck that it was actually in a in a
reboot loop so we've let it warm up a
little bit also the screen protector
came off there so I placed it gingerly
back on so we can have our little moment
of pleasure pop open the box itself
here's the battery which is still still
cool to the touch here is a USB cable
here is that Samsung uniquely shaped
Samsung wall charger a start here a
guide and I believe that's going to be
the end of the box materials so let's go
ahead and pull the screen protector
right off you're here beautiful sound
beautiful field there's that display
that is a 4 inch Super AMOLED display at
480 x 800 resulting in a pixel density
of 233 PPI you can see the windows phone
buttons down below to explore the sides
a little bit power standby button is all
the way up here under the thumb this is
the multistage camera key which feels a
lot like it does on the t VES coming
around to the other side volume down
volume up the hatch for the microSD card
more on that in a second and we'll hop
on back to the back here this is a 5
megapixel primary shooter capable of
1080p video recording the battery is
under a removable door obviously since
it's over there door does not feel as
flimsy as on any other Samsung device
that really beefed it up here obviously
not afraid about thickening up this
already somewhat chunky phone go ahead
and pop the battery in there's our
verizon sim card right there underneath
is the predictable Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 o'clock at 1.5 gigahertz backed up by
a single gig of ram 8 gigs of on-board
storage but that is expandable via the
microSD card we saw before go ahead and
peel this back protector off so we can
take a look at the texture on the back
very very familiar much more akin to the
sticky much more akin to the galaxy s3
or galaxy note 2 on the back here this
is not the achieve esas polished metal
more like the the hairline finish on the
s3 and the note 2 coming back around to
the front we've already got some
fingerprints going on but let's go ahead
and give it a first power on here 12 got
some reassuring vibration there there's
our Windows Phone splash screen up above
of course we have the front-facing
camera on proximity sensors here and
once again looks like the same earpiece
as used on the galaxy s3 and the note 2
there's our samsung mobile splash screen
with samsung's website address down
below device feels pretty good in the
hand actually it we handled this before
we handle this at CES cos samsung was
nice stuff to show us a pre-production
model there it conforms very nicely to
the palm because it's not afraid once
again to be a thick device there we go
we didn't get this far before this
verizon splash screen and welcome to
your achieve odyssey wonderful wonderful
stuff guys that's going to wrap it up
for our unboxing and quick hardware
toward the Samsung at Eve Odyssey stay
tuned for a lot more including
comparison videos we're going to do a
comparison with UTS and of course our
full review coming very shortly follow
