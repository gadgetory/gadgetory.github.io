pocketnow.com and we've got a really
interesting unboxing for you today if
you're a fan of the James Bond films or
science fiction you may have seen a
watch communicator device that they used
a very futuristic idea were you talking
to your tear watch and you would
communicate with someone on the other
end well the technology exists today for
a watch cellphone and in this video
we're going to unbox the LG gg9 10 watch
cell phone it even has 3G I'm sure
you're as curious as I am let's get to
it and this thing even has a touchscreen
super cool so let's get to the unboxing
and you can get these right now at Negri
electronics calm and let's let's get to
the unboxing packaging peanuts don't
forget to recycle them that is the green
thing to do so I'm just gonna get these
all out of the way alright so here is
the box let's get inside
LG life's good pretty cool I guess this
this comes out I expect this to be a
nice presentation I gotta tell you this
is a very expensive device it's almost a
thousand dollars this is definitely a
luxury item and most people aren't going
to ever buy one but we just wanted to
show you what a watch phone is like
pretty cool pretty cool so but I take
this out and put it aside it's a lot
smaller than I thought it would be it
actually has a cellular radio in it and
can do a lot of functions so let's see
what else we get in here this is a
really nice presentation so we've
accessory over here so we get
I don't know what this is
hmm some sort of charger perhaps we'll
have to look into that later see what
else is down in here and this looks like
the the USB cable used to connect your
computer as a proprietary connector here
all right pretty cool and on the other
side there are more accessories there's
the wall charger European plug that may
be a problem unless there is a u.s. plug
in here I have no idea what this is a
lot of exploring to do and then it's got
a CD and manual and maybe a couple of
tools in here to resize the watch oh
just a little mini CD and I'll put that
back here and the user guide interesting
so you can see some screenshots in here
of what it's like to actually use this
hmm pretty cool stuff so let's take a
look at the watch when I clear the stuff
out okay and here is the watch and it
looks like hmm I guess that's just for
the presentation but here it is the
screen is obviously color let me see if
I can turn this puppy on let's see how
it looks on my wrist I've got kind of
small wrist so don't use this as a judge
it looks massive on fire wrist but for
most people especially people with
larger size hands and wrists it won't be
too unsightly and it kind of looks nice
it's got a chrome finish around the edge
it looks like a standard digital watch
but it obviously does a lot more than
that next to a quarter here it is next
to a quarter and I can kind of put the
quarter right in the screen so it's not
too big where is the power button to
peel this off the side okay I think I
found the power button I think this is
it right here so you put your SIM card
in here where I have no idea I have to
find that out soon but let's just see
what it's like after you turn it on I
think there is a stylus for this screen
perhaps I missed it in the box
anyhow let's see what happens
Wow pretty high-tech here I mean this is
this is really cool low battery I'm
gonna have to charge it see if we can
get past this screen okay so we are at a
clock I'm going to just touch something
and swipe Wow video call this actually
is a camera on it this is amazing in the
United States you're not going to be
able to use this with video conferencing
but if you're in Europe you will be able
to and you can do a voice call you tap
there wow this is cooler than I thought
see if I can go back back again so I
swipe to the right so you have text
messages settings I'm really curious how
you input text into here so if utilities
touch screen is pretty sensitive you can
scroll down this is really well done I
actually expected something a lot more
archaic than this considering this is a
watch phone so we've got a lot more
coming up on the GD 9 10 watch phone
biology I've got a ton of questions
about this how it makes calls how you
put the sim card in gonna show you all
of that in upcoming videos so be sure
you subscribe to our channel and give
this video a thumbs up we back soon with
more on this interesting piece of
technology that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
