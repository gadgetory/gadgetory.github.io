affordable home entertainment accessory
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is Google chromecast Google is no
stranger to the home theater industry in
October 2010 Google launched Google TV
with a handful of partners yet three
years later Google TV hasn't really
taken off last year Google pivoted into
an entirely different direction and
introduced the Nexus Q at i/o 2012 the
Nexus Q is a central device that bridges
the gap between the television and the
devices we carry in our bags and pockets
each day our Android tablets and
smartphones and it was set for a quite
hefty $300 after some backlash over the
price Google decided not to release the
Nexus Q and to go back to the drawing
board
one year later entered the Nexus Q part
to chromecast how does it work how does
it compare to the Nexus Q and how easy
is it to set up that's what we're here
to find out instead of a big heavy
overpriced orb with a built-in amp
Google went simple and cheap chromecast
is a size of a USB thumb drive and plugs
into the HDMI port on a display or
television and it streams online videos
YouTube Netflix and Google Play movies
in TV and music it requires an external
power source via microUSB and it costs
only $35 set up is quite simple plug the
device into the HDMI port on your
television and the USB cable into the
other end of the dongle the display will
then prompt you to download and install
the chromecast application onto your
computer when you run the application it
will discover nearby chromecast devices
use the unique code to determine which
chromecast to connect to and enter the
password to your wireless network for
setup that's it
next is streaming connect your iOS or
Android device to the same wireless
network open the YouTube application
Netflix or Google Play Movies and choose
a video select the chromecast icon in
the upper right corner to toggle between
playback on the phone or through the
television once the playback begins your
mobile device or computer then becomes
the remote for your playback your mobile
device can control volume skip forward
and back play pause and stop
you and other people around with iOS
Android Windows devices or Mac not
windows phones or BlackBerry's can add
music or videos to the playback queue
and all-around it's a great social
streaming experience what the Nexus Q
never really could be however there are
some caveats worth mentioning unlike
similar devices chromecast does not
allow you to stream local content from
your devices only online content and you
cannot mirror your device's screen to
your television but that's only a small
setback for such a cheap and otherwise
very capable device in our short time
with chromecast we can honestly say it's
been more reliable and easy to use than
the Nexus Q ever was not to mention it
fits in your pocket and travels
unbelievably well with the Netflix
promotion the total price of the device
comes out to just over $11 if you're
currently a Netflix subscriber and if
you only use it once in a blue moon it's
certainly worth it best of all more
streaming options will be added to the
list of supported services over time and
what's better than watching PocketNow
videos on the big screen from the
comfort of your couch plain and simple
you'd be crazy not to pick up a
chromecast for your own living room if
you enjoyed the video and found it
