pocketnow.com
and this is a look at the Sense
interface on the new HTC legend HTC has
done a lot to its Sense interface since
the earlier Android devices like the
hero it's much more usable it's got some
cool features a lot of widgets and
overall it's just a much better
experience especially in terms of speed
so let's take a look at it now so I'm
going to unlock the screen and by the
way the AMOLED screen on the HTC legend
is just fantastic the zoom in on the
screen a little bit and right away you
can see the the weather animation that
comes sort of from the HTC hd2 so if
it's sunny outside you will get a ray of
sunshine if it's cloudy clouds will kind
of fly across if it's raining you'll get
raindrops on your screen very nice way
to sort of experience your device and by
the way just a note on this optical
trackpad here the hero had a mechanical
trackpad but now it's a little bit
easier to be more precise with moving
your thumb around on this optical area
and to click on something you tap in and
here it pops up on the screen so if
something to get used to it's kind of a
nice addition and it really helps with
one-handed usability okay so let's get
started this is the home screen this is
how HTC puts together the home screens
out of the box we get the clock up here
tapping on the clock will bring you to
an HTC Sense like clock application so
from here we can go to the world clock
we can set the alarm clock and I'm
waking up at 7 a.m. it looks like
tomorrow over here is the stopwatch and
on the right there is the timer so
really nice sense interface applied to
the clock application it seems kind of
simple but it's it's a nice congruency
going down we have some other shortcuts
that I've added such as a link to call
somebody or an application and also you
get your look your weather and your high
low temperature for the day which is
quite nice it knows where you are I
didn't have to configure this it used
the GPS to find out where I am so I'm
going to swipe to the left here and this
is my email inbox widget so I can see at
a quick glance the emails that I have if
I want to open up an email I just tap on
it and it comes up and there it is from
here I can also launch my entire email
inbox like
tap down here to go straight to the
message list and by the way the message
list also is wrapped in this nice sense
interface so kind of taken from Windows
Mobile actually we have this list down
here we can view by conversation this is
really great we can see the VIP group if
you have people set in a special group
we can go to unread marked meeting
invitations and also anything that has
an attachment an awesome way to quickly
filter your email and by the way you can
swipe the optical trackpad here to move
between these different fields and you
see this interface a lot all throughout
the operating system which again makes
for a very nice consistent feel so that
was the email application let's go to
the left this is the friend stream so
this will tie into multiple social
networks at the moment I only have it
set up with Twitter and it automatically
updates and I can quickly glance and see
what's happening on Twitter and I can
tap on one tweet in particular it will
open up the friend stream application
and from here I can quickly tweet I can
use the sense interface once again to
see all of my of my mentions or I can
see my private messages or I can see any
favorites that I have made so let's go
back to the previous screen over to the
left we have the weather weather widget
which is very functional it knows
exactly where you are if you have
multiple cities set up you can swipe
your finger up and down or tapping on
the weather widget will bring up a
beautiful weather application and here
it is and we can actually go through a
little bit of a demo here so you can see
what the weather animations will look
like the weather animations aren't as
smooth as I think they should be we're
gonna see the same implementation of
sense on the HTC Desire which has a
Snapdragon processor I think it's gonna
rock on the desire and so we can swipe
and see the other animations but you get
the point very visual very nice indeed
let's go back home and that was the
widget all the way on the left now a
problem that HTC has solved is okay I've
got seven screens to customize I want to
get all the way over to the right now
they have that pinch functionality which
lets you zoom out to one particular to
be able to see all of your different
widgets and you can you can tap on one
of the screens and get there or another
way you can get here is just by tapping
the home button while you're home
and this is just a really quick and easy
way to jump around from screen to screen
so I'm gonna continue on my way here
this is the favorite people widget which
lets you quickly dial people that you
call on a regular basis and it's very
easy to add to and tapping on these
lines here will jump you into the full
contacts list which also has an HTC
Sense like interface and let's go over
to the right here's the bookmarked tab
which is quite nice it shows you a
little preview of the websites that you
visit on a regular basis so up here's
there's pocket now you can see the
pocket now logo at the top very elegant
we're gonna talk about the web browser
in a future video
swiping to the right we have nothing
because I want to show you some of the
other widgets that HTC doesn't put on
the device or on the home screens out of
the box so a little tap and hold will
bring up whoops missed it there will
bring up the widget screen and I'm gonna
I'm gonna go through the things mark
with HTC so calendar that's right from
HTC and there are three different styles
that you can have you can have this
color coded version this simple version
or the full calendar and so I'm going to
go into the full calendar and quite
simply this is a widget that sits on my
home screen that's beautiful and very
interactive so I can tap on tomorrow see
what I'm doing tomorrow I also get the
weather integrated right into the
calendar application which is quite nice
let me get back to that and you can see
how fast it is going from screen to
screen now that HTC has added that new
feature so I'm going to delete this
widget and we'll go through the other
ones okay we just got calendar you've
already seen the clock HDC is added
footprints this was also from Windows
Mobile and there are two different
styles you can have kind of the
condensed style or the full style so I'm
gonna click select and here we have
footprints right from Windows Mobile so
the idea here is that you take a photo
of a place that you want to go to again
it will assign geo coordinates so that
you can actually map a you can go on to
the map and see where it is you took
that picture so we can tap on one of
these items we can see sort of what the
notes that we wrote about it these are
all just demo right on the device I'm
going to take that off let's add another
widget from HTC see what else we have on
here okay we did footprints and you can
see there's an Android Facebook widget
friends stream we already saw that mail
here's messages let's take a look at
that and you've got only one style okay
and so here is the awesome looking
messages widget this is this is brand
new it lets you look into your text
messages and you can just flick through
your messages very elegantly you can tap
on one to view it in full screen you can
make a new one by tapping on the little
pencil icon very awesome edition in fact
this is one I probably have closer to my
Center area so I can get to it within a
a quick second so let me remove this and
we'll go back to the widget menu and see
the other ones okay the music widget is
also quite nice and this is looks looks
different than what you got before on
save the hero two different styles
simple style and more expanded let's
look at the more expanded it's gonna
search your device for any music you may
have and complain music right from our
home screen if you have different albums
you can flick through them with your
finger or if you can tap on the album
cover you're taken into the HTC music
application which is absolutely gorgeous
I mean you can flip through the album
art tap on something and play it and of
course the music continues to play
because Android can multitask let me
actually let me delete this all right
let's go back into the widget area a lot
of really awesome widgets as you're
seeing news is something that's not new
there's two different styles simple and
expanded so we can go into we can add a
feed for a particular website and be
able to see the news updated right on
right on our home screen which is quite
nice so I've just added a feed hopefully
it'll work now doesn't look like it took
well let's go to the next one
so we've people we already saw that I
believe yep that's the that's the
favorite people and we've seen that
let's go back photo album which is quite
nice let me show you that select which
album you want to display here so this
is just a viewer this is a quick way to
browse through photos say you've just
taken a picture
some pictures of a partying you want to
show your friends what happened at the
party you can flick through that's my
fingerprint iPad these are just stock
HTC images that come on the device and
just a simple and quick and easy way to
browse through pictures and let's go
back to widgets we're almost almost on
the list here we have a photo frame from
HTC I'm not going to show that we have
the search from HTC again that's very
simple and then we've some settings here
things that we can add so we can add a
quick link to Wi-Fi which is quite nice
a toggle switch on and off and something
else I wanted to show you if I go back
here is the stocks application which is
also quite robust and there are three
different styles you can get a stock
ticker kind of with a simple view just
one symbol or with several different
symbols and it's very congruent with the
Sense look again all of these things are
very consistent and we can tap on one of
the particular stock tickers and it will
load a chart and here we go again with
the beautiful Sense interface with this
little scroller along the bottom that
you can actually move with the optical
joystick very very elegant let's go back
delete that and I think that's pretty
much it for the widgets from HTC there's
a huge list they've spent a lot of time
developing really killer widgets for the
new breed of Android devices from HTC
with this latest version of sense and
couple that with the fantastic new pitch
feature that allows you to quickly jump
to any of your home screens and it's a
really killer interface that shows
dramatic improvement over where it was
before and makes it so much more useful
than any other interface in my opinion
that you can get on a mobile device
right now just shows you the information
that you want and it's all very easily
accessible now with so many different
widgets what if you want a widget
configuration for the weekend the widget
configuration when you're traveling and
always your configuration when you're at
work well you can actually do that with
HTC Sense they've had this on previous
generations of sense you go to menu and
you click on scenes and you can go to a
bunch of pre-configured widget setups
and so we're gonna go to I think this
was play right here and so this is a
little bit more
so you have a nice looking clock you can
set up a picture album there's your
FriendFeed you get this kind of colorful
background music player and bookmarks
you could also configure this particular
scene and save it as a custom sign so
let's go back into the scene mode and
let's go to travel let's say you're
traveling let's see how HTC thinks you
should have your slates or your and
let's see this okay so for a travel
scenario HTC thinks you should have some
world clocks here over here is the mail
application although this is the
different mail application different
view pretty cool we didn't actually show
that we've HTC footprints weather see
what else we have we have music friends
Stream condensed your calendar and then
a blank screen over here so scenes is a
really cool way to customize different
widget configurations and finally let me
just show you the different wallpapers
that you get on this device so I'm going
to go back over here press menu and then
I'm going to do wallpaper there's some
pretty cool stuff that is here and you
can change the wallpaper on the lock
screen or on the home screen and I'm
gonna go to the wallpaper gallery and
there's always cool wallpaper on Android
devices but this is definitely true on
the legend so we have some very nice
landscapes that look beautiful with the
AMOLED display so let's go to that beach
scene that actually stood out and I'm to
click set wallpaper and there we have a
beautiful beach scene as our background
awesome so coming up soon we'll talk
about the other software on the HTC
legend will go through web browsing and
some of the included programs if you
liked this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and thanks in advance for
doing that that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
