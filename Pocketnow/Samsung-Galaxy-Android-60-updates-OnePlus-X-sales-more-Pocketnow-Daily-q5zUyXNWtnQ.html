updated with new devices on the list 1
plus X begins to expand to North America
even with a system that kind of sucks
and the iPad pro is already hitting
production issues even if it barely
started selling I'm high net ravenna and
if anybody can mention anything that can
travel faster than the speed of light I
will record this video slower this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with 1 plus and particularly that
two hundred fifty dollar 1 plus X that
has is very impressed so far those of
you that are interested in the United
States can already order it though that
will depend of you are part of the
invite system because that's exactly the
way this company does things if you want
to wait for non invites that will happen
next month right now invites only and
you should be getting your phone by
November 24 and if you did not order the
ipad pro we don't blame you we're still
trying to figure out where this product
fits in a niche but then again hey
apparently Apple has sold as many as 2.5
million units so far and for those of
you that are in the market try to get
one you better move fast ass apparently
Apple is already running into production
issues because sharp can't build enough
displays and we also have a separate
article that shows us that this displays
in really asked hot its previous iPads
which is kind of odd let's move the
spotlight over to windows 10 mobile news
i bet that those of you in the insider
program have just received the latest
update which pretty much set sit close
to an rtm released to manufacturers
which is great news it means that we are
very close to a final product though it
could happen in december but then again
we also have news of a service phone
we've been covering the rumors lately
and it seems that there are some
benchmarks out there nothing surprising
though we can't bet it'll happen we have
benchmarks two years ago if you were
just shocked with the camera quality of
Samsung Galaxy smartphones it's not
necessarily because of Samson surely
they are doing the post-processing and
everything but most of the image sensors
come from Sony apparently Samsung psycho
self-censor wasn't really as great as
they expected until the point where the
company is now working on a new right
cell technology which mimics I so sell
to a point but instead of green
subpixels they'll be using white sub
pixels for better low-light performance
we're not sure exactly when we'll be
getting this camera but the Galaxy s7
might be it and finally the very hot
news today have to do with an update to
the Samsung Galaxy roadmap for
marshmallow updates those of you that
are in the market to get it well we now
know that the galaxy note 5 will be
getting the update in December lucky you
guys who have an unlocked unit I'll have
to wait for my AT&amp;amp;T variant to get it
but then again for products like the
galaxy s6 galaxy s6 edge+ and edge
you'll have to wait until January and
then everything else is around April
which is kind of crazy as we are getting
rumors that the galaxy s7 will be
available in January as well probably
februari which does lead me to the
question of the day how do you feel that
Samsung has handled it's a software
updates for Galaxy smartphones this year
I feel it's done so terribly so far
because marshmallows been out for a
while LG already beat them to the punch
and this could be a differentiation
factor but then again it's not taking
advantage of it it's doing the complete
contrary leave us a comment down below
