is that none of you would really call
cool or aspirational what you get is a
sea of forgettable neat to designs and a
long list of compromise that you settle
for because that's what you can afford
one company is out to reinvent that
mentality and it's time to take their
new affordable flagship for a review I'm
high memory that I will pocket now and
let's take a look at the Alcatel
OneTouch Idol 3 Alcatel OneTouch is not
new to the US market but its products
have only been famous for their
affordability still the idol 3 falls in
line with a few predecessors that are
focused on raising awareness on the
company's new plan and building
affordable flagships and it's clear that
they've come a long way for starters the
idol 3 doesn't seem like a budget phone
when first glance its matte hairline
finish at the back match with a very
thin 7.4 millimetre profile and the
chrome rings that surrounded give it a
very elegant first impression the front
actually only makes it look better with
its flank stereo speaker is on a
recessed design that elevates a display
in a way that resembles some of the
curved HD TVs in the market the phone
also feels extremely light probably too
light for my taste the materials that
its size actually contribute to not
making it feel cheap which is good my
only true complaint with its design is
the left mounted power button which is
rather odd a displacement and also very
thin so it's hard to feel for but it
also has double tap to wake on a display
in case that's uncomfortable for you as
well
spec wise this doesn't seem like a
budget phone either its specs resemble
it even better the $500 Oppo r5 in many
ways by packing an octa-core 64-bit 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon 615 processor Nats
with an adrenal 405 GPU you also have 2
gigs of ddr3 RAM 16 gigs of expandable
storage up to 128 gigs via microSD a
large 29 10 milliamp hour battery in
we've also got LTE HSPA+ connectivity
for all major u.s. GSM carriers dual
band Wi-Fi 802 an N bluetooth 4.1
low-energy and have seen in all the 9
yards of a typical flagship
we're actually reviewing the larger
model which sports a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS
display that's also enhanced by
Technicolor and that actually shines
through even when you compare this with
the AMOLED panel of the Moto X great
color saturation great viewing angles
and deeper blacks than most of the IPS
displays that we reviewed in the past
more interesting is that probably this
is one of the brightest displays that
I've ever used where 25 percent
brightness on the slider was enough for
my needs for example stereo speakers on
each side are also enhanced by a known
brand this time JBL just like the
headphones bundled in our review box
it was tough not to draw an immediate
comparison it took wearing the watch for
over a week to understand what it isn't
sound is very crisp and even it's had
louder than our experience with HTC's
boomsound
which is great for watching videos or
playing music but that's really not the
coolest trick that this phone can do
believe it or not there's a microphone
and the speaker on each side and the
software is enhanced to allow to use
this phone upside down if you want to so
you can take a phone call from the
bottom or take a phone call from the top
it doesn't really matter it's a really
cool and nifty feature that every
manufacturer should consider it's
extremely thoughtful and very practical
if you're for example driving and you
want the headphone jack to be at the top
or the bottom it makes no difference
speaking of software one of the most
positive aspects of this device is that
it runs a very light skin on top of
android 5.0.2 lollipop if it weren't for
the icon pack and the folder animations
you really think there's a stock Android
and that's really a good thing this
allows for a very smooth experience
overall you'll notice that the
reversible screen controls are within
the slider in addition to other
enhancements that are a plus for the
stock Android experience
the company also bundles some of its
proprietary applications that instead of
providing bloat enhance the user
experience services like whatsapp
Facebook and Twitter come pre-installed
and there's a light bass tune
application that enhances selfies
there's an office suite and a nicer
weather application that provides a very
good weather widget for the basics
there's even a music mixture that allows
you to create turntable scratches
your own music overall if you prefer
stock Android like we do this is
definitely a very good way to go
even though software updates in the
future are the best judge over time both
hiatal Houston and I have been testing
the idol three over the course of a week
in the US and in Guatemala City and our
consensus is pretty much the same when
it comes to user experience this may not
be the fastest phone by flagship
standards but hey those other flagships
cost twice as much we do see some
negligible stuttering the launch of
folders every now and then or some
sluggishness and closing down all
applications as well but there's also
times when you find this thing launching
stuff faster than the Moto X so there
could be lollipop to blame here this
takes some time to launch a game for
example but once loaded and handles the
graphics well and the combination of the
large display with the stereo speakers
actually provide a very delightful
experience for gaming for the most part
bubbly phone call sounded better over
the speaker then through the earpiece
I'm not saying that sound is bad but
it's not a scripts through the earpiece
as when you activate the speaker even
though it's plenty loud for both usage
scenarios itta speeds over my test in
Guatemala is HSPA+ for good and Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth perception were also good
for the most part sadly if it weren't
for the cameras my list of cons for the
idol 3 would be very slim the 13
megapixel primary shooter is backed by a
Sony sensor that provides these in
photos during the day there is also a
decent amount of shooting modes like HDR
panorama and even manual controls but
the resulting photos tend to either
overexposed or favour yellows at times
especially in HDR low-light photography
tries very hard to favour light but at
the expense of sometimes pixelating
darker areas of the photo which is
really a problem selfies also suffer
from these issues in most cases but
that's a common thing even for the best
flexions video recording was also good
and there's even a time-lapse mode which
is very hard to find an Android phones
in addition to other modes
which were cool again you really won't
buy this phone for its camera but then
again I could give you a list of very
expensive flagships that could offer the
same amount of performance anyways now
leaving the camera performance aside
what's a true shocker for this phone is
its battery life I start my day every
single day at 5 a.m. and that at 10 p.m.
to 11 on average end every time I've
ended with 40% of battery life which is
really good for a phone in this price
range and I've noticed that this
performance improves over time and I
think that my experience with its
battery life is the best way to conclude
this review I find it hard to believe
that this phone cost only 250 dollars
unlocked tell me something how many $650
phones provide you with good stereo
speakers all-day battery life and
expandable storage and even on the other
hand tell me how many $250 phones
provide you with LTE connectivity packed
on there are very elegant and thin
design and a great 1080p display or
let's just face it how many budget
phones provide users with innovated
features like a reversible display
bottom line is I think the auto 3 is
definitely in a class of its own it does
a good job at being both affordable and
capable up to the point where I'd
recommend this over the Moto G any time
this device is definitely a good
solution for a first-timer a teenager or
even an adult looking for a very elegant
solution on a tight budget
surely my personal leads would probably
require a better camera but hey that's
really just because of the bubble we
live on as reviewers to get all this for
$250 unlocked and complain would simply
be unfair overall I do believe that
Alcatel OneTouch did a really good job
with the idol 3 for more coverage on the
Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 or even the
Alcatel OneTouch watch in addition to
