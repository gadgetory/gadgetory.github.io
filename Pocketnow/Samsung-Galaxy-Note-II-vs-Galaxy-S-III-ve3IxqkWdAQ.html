videos we're comparing smartphones of
the same class flagship against flagship
mid-range against mid-range and so on
that keeps things fair and that tends to
be what most people want to see
but sometimes the opportunity arises to
mix and match a little to bring two
devices from separate device classes
side by side and see how they stack up
that may not be as fair from a specs
perspective but it's still useful the
buyers because sometimes people need to
know whether they should consider
switching categories if the questions
I've been getting on Twitter or any
indication that's definitely the case
here Android smartphone shoppers want to
know whether they should stick with
Samsung's flagship smartphone offering
the galaxy s3 or take the leap into
phablet territory with the new Galaxy
Note 2 so let's take a tour do some
benchmarks and see how these two super
phones stack up I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow
and this is the Samsung Galaxy s3 versus
the samsung galaxy note 2
sitting side-by-side two things are very
clear about these devices they're very
obviously from the same manufacturer and
they're clearly in different categories
due to their size the galaxy s3 often
feels like it gets close to tablet
territory itself with its big 4.8 inch
display the largest panel in smartphones
but it doesn't even come close to the
massive screen on the 5.5 inch galaxy
note 2
they're both Super AMOLED displays
covered by a Gorilla Glass 2 but they
feature the same 1280 by 720 resolution
resulting in a higher pixel density on
the galaxy s3 306 PPI versus the note 2
at about 267 PPI now as far as colors go
setting both screens to half brightness
reveals they seem pretty close to on par
here occasionally the note 2 screen
looks a little warmer to me with maybe a
touch more saturation but it's so minor
my eyes might be playing tricks on me
also I should note here that I've set
the screen mode on the galaxy note 2
here to standard not the oversaturated
dynamic I prefer for everyday use I
don't have a screen mode option on my
American galaxy s3 here not because it's
a galaxy s3 but because it is a US
carrier variant we'll touch on that
again in the software section but to
wrap up the display discussion these
screens are very very very similar pixel
density enthusiasts won't like the note
twos lower PPI rating but it doesn't
bother me at all day to day from an
external hardware perspective Samsung's
made a big effort to unify its design
philosophy with these two phones they're
very obviously close siblings right down
to this glossy slippery skin oil magnet
that Samsung calls its hyper glaze
coating you can see it's already I'm
wiping these off every two seconds and
they're both just getting smudged up
like crazy so no advantage on either one
there they're both the fingerprint
magnets the note 2 is quite a bit
heavier in the hand it's 183 grams
versus the Galaxy s3 is 133 grams and
it's also thicker nine point four
millimeters
versus 8.6 but that doesn't ruin the
experience in my use it actually made
the note to feel a bit more premium and
that's a feeling that's also helped
along by the Galaxy Note 2's thicker
battery door the lack of a visible seam
on the silver bezel and at least on our
review unit a clicky er more responsive
home button now that comes at the slight
cost of ergonomics the sgs3 is
definitely the prettier of the two in
our opinion with its rounded Riverstone
design though the note 2 is more
streamlined than its predecessor it
still got a pretty blocky design when
compared with the galaxy s3 otherwise
the only visible difference comes on the
back where Samsung has moved the
speakerphone from the top to the bottom
of the device there's the same 8
megapixel 1080p camera around back here
and the same 1.9 megapixel camera up
front even minor components like the
earpiece grille seemed to be recycled
between these two devices and obviously
you can see the LEDs flashing away on
both always nice to see notification
lights on modern devices kudos to
Samsung for continuing that trend
finally wrapping up the hardware tour
that's worth cracking open the battery
door here to have a look at what's
powering these devices the differences
in power source are visually very very
apparent with the note twos 3100
milliamp hour battery dwarfing the
galaxy s3 is 2100 milliamp hour pack now
that's the look and feel
let's talk guts and software as I
mentioned before this is the US version
of the galaxy s3 so it makes it a little
bit tricky to compare with the galaxy
note 2 and its international specs but
not too tricky most notably the galaxy
note 2 is powered by an EXO notes 4412
quad CPU that's the same as most
international versions of the galaxy s3
except running at 1.6 instead of 1.4
gigahertz but it's not the same as we've
got in this verizon galaxy s3 which is
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
dual-core CPU now we've had some lengthy
discussions and articles at pocket now
describing the differences in processor
architecture
between these SOC s so we won't go into
it too deeply here but the X note squad
and the European Galaxy Note 2 here is
the same CPU that will come in the US
version and there's also two gigs of RAM
in each of these devices so it is a
relevant comparison if you're an
American shopper they're not running the
same software though like many Americans
I'm still stuck at Android 4.0.4 Ice
Cream Sandwich on this galaxy s3 waiting
for a carrier approval of the jellybean
update however the note 2 is shipping
with android 4.1.1 jelly bean the newer
software with TouchWiz running on top of
course has brought the usual jelly bean
improvements we've got improved
notifications right here we've also got
Google now running down in multitasking
view there that is and of course the
increased fluidity promised by jelly
beans project butter improvements but
honestly TouchWiz on ICS on the galaxy
s3 runs so well that I haven't noticed
much improvement in UI fluidity maybe
it's just that the bigger screen shows
flaws more readily when they're there
but in any case like the screen color
question the UI performance is almost
identical between these two devices will
be listing the full array of benchmark
scores in our full review and we'll put
them in chart form so you can compare
them easily across devices but in the
meantime just know that the Galaxy Note
2 scored 13 590 and on to 254 39 in
quadrants standard and Linpack
single-thread 63.8 Linpack multi-thread
92.3 19 and smart bench 2012 4994 those
scores beat out those of our US and
international galaxy s3s handily so how
does that performance translate to
real-world use well this is the boring
part to some and the exciting part to
others whatever the case it wouldn't be
a comparison video without a boot time
test and a launch off so in the real
world you want your phone to start
quickly and you want apps to launch
quickly so let's boot
first power button is on the right on
both these devices 1 2 3 boom there's a
Galaxy Note verizon version takes
another second you have to hold the
button actually longer on that version
that is always interesting to see when a
carrier or a manufacturer makes that
decision to change that timing and why
now we're going to sit through some
carrier splash screen on the left
obviously whereas the unlocked version
on the right is obviously going to boot
more quickly also these devices are not
fresh out of the box the one on the left
has been my daily driver for quite a
while so it's got a few more apps than
the note 2 but the note 2 have been
testing pretty aggressively for the past
few days and it is loaded up with apps
as well so obviously not a scientific
test but also very nice and there's the
US version also very nice too to use
some phones that have actually had some
use put on them and are not still in a
factory fresh condition which also
doesn't tell us much so we don't feel
too badly about that now app launch
speeds are also important now some are
more important than others we've kind of
gone through the boot sequence here
we're connected to a Wi-Fi network on
each side that's nice let's go ahead and
launch the camera most important you
don't want a lot loulou's any shots
sorry about the glare here 1 2 3 boom
almost immediate launch on almost an
identical launch time rather on each one
the Galaxy Note 2 still in tips mode
still giving me some some advise I
haven't disabled these yet because I'd
like to be reminded of the new features
in the camera which we'll talk about a
little bit later let's pop open our
email if we can 1 2 3 boom stock email
app boom very very very similar launch
times let's pop open the dialer got to
make phone calls even in this day and
age 1 2 3 boom very nice and let's not
go ahead and open the stock browser
we're not going to do Chrome even though
that's becoming the stock browser on
many Android devices go ahead and find
us the internet browser itself 1 2 3
boom this is Samsung's stock browser
this one for some reason loading into
XDA I guess I was over there yes a webOS
story now while we have the browser's in
our mind right now we're going to go
ahead and load pocketnow.com just to see
load times of course we're using the
same Wi-Fi hotspots we're competing for
bandwidth not a scientific check once
again we're just interested in how the
browser's load the page speedily or not
one two three boom this is not a race
we're just seeing how the full version
of pocketnow.com loads the Galaxy Note 2
decidedly ahead here it's just doing a
little bit of scrolling while the page
is loading some gaps in the page showing
up on each now the galaxy s3 is
indicating done before the Galaxy Note 2
which is still actually loading up here
if you can check and now it is done as
well alright so a couple seconds of
disparity there not really anything to
write home about let's do the double tap
to zoom check I don't know why we're
getting this brightness difference here
all of a sudden sorry about that that is
not a reflection of the screen that is a
setting change that may have happened in
between takes here I will fix that
anyway scrolling performance is looking
pretty nice here let's get them decked
back down here we'll fight the glare for
a second do a little bit of this very
very nice very nice and fluid on each
browser the page is being rear-ended in
more with more than acceptable speed
scroll test there double tap for a
column zoom pretty responsive the note
doing a more intelligent column zoom I
think but minor differences really
really excellent browser performance
from both of these devices finally why
don't we go ahead and hop into a
third-party app here I'm no gamer but
occasionally I do like to fly around so
let's make that Air Wing tap on the same
we should have comparable launch times
here and I don't think I remembered to
trim this
of course I didn't so the note to
everyone settle down yes yes yes we like
rock music the note to launching just to
maybe a second faster there to a new
game Trinity mission carried a landing
yes I will go ahead and perform that
carrier landing f-18 Hornet sounds great
to me I'll do it over here while we're
waiting for that to load we'll do it in
the galaxy s3 as well continue f-18
Hornet sounds excellent to me select
aircraft loads the mission comparable
times here there we go game isn't this
game isn't actually formatted properly
for either of these screens it is it
does do a little bit of stretching here
and there we have accelerometer based
yes yes yes yes yes thank you for the
tutorial please skip it and you can tell
here maybe you can't graphic performance
just just just fine with this very low
impact game this is just to show the
devices are equally competent on average
entertainment apps I suppose I could
just as easily open Angry Birds and show
you that obviously the quad-core
powerhouse inside the note 2 is a real
beast here we'll have to evaluate its
true gaming performance in another venue
one thing to note though as this applies
to media as well the note 2's
speakerphone considerably louder than
the galaxy s3
and BAE's here maybe I let this rattle
now I'm gonna crap anyway there we go
while we're on the subject of graphics
we haven't had time to fully evaluate
the note two's camera yet but it
definitely seems on par with the Galaxy
s3 is which makes sense considering that
it looks like it could be the same model
the software though has undergone some
tweaks you can see that burst shot no
longer requires selecting a special mode
you just hold down the shutter button
and you have extra shooting modes
available here as well compared to the
sgs3
at least the American version here with
best photo and best faces showing up
those options not available in the sgs3
but we wouldn't be surprised to see them
eventually pop up when jellybean arrives
to America's Shores finally and very
quickly we would be remiss not to point
out the note 2's other huge
differentiator the s-pen it's not your
grandfather's stylus and the amount of
added functionality it brings is rather
extreme whether you find that added
functionality useful or not is another
question one you can answer by watching
our s-pen lesson video from last week
but it's definitely a point in the note
twos camp so after our first hands-on
with the Galaxy Note 2 at Aoife in
Berlin a lot of internet commenters were
saying the same thing we were thinking
the note 2 is a lot more similar to the
Galaxy S 3 then the original note was to
the Galaxy S 2 samsung has really pulled
no punches in trying to convey the
message that these two devices are not
just in the same family but are actually
very very close siblings so that might
be a push toward making the phablet
form-factor more of a mainstream concept
and if so it's easy to hazard a guess
that it might work in this case because
s-pen aside the note 2 is very very much
a blown-up Galaxy s3
and that's a good thing as far as we can
tell so far thanks for watching
everybody this has been Michael with
pokken out
be sure and stay tuned for our full
review of the Galaxy Note 2 later in the
week there also be a lot of feature
articles and in-depth videos leading up
to that review and following that review
so keep it locked to pocketnow.com for
that leave us a comment at pocketnow.com
if you have something to say if you want
to follow us on Twitter you should do
that pocket now tweets is the twitter
account name you want to follow me do it
at your own risk at captain 2 phones
really though thank you very much for
watching throw us a like if you liked
the video we'll look forward to bringing
you more a Galaxy Note 2 coverage and
every kind of mobile coverage in the
days weeks months and years ahead thanks
again for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
