display fingerprint sensor for the
Galaxy Note 9
it seems that Android has gained more
loyalty from consumers than iOS in the
recent study and for all of you gamers
fortnight is now coming to iOS devices
I'm Jaime medley that I and can somebody
explain to me why it takes so long to
get from Monday to Friday and then once
we get to Friday it's so close to Monday
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals to a certain
degree I mean if you're in the market
for the Galaxy S line and s9 plus and
remember our review is already live
you've probably noticed that in that
t-mobile go I think that's the name of
the product their program well you saw
that you have to pay a hundred twenty
dollars down and then thirty bucks a
month and everybody was like $120 so hey
right now and the company is already
making adjustments you don't have to pay
anything down and then 37 bucks a month
for two years so yeah they're just the
looting the 120 bucks but yeah they're
diluting the 120 bucks it's just seven
extra dollars and for those of you that
have been following the news about VEVO
and II know all their crazy designs for
smart phones that we actually want to
leave from China we've got two smart
phones that are coming both within this
play fingerprint sensors apparently one
of these is including a knotch if you
are in the market for anything special
and different apparently they will be
available as soon as March 13 to pretty
much a week away not exactly sure but we
will confirm as soon as we get the news
obviously we're not sure if they're
gonna leave Lee in China and come to the
United States now in some very
interesting studies lately we hear that
Android has found more loyalty than iOS
and buying patterns apparently a recent
survey noticed that at least 5% of
people prefer Android / io s for the
last couple of months we're talking
December January and the reason why the
news are interesting is because can you
remember when the iPhone 10 was launched
yeah November so how could it be that
you know after the launch frame of the
iPhone 10 which is usually the time when
Android phones so the least we've got a
5 percent difference in consumer loyalty
for Android
that's rather interesting and it could
be the reason why Apple is struggling
right now with the sales of the iPhone
10 and the only reason why I'm including
the news of a game in the daily is
because I see my kids playing this every
day fortnight is now making its move to
iOS signups begin as soon as next week
and for those of you that don't know
what fortnight is where have you been
like seriously I mean this game is
really cool it's been available for ps4
and for PC and now it makes a move to
iOS graphics are a little different but
the concept is pretty much the same I
can't wait to give it a try
yeah and finally the very interesting
news today I have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 particularly because now
we have kg iseman she quote providing
some predictions and it seems that there
will not be an in display fingerprint
scanner it's not necessarily because the
technology doesn't exist it does the
only problem is well notes need to sell
in volume as compared to any other
product out there so apparently the
technology won't be ready to be produced
in that amount of mass until early 2019
so it seems the Galaxy Note 9 is going
to be yet again another galaxy s 9 with
a couple of extra features in a pen I'm
not necessarily pointing that to be a
bad thing but in today's question let us
know what do you think do you think that
it's about time that Samsung figures is
out or now that the fingerprint scanner
placement has been fixed on the Galaxy
as a 9 are you ok with it in my case I'm
not gonna lie I'm ok with it the way it
is but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
if you want to get the news early or
photo was I'm talking out on comments or
after a travel but hang this button up
here and watch yesterday's parking out
daily up here in our review of the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus down here you'd
