this is the one plus 60 McLaren one of
the most powerful smartphones you can
buy even if not as expensive as limited
editions usually are this is the pixel 3
Excel Google's most expensive offering
in the company show case of an ideal
Android experience I've been really
looking forward to this comparison you'd
think that the price defines more
quality or that specs to find better
performance but there's really only one
way to find out I'm how you might only
went out with pocket now and this is one
plus 60 versus Google pixel 3xl the one
plus 60 took the world by storm last
year particularly the United States
because this is definitely the best
dollar perspective ice you can buy and
then the Google pixel 3 Excel sadly only
one the ugliest notch contest but
there's also a reason why most of us
tech youtubers rely on this phone a lot
see from the back I'll call this one a
tie each company has its own unique way
to have each device stand out they're
both made of glass and aluminum they
both play around with matte finishes of
glass depending on your variant and they
are both large phones that bring heft in
the hand the pixel 3 excel is actually
half a millimeter taller 2 millimeters
wider half a millimeter thicker and one
gram heavier in the spec race the tie is
actually broken both run on the same
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and
have no expandable storage but then the
similarities end there the 60 mclaren
sports a crazy 10 gigs of ram with the
basic 60 starting at 6 gigabytes the
pixel while all variants are stuck at 4
gigs the mclaren brings 256 gigs of
storage with the base model starting at
128 while the pixels starts at just 64
the 16 has around 300 million powers and
more in the battery pack as well
now the pixel 3 accel swings back with
having ip68 water and dust resistance
where the oneplus 60 does have
splattering systems but there is no
rating the
Excel also doesn't just bring wireless
charging but includes the pixel stand
experience if you want an extra sort of
Google home now even if it does support
fast charging through USB see it doesn't
even come close to how fast the 60 tops
up through warp charging and as for
content consumption it's also hard to
call a winner
both have OLED displays but the pixel
has more resolution and quad HD plus
versus 1080p Plus even at the 1 plus 60
wins and having a significantly brighter
panel and also defeats the notch and
chin King with nearly insignificant
offerings seriously if it wasn't for the
dual firing speakers on the pixel the
segment would belong to one plus a
segment war I would totally call this a
tie is in software sure the pixel is the
quickest way for you to get the latest
version of Android but one of those is
proven that they can catch up in just a
couple of weeks now the approach to
Android is different though the pixel
launcher is actually less stock Android
than oxygen OS and as such it's
animations make the experience feel
slower than on the 60 I can't say I like
one more than the other but I will admit
that I do find the Google feed to be
more useful to me than the oneplus shelf
and then I'd prefer the oneplus approach
because everything else is just faster
I'd also give extra points to one plus
four it's more natural gestures I'm
seriously annoyed that you can't switch
off the pixel pill for something else on
a3 excel now even with the added kick of
the oneplus 6c and its internals launch
your favorite gaming you won't really
notice much of a difference both devices
are powerful the 16 will just launch
certain games faster if you've been
taking advantage of project boost where
extra ram is being used to load certain
elements of your favorite applications
another area where I give points to the
1 plus 60 is definitely battery life
sure the pixel 3 Excel will get you
through end of day but then the 60 will
take you an extra day in certain cases
it is just amazing and then it's little
things like the mute slider that I
really love on the 60 even if you can
click the power button and the volume
buttons on the pixel to achieve a
similar effect you've got some nice face
to unlock on the 60 as well along with
an on display fingerprint scanner though
I'd
you find the standard scanner on the
pixel to be a tad faster oh and don't
forget you can squeeze the pixel for the
Google assistant but then the 60 also
allows you to use a long press on the
power button to do the exact same thing
again so many cool things on both phones
and so many similarities so how about if
we talk about the tie breaker that you
think is coming the cameras yes in this
department I will always say that a
pixel is a pixel but once you notice the
results in a computer you will say that
the 60 is actually no slouch see both
companies have their own proprietary
smart HDR and you can tell with the
resulting photos dynamic range is just
fantastic on both during the day with
colors and warmth just being great on
both devices obviously the pixel having
an added kick but it's really not until
you hit low-light scenarios where you
start noticing why we all love the pixel
oneplus does a really good job of
nightscape but once you compare them to
night side on the pixel you'll just see
less noise and more detail coming from
the Google offering now an interesting
thing is that I thought that all the
computational photography on the pixel
would have it defeat the 60 in portrait
photos but that depends on your taste
the 60 has the advantage of a wider
field of view in these and even if the
pixel has more epic results I find the
60 to be more natural and then if you
were to switch cameras and go for selfie
portraits let's just give the race to
the oneplus 60 as this device does know
where three people are in the shot and
adapt I honestly only prefer the pixel
for white selfies as those are
definitely more handy for group shots
and as for video I'm happy to report
that the software updates have improved
audio on the pixel 3 Excel match this
with great stabilization and you finally
have a good video camera though notice
how the one plus 60 is just as good even
in the case of selfie video both devices
have the same crop similar stabilization
and really the only spot where the pixel
wins is in dynamic range in some minor
scenarios to conclude you guys know that
I have to call out a winner but notice
how difficult this comparison was sure
the pixel 3 Excel is made by Google
and it should be the showcase ask the
best Android experience out there but
once you use the oneplus 60 notice how
both devices are not that different I
can't even say that you have the
advantages of Google file the pixel
anymore because the one plus 60 is now
just as capable and let's show both
devices are great phones in my personal
opinion I can call the oneplus 60 more
visually pleasing and powerful but then
I'd call the pixel 3 Excel a tad more
convenient in some perks like free full
resolution storage in Google photos the
only splat left really is the price tag
and this is where even the 1 plus 60
McLaren wins if you were even to buy the
standard one plus 60 I feel you're
getting more bang for your buck here
than on the pixel 3 excel so if it were
my money this would be my pick but then
again if your smartphone is your only
camera that's where things get tough
that's where I feel that the extra cash
would make the Google pixel 3 excel
worth it what about you let us know what
