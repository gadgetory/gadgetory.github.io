fold - but your Samsung where is the
fold one we see new renders of the
Galaxy Note n now showing a vertical
camera array and a different punch hole
and Apple could be releasing an OLED
MacBook Pro and iPad in the very near
future I'm Jaime Matta Rivera and my god
the comments and this whole drama with
Huawei intensifies but we've actually
got a break from that on this show this
is parking out daily brought to you by
brave the official news today are
actually not gonna start with deals
there are actually and that we could
leave it in the first link in the
description as well it's just my god
we've got so much news to cover that
let's begin starting with a new bill
passed by the Senate for you know just
getting rid of all the reasons why
people in the United States don't take
phone calls spam calling in this country
is insane
I actually don't get phone calls from
anything else other than spam up to the
point where it's the reason why the
landline in my apartment is dead and
it's just the worst think about it is
there is a Senate bill it'll charge ten
thousand dollars per phone call
fine ten thousand dollars per phone call
whomever is found guilty I just hope
they figure that out because I hear that
a lot of the calls are actually not
originating in the United States now how
about if we talk about snapchat even if
I rarely do because I don't necessarily
care about it and now I'm gonna care
about it even less apparently there is a
tool designed to be able to spy on you
that was designed and able to help law
enforcement yeah that's kind of weird
but even weirder is the fact that we've
got former employees telling us that
they use these tools to be able to spy
on you too even if you're not law
enforcement
meaning that yeah you're safe snaps your
location all these things were being
used to spy on you that's rather sad we
haven't heard from snapchat over what's
up now let's move the spotlight over to
Ola displays and MacBooks right now we
just got a refresh on MacBook Pros but
it's not the one we were expecting with
being hearing the rumors of a 16 inch
MacBook Pro under the same 15 inch
footprint meaning killing the bezels and
now we hear that Samsung is going to
provide the OLED panels
apparently that's gonna happen for iPads
to just don't know exactly when that
change is gonna come but we're hoping it
happens soon cuz uh yes $6,500 for a
maxed out MacBook Pro is kind of insane
at least give me a better display and
speaking of Samsung let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 ders being
shown off these are not official leaked
renders we're talking about somebody
that designed them to follow on the
information that we've had over what to
expect for this phone we hear that
there's a center punch hole for the
selfie camera in addition to a vertical
camera ray at the back it looks so cool
I'm hoping that it actually happens this
way and finally the interesting news
today are actually two let's start with
the fact that we've got some patents
that show us an outward folding galaxy
fold - coming from Samsung obviously
these are pens we don't know when
they'll happen you know what the problem
is we also don't know when the Galaxy
fold one is going to happen and things
just started getting weird mainly
because Best Buy has just notified
pre-order customers that they're
canceling their pre-orders because they
don't have a date either we have no
information on the fold
we heard that it might happen early June
probably which I would assume that if
you made the pre-orders and we're that
close then why is Best Buy cancelling if
even retailers have a level of
uncertainty in today's question let us
know I mean what do you think aside from
the fact that the fold was crazy
expensive just the fact that you don't
know when you're gonna get it is
dramatic enough for me I really liked
the product but I have no information to
provide let us know if you still care
about this product even if you didn't
want to buy it because in my case I
would love to give it a try again but it
seems that things are extending
themselves I mean also let us know I
mean is what Best Buy is doing right now
worrying you as well because I know that
a lot of consumers will be today's
