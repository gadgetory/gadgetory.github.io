clear the first HTC m7 images get leaked
and the LG Nexus 5 and 7.7 reach rumor
mill I'm hi Mary Vanna wandering of even
Apple employees use FaceTime these days
and this is out daily on the HTC
m7 waited by many and that even includes
HTC with all the recent issues we all
know the device will be sporting a four
point eight inch display that has 1080p
resolution but nobody really knew what
the device looked like we have the first
rendered images of the device and
apparently it doesn't look that pretty
in photos but if you remember the HTC
One X when leaked looked really ugly
until we actually held a device in our
hands it turned out to be a beautiful
device and we are expecting this device
to rock mwc 2013 so wait a couple of
weeks our guys are going to be there and
they will have the hands-on coverage
that you're waiting for now for those of
you that actually use FaceTime that does
not include me AT&amp;amp;T has just come clear
officially on who can actually use the
service you know that everybody
complained because in the past you
pretty much have to move into a family
shared data plan in order to use a
service and now they've officially
confirmed that anybody with a tiered
data plan can use it as well but there's
always a catch in the bad news is that
of your grandfathering an old unlimited
data plan you will not be eligible to
use the data plan or to use facetime for
that matter but what did you expect I
mean typically AT&amp;amp;T wants you off the
service anyways so most likely you will
have to move to tiered now some recent
leaks from Samsung itself show that the
company is working on a six point three
inch display Galaxy Note 3 and just
think about it I mean the Galaxy Note 2
and the Galaxy Note where ginormous
themselves I don't think you could even
consider a six point three inch display
device a phablet that's pretty much a
tablet of me think about it but rumors
have it that this device will be
sporting samsung's new Exynos 5 octa
processor and hopefully we will not have
to wait until the fall to get the device
but we'll keep you posted now Sonia is
now offering six weeks of free games in
their PlayStation mobile store for
eligible devices which include certain
Sony devices and certain HTC devices
that are certified
but sadly this deal has a catch they'll
give you one free game every week but
sadly if you're not in Japan Australia
UK or certain countries and for details
on those countries there are links down
below you won't be able to get these
games as if Sony was really going well
in the United States shouldn't be the
other way around anyways and finally for
the oh no not again news of the day we
have LG apparently working on the Nexus
5 and Nexus 7.7 for this year yeah that
company that can barely meet them as for
the nexus 4 apparently that's going to
be Google's new partner for the next
Nexus lineup which is terrible news if
you consider how bad things have been
for the nexus 4 and don't get me wrong i
mean the optimus g is a great device the
nexus 4 is on it's a good device but
sadly if they were able to meet the
man's we really wouldn't complain so
that leads to the question of the day
which company would you prefer built the
next Nexus lineup in my case I actually
preferred Samsung in a sooz dealing with
this but leave us a comment down below I
have nothing against LG again it's just
their timing and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet roll make sure
you follow us on pocket now calm music
of this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm high memory that again
with a craziest cold ever from Vegas but
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
