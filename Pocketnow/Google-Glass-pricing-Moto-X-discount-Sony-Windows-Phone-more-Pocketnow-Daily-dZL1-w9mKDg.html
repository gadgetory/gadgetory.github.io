rumors on its pricing emerge samsung
executives keep fueling the rumors of an
early galaxy s5 launched in rumors have
it that Sony is building a windows phone
I'm high memory that I am probably one
of my best New Year's resolutions is to
stop drinking on mondays but I don't
think I'll do it this is pocket now
daily let's search they offered some
official news as Samson is just in the
other second-generation galaxy camera
and the reason why I have the space is
because I'm really not sure if it's
gonna succeed it's pretty much got the
same specification is the first one
which was an experiment and that's
really a problem because the first one
didn't really take good photos let's
hope that Samsung brings in a better
imaging processor there are some better
specifications but nothing
groundbreaking so stay tuned for that
and speaking of Samsung company
executives keep teasing on a possibility
of an early galaxy s5 we usually get it
an unpacked event in May but as it turns
out the company's executive VP has just
talked to a South Korean news agency and
according to his reports we can expect
the galaxy s5 to launch in February
which would be mwc stay tuned we're
definitely going to be covering them
until you see live so we'll keep you
posted now let's talk about motorola as
the company has become yet more
aggressive in their pricing of their
Moto X and moto G you can pick up a Moto
X now for four hundred dollars unlocked
and then 450 for the developer edition
which is great and then in the case of
the Moto G you can get it for 180 bucks
which is good but apparently carrier
variants are gonna cost even less
hundred dollars on a prepaid plan so
can't wait to see that one now rumor
that's been talked for a long time
already as a Sony Windows Phone and as
it turns out it seems that Microsoft is
already in touch with Sony on building
their first Windows Phone we just don't
really know how that's gonna play out
with their whole purchase with Nokia and
still apparently Sony is not that
convinced apparently this negotiation is
going to happen by the end of 2014 so
we'll see what happens and finally for
the hot news of the day it seems that
we've got a more reasonable price for
google glass it's not going to cost 1500
bucks according to certain longtime go
glass users it seems that the company is
focusing on bring it a little over five
hundred dollars apparently that base
price will start at six hundred which is
really interesting for a pair of glasses
that are smart but not smarter than a
SmartWatch so anyways that leads me to
the
question of the day for six hundred
dollars would you buy Google glass
because it might particular case I think
I'd rather stick to a SmartWatch but
leave us a comment down below what would
you stand and friends II know the drill
