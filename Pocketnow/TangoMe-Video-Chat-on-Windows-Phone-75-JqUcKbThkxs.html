and we've got the first video chat app
for Windows Phone and that's called
tango so we're gonna check it out
alright so over here I'm going to start
tango and the way it works is it bases
the contacts off of who has Tanglin
style so when you first install it you
got to register your phone number and
your email address and then you will
show up for anybody else who is using
tango and has you in their contact list
so let's do Adam
so it's gonna rain me and this phone
there's a little notification there
incoming call so I hit that and I can
answer and here we on a voice call you
can hear me echo there we are
and from there you gotta press the video
button there I'll mute them for now
so this one is broadcasting video to
this guy they're not both doing video so
if I want this one to see my video from
this one I have to press this button and
now they're both showing video so you
see I put my finger of this camera it's
showing up over there and if I go over
here so there you have it video calling
but we also have a switch to the other
camera mode so let's point that at the
outlet over there so that's using my
back camera and this will work with
Windows Phones that do not have a
front-facing camera so you can still
share video and maybe you can turn the
phone around to point it at your face
with the speaker front on and you'll
still be able to do video calling that
way but you won't be able to see the
other person at the same time so there
we have it
so that's it for tango the first video
calling app available for Windows Phone
mango I hope you enjoyed this video give
us a thumbs up if you did and that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
