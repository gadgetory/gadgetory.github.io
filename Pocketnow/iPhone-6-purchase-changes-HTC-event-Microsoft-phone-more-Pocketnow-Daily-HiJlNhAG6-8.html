to purchase the iphone 6 finally agency
sends out press invitations for a double
exposure event and believe it or not
windows phone and nokia as a brand are
dead I'm hi meri behna and the only
thing standing between me and happiness
is a cup of coffee I need to fix that
this is out daily there are a
lot of interesting official news today
starting with HTC the company has just
sent out press invitations for an event
to happen on October eighth and they're
calling it the double exposure event and
judging by the fact that we have dual
cameras on the HTC One m8 we're
wondering exactly what we're getting
here but October 8th is usually the time
when we get new Nexus products so could
it be that this is really rumors for the
Nexus 9 that we're actually going to
talk about next yes the HTC nexus 9 as
next as nvidia has just leaked out some
official documents internal documents
and these mentioned that the company is
preparing the Tegra k1 to launch with
the HTC nexus 9 as soon as a third
quarter of this year meaning that yes
October eighth which is the event for
HTC could be the time when we are
getting this product now we are still
trying to understand why this is a
double exposure event and why could it
be that you know we could be getting the
next design what technology could be
involved or could it be that Google and
HTC are doing double exposure now in
other official news that are cool google
has officially now extended the amount
of time that you have to get a refund in
case you don't like an application you
just purchased the pass all you had is
15 minutes there's really not much you
can do in 15 minutes now it is official
you have two hours two hours from the
time the purchase applications at a time
that you can claim a refund and the
button will disappear meaning that at
the point where you cannot get a refund
anymore you simply won't be able to the
option will not be available it's still
great that we have this option since for
example on iTunes with Apple every
purchase is final according to the terms
of service and speaking of Apple the
company is reportedly training its apple
store employees for launch date of the
iphone 6 which is happening on September
19th pre-orders start tomorrow and as it
turns out there will be this new
reservation system
we're in the past you would have to make
the line get a cart for whatever phone
you want it and then hopefully get it
because this was not an accurate system
the new reservation system will send you
an e-mail or an SMS for the time that
you can return to the store to pick up
your phone so you won't have to be
making that crazy line for another hours
apparently Apple is also doing things in
order to ensure that there won't be
enough stock and yes we do have two
iphone options that are enticing so
let's see if this new system works
remember pre-orders begin tomorrow and
finally for the news that we still don't
know what to make of it seems that
Microsoft has a decided that it will
kill the Nokia branding which is
understood since all they wanted was the
device and services division and they
are also killing the Windows Phone
branding which in itself was sort of
convoluted to say these are the new
windows phones and you know every time
you said Windows Phones it was just a
long name compared to Nexus or iPhone
for example definitely Microsoft could
have done a better name but it seems
that the new branding will be microsoft
microsoft and it would just be Microsoft
we're not sure there is a specific
branding could it be that it's microsoft
lumia and that's actually what the
rumors claim that apparently it will be
microsoft lumia something but that leads
me to the question of the day do you
like things to be called microsoft
instead of windows or nokia in my case I
feel sad I love the Nokia branding ever
since the beginning of Ages I my first
smartphone my first phone was actually a
Nokia and then again my first PDA was a
pocket pc from Microsoft so we've seen
so many branding changes which do you
think should be the name I would love
for them to bring back the name zune and
just call it soon but leave us a comment
down below what do you think friends you
