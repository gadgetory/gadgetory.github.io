pocketnow.com and today we're doing the
unboxing of the sprint motorola photon
4G so sit back relax and enjoy the show
now the motorola photon 4g is the first
4g device for sprint from motorola it is
a dual-core nvidia tegra 2 1 gigahertz
processor he's got one gig of ram 16
gigs of onboard memory and it's got the
support up for a 32 gig SD card so
that's a total of forty eight gigabytes
let's go ahead and open up the box and
take a look at what's inside here so
here's the device itself which we'll
come back to in a second we pop this
open here then we've got the standard
USB cable and the wall wart and your
instruction manual so here's the back of
the device and one of the really kind of
neat things that that this device has is
a kickstand that the original evo had
and not really very many other devices
had up at that point it gives you the
ability to kind of rest the device so
you can view it easily from may partly
like a movie watching angle or perhaps
using a wireless keyboard it's a little
flap here to slide your finger over open
it and it looks like it's got a little
magnet here that keeps it securely
closed as well if we look closely here
we've got our 8 megapixel with dual
flash camera we'll see how that turns
out and we've got some microphone holes
there if we pop the back off of this
phone it's kind of a this is a like a
brushed plastic feel it's really squishy
in here we have the 1650 milliamp hour
battery a slot for the microSD card but
there's not one included and the
Sprint's a sim card which is right here
now the sim card is only designed for
outside the united states it is
apparently currently
or rather currently locked to the United
States domestically through sprint folks
are reporting that if they put in a
outside the US Sam in here then it comes
up just fine but domestic sims are not
working snap that back on nice and tight
the side of the device we've got the
hdmi and charging port on the top we've
got the button and the headphone adapter
over here we have the volume rocker and
the dedicated camera button which I
appreciate both of these have little
ridges in them your finger stays on them
pretty well so far they feel pretty nice
we'll see how they work out in the real
device on the front we've got the touch
buttons here vga based front-facing
camera up here and then your sensors as
well let's go ahead and turn the device
on 4.3 inch screen qhd display it is
using the pintail technology so if
you've used if you see used or seen
pentile in the past it's exactly the
same you're going to have some
noticeable pixilation and then when you
scroll really fast you also see some
blurring and some it might be just a
little hard to read you can take a look
at our droid 3 review for more
information without the pin tile display
if you if you want to see that before we
get to the the hardware review it is a
4g phone so it does have a wimax antenna
in it it says see them it excuse me CDMA
and GSM as we talked about it is about
158 grams compared to my epic 4g it is
slightly longer here and widthwise is
obviously just a little bit thinner than
the epic 4g which is interesting because
this does not have a slide out keyboard
but it's not really that
much shorter or thinner then the epic is
as nicely rounded our rather beveled
corners not really rounded as much as
beveled if the screen itself has a
slight looks almost like a like it
slides in just a little bit here on the
top on the bottom you could hear that
you know the startup sounds it has
sprint ID on it but thankfully it does
not require you to use the Sprint ID
when you first launch the device there's
rendering ginger bed and we can see here
we can scroll through the apps we'll see
how many of these apps are bloatware a
little bit later on in the software
review tegra processor the dual core
makes it very snappy so far overall the
screen looks good and since it's pentile
we should be able to see this in direct
sunlight without too much of a problem
although I do wonder if the color
accuracy is going to be as good as like
an AMOLED screen which will determine
once we do the hardware review that
wraps up our unboxing of the sprint
motorola photon 4g if you have any
questions or comments please leave them
below and we'll try to address them in
the hardware and software reviews when
we get to them and then watch for our
full review coming up at pocketnow.com
later on thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
