the heat in a smartphone market
releasing several high-end smartphone
models I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket
now and this is the LG optimus g pro
review from the time the optimus g pro
leaked it was paralleled with Samsung's
Galaxy Note 2 and rightly so it may not
be the carbon copy we originally thought
it was there are certainly subtle
differences all throughout the hardware
and specifications but there is no
denying where LG got its inspiration for
the optimus g pro the design and even
the materials it's made of strongly
resemble those of Samsung's Galaxy
devices for such a large device the
optimus g pro is remarkably lightweight
weighing in at only 172 grams and
despite its 5.5 inch display the optimus
g pro actually feels kind of small much
smaller than the Galaxy Note 2 thanks to
the minimal bezel along the sides of the
display even so the optimus g pro feels
elongated making it quite difficult to
use one-handed there are a few points in
the design worth mentioning however it
comes with an additional physical button
along the upper left edge the cue button
which is a user definable shortcut key
that mind you can double as a camera
shutter button the physical home button
although very hollow in cheap filling is
lined with LEDs and doubles as a
beautiful bright and multicolored
notification light and the model we
received was the korean model which
comes with a long antenna tucked into
the upper right corner that works with
DMB television in korea the global and
US variants will likely not have this
antenna but it is said that they might
come with a stylus that will talk into
the corner instead the innards of this
smartphone are what make it so
impressive it's a no-compromise device
the 5.5 inch display is a true full HD
IPS plus display at 1080p resolution for
roughly 400 pixels per inch it utilizes
Qualcomm's latest 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core snapdragon 600 chipset it
features two gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of built-in storage with a
microSD card slot a 13 megapixel camera
and ir blaster NFC and a 30 140 million
power battery
the display is not the best 1080p
display we've seen but that doesn't mean
it isn't gorgeous the colors are vivid
and pop viewing angles are great and
it's super sharp the contrast is a tad
low however and blacks aren't as inky as
we would like but it's definitely among
the best displays on the market although
we were impressed by the design or build
the optimus G Pro offers some of the
best specification seen in a smartphone
to date and it's the first true phablet
with a 1080p display where LG truly
tried to differentiate its optimus g pro
is in its software but the best singular
term to describe the software on the
optimus g pro is overwhelming make no
mistake the company thought of almost
everything when making this customized
interface and it took plenty of cues
from Samsung with its suite of Q branded
apps Q translator Q voice qslide apps
etc even the notification shade
resembles the TouchWiz notification
shade with quick setting toggles a
brightness slider and suggested
applications virtually every inch of the
operating system has been customized by
LG from the lock screen to the deepest
part of the settings application
speaking of the Settings app it has been
transformed into a tabbed interface and
separated into four sections networks
sound display and general this alone
takes plenty of getting used to the
amount of pre-installed software on the
optimus g pro is mind numbing a total of
eighty-three applications only 14 of
which can be removed come pre-installed
on the optimus g pro those range from
Google's own applications like Gmail or
Google search and essentials like the
phone and camera to LG's expansive
library of applications such as q
shopping smart world Smart Touch smart
share and many many more unfortunately
we couldn't test many of these
applications due to them being fixed in
the Korean language during our time with
the optimus g pro and its software we
couldn't help but feel the software is
overbearing redundant and cluttered as
if LG was trying a little too hard the
optimus g pro is extremely impressive in
performance both in synthetic benchmarks
and day-to-day use not once did we
experience an instance of notable lag
and standard usage everything from
opening applications to switch
and scrolling between home screens is
buttery smooth but there are some
noticeable animations that slow down
some actions such as opening folders on
the home screen we found call quality on
par with most other flagships the air p
speaker is plenty loud and not terribly
tinny though we did have trouble hearing
people in noisy environments and the
speakerphone is not exactly very loud a
review unit was the korean model of the
optimus g pro it supports LTE
connectivity but was limited to AT&amp;amp;T 3g
meaning here in the States speeds were
pretty dismal compared to either hspa+
or LTE speeds battery life on the
optimus g pro was unsurprisingly great
the 30 140 million power battery
consistently managed to keep the device
powered over a full day the screen on
time varied quite a bit but not once did
we need to charge more than once per day
we found the 13 megapixel camera on the
optimus g pro to be passable nothing
more nothing less the images lacked a
ton of detail and most images were
washed out although the occasional
picture was super saturated and warm in
perfect lighting pictures turned out
great in anything but perfect lighting
contrast was low was quick to overexpose
and pictures were full of noise there
are definitely better 13 megapixel
cameras around but the optimus G Pro's
camera is hardly the worst the optimus g
pro on the outside is far from
spectacular everything from the hardware
design and materials to various
interface elements and software services
are almost direct copies from samsung
top to bottom the optimus g pro is
uninspired but it's impossible to
discredit the device entirely if you're
after a no-compromise experience you
will likely find yourself satisfied with
the optimus g pro so long as you can
deal with the overbearing software and
credible amount of bloatware and
mediocre build quality if you're after
substantial hardware and lightweight
software however the optimus g pro is
not for you we give the LG optimus g pro
a 7.5 out of 10 that about does it for
the review but if you liked the video be
sure to give it a thumbs up and
