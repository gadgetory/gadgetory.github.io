about the Galaxy S 9 we've got rumors on
the horizon and maybe maybe we'll see an
S 9 Mini next year
I don't know fingers crossed a sprint
choo-choo chooses Hulu to fight t-mobile
and Netflix and Plus we've got a lot to
talk about when it comes to the 1 plus
5t our buddy Ryan aka fried face drops
by the podcast to chew through all the
news that's fit to print we've got a lot
to talk about so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode 279 of the
PocketNow weekly recorded November 17th
at noon pacific this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and one plus 5t was just
a silly easy algebra problem i'm juan
carlos back now senior editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer and in one window our
buddy ryan joining the show welcome to
both of you out on the east coast oh I
so he used the same time wrong yes I
think I've been super uncomfortable
Jules well done it only took what 30
seconds into the podcast and now we're
off and running
well the script is hey Ryan
nice to meet you finally we use like
podcast media landscape of course this
is my first time being on podcast and
we're sharing the awkward one year but
apiece while we're talking to the same
microphone but we're also recording two
separate files for this because of
course I don't think anyone needed rvts
that's that's that's fine I think we get
it it's some tech news but Ryan Before
we jump into some news man so you're a
production assistant you've been doing
some video editing and you've recently
started cutting together your own
YouTube videos tell us like what kind of
tech beat are you covering right now and
what have you started with I saw a video
of you in line for the iPhone 10 okay
yeah you know I just want to give you
guys a quick run-through I've been a
huge tech enthusiast since the launch of
the t-mobile g1 I've been falling
parking now ever since Brandon minima
was there so I I'm from the og day to
day og days so a lot of history
PocketNow but I'm I work for an Asian
American channel right now called the
Fung brothers but what I wanted to do
was I wanted to create a tech content
for mainstream consumers so what I'm
planning to do is I'm going to do a lot
of Street interviews I always see you
know a lot of fanboy arguments online so
there's going to be Street interviews
where I ask real world opinions from
real people and I just wanted to
experiment with different concepts when
it comes with tech to trying to make it
so it has a more mainstream appeal you
know a lot of my friends aren't into
tech as yeah we probably go and he's cut
incorporated food into his content as
well yes quite interesting I recommend
that you check it out
also check out our podcast while we're
on the air we're going to be talking
about the 1 + 5 t we're going to be
talking about a whole bunch of other
news that's happened this week so what
you want to do is go to Twitter and make
sure that you're talking to us at the
hashtag PN weekly we have a bunch of
other people on the show right now that
are just getting that conversation up
and going if you can't be here right now
if you're listening to this post
production then you should send us an
email we do these mailbag episodes every
end of the month and that would be a
podcast of pocketnow.com would be the
email address that you send it to but in
the meantime it's hashtag P and weekly
and we'll be on and off our merry way
beautiful all right well let's let's run
into some news breakdown we're gonna
save the 1 + 5 1 plus 5t conversation
for second half of the show but we've
got the top headlines from pocketnow.com
we can chew through those real quick and
get a get the lay of the land on what's
going on in all things mobile indeed so
for the week of November 12 2017 this is
all the news that's fit to podcast there
may be a galaxy s 9 mini on the way but
we wouldn't buy it because it's all just
hearsay for now there's a galaxy s nine
many that's supposed to come with the
galaxy s 9 and
Plus apparently it's going to take on
all the modern design language such as
then Fetty display but again we haven't
seen this model for since the s5 money
so we're gonna have to keep checking on
that make sure that that's a real thing
the meantime galaxy s 18 gots the s8
plus users in the US on Sprint t-mobile
may have had to suffer a little bit in
terms of the Android Oreo update Galaxy
beta program has stopped temporarily to
fix an issue with those two carriers
variants on those devices in the
meantime Sprint is offering up free Hulu
this is in a direct ballad towards
t-mobile and Netflix pairing up for a
free service if you get an unlimited
data plan you'll get a free basic tier
of subscription to cool as well
rock mobile is something that we might
want to talk about a little bit later
but they're an interesting in vno and
they have a deal going on with three
months of service for 99 bucks usually
it's $45 per month and there's also free
international calling texting and a
whole bunch of other stuff and I do want
to save this for later because there's
some tequila involved in this
conversation
not enough tequila in our tech chats I
feel not not going to record midnight
thenn adronis now after that we've never
used it I'm on like Boop and darn oh I
really should be swearing no G is having
its own Black Friday Festival these are
all black friday news but they're not
really like they go pass beyond black
friday in any case if you get an LG v 30
or v 30 plus and then get any other LG
products you get up to $400 back in a
prepaid card i mean it's that simple
there are some exclusions but it sound
like a great deal and yes if you're not
taking advantage of a official carrier
BOGO or
Bobo offer for the v30 or if you just
buy for phones and total like two pairs
you that will count towards the $400
prepaid gift card so that's interesting
nearly four million Apple watch
shipments were made in the third quarter
in the wake of the Apple watch series
three cellular taking on about fifth of
those shipments wore of the cellular
kind and this is pretty interesting to
see when we have competition stiffening
up from Xiaomi and also fitbit's which
has revived its own SmartWatch efforts
in this quarter actually so it's
interesting to see that growing again
Apple is rumored to be planning on a 3d
sensor something more of a true depth
camera that we see on the front of an
iPhone 10 right now that's a lot for
face ID and whatnot
we're gonna see that on the rear of a
2099 job yeah where are we talking about
a year plus from now and this is only
going to expand the potentials for AR
they have a arcade right now and perhaps
they're even be seeing more software
uses going beyond that but speaking of
face ID let's talk about a certain
family from Saks Staten Island actually
not too far away from here who have a
fun time trying to get their child their
son that can you old send from not
running into his mother's iPhone 10 big
eyes so it's a dad and a mom they both
got iPhone tens and they introduced
their son to and it's like hey I'm just
gonna try this face ID thing I was to
see if it's really you know what it's
cracked up to be and reliably and
consistently he has been able to unlock
his mother's phone now there was one
time where he was also able to unlock
his dad's phone but that has been
basically a fluke so we've already dealt
with the
non-identical siblings we had a
couple of brothers that were able to
game the system for a bit and there's
all the other kind of evil twin you know
that's been going on so I mean we're
getting we're pitting down on this idea
that one-in-a-million attempts will be a
fossil of false positive and with all
these little fringe cases of you know
hey your mom you look like your mom or
you look like your dad and oh I just
happened to go into their iPhones as
well because my faces are apparently
that much similar to them I mean it's it
really underscores I think some of the
disappointment where we can look at a
phone like the Galaxy Note and you have
more choice over how you want to protect
that device and and we know Apple is not
really a consumer choice kind of company
they've decided that this is how the
iPhone is going to operate and this is
what we're all just going to use moving
forward but we weren't seeing these
anecdotal test cases and we're seeing
these these situations where it's
probably gonna be fine for most people
out there but there are enough folks
that are affected in this in a different
way that it should cause some concern
and whether or not these people want to
continue using face ID instead of using
like a pin or a passcode now that's
their that's their option that's now
their choice what worked fine with
fingerprint sensors and would have
prevented this kind of unauthorized
access is now no longer available I did
think it was hilarious though that it
was it was it the the father the quote
that you guys pulled from Wired it was
funny at first but it wasn't really
funny afterward my wife and I text all
the time and there might be something we
don't want him to see that's terrible
justification for saying well if like he
has a food delivery app his mother has a
food delivery app and if you know the
son wants to get into the iPhone 10
and just continue to buy ice creams over
and over again that would feel like you
crazy he's like one of the top students
in this class I mean is he's generally
well behaved now my wife has to delete
her text when there's something she
doesn't want Ahmad said look at your
like I really I think this is a larger
conversation in your family about
boundaries and personal information and
stuff this doesn't this isn't really the
issue we're talking yeah I had an iPhone
10 and I returned it because I was just
so dissatisfied with it I was about to
say I was interviewing people yesterday
I gave them the chance to go hands-on
with an iPhone 10 and the pics to excel
and the thing that came with the most is
most people hate the fact that they
removed the fingerprint scanner and you
know hearing about these cases it just
it just blows my mind that Apple today
you know like the inconsistency of face
idea I'm surprised they even like I mean
I'm surprised they even made it the sole
way of authentication so I mean we've
seen this spun by its hardware engineer
I forget his name okay that software but
in any case he was saying that there was
never a plan to include touch ID in this
iPhone whatever it was going to be at
the time because this was good if we're
going to go into the future we're gonna
go all the way and that counteracts a
lot of talk of designs last-minute
changes and just overall confusion and
and worried going on at the Apple campus
because all the use of parts we're not
coming together right and there was
worried that it would be there wouldn't
be enough time to properly test it at
the software level so I mean it's all
rhetoric aside this has not been the
most easiest thing to negotiate between
the company and the consumer and I don't
think if we dug into the store a little
bit more it's just gonna be more money
and I don't think it's as seamless like
what I'm trying to say it's much easier
to spoof base ID than it is touch ID
with touch ID
would have to go like make an extra
effort to get with someone's actual
fingerprint while face ID yeah so just
because you have so many data plots you
have you can project so many dots right
the replica replication rates how easily
you're able to have a you know produce
the same ones is it was kind of like
that's the key here it doesn't matter
how many of these things you have it
just matters that they're easily
replicable and with that like cheap hack
that a university did with the software
with the 3d printing of a mask
it's very finagle II but it's possible
and if there's someone out there that's
willing to put in the work to get the
data that you have great that's that's
an issue well and that's this is similar
I think to some of the the security
outlets that we're doing spoofing a
finger prints so you know if someone
really wants your data they'll go
through that but what I think is
interesting is the same time that we
have face ID as the system to unlock the
iPhone the iPhone actually does come
with the hardware to defeat face ID I
mean technically you could go around
with that front camera system and come
up with custom software to scan
someone's face to make a better map of
whatever mask that you wanted to print
to then get into the device did Oh other
devices to I mean I was at Sony phones
have that 3d mapping built into the
camera so you can send it off to like a
3d printer to make a replica of a
knick-knacker
or even if someone's face PSO some sort
of Heat's metric of temperature metric
or body you know so there's gotta rub it
on your face first and then hold it up
to the phone and you'll be fine but yeah
that's inherent biometric that's not
easily replicable and that's because
I'll still say I mean we kind of talked
about this last week too but there was
one extra piece of safety on a
fingerprint in that you could choose
what finger to use you know like that
that in itself is actually one piece
of security through obscurity is you're
not entirely sure I mean we all have a
pretty good idea that someone's probably
mapped a thumb on an iPhone the way that
that home button works but conceivably I
like when my mom was really using her
Galaxy s5
I think it was I think she had an index
finger bat you know like if you want why
not map a ring finger and that's gonna
be one of the least likely fingers
someone's gonna try to get a fingerprint
off of to then use on some kind of
sensor so there's now definitely a
chance that that could you know release
some of the liabilities off of touch ID
and that's what people but with face ID
if I'm trying to break into your phone
Ryan I'm pretty sure I know what face
you used like lock the phone down it's
not a big mystery I want to just touch
on the smart watches for a bit because I
you know we are we talking about smart
watches but it just seems it feel so
stagnant recently with the demise or the
malaise of Android wear 2.0 and the fact
pere fact that we haven't been talking
about the ionic fit Bionic as much as we
you know the main splash it's all been
Apple watch series do cellular oh my god
look at the sales you know it's funny I
was debating on whether I should get my
first SmartWatch a few looking because
they were discounting the gear s3 okay
because for me you know I think it's
just redundant the fact that it wouldn't
last more than over a day of charge I
mean most Mart watches from my knowledge
they still use OLED panels right toilet
panels but the thing is you know like I
have five small hands okay but uh but
you know like everything that besides
from you know fitness tracking like yeah
I don't I don't need to have my
notifications all the time on my phone
and just having an extra device to
charge every night it's just a hassle to
me so we're you know thinking all about
Fitbit you know I had a Fitbit before
but the problem with Fitbit aside topic
is that like the materials that they
utilize in the way that's not
hypoallergenic
and plus you know the heart rate sensor
has to press against your wrist to get
an accurate hardly reading so that's
just an uncomfortable experience right
sure I mean we're kind of doing the
whole diagnose your problem here right
now have you considered polar Polar what
polar is a maker of heart rate sensors
they're dedicated to that kind of thing
and even looking at a bunch of their
their stuff m600 it runs Android wear
like they've been getting to that
recently so that's an interesting thing
Jaime Rivera has had lots of praise to
go along with that says that that
accuracy is something like I was like a
chest-mounted okay you mean I'm I'm not
a huge fitness junkie and the last time
I used an Android wear device was the
LGG watch you know when it was still his
first initial stages I didn't I didn't
think the watch interface was that
intuitive but I I have been looking at
Samsung's Tizen OS for its gear
smartwatches and I actually think the
fact that you could navigate do
SmartWatch with the clock the bezels
controls are great just to give us some
color these are members from panelists
and it's a 3.9 million Apple watches
with 3.6 million Fitbit was a 3.5
million and then you go come all the way
down to fourth place which was Samsung
but by my estimate it's about eight
hundred thousand units so that's a whole
magnitude and I'm surprised I I know the
hallway watch is super popular I'm
surprised it's not when the top sellers
rain annually they were in the top five
and they like it said here the while we
watch T only scored 200,000 shipments oh
okay which is yeah well is it for a for
this year because I know it's not the
first iteration right yeah sorry I was
trying to be smooth about it now we're
trying to move the mic around it's crazy
in any case yeah it's been kind of
interesting I've lost my train of
thought
they've tried really hard it's not there
it's not to fault them for having bad
hardware they always do an amazing job
or at least you know starting from like
the Nexus 6p
we've been placed a great phone great
ability ever since then they've done an
amazing job in the hardware department
Android wear 2.0 just triples everything
it touches
yes I mean speaking of hardware's just
side note I and this is a very unpopular
opinion but I think for the first
generation pixels I think Google just
should have compromised and just let
quawi slap on their logo and have them
make the first generation pixels the the
lack of facing because I try to
transition from a 6p to to the pixel XL
and the lack of front-facing speakers
especially since Apple emblem started
implementing it last year with the
southern plus and southern there's a
huge letdown
because you know it's always interesting
to see what people are all right so I
was here originally for the oneplus but
not originally for the one post five to
you but but for I think you helped by
pet comm it's one of those event
organizers that gets tech ODMs and OMS
together and you know that they do a
showcase every so often for the media
and this happened to be one of their
holiday season spectacular is and
whatnot and I was gonna plop on by for
that it just so happened that that day 1
+ 5 t was was gonna happen
and it just so happened that I had a
ticket but in any case one of the things
one of the companies that immense at
comm was rock mobile and they've been
around for a few years now it started it
was started up by one of the founders
the founders of patron I think I believe
it was patron and also another venture
capital group and you know he's made a
lot of money from tequila and he just
wants to give back so like there's a
whole bunch of stuff why the original
plans was like they includes like Tolman
three telemedicine services excuse me
and insurance from top partners like
Chubb home security from ATT and so I go
after like the underserved under banked
communities and you know it's just it's
a private adventure so they don't have
things to talk about in terms of you
know having to answer to the board or
whatnot so I mean that kind of tickled
my heart a little bit and they have this
deal going on it's like yeah but this
did well if I'm not mistaking they're
peeing back off of Springs GMA Network
so the main deal for this is three
months for $99 service it's a little bit
voice text and LTE although it's not
even like it's not even like you have a
high-speed data book it's just regular
you go up to 20 gigabytes and they you
know throttle which is kind of standard
practice video stream is 480p to be
expected but yeah that's and there's
also free international calling and
texting which I don't believe is
standard on the Sprint side but I'm
going to check on that and you know in
the post that is wrong in any case
there's also a thing for Verizon - I
don't know why there's a like they they
don't they can't save Verizon on their
site but it's red and it says CDMA so
that's that's one of the things that's
going on so I think props to them that's
my opinion have you ever done anything
with virtual operators other than like a
project v which is one of our go-to yeah
I mean the only one that I'm currently
using his project file and so that's to
toggle t-mobile and Sprint and I guess
like US Cellular that I don't know it
was working through USL territorial I
think the last one that I did business
with was a straight talk and so that was
a before joining the PocketNow team was
actually a while before joining the
PocketNow team so as almost maybe four
years ago and that was back when you had
to sort of specify a t-mobile SIM card
they were they were one of the few
options that I thought did a really good
job of kind of balancing good coverage
with sort of respectable prices now like
the whole MVNO space is kind of blown up
we even got a comment on Twitter you
know someone's saying hey if you're
talking about M V you knows you should
check out ting and I think my brother
might still be on ting but you know it's
one of those things it's we now have a
few options and a few choices for people
to cover we still have to play the same
game though what backbone service
they're on and then whether or not you
get good coverage for that service so
you know if you're on an MVNO that
relies on Sprint I don't know that I'd
maybe recommend them out here in the
valley where sprint coverage gets really
spotty from block to block sometimes
it's awesome and then literally a
hundred yards away you'll be down to 3G
CDMA so that's really the only thing
that I would say is it's not like a
buyer beware but it's just a do your
homework and see who offers you not only
a good rate because the rate doesn't
matter as much I mean like I could pay
five bucks a month for zero coverage and
that would be a waste of five bucks a
month so you just want to know in your
area who you're really doing business
with on and on what towers yeah I mean
like we're going into the 5g age and
everyone's been trying to get together
and improve their networks Sprint has
announced its backhaul deal with LTS a
cable provider that serves a few states
in this in the United States and also
t-mobile has been you know hey we have
six hundred megahertz now so AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon kind of caught you know like
like with their foot lagging behind so I
mean the network can always change but
you want to deal with what you have
right now and Sprite might not be the
best idea maybe Verizon is but check it
out check out the Rocklin thing well
it's just you're just being a sweetie
giving them some love soft heart you
know that's that's that's fair to say I
think at the time like 5g become a
standard I think it should be compliant
I think all
carrier should be compliant in
eliminating any tier data plan I mean
unless it's for a budget plan because I
for a for LT I understood you know like
there's there's a lot of capacity that
the towers have to handle this you know
like where we're getting to the point
where you have to compete with the rest
of the world like either either you
either throttle and like no overages or
get rid of it's your day to play well a
lot of what you know unsexy thing about
virtual operators that they purchase
data wholesale and you know so that's
you know part of the bucketing that they
have to do buy great yeah in any case
Sprint Hulu what which do you usually
use more often who are Netflix what oh
no I'm on Netflix all the time
yeah now it just kind of feels it
doesn't it feel a little bit and I don't
mean to besmirch any of these companies
but if you were looking at not one of
the first or second place cellphone
carriers I think a lot of people are
probably shopping t-mobile and more more
aggressively than Sprint so that feels
like Sprint's like the consolation prize
carriers and then the same thing you
know with the original content that's
going out on Netflix right now I kind of
feel like there are plenty of people
there are a ton of people who are still
on hulu but netflix is making more noise
so hulu starts to feel like the
consolation prize video streaming
service it's like t-mobile and netflix
and Sprint and Hulu you know it's like
it's got like that kind of consumer
awareness disparity between between the
the partnerships to politically inject
think you know things into it but
there's so the advantage to AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon is that they they're they're
farming their own original content it's
in their exclusive pens and whatnot and
you know sometimes they use you know
b-grade stars and that we haven't really
heard of whereas recently we've had to
deal with you know the sexual assault
allegations that have kind of you know
made viewing kind of a guilty thing kind
of a debate and wondering okay should I
really be paying my money to these kinds
of services and you know who
which is you know has all the network
programming there's always gonna be
something you know that you can point to
for a star that's started and then
there's also Netflix which is the Big
Kahuna of original content that's its
own thing so and of course you know we
find a couple of big names that have
confessed to this so it's always
interesting to see you know the dynamics
externally of you know these media
companies getting together with the
tubes with the with the pipe providers
and seeing what happens because if
they're not integrated and they can't
have a bottom line that's jarett bottom
line well we're trying to see if this
makes economical sense for the carriers
and for the media companies at this
point oh thank god I use crunchyroll or
kdramas or whatever yeah well I'm
shocked that like you know Project Fire
doesn't have a tie-in with YouTube red
now oh that would be I totally should I
mean not a VP I need to be a president
of marketing no V just pee and Rachel's
voice yeah and finally last night Minnie
how do you feel about small phones so I
did not get a chance to read the article
and pucking out but upon very little
it's just a whole bunch of waffling from
other sources and there when I heard you
said s9 Minnie I was assuming okay this
is not gonna be a real Minnie s night
it's going to be a mid-range version
like because the last time I thought I
think there was a proper you know
compacts original flagship that was all
Sony experience even the X Z X which was
recently like when was the last time you
thought they released a you know I think
the pixel the pixel is like the closest
like this quarter which shows how much
awareness Sony how nice idea they meant
although aims in general
I mean well I mean yeah but still it
shows how much favor Sony has in the
market which is to say not much at all
there those puzzles because they mainly
sell in Japan and those was to be fair
yeah they're not any thicker than the
pixel - well I'll say this like I said
first impression like I didn't get to I
get to read up on these rumors yet but I
thought it was gonna be a mid-range
device that was probably gonna head to
t-mobile like or it's it's just gonna
sell in Asia it's never gonna come
stateside and there's probably gonna be
some compromise like on the specs as
well like it'd probably be a 1080p
display but from what I'm hearing like
if it does have an infinity display like
I I think this could truly be a compact
flagship that's always our hope and but
I've already displayed like I know and
we're talking about 10 even if it's like
a 4 inch 1080p display that's gonna be
up there and the pixel depth yeah yeah
what's the rumored screen size it will
sub 5 inches is the thing some 5 minutes
really which would be crazy on a two by
one since they'd like the height to
great is it do we know if there's 16 by
9 or 18 by 9 now well I mean you were
you know 50 60 18 point 5 by 9 which is
display that's that I when we talk my
infinity it's display the encompasses
the aspect ratio I would think Samson
correct me if I'm wrong Samsung do you
do you think Wan do you think the s9
mini if there is one do you think he'll
come stateside no I don't I think the
majority of the marketing that Samsung
puts into the United States is gonna
focus on an s9 and an s9 + just like we
saw this year with an Si and si plus I
agree with the sentiment on
unfortunately I right now smaller phones
aren't making any headlines the xperia x
z1 compact was one of my favorite phones
of the year it's right up there for me
with the V 30 and the BlackBerry key one
in courting a very specific audience and
when that phone's right for you it is
literally a perfect fit for you as
opposed to sort of gonna all-rounder
if Samsung were to pull this off I
unfortunately think Samsung would
probably fall down the trap of making it
a mid-range device banking off of the
s-series name like they did before with
the s5 mini
I would really love to see their take on
a 4.7 to 4.9 maybe even a 5-inch 18
point 5 by 9 aspect ratio because that
would be a legitimately small phone the
regular s8 is a 5.8 inch right which in
roughly the same general volume of space
as as like a 5.1 inch phone like I'd
like a huawei p10 something about seven
I mean if it was even a little bit
smaller the Galaxy s8 with even a little
bit smaller than the galaxy s7 with its
5.1 inch display let me get sort of
overall volume I think you know we're
talking we're talking to being a gap
between 2014 or 2015 and 2017 and mid
rangers like if you were to put a
mid-range chip from then into Interphone
now that's that stupid ring will never
get software update once ever has to by
2017 mid rangers tonk at Snapdragon 625
we're talking about more capable chips
that drag less and just are known for
their endurance so I think we're in
pretty safe territory even if this is a
mid-range right I think I think the
conversation we would have is Samsung
don't get out of bed for less than a
billion dollars it's it's not whether or
not I think Samsung could have the chops
to deliver something it's if it's called
an s9 mini they're banking on the cachet
of the s name and we know that that's
going to be a premium phone it's just
disappointing because I I miss some of
the more daring design experiments of
Samsung of old when I'm when I one of my
all-time favorite phones is I mean I
think people have heard me say this
before I think Samsung Pete with the
note 4 and now my favorite phones from
Samsung are all actives but that same
year we got the Galaxy alpha and that
was an amazing small form-factor
it was just a little ahead of its time
for that smaller battery capacity with
the chipsets that were coming out around
the Qualcomm 801 805 era it really
couldn't hang as an all-day companion
content device nowadays if we were to
deliver something like that I think we
would be in much better territory I
wasn't the Galaxy alpha and 18 t
exclusive in the u.s. it was too exotic
when it comes from I don't think it
killed it but Samsung had already
started moving on I think like they had
looked at that sort of harder-edged
rectangular look with the grippy back as
opposed to having glass and we were
already sort of shifting to so
unfortunately the Alpha I think was just
sort of a phone in the pipeline that
really didn't have much support I think
if it had been advertised as hard as
like the note 4 it would have been a
more popular option even for its 18 t
exclusivity but we know that Samsung can
put out a nice small form factor device
it's more can they find the niche where
that's appropriate that they can keep
their profit margins high and we don't
feel like we're getting an overly
compromised device that's more about
labels than it is actual performance and
that's a really difficult balancing act
right now when I just got my hands on a
Moto G 5s it's a $250 phone and this
thing is is kind of awesome you know
especially when we're gonna be talking
about one plus 5t territory now the guys
playing at the mid-range and I mean that
in terms of pricing like with a thousand
dollar phone out there from Samsung and
Apple five hundred dollar devices are
mid pack players now and under that
we're getting amazing experiences
III don't know that we need to turn to a
Samsung to deliver a mini that were
gonna pay more for that Samsung badge on
the back there's plenty of tide shifting
between I mean Huawei itself itself was
trying to go for the gun and reach
number one volume by by 2020 or 20 and
18 or whatever so any chance that we can
see new operator or even like older
mid-size operators try and run the score
up I think is
yeah but I think Samsung's strength will
probably be playing more in like a
galaxy a series like if they really if
they really want to make it make them
move into a small form-factor phone or a
mid-range ER or something like that if
they call it an A Series and this is
what's so funny is this is how much
names matter right right I think anyway
any consumers would buy a potential s9
Mini they did wouldn't be a tech
enthusiast like you and I they would
just be buying the s9 made based on the
Samsung brand name like they would do to
know that they could get a essential
phone for five hundred I mean what it's
simply possibly have the cachet they
have the marketing dollars and you know
it sucks you know to have to be
complacent about it but and I have to
say everything you know the signature
Samsung theme song it gets me it makes
everything seems ten times more
beautifully I was about to pick up a
note eight and said my pixel XL to just
because they had a really good like
marketing video yeah everyone's always
so happy when they're taking selfies and
whenever it boots up to like
unfortunately oneplus didn't get to
incorporate that you know what I'm
talking about
oh and that yeah in just a few minutes

thank them for supporting the PocketNow
weekly indeed we do and we also thank
you for continuing to talk about the one
plus 5t as we go along on this very
fast-paced show because this has been a
brick Nick year in my opinion for just
smartphones and it's like we've had the
most stacked fall to dates with a couple
of you know HTC and of course Apple but
LG with its usual V phone usual we're
talking about 2015 they started the V
lineup so that's kind of crazy so it's
just insane to imagine if we can
continue to keep up this sort of pace
but it turns the 1 + 5 t I think it's
kind of most controversial in terms of
its pace don't you think because it's
like oh hey here's the 1 + 5 in summer
and then we're gonna shut this down and
make the 1 + 5 t just like last year but
and you know people who were kind of I
kind of sense in the room
the event in Brooklyn that's this was
not really a I think you guys should
start off there what was the event like
so the events I had a blast you know
just like by meeting everyone Dave I
didn't honestly I wasn't I didn't have a
blast about the five T because I was a
Verizon customer you know no CDMA
support kind of just killed it for me
but the general impression that I have
the whole one plus five is my key
strategy it's the same way I felt before
what Samsung did with the s6 in the note
5 yeah you know it's it's not much of
the difference it's just the difference
in screen size same goes for one plus I
don't think you really changed any of
the specs aside from the 89 absolutely
let's get into the fact sheet a little
bit here so of course there's 835 same
as the 1 plus 5 different screen as he
said 6 inches but it's a 2.1 display it
has the same optic AMOLED technology as
before with white color gamut and very
it's a 80% screen body ratio and you
have this typical 6 gigs or 8 gigs of
ram the cameras and I believe this is
where Parker coming on this because they
went with a zoom strategy for a dual
camera system in the rear for the 1+5
and they've changed it up I believe
because they had this new sensor instead
the 20 megapixel support sensor is the
Sony Isaac's 376 keh keh which I believe
is for black as in CMYK with the cyan
magenta you know color it's a monochrome
sensor a monochrome sensor which helps
out for details for lossless zoom
they're promoting for this
they're both had the same focal length
so I was wondering them if this gives
more credence to what Kwame has been
doing instead of Apple you know they
have had their own routes to home for
dual camera systems to exhume and the
color monitor thing I was wondering what
your take on that is well so far my fav
for a dual sensor strategy is still
matched sensors Huawei started this off
using with like--is design where you had
a color and RGB sensor and a monochrome
sensor that for JPEGs those the images
from both of those sensors are emerged
and it creates a really lovely contrast
and detail effect that you can't get
with a single sensor solution like we
still haven't seen it duplicated from a
single sensor so I mean the different
dual sensor strategies you've got a zoom
in from Samsung and Apple and I think
Asus is employing that one plus was
using that on the oneplus 5 you've got a
wide which only LG has been doing so
that the single the secondary sensor is
an ultra wide almost a panorama in a
single click kind of field of view and
then now we've got Huawei Motorola
Motorola is using matched sensors and
the one plus 5t so they all have their
individual pros and cons for me I'm
always gonna be happiest with your
everyday normal photos being augmented
and so LG did something really
interesting with the glass lens in the G
in the V 30 where it's a really crispy
look it's one of the sharpest phone
cameras we've ever reviewed and then
that's you know that that's got to be
contrasted against Huawei with Leica
using this image merging process the
problem that I I'd the worry I have with
oneplus is replicating the hardware is
only a third the battle there's a very
particular look that I enjoy from Huawei
cameras and that all has to come down to
taking the the image data from two
sensors and merging it through a very
particular aesthetic and that's that
like a look I think it's really funny
when people complain like oh well in
low-light photos on my on my qual ways I
I see a little extra grain and it's a
little noisier and Leica engineers have
never been afraid of noise they consider
texture in your photos a feature not a
bug and so I like the look of that style
of photography especially you start
pushing into low-light or you want that
monochrome look
it's got a very photographic feel to the
output from that camera I am not
entirely confident that one-plus
engineers can can replicate that or come
up with their own aesthetic to be
pleasing so right now hopefully what
we'll see is an improvement to contrast
and clarity and that oneplus engineers
have found a photo look like maybe
they'd go with a slightly more HDR style
processing where the the exposure rates
between the main camera sensor the color
sensor and the black-and-white sensor
captures more dynamic range in a more
sort of a squashed kind of HDR look that
could be an interesting benefit but the
other thing that we've got to take a
look at is I believe this is only going
to be an electronically image stabilized
so that we're not gonna have Hardware
stabilization on the main camera like we
do on Huawei which takes us all the way
back to the P 9 p9 was still a wonderful
performer for stills I have every faith
that oneplus has the horsepower to
electronically or software stabilized
video but these are a lot of changes
this is a this is a very different setup
from where we were on the one plus five
and this is a company that tends to need
that extra couple updates out of the box
before these things are running smooth
so the initial reviews that you're gonna
see on the 5t if the cameras are
performing kind of weak I wouldn't be
overly concerned because every single
time we've had a one plus it's around
the six-month mark that that stuff
starts getting really good I want to
switch to the narrative surrounding 15
just a second because I think that
brings up a good point but I just think
that the oneplus 5 was heavily crippled
by a zoom level 2.6 F that was well but
I don't know that any any other zoom
lens has been so substantially better I
mean the galaxies don't really really
the top performer like f 1.9 is that
what it time yeah also the fact that we
zoom sensors so that you don't have a
huge lump of glass sticking out the back
of your phone these zoom sensors are
also smaller so you're dealing with the
crop
it's kind of like if you go from a
full-frame camera to an aps-c but you
use the same lens it looks like you've
zoomed that's because you're using less
of the glass on that lens so you're
actually cropping the glass you're not
cropping from a digital sense like
you're cutting pixels out of a photo
like this there's a central size - and
you know you still need light you still
need a discernable amount of light in
order to well and that's that's that's
why I actually really do like this move
of going to match sensors yeah so if you
so for example if you try and use
portrait mode on an iPhone or a note the
note can go darker than the iPhone can
so like you can push farther in tonight
but the portrait mode depends on the
zoom sensor being the main capture
sensor and the wider sensor being the
one that's fleshing out the depth
information for the camera to know where
to blur the background eye that means
that for the iPhone there are just
plenty of times even in regular indoor
lighting that the iPhone is going to
tell you oh you don't have enough light
to use portrait mode or you're too close
because you you there's a minimum
focusing distance but that a zoom sensor
can can reach and it's way farther away
from the phone than the normal sensor so
with matched sensors you don't have that
problem you get depth information from
two of the same focal length sensors and
those sensors should be larger so
because both of the sensors are the same
size they're both larger you don't have
to worry about playing this game of
shrinking one sensor down to reach a
higher crop factor to simulate the
experience of a 2 X optical zoom so the
hole is better overall for this
iteration and then any bugs that might
be coming and that gets into the
narrative that they wanted to paint at
one Plus where they basically went
through the entire history of the
company if you want to go in jump in
when I'll start off with my saying the 1
plus y I you know what's what's fun
vacuum cleaning you know I actually have
yet to use a smartphone with the match
sensor because none of the OEMs are
available on Verizon
I'll sew it it's interesting to see if
Google does adopt a dual camera setup
like if they're associated sync to see
which type of setup they go for I
personally think they're either gonna go
for soom lens or a wide-angle lens I
don't think they're gonna go with a
match if ever they do decide to go with
as you'll think I mean they have
obviously demonstrated with their single
camera unit on the pixel to pixel to
excel that portrait and computational
mathematics are and have been able to do
for the most part pretty good jobs
unfortunately it's just why the big
hyper things--that's is a consumer
trends in electronics which is weird but
when they start when he talked about the
1+1 and you know let's think to the fans
and I think they decided like admitted
to going for the mainstream for the 1
plus 2 and the 1 plus X and they found
not much not much take us they found
lots of enthusiasm but not much take-up
because it wasn't a product for them and
so they realized that they copied
themselves in and well since that's been
the story system 1 plus 3 where they do
value hardware value hardware as we've
seen the price go up of course no
disrespect to oneplus but if they so
claim that they were listening to the
fans when developing the 1 + 5 t I think
they would have they should have
implemented a wide-angle lens because I
don't think the majority of one-plus
fans are really into portrait
photography that's my two cents I think
I kind of I disagree I think one we're
kind of looking at the influence that
elbow has over the space and we can make
a lot of selfie and portrait II kinds of
phones so I think they're getting to
piggyback on that but that sort of
become one of the general consumer
trends you know Apple does it now we
kind of expect flagship grade phones to
have some kind of software background
blur effect understand why they're doing
it it makes sense to me that that this
is a part of the strategy that they're
wanting to keep
pace with the rest of the industry yeah
it's a whole propagation and of course
you know when may to a Chinese company
that has this selfie does all the selfie
phones and the selfie apps and it gets
take up in us for at least a little bit
I mean that's that's part of our culture
now and that's that's parenting reigned
yeah then again though the story about
the wide-angle ones not that great
anyways from my understood prior to the
V thirty there's a fish fish ball is
very well to the fish ball yeah there's
definitely barrel distortion on the V on
the V 20 and on the g5 but from in one
generation of phones to the next that's
radically improved and I find that if
we're gonna change focal lengths the
wide angle is significantly more
beneficial if you're that kind of person
who's out traveling or want to get a
bunch of people in a shot or you want
someone there and still be a background
in fact even with the V 20 sorry Jules
real quick even with the V 20 when my
daughter took her first steps I was
really grateful I had the V 20 because I
was way too close to her to get video of
it until I flipped wide and I was able
to capture the whole living room sitting
from the couch so that I could catch her
first steps I could catch her walking if
I'd had a phone with the zoom sensor
that wouldn't have meant anything to me
it would have been useless to try and
use that and even a normal sort of field
of view that sort of 26 to 30 millimeter
equivalent field of view I would have
gotten a great like portrait shot like
head and shoulders of her taking her
first steps but that who cares that's
not what you need your feet also are the
ultimate zoom in your in your in your
photos so I think the ultimate form of
that is mobile photography where you can
walk up to your daughter or son or
whoever else but you can never you can
never get far enough away to you know to
capture the whole thing the whole of the
bit of the magical Wonderland castle
that is part of Disney World or whatever
that you need so I mean
that's that's all the part of the the
optical story of ivory do you want to
touch on a couple of other things here
and that is one that would being
software did launch with Android Oreo
that's gonna be on a beta program from
late this year up through early 2018 you
would have hoped that Oriole I feel like
and you have to the UX guys making a
whole spiel about stock Android just
goes like and we're not launching with
you good yeah I mean I feel like oh em
said been lagging on Oreo as opposed to
nougat where there was more of a hype of
hey here's the LGV 20 the first ever
with nougat ends you know that that's
that's great you know that's I wish
there was more excitement around Android
based OS updates I think probably this
year the priorities for each OMS have
kind of changed I think like this year
yeah a lot of them are expanding beyond
like because III think unless you're at
Apple and Samsung and maybe LG like this
Marvel market it's not really gonna
generally eat a lot of profit so I think
a lot of OMS are looking for other like
revenues so like I don't think and the
narrative change I mean I would love for
OS updates be a bigger thing in Android
world but um the priority changed in
terms of hardware because they have this
display these days right oh look at this
extra wide display as opposed to well
we've iterated all weekend we've
introduced dual cameras last year the
year before and now we're going to oh
yeah hey look at this thing it's
software and that's important it's like
the last thing yeah I'm not gonna defend
samsung here because I don't think
they're perfect company but when the no
date launcher you get I was perfectly
fine with it because it's not like Oreo
offered anything significant
better than what sandstone was because
they already have some form of picture
in picture I believe all right
and you can you can theme it and I think
like LG in the times I had that before
like nougats
yeah Samsung has done a great job of
optimizing the Samsung user experience
that's what you're calling TouchWiz now
apparently except some users and also
the fact that there was no speaking of
the display there's no it was not going
to be that jelly scrolling thing
apparently because it's not gonna be
upside down
would find the party or the party yeah
they're using a Samsung we're assuming
it's the same panel that's probably in
the May 10 Pro yeah that's gonna be if
that's good in case so I mean it's a
different part so at least you know if
the problems problem pops up there then
we know where else it's gonna pop up but
we haven't seen it popping up yet so
that's that's good news just I mean it's
not really a big thing in terms of time
for the whole totality of the phone but
it's that like the people were very
nitpicky about that it's you last time
around it was like they could they just
picked up every little people I would be
like yeah especially jelly squirrel
really convinced you not to buy the five
if that had been your your phone of
choice everything else is spot-on that's
exactly what you wanted in a phone it's
the price point that you want in sort of
that premium mid-range territory but
this scrolling gets a little bouncy when
you go through a list that would have
convinced you not to buy it
know that that's the same thing with the
happening at the pixel to excel I was a
little bit forgiving with with the you
know with the blue shifting button like
before Google came out said we're gonna
add saturated color profiles I was like
man for $850 for this right but we're
talking for like 450 yeah I mean I think
because I'm constantly on my phone
watching content it would it would
depend on how bad it is when I when it's
an all white background but um it
depends on the usage case per unit like
if you're buying because no matter how
is for one thing it better do what it
says on the tin can really and then the
the display is first and foremost with
my interface yeah so yeah and then want
to give a quick mention to Star Wars
apparently in the last Jedi is gonna be
coming out next month and there's been
some code digging going on by some good
folks there was an anonymous source but
XD a really helped us out here and
apparently there might be not only a
Star Wars theme going on but also a Star
Wars dedicated 1 + 5 t limited edition
use your 1 + 5 t for 4528 hours before
you unlock all of the premium character
wallpapers you got to because I also buy
a bunch of like you know a wallpaper
crates I think it's only gonna be like
around $2,000 worth of wallpaper crates
to get all of the premium characters
online that's or you could fly to France
I mean the work the last two limited
edition things I was making a
battlefront 2 joke I don't know where
you're going Jules I'm sorry I really
wanted to you went off in another
direction and the crystals they shut
down the in-app purchases we can move on
from that because they've shut down the
in-app purchases for now in-app
purchases are coming back I guarantee
you in app purchases are coming back
after the phone's initial burst after
the the game's initial burst or sales I
guarantee you they're gonna be like
we're not gonna change the the leveling
structure you're still gonna have to
grind for 4,000 hours oh but wouldn't it
be great if we had these loot boxes back
that's totally what they're gonna I
don't know anything much about Star Wars
but I just remember back back in the
days Motorola had the exclusivity on
Star Wars like Star Wars like the
arcuate like really any joy yeah yeah
those were intense things
as I've been trying to say oneplus has
limited edition devices with the 3t they
had they partnered with the French
design firm
Colette's and then also this
jean-charles the Castelbajac sorry if
I'm butchering his name but he they
partnered with a 1 + 5 T 1 plus 5 design
now if 1 plus is going to partner if
these things you know come out of
university is true this is going to be
one of the biggest media for interest
high ups for oneplus that's that's gonna
be important from them I'm not sure it
well I think it's important to know what
have we been seeing we've been seeing
oneplus try and find avenues where they
can pivot mainstream this is this is
taking us back to what was that
gentleman's name you posted that really
great video talking about how brands
can't succeed Barza yes Mark Martin yeah
top talking about how a brand can't
succeed if it's only courting like super
hardcore diehard enthusiasts like you
have to find avenues where you can reach
general consumers and that one of the
main ways that you can do that is by
trying to find some kind of licensing
deal or a licensing agreement overseas
they don't seem to have problems Opel in
1 plus reaching out to local celebrities
I don't mean local is in like you know
hometown but I mean like regional
celebrities and if they're going to
continue to find any kind of traction in
North America especially away from the
angriest and loudest Android enthusiasts
outside of that community talking about
their product then this is a huge step
in the right direction for them you know
like they tried to shut down the phone
on jelly scrolling and literally
something that most people that use the
phone would probably have considered a
feature look at how cute the bouncy
animations are when I scroll this is fun
it reminds me of my Palm Pre you know
like that's that would have been a
feature for a lot of consumers if it had
been billed that way but Android we
Android geeks had to try and savage the
phone brand based on them mounting the
screen upside down court geeks anymore
why not just swing mainstream
well I mean if you're talking about
mainstream they have all the credit in
the world and all the money in the world
to buy a phone right so let's talk about
price it went up again then when it went
up by 20 bucks but it went up again so
it's $4.99 for the base model that's
gigs of ram 64 gigabytes of storage if
you're talking about a gigabytes of RAM
and 128 gigabytes of storage that's 559
which yeah you know the whole story of
things it's good
all these feature out grades work the 20
bucks yes when we look at it as a story
when we started out 300 bucks you know
where this attention is being turned
away from tech enthusiasts that wanted
very value oriented hardware - well I'm
not sure what their attitude is in terms
of you know software and whatnot and
just you know clean clean Android and
this whole stock attitude or anti stock
I I think I think this is actually
probably the right play the higher price
tag actually will go hand in hand with
consumers treating this like more of a
premium product the fact that it's still
in this sub $600 territory might
actually work against it for general
consumers who are look well it's
probably not as good as my iPhone or
it's probably not as good as the Samsung
even though it's covering all of the
basics in a way that most consumers
would probably find more than adequate
for their daily smartphone computing
needs so again this is this is where you
have to walk that fine balance if they
just came out with the phone tomorrow
that was 699 they would be savaged
they would be oh they're trying to pull
an essential oh no look at one plus
they're doing all this stuff like you
can't have that conversation immediately
so you kind of have to lobster pot your
way to making your brand more
recognizable for people who are also
going to consider it a nice product and
not a compromised product because it's
less expensive you know do you think I
mean starts at $4.99 right yeah do you
think the pricing for the components do
you think big
squeezed in at least a quad HD display
because if you think about two years ago
like $4.99 was the starting price for a
Nexus 6p and that was almost a complete
package like I don't know Google was
taking a loss on that but personally I
think Google was probably at such a
razor-thin margin on Nexus because the
point of Nexus wasn't to reach the point
of pixel is to reach consumers and what
did we see from the 6p to the pixel
Google's always listening oh Jesus stop
so so at it at $4.99 oh yeah don't know
what pricing on panels we could expect
that they would have the market
leveraged to get that kind of preferred
pricing on AMOLED what I think is really
interesting is how close this phone
lands in a comparison against a wall we
made 10 Pro I I've never had a chance to
use any hallway smart no but I mean like
like go spec to spec so you know there
are improvements over may 10 pro over
the oneplus 5 but we've got probably the
same AMOLED panel the same the same
dimensions the same size um
the mate 10 Pro has a larger battery but
3300 milliamp hour battery on the 1 + 5
t is certainly not a deal-breaker say
similar performing chipset between the
keren 970 and the 1 + 5 t and just sort
of raw computing power but the one the
May 10 is going to have all this neural
processing unit AI on chip kind of
customization stuff happening if that's
a benefit if you like that dual cameras
that perform very similarly and then the
mate em pro arrives with water
resistance now the mate em pro is is is
obviously a better phone across the
board every single individual metric
there's some benefit to having the mate
10 Pro does all of that add up to a
device that's eighty percent more
expensive than a 1 + 5 t and that
becomes a much more difficult question
to answer right from my last experience
using a flyweight phone like hands on a
kind of electronic detailer right I
thought you know their software is kind
of clunky but I did appreciate
the extra like features that were built
in I haven't used look one pluses oxygen
LS but I think some consumers might see
the added software like features I was
like a benefit like a justification for
the higher price and there there is
something to be said
I don't like Huawei software design like
I like the look of emui but having a
mate nine almost every single day since
its launched has been the phone that has
aged the best out of there any Android
device that I've used - maybe that last
year's pixel XL like they're
neck-and-neck and for all of that custom
software and all of their their appeals
to better garbage collection and better
resource management I find that those
claims to be somewhat accurate you know
I haven't ever felt the need to wipe out
a law way like I have a Samsung after
four months and it starts to just get
that little bit of the jank just that
little bit of the Samsung twitch going
on so I it's the double edged sword I
really wish I could have that kind of
optimization and long-term stability
with something that was closer to stock
Android was something that was cleaner
that that was more material design and
less of this emui aesthetic and that
would make me really happy right yeah do
you think do you think the pixel to
excel is kind of all just using it
sometimes it does I mean if it starts
out you know with all these problems
that people say that they have I mean if
it's if they come out with an RMA and
that pixel to exile is going to be fine
then I mean so again it depends on what
we're talking about with aging I don't
think the pixel twos are gonna Ange aged
well from a hardware perspective I think
they're gonna look pretty rough after
about six months of daily use if you
don't have them in a case with a screen
protector on oh I'm talking about the
software experience but the software
side is where I have confidence because
Google's not a hardware company they're
trying they're making efforts but
they're not they don't make hardware
they make software and I think like the
pixel excel
I think the software is going to
really well but it's we're getting to a
point where you know being able to
differentiate you know like all my
screens got a ton of burn in and the
microphones died and one of the
speaker's is crackling oh but the
software is so smooth you know like
that's a terrible smartphone experience
that's that's like that's not a thing
for an $800 phone that's barely
something we would have put up with on a
nexus 5x it you know like you know if
that's the case Huawei might be the only
smart phone manufacturer in my mouth and
in my current mindset right now that has
a good combination of both hardware and
software because Apple has really
dropped the ball lately with iOS iOS 11
pretty rough right now they have to play
catch-up it's you know it's great to be
responsive to these bugs but when you're
ending up having to do a lot of public
you know dirty laundry about that it's
kind of rough to see him actually need
to start getting going here pretty sad
PN weekly comments that we've been
getting on Twitter from Andrew Wallace
at fat produce recently a guest on the
podcast I still don't understand why
oneplus refuses to include an external
SD card slot on their devices for that
$500 plus price point I think we're
actually gonna start seeing the SD card
slot vanish like we do the headphone
jack I don't think that's long for this
world let's write that in 2015 and mate
10 pro pixel iPhone keeps reinforcing it
and we're in a market where if Apple can
do it anyone can do it I think we're
gonna start seeing it vanish maybe even
256 if 256 can be a new standard then
hey no strategy
I've been carryin pianned weekly the one
has the oneplus stepped up the display
quality as far as the rest of the phone
is okay now not saying 2k but a better
tuned 1080p display to see and feel as
class-leading I know we had the hands-on
video um I don't know I mean like it
looks like it's gonna be a solid
performer I've been happy with the may
10 pro screen
there's nothing that really makes me
feel like I'm compromised by using a
1080p wide display yeah you know what we
saw under dim stupid tradeshow lights it
was better than the pixel to excel in my
hands-on experience anyways in terms of
all this coverage that we're going to
have for the 1 plus 5t how many rivero
is going to be handling the book of that
and you'll be expecting it sometime but
for everyone on this podcast now the
last the last one I want to get to is
from Panzer Z with the announcement of
the 5 T at $4.99 is it really the deal
that it used to be when you compare it
against the essential pH one which is
currently at 449 and what's a 449 now
that's for boys what do you do what was
the question
essential for a metaphor for a central
phone at 449 or + 5 t + 4 9 I would
choose I would choose the essential fun
really neither I I would - I I'd be a
little concerned about the camera
performance I think oneplus would
probably beat it there yeah but I love
that ceramic and titanium build exact
line is more progressive I die I'd
probably go I personally would probably
go pH 1 no and the LCD you know on on
the central phone it's not bad I
actually think it looks great especially
with the thin bezels it just melts in it
I like it
and we wanted get into the ecosystem a
little bit the accessories and the I
don't so gimmicky if I was if I were to
do that if I were to go into essential I
don't see myself getting into that there
is no ecosystem besides from the 360
camera I heard that that was pretty
clunky third parties are so much fun
yeah I don't see anyone picking up
wireless USB as a standard when we have
real USB and you can just plug stuff
into the bottom port but again phone to
phone I mean like you're not there is no
ecosystem
one plus I mean they've got a really
nice backpack a really nice on it and
that's that's your big accessory add-on
for the one plus five real quick before
before we jump I do want to screen share
something real fast here this is just to
kind of show off the the difference
we're back loading up whole bunch of
stuff here yeah we are so this is uh
this is a portrait mode photo or they
call it wide aperture mode photo from
the huawei mate mate 10 Pro very well
defined with the beanie cap on and
excellent cutting out around all of that
especially with all like the sides and
the vents and the door frame and
everything else and that it's in pretty
dim and dark conditions
and I have to pull up this is from the
same position this is from the note 8 or
is the difference when we talk about a
zoom sensor in low-light conditions
versus dual matched sized
sensors in low-light conditions the
reasons why I consider this to be such a
significant advantage this is an indoor
lit shot this is like one lamp from my
kitchen is lighting both swirl well and
you can see that this is really pushing
the note 8 to its limits in noise
reduction because this is blurry and
patchy and smeary I mean not that the
the May 10 photo is so pristine and
clean there's a lot of noise reduction
going on there too but it's a much nicer
experience when you compare them
side-by-side in terms of solutions I do
not find a huge benefit from zoom sensor
phones you need excellent lighting and
an excellent lighting a crop of a photo
from the normal sensor is probably going
to look almost as good oh absolutely the
the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL both
would have done better in this setup too
because it uses that main camera sensor
it's got a larger camera sensor with a
faster aperture and better image
processing it absolutely would have done
better in that
if you want to see what the 1 plus 5t
can do in terms of those respects well
we're just going to wait for our review
so can't you just plug I might be myself
on your podcast I smashed into I smashed
my face against Joshua verduras check it
