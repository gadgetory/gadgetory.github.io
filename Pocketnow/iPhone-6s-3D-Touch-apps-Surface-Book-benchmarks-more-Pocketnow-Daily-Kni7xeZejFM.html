other creative purposes benchmarks now
show us how powerful the surface book is
compared to the macbook pro and the LG
v10 starts making its way to the US
carriers with some deals I'm hi Mary
vera and I don't understand why some
people don't like Monday jokes and still
hate mondays along with me this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Apple those of you
waiting for the new Apple TV we just
learned the two things number one the
pre-order starts today the second is
that there's actually two models there's
a 100 $49 model with 32 gigs of storage
and then in 199 model with a well 64
gigs of storage because obviously you
can play games on this store everything
and that's interesting and what will be
ordered today you get it by November
third or somewhere around there which is
an interesting date we will keep you
posted most likely i will be ordering
line other interesting official news
come from LG those of you interested in
the LG v10 you can pretty much order it
now on t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T the case of a
TNT though you'll be paying 250 dollars
plus a contract or seven hundred dollars
off the bat we're in the case of
t-mobile you actually get in one hundred
dollar discount at just six hundred
bucks so for those of you interested
there are carrier options but we do
remember that there's a verizon variant
as well have you thought that 3d touch
technology on the iphone success was
just for shortcuts well there are
developers that are already taking
advantage of it and there is this new
application called the plum o meter and
the idea is that well you can place a
plum on top of it and you can actually
weigh it so you use this for such to
detect the amount of force applied by
the you know whatever products you use
and yeah there should be other scale
applications coming very soon but for
those of you that didn't know there's
actually not new for the Huawei device
that's also capable of for such
technology and if you are on the ropes
waiting for the new microsoft lumia is
the 950 or 950 XL and you are in the UK
there are some good news as there seems
to be a drop in price of up to a hundred
pounds in the Lumia 950 950 XL from the
previous retail prices which is rather
interesting we're not really sure if it
has to do with the fact that Microsoft
is just
there is less than n they expected or
they just want to be more aggressive I
hope it's the latter because the these
products are actually rather cool can't
wait to review it and finally the
interesting news of the day has to do
with the Microsoft Surface book the
claims from Microsoft that this product
was more powerful than the retina
MacBook Pro were true to some extent
because well it is twice as fast as the
13-inch macbook pro but then again that
13 inch or if you do some benchmarking
and look at the specs there's really
very little difference between this
product and the 13-inch macbook air if
you beefed it up so yeah obviously the
13 inch MacBook Pro is not as powerful
as the 15-inch model but then again I do
feel that is somewhat of a fair
comparison particularly because well the
surface book is actually three hundred
dollars more expensive so it leads me to
the question of the day if you have to
choose right now which of these products
would you buy and I'm actually going to
include the surface pro for the surface
book or a 13-inch MacBook Pro which one
would you pick in my case I stayed away
from the 13-inch macbook pro because of
the lack of the quad core processor back
in the day but yeah I'm really compelled
for the service book except for the
price tag it was a comment down below we
would love to know what you want friends

to get the news earlier before this
