US government probes the battery
throttling controversy LG settles the G
for boot looping class-action lawsuit
and let's dig into the future of 5g
we've got a lot to talk about so make
sure you're charged and ready for
episode two nine zero of the PocketNow
weekly recorded february 2nd at noon
pacific or close to noon pacific this
weekly podcast is where we dissect and
discuss those gadgets that make our
lives mobile smartphones tablets and
wearables it's all the stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and boot
loops would have been the name of a
terrible off-brand kid cereal you know
came in the bag not in the box with the
car love colorful graphics on it I'm
Juan Carlos back now senior editor
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wilin out on
the east coast how's it going buddy boy
you know I've always been more of an
oatmeal square kind of person like
Quaker has this good vision to the life
like they have they have the like little
puffs things and in like the store
brands have them they never really
compare ourselves yeah it's it's funny
like there are a lot of see generics
have gotten really good now though but
when we were younger if you if you got
like the bag o cereal it's just like
Lucky Charms and you're like no no say
that we've gotten to like 75 or 80
percent of the enjoyment so I mean if
you really want to see like real off
brand on brand comparisons you should
check out the cheap show podcast
available where other fine podcasts are
available we were literally at their
podcast this week but it's not right
we're sending a thrown out of bone to a
completely unrelated show so totally not
as I wasn't expecting the whole intro
thing so I was like yeah that sounds
like a good thing to get into so I think
you should take that on our
recommendation no we actually have some
cool tech news to talk about this week I
just kind of kind of get in the pre the
house and order our pre-show all set
before we start getting into the harvest
season of
rumors and news articles and releases
that are gonna be coming out around MWC
time it's hilarious you start thinking
like well the show is gonna take place
at the end of February but February is a
month that flies by so we're already
starting to sift through news coming out
of what might be going down and and
we'll also be going hands-on with a
couple things on the channel - some more
after the buzz videos we're gonna be
catching up on those we just did the
galaxy s 8 plus I'm gonna be spending
some more time with the BlackBerry key1
while they might be moving forward with
some of their unlocked phones in the
United States as since they couldn't get
a carrier deal they're still looking for
US distribution on some of their flag
ships and we still want to hear from you
we will be putting together another
listeners take the wheel or mailbag
episode soon so make sure you're sending
us those comments and questions and and
Jules
if someone wanted to join the
conversation right now how might they
participate with this actual live
broadcast of the show this this cluster
of a podcast that goes to air 15 minutes
late and no one's actually number of
people are actually watching we have a
show running right now through nothing
but perseverance I have to apologize
like my setup super raw right now my
desktop is still out of commission I'm
trying to fix up a few things and clean
out some of the casing and I thought I
was gonna be able to get it done
yesterday so I'm running this for my
last shirt really give a shout-out to my
for a newfound friend and colleague
Rhine Hagar from Android police he was
let me this space over here for you to
use and the gigabit internet that
apparently he has I feel like flipping
jellies that is so not fair I mean like
we're still like I know we're probably
around five years away in Los Angeles
from holding town hall meetings about
the potential of examining the economic
impact of a potential bid in Southern
California to consider the future
viability of Fiverr first-round
Commission report and then a viability
competition and then you have to assess
the big
that economic impact and then like what
will it mean for people who own really
nice homes because they won't want you
know their homes disturbed by this if
you want to join this show a hash okay
yeah weakly not Twitter if you want to
if you want to get in and insert your
own comments about the internet about a
lot stuff like that because internet 5g
is gonna be a big topic in our second
segment of this broadcast so we really
want to get you you know that as well as
the rest of the news by the way you can
actually access the rundown and see what
we're actually talking about by clicking
the link in the description on the
YouTube channel and pocketnow.com hello
we run that site it's it's a place we
run that sigh yo let's jump into some
some hot news the the top stories that
we get to talk about this week as
cultivated by the writers on pocket now
yeah and I'm one of those writers so but
so let's just go through them for the
week of what was a January 30th this is
all the news that is fit to podcast
apparently home pod demand for the smart
speaker from Apple Apple's first is not
stacking up to the usual standards that
we have seen whereas iPhones have sold
out in minutes from launch time we've
seen the original sales date of February
9 still tacked on to pre-orders made
after the weekend of its launch it
watched last Friday so and it still has
not yet to do anything except be
available at places as opposed to
selling out so that's interesting we'll
get into that Apple is potentially a
little stressed out too
perhaps because with the iPhone se 2
there may be evidence as KGI securities
claims that there isn't enough resource
and development to be able to put out an
iPhone se sequel the favorite mid Ranger
of hot color spec knows
of 2016 may not get a follow on at least
for this year US government agencies are
looking into Apple's behavior in terms
of throttling certain iPhones older
iPhones in the case that they are
protecting the battery from overcharging
or from over exerting itself in causing
shutdowns but this behavior was not
disclosed properly it took them months
to do that so the SEC the Security and
Exchange Commission as well as the
Department of Justice are looking into
that behavior right now LG has actually
when it actually went to arbitration it
was initially reported from the law firm
Geron kids LLP representing a class
action against LG on bootloop issues
that weren't properly supported that's
they would get rebates free funds cash
and credit you know and now it appears
that it's it was either inaccurate or it
was too early of a report because all
that the class is getting now through
arbitration is extended warranties will
dig into that in just a bit as well 10
gigabytes of RAM who needs 10 gigabytes
of RAM who needs 512 gigabytes of
storage on their Android smartphones
apparently that's in the cards for a
Chinese manufacturer vivo they were the
ones that introduced the first phone
with under display fingerprint sensor
from synaptics and now thanks to slides
leaked out to Weibo presentation slides
we see that 10 gigabytes of RAM is in
the cards for the x-play 7x play being
the flagship series for vive right there
so we're going to look at that in a bit
Strava one of the big compilation the
services for fitness tracking for data
for geocaching that fitness tracking
data is getting a good look
at looking at from military bases
because a lot of military personnel who
do their workouts
they have been apparently tracked there
are patrol paths have also been tracked
and all this data is public is available
and it took college kid just a few
minutes to figure this out so it's an
interesting InfoSec failure it is in a
sense is a fun find their failure yeah
yeah it's it's a failure of epic
proportions but want to start off with
the huawei P 20 apparently there's going
to be an event in Paris I'm mark invite
me to like the Parisian events what's
going on there super cool I mean like I
have a good time in Germany I get along
with with the Germans they're fun I
think they're super fun people um but
you know and just it's either that or
San Francisco and I just say if there's
other things going on we could go to
service I don't I don't recall them
going to Paris for any certain events
yeah well and actually I think this year
they might be looking at swapping out so
instead of doing a you know that that
sort of German home-based launch which i
i've never was completely i never
completely under completely understood
why kwame picked germany as my strongest
consumer basis in addition to the UK
which they sometimes do for honor events
as well but the trains so maybe that
maybe the conventional wisdom is like if
you if you show Paris a little love can
you crack more into that sort of like
you know Iberian Peninsula market make a
little bit more headway in Spain and
Portugal too because they're I mean they
have shown strengths in the top EU
countries but it's not you know well
distributed there's again stronger than
other places stronger these ways is the
tender places so you know it's
interesting to see three cameras we've
been talking about this for a while and
it seems like we we had a little debate
about the name whether it was going to
be in the p11 p12
well excuse me that could the p12 was
supposed to be they may treat mark these
names like years in advance just
thinking that they can just go down the
line and it appeared that this name the
p11 was in more offices was at more
offices than the p20 name but turns out
that well at least Evan bless says that
the p20 name will stick around and his
word is bond yeah I'll be crazy to see
we definitely we've been getting
numerous questions especially from
huawei fan and friend of the show
Andrew Wallace at fat produce who I
think he's rockin a mate nine really
hoped the p10 and I think he means the
p20 introduces the standard monochrome
and color sensor set up along with an
ultra wide third camera that precedent
would be great to have as an industry
standard going forward I wonder if if
we're talking about a triple camera
arrangement on the back if they will
play with any kind of focal length
changes I'd be curious if we're talking
about three cameras working together a
wide-angle camera can't really
contribute to that setup as well as zoom
can because of you start changing the
focal lengths yeah you have you deal
with varying degrees of distortion so I
think if one of them is gonna be some
some form of zoom it'll probably be a
zoom in not an ultra wide but I'll be
curious to see because we keep throwing
around this like 40 megapixel output
you know like buzz and I I would really
hope that maybe if you have three
matched sensors three matched focal
length sensors you become more of like a
light row style camera in how you
acquire light and how you can play with
depth effects maybe some of that
information can feed into things like
augmented reality and you can have like
sort of a smarter post-processing setup
on the phone since that's kind of where
everyone's going to anyway it's less
about putting on the biggest possible
camera sensor and more about how can you
manipulate the data once the raw image
has been captured well it's about the
raw data and stuff that you capture and
how you can creatively trick the
hardware
and so that if you know you have all
this data and you can use the more data
that you have the more you can
manipulate it is what I'm saying here
we're not on the courts with the PN
weekly hashtag on Twitter well they have
the power trip with like a intuitive so
I think this was the logic behind
Germany fair point
oh that's right soon I forget about that
yeah yeah yeah and with German companies
so that makes sense David bad piece of
this Silva says Americans should take
advantage of their easy - well that
that's LG we'll get to that later all
these tweets here Peter Peter hating aw
so just just sort of confirming that
idea that Leica is also a German company
and that makes sense for them to be
launching like a products and
partnership that's another thing that I
I we could also potentially consider is
for like--is benefit would that would a
foam platform be a way for a traditional
camera company to experiment with future
iterations of photography and so is like
a does like a stand to benefit from this
type of an arrangement for when they
start releasing standalone products if
Leica wanted to get into the light row
space and make their own l16 style
camera then I think the data they could
glean from a smartphone experiment with
a you know a triple sensor could be very
helpful in moving forward on future
products and services I don't know I
mean like that's actually kind of a I
thought just kind of popped in my head
that's kind of an interesting idea if
this is a truly symbiotic relationship
and that information can flow freely
both ways then Huawei might be enabling
sort of a new generation of
point-and-shoot cameras in an in a
really smart fashion well I guess we'll
have to see I mean we are about that's
like three and a half weeks out of em WC
so and trying to be one of the
manufacturers to get themselves away
from the noise but you think well there
isn't much noise this year right because
LG is gonna be after the show and it's
really just going to be the Samsung so
that's actually is it isn't that the big
fear where last year we had
you know some really great announcements
happening at MWC because we knew Samsung
was gonna be doing its own thing
Samsung sort of leveraging MWC for
themselves wouldn't you want to get out
of the Samsung vortex and excuse me do
your own sort of press conference I mean
I think Huawei can survive doing their
own press conference I don't think they
necessarily need the reporter base of
bloggers and journalists that are all
going to be in one place at one time for
MWC that they can they can do their own
announcements and still find reasonable
traction on getting the news out there
the thought of mind is you know at one
point let's get out in front of them
maybe that will help now we should wait
afterwards or somehow let this is this
vortex of attention as you put it is is
just not good for the companies that
would come otherwise around that line so
yeah it's an opportunity if they can do
something really cool with the p20 so
you get out after Samsung and then just
before you can you can if you can get in
that window in between when Samsung
announces and when Samsung is really
shipping product in earnest and then do
something a little disruptive like
saying oh yeah Samsung they finally
stapled two cameras onto the back of the
Galaxy S 9 plus but on our p20 we've got
three camera instead of the megapixel
war we've got the camera sensor how
granular Huawei wants to market their
device because so far so vague you
mentioned something about the vortex of
attention or something or like the maps
of the world and what I've tried this is
so ungraceful of a segue to stream but
we'll take it anyways the header image
that we're using is it's not that
definitive because of course it's you
know when you pull out to a whole view
of Europe or whoever
the on a continent skill you really
don't see individual paths but
apparently this person I tried to have
strong Australian student was looking at
this Nick waters no he's an X well that
was let's take Nick waters a comment
here because he's an X infantry officer
and he perhaps best described the
situation as a big op second per sec
fail operational security and personal
security and if you where and this this
is this came across the u.s. in Russia
and like every a lot in 20 of a the
infantry just you know who happens to be
taking care of their fitness and likes
to do so in a more technical manner will
be wearing a Fitbit or whatever and you
know they might be wearing their Fitbit
on their patrols and when you see this
when you see this data trove well good
luck to those who want to breach that
breach where were that bases well yeah
but I mean it's it's also I think we're
gonna see continued clashes there was a
really high up voted story on reddit
again another editorial talking about
all of these tech companies that monitor
every waking moment of our lives through
mobile devices and smart speakers and
and like it's we're kind of running into
a decision point we're running into a
pain point where we need to decide what
the future of commerce of advertising
personal data tracking storage all of
these things are going to be coming to a
head in a way that could be very
upsetting to the current market that we
have again huge opportunities for other
players to jump in but this is like
another data point in this vast sea of
who do we trust with our data who do we
trust with our movement who do we trust
with very personal and granular
information I mean things we just take
for granted how much I love having all
day heart tracking information on my
SmartWatch yet that still has to live in
a big cloud bucket on someone else's
server and it can only be as safe as
however you know safer safeguarded that
server
be so there's a lot of trust there's a
lot of faith that these companies are
gonna be acting the best interests of
their comes customers because that's
what the market would dictate that's
what you know capitalism would dictate
if they do a poor job of it then I'll
move on to another solution but we're
also at a time where consumers have
never been more entrenched if Apple
suddenly failed and violated the privacy
of a huge swath of their customers I
would be curious to see how many of them
would actually use that as the
justification for leaving the platform
and how many would stay
ditto Samsung ditto any other major
corporation in the space ditto Amazon if
there was a sudden Amazon breach how
many people would be like oh I'm totally
mad I'm never shopping with them again
until tomorrow so I want you to remember
back at least a decade didn't half
remember tennis great John McEnroe III
never I never forget tennis great John
McEnroe he is he is always in my
thoughts you know see the game show
right oh he's I mean he does tons of TV
actually I really I really like his
commentary my wife is a huge tennis fan
so anytime there's like a major
tournament we're watching we're watching
the tennis and and history I'm trying to
get somewhere dude I would actually you
know have to profess my undying love and
affection for tennis great John McEnroe
so I'm saying
so back in 2002 you hosted called let's
share there was a game show
mix trivia with heart rate limits and
you know between the questions you had
to face very confronting challenges that
raised your heart rate that you know got
your fear up and you have you have to
lower your heart rate to a certain level
before you could progressed on to the
necros next question otherwise your cash
value would cash winnings would drop off
that sounds like a gasps I think I'm
thinking that at some point we'll have a
movie where it'll take the form of the
chair game show and then you know
hackers will create this world where it
everyone is like you they extort money
from them unless their heart rates are
like below a certain level or something
kind of kind of like speed with your
heart rate instead of the buses
speedometer going on yeah there's lots
of mental games abduction that could be
the dystopian leaving we need in order
to turn the tide on this whole data
tracking and you know just get people
more aware and more careful that this
stuff well and we're definitely we're
definitely in that phase of a lobster
pot effect because I think if some of
these tech if some of this tech could
come out even like five years ago I
think consumers would have been a lot
more skeptical I keep pointing to the
example of the Xbox Kinect and how many
people reacted fairly negatively to the
idea of an always-on listening
microphone in your living room and now
it you know on the regular we're getting
reports about Smart TVs being
compromised we're putting you know smart
speakers in every room of the house and
people often aren't utilizing the best
possible security or two-factor
authentication or keeping those devices
updated against potential security
threats and it's just sort of
commonplace that we've traded a
significant portion of our privacy for
convenience and that's not necessarily a
bad thing but along the way we do need
to audit this industry not an individual
company but audit the industry to say
who's doing a good job who do we trust
and what potential threats are out there
and again a story like this where we're
talking about military troop movements I
don't understand military policy which
doesn't react viscerally swiftly and and
with you know with a high degree of of
precision in fixing a problem like that
you know the most immediate idea that
comes to mind is like if you're active
duty if you're involved with troop
movements if you're in logistics you
don't get to wear smartwatches and
fitness tracker this is where the
developing markets all the developing
that we've talked about take over like
they all they have to do is use the plot
data and come up with some conniving
schemes to just the internet base and
take them over and you get all the
passwords or whatnot
I think got a happening maybe time this
is this gonna be the turn of the new
world order that we've been looking
forward to ray I for one welcome our new
AI robot overlords I for welcome welcome
Tim I don't even know what I'm saying
did segways excuse me again in cleaning
out my PC and trying to fix my
workstation my office is so full of dust
attack in front of the microphone and
it's so gross because it's probably
mostly like degraded human skin cells so
um 10 gigabytes of RAM 512 gigabytes of
storage two years ago I would have said
how ridiculous this is complete overkill
for a phone I'm cranky and old kids get
off my lawn why do you need that way
away away away away the fact that I've
now been producing a lot of content
directly from my phone putting together
vlogs editing video on-the-fly writing
documents while watching movies some
fairly aggressive use directly from a
phone and I'm super excited about future
products that will do better screen
mirroring or enable a desktop mode I am
now 100% completely on board and wanting
to see if we can push this even further
like I want 4k displays
yeah yeah I mean like I want to push I
want to push our phones into true laptop
grade spec territory especially as we
already have some pretty clear
indications that we've got things on the
horizon like windows on arm once we have
our project Linda a Seuss's mobile line
of displays accessories a better
implement or mimic a laptop style or a
desktop style control just the fact that
you can easily plug a USB cable into a
device I did a little hands-on review
on you know like a capacitive stylus for
all phones those things all wrapped up
together
I do think speak to the blossoming power
of smartphone in your pocket you know
much wider ecosystem of actually getting
to done and so I think Qualcomm 845 is
going to be one of those good
transitionary time periods as we start
making that migration into true
productivity laptop grade productivity
that fits in our pocket and can be
expanded upon either through you know
gimmicks like folding screens or good
ecosystem accessories like laptop
cradles and external displays yeah yeah
and I mean I'm just I'm just wondering
what the heck I can do with 16 gigs of
RAM on a phone right now and and to be
honest I can't think of any ways that I
would be able to follow up without you
know just having natural bugs and
whatnot slow it down so that we get to
the point where we mineralization of the
fabrications that we use to produce
these chips get you know so that 16 gigs
of ram doesn't seem ridiculous to put
into a like a 5 inch phone no you're not
you're not wrong because we're still
ahead of the curve you know we're the
hardware is still going to be far and
away overkill for what software
currently can do but when I say the 845
is a TriNet transitionary step I mean
over the life cycle of the 845 and I'm
assuming around 2 years of use for this
chipset for people who are buying into
this ecosystem by the time we get to the
end of life on the 8:45 I wholly expect
that we'll have seen another
generational or three generational
improvement - absent services so where
we were when the iPad 9.7 Pro came out
where I couldn't finish a review of the
iPad on the iPad I tried to edit video
and record the the vo I tried to do
everything in my production on the iPad
and I couldn't quite finish a video that
would have been similar to how I would
have produced a
a video on my laptop flash forward a
year to Android devices with
PowerDirector and you know good hardware
in good RAM and 4k video shooting and
rendering capabilities and I can I can
do it now I can finish these videos I
can get my actual work done we've we've
we've transitioned into true pro
productivity we have a lot of bugs to
work out
app developers they'd like to have more
of you know the customization because
the like the features you still have to
put in a 16 by 9 art asset and you can't
have PNG that's out oh no I can do all
that I can do transparencies I can do
transitions I can do three I can do
three tracks of images five tracks of
audio I can do color correction I can do
green screen I can do all of it it's not
as seamless and it's not as fluid is
when I'm producing on a proper
workstation but still I'd argue that I
need one more really a couple more of
those things going on here but we're
getting close
we're getting close but that's but
that's what I'm saying is if we're
talking about transition we're never
there it's all a work in progress it's
all it's all constant this is like until
death and so over over the next two
years considering how far we've come
over the last year over the next two
years I feel that there could be a
segment of this population especially as
more specialist devices come out that
was a really cumbersome sentence
especially as more specialist devices
come out but it's only going to take a
handful of players in this space to show
off truly high-end and demographic
focused solutions a player like red
getting into this space starts to bring
legitimacy to a market of mobile
high-end video production and using your
phone to fit into that kind of workflow
a few more players like that really
speaks to where where we could go with
this style of work and productivity and
if we have a couple companies out there
that are actually trying to push the
boundaries on making sure the hardware
solutions are in place for the
developers to take advantage of that
then I think that's that's the right
play I think that's the right
action to handle it's all the more
interesting that it's coming from a
company like vivo where the few a few
products I've experienced of theirs have
been more that see of mid Rangers and
selfie cameras and like really popular
sort of you know younger consumer fair
to see them come out with some of these
specs means that the specs war is kind
of done you know you can make a phone
that's essentially laptop grade powerful
and now it's up to software developers
to take advantage of it I think they're
still just more in terms of ilium to OEM
the PvP sword-fighting button no that's
for well I mean I mean what I'm saying
is when you actually get to the consumer
facing release you know there's gonna be
a ton of stuff happening behind the
scenes there's still a ton of argument
over how we're gonna handle neural
processing ai machine learning
everyone's trying to create their own
standard that plugs into Universal you
know development but we discs themselves
I mean you know we could be talking
about two four gigabyte LP are ddr3
discs and then a1 and like a two
gigabyte lpddr3 are too even and it
could be in like the ten gigabytes that
they're doing but you know you'd hope
that's something happens in terms of
getting those parts together in high
quality high throughput is just I mean
so getting into the grind on what what
the actual hardware is that that will be
important and I know a lot of people in
especially in our comments on videos are
going to be paying attention to you know
even just what what class and grade of
storage is that for 512 are you gonna be
getting 512 gigabytes of like ufs 2.1
people are gonna care about that but the
vast consumers out there once its
consumer facing like that and once those
specs actually exist and we start to see
some software taking advantage of more
aggressive hardware they're not gonna
care at least the first one the first
blush is always going to be the they're
not going to care but you know over
talked we we do have a tweet from renato
Laporte using pn weekly attend gigabytes
of ram on a phone finally i can use
chrome like once we have hardware like
that think about blurring the lines be
Chromebooks and chrome is a desktop
style operating system and the web
browser on your phone being a truly
desktop grade browsing experience as
we're adding you know components of apps
that are downloaded momentarily for that
actual instance you don't have to load a
full app because you'll have these sort
of apps on-demand services like all of
this stuff ties together for having a
significant amount of desktop grade
storage and memory to accomplish these
tasks you know again we talk about the
death of Windows Phone but Microsoft
could I doubt they will but Microsoft
could pull some sort of back-end entry
into the mobile space again utilizing
Windows as a service on ARM chip sets
you know like there's potential there
where again even two years ago we would
have mocked a move like that but we
should probably i mean i'm mock it all
day long they're gonna keep trying
anyways because it's in there important
their interests to try it's it's all the
funnier when we know that the the top
brass at Microsoft have no interest in
that kind of mobile strategy and they're
pushing everything server side I think
they really are impressed with
themselves about potentially unseating
Apple is the most valuable company on
the planet they a third cake now they
want the frosting which is hilarious oh
you want to go to LG purposely threw the
little apple at Bing in theirs and we
could make a transition okay okay so
apparently I got this the the update
this morning about the arbitration you
know apparently because when I went into
the story about LG's settlements with
the the class it's like you had all the
details like it was reported beforehand
and Gerard gives the lawsuit that's
representing the class here had a site
up dedicated to you know the settlement
and by the time I got to it all the
content was gone and Germany and
apparently there was nothing I could get
from the company about it the when I
looked up like the original page where
they said that they were working on the
case
it just said LG is extending their
warranty call LG and that's all
incontinent and then apparently Ars
Technica made the official calls in
apparently that's that's that's all I
get him so well first of all let's just
kind of recap sorry I I do apologize
listeners and viewers like I am I am
trying as hard as I can not to hack up
with all of this dust going through my
lungs right now real quick can can we
recap what did what did the settlement
what what did the class-action lawsuit
reveal or what were some of the benefits
because we've been hearing the echo
chamber on LG plus boot loop since the
g4 people who were concerned about it
affecting the v10 Nexus devices and out
of all of the phones of LG recently the
g5 was my most problematic where I went
through three of them and in the one I
have that still technically works kind
of doesn't work what what what were
people in for is this just the g4 and as
far as I know and please correct me if
I'm wrong people who weren't a part of
this initial batch of class action
lawsuit participants are kind of Sol
like they can't join this now that the
that the settlements been reached yeah
all right so the problem it is is that
apparently the original issue with the
g4 and the subsequent devices being the
v10 g5 p20 and the Google Nexus 5x which
LG produced was that there was some so
there was a soldering issue where it was
important like the PCB was not
connecting to the CPU and that was
causing the boot loops themselves part
of that which is the main step that
we're talking about here is LG
supporting that and not taking those
claims and giving them due process and
that was part of the issue here now
Jerrod Gibbs initially set up the
class-action to feature just the G for
that class expanded with the v10 g5v 25x
and that was all in the start of 2017
technically oh what a lot of what LG a
lot of companies actually have clauses
in their contracts in you know for
end-users it says that if you agreed to
certain things or if you if you don't
talk down which was the case here of
certain things then you agree to not sue
LG and you would go into arbitration can
determine remediation and what was
initially reported what was initially
published actually was a $700 credit for
another LG handset or four hundred
twenty-five dollars in cash and there
was a form out and if you owned any of
the devices that were affected if yet
Ciera number proof of purchase you were
able to get into the the payments but
that all got taken down and what is
actually being reported by ours here is
that's only the those who joined the
party those who joined the class action
will be going forward with into with
this apparently this helmet and that
other customers will be going forward
with 30 months of from the date of
purchase that they can get but activate
the warranty and get it replaced at no
cost
so I mean and we have seen some other
alternatives if they you know if some
adventurous people want to go to China
and get some of the board replaced get
six
they can do that for like $120 that was
an unofficial thing but you know that
seems like the best idea like how much
you really want to really you just want
to give the finger to the whole process
just because it's so in a separate
Google problem a Google solution when
what was it the the 5x some of the
settlement seems to have impacted Google
strategy for replacing five X's which
have had battery and blooping problems
ever since these two because there were
some batches of that too again it was I
think it was a little bit harder to
glean how chronic the issue was on the
6p versus just the echo chamber at work
whereas the 5x seemed and again this is
I don't have numbers to back this up
these are just my feelers the the 5x
seemed to have more ready and
discernible problems but I thought it
was kind of interesting seeing like they
didn't they released a program where
they were going to be replacing select
phones that were suffering from very
specific problems with the Moto X 4 yeah
that's well I mean their friends from
2015 anyway so at this point they'd be
there'd be well out of production and
they I mean so it could be that the
lawsuits are a part of it but it's more
likely that they're just out of
production and that the only way that
they would be able to satisfy what they
could in the warranty was to replace it
with a what they consume right yeah
exactly so that's there's a mix of that
we're getting into that Twilight phase
here where things just kind of blur yeah
it's kind of difficult to tell like on a
phone that came out you know in 2015 are
you really having problems that are a
manufacturer based or are you just
succumbing to your phone being 2 plus
years old
life cycles we and those are those are
just great I've been going through like
just some old device
is to kind of like see like if there's
anything worth revisiting just how many
of them won't power on won't charge like
oh no tech does not last like we think
it should that's crazy well one of the
things that does last more often
surprisingly that's not the iPhone I
mean we've seen refurbished units go up
for sale and they'd seem to last pretty
well if left to their own devices and
not you know you know slammed into that
right prior prior to iOS 10 yeah I do
iOS 10 point to point do J and SEC
trying to just go after seeing if they
can do anything about this see if they
can get a people against Apple case
going on here is that I think it's I
think it's totally worth the
investigation um I I don't I don't feel
it truly raised rises to the level of
you know actionable legal severe legal
consequences to Apple especially with
whatever reason why Apple still gets to
be a sweetheart company for state and
federal governments how many iPhones are
utilized in military national science
national defense and politics law
enforcement you know you you you we've
kind of arrived at the iPhone being some
sort of de facto standard for all of
these different agencies I don't think
we'll get to anything that's going to be
severely punitive but I really do hope
that there is a public examination of
the company's business practices
especially after we just went through
all of these tax shenanigans with them
you know sort of playing ball with them
extorting at lower tax rate so they
could repatriate funds that they weren't
really paying their tax bill on also
that they could drop their tax rate they
weren't paying taxes and they want to
pay less taxes is is again you know kind
of a kind of a scummy business practice
from a company that's supposed to be
this American industry sweetheart so I
think they're overdue just some kind of
examination into how they do business
how they really with their customers and
and like not just taking the narrative
of Apple on its face value really did
into some of these behaviors I think
they went a little too far and I hope
that enough of this messaging comes out
that fans of iOS and fans of iPhones can
demand from their favorite manufacturer
improvements you should not be building
a thousand dollar smartphone which only
has the bare minimum battery capacity to
last you the day and will degrade with
no buffer and their only solution is to
slow down the power draw from the CPU
that is terrible design that is very
anti consumer design and it's cynically
not only just planned obsolescence but
an aggressive tactic at trying to make
yearly product cycles more desirable
than they really are you know you get to
that point where even after a year
you're now threatening phones if you run
the phone at full power you could
experience you know reboots or you know
sudden power loss or you know sudden
power cycling stuff like that that's not
ok we we should all be able to say
that's not ok so I do hope that we see
some aggressive examination of the
company though I doubt anything
seriously punitive will come from it I
would like to see what happens in
Australia because according to show that
I peruse very often the check out from
ABC there are consumer law is pretty
intense and they have more strict terms
about what's you know considered good
for a lifecycle or the life of the
product and when they have plenty of
stuff so if anything is I mean they've
tried for certain things like iTunes
purchases where yeah you know so there's
there's a whole bunch of like I bet you
you will probably be a bit more
aggressive too just because an Apple
doesn't have the best name in Europe
because of their tax shenanigans so
again like regulatory agencies outside
of the United States are all kind of
itching to take a bigger bite out of
this company III realize like I could
have gone full pun on taking a bigger
bite out of the Apple and then decided
against it but I still told you about
the pun that was in my mind because
that's good I mean in the US it's the
code of Meck well yeah but again we have
this this notion of them being this this
like you know we're
somehow by having one of the world's
most profitable companies as an American
company but they're really not you know
their their headquarters were moved on
paper just so that they could benefit
from preferential tax treatment overseas
so I feel like if they want to leave
then we should stop pretending that
they're this darling of an American
company while they're sort of holding
jobs as ransom for you know what they
might build for a future campus or new
Apple stores or new manufacturing here
in the United States if they don't want
to play ball
bye-bye the current rules and they want
to throw money into offshore tax havens
then I don't think we should be giving
them the kind of like special treatment
that the company seems to get whenever
they come up under these investigations
think any of those 20,000 new jobs will
be dedicated to that iPhone I seen to
that
probably not as according to PocketNow I
don't know if you've read this blog it's
a it's a really handy tech news blog
they do a really good job of reporting
on these kinds of stories that again for
all of their money for all of their
wealth they keep a very limited team of
engineers and developers on tap to build
their products and they're they are very
aggressive about moving team members to
different projects there's a problem
with iOS they'll pull people off of OS X
and Mac books and Mac Pros to help with
iPhone problems and vice versa way Steve
Jobs would have wanted to well I mean
but the thing is like the I do I do
believe that a company climate of trying
to keep a small dedicated skunkworks
level top secrecy team of developers and
engineers working on your products makes
sense for how few products Apple
actually produces but that absolutely
means that their resources are
constantly complete with there are
problems not only problems just when
they're doing business normally when
everything's working like it should
you're near capacity for what your team
members can actually accomplish and
moving them around means you you have to
beg and borrow time from different from
different products different projects so
it would make sense to me that
the land of i/os if something was gonna
take a backseat for a short period of
time it would be a lower-cost
iPhone I think especially with the
iPhone 10 not resonating as well as I
think Apple hoped it would in in sales
numbers their solution isn't going to be
well let's make up more money by
dedicating resources to building a lower
cost lower margin iPhone it's going to
be let's really make sure that for
iPhone 9 or iPhone 11 or whatever it is
that they're going to call it that we
can really come out swinging swinging
with a desirable lifestyle product that
can build some buzz again McKnight
wonder where the staff goes because
Microsoft it's you know comparable staff
roles of was a hundred thousand where as
Apple was last reported to have 120,000
or so and miter saw cutting down it
started mostly with the Nokia with the
hardware going away and cuts into most
of their hardware divisions able to make
anything at this point and even with
that but yeah that's fair but even with
that they're still mostly you know doing
software and whatnot and that's that
still warms a hundred thousand people
whereas Apple like where where does the
staff all go do they go to the stores
because there's only like 50 people per
store at best if not you know because I
mean cuz you know that's a very good
question Jules and Apple is exactly the
kind of secretive company where I doubt
we'd ever get a very clear glimpse into
how they dedicate resources but for for
right now I would be willing to put good
money on the internal culture at Apple
being all hands on deck for iPhone 9
that they want their highest margin
product to launch as smoothly as they
can we saw the recent news that they're
gonna be backing off of new features in
iOS until they can sort out some of the
stability issues fix some of the
software ground gremlins which are still
plaguing iOS 11 they want to be the I
everything looks to me like a
conservative implementation of
dedicating resources
towards next-gen iPhone to be the proper
relaunch of the iPhone brand finally get
us away from the iPhone 6 form factor
potentially move all of their devices to
2x1 plus aspect ratio displays and and
make sure that everything is cooking for
them to recreate a level of desirability
that iPhone 10 sort of fizzle that
that's what I think they're doing and so
they can't have you know a lot of time
energy or money dedicated towards
refreshing iPhone se which is a shame
but I kind of feel like with the number
of people have met out there that still
have iPhone 5s is iPhone 6s
let alone iPhone 6s is iPhone se can
exist like it can probably throughout
this year I wouldn't be surprised if at
the end of this year I'm still perfectly
happy with the experience on my iPhone
se it's it's been working a champ I've
been happy at the end of this year I'll
probably swap the battery just cuz it'll
be cheap and moving forward like if we
can get a refresh on that for 2019 then
maybe we're in good territory there
again - I just haven't seen those
evergreen phones they can always just
pop and again it really speaks to the
usage of a phone like the iPhone se I'm
not looking at the iPhone se as a way to
have top-tier multimedia capabilities or
I'm not trying to produce you know
aggressive video content on it it is the
best on-the-go short interaction burst
of interaction communications device for
one thumb users and I don't need a whole
ton of horsepower to interact with
social media email take a couple nice
photos it's not the best camera anymore
but it's still a good camera I don't
need to go crazy with the hardware to
accomplish those tasks and as long as
it's still lean fluid smooth simple
lower resolution display not taking up
too many resources then the SE is still
going to be delightfully competitive in
a world of mid-range errs and finally we
got the whole pod here first bid into
the industry so basically you just have
to deal with
is that it yeah I mean I think I think
this world is currently going Alexa
Google home Bixby and then home pod I'm
gonna kind of pair it there's a buddy of
mine Jason T Lewis who does painfully
honest tech on YouTube and he's just
kind of a kind of a groovy FM radio kind
of voice gonna tell you about all things
that bugs him and why home pod is such a
failure he comes out I mean he's a cool
dude he comes out of a like legit
recording so he's got that kind of vibe
down musicians he's great I did like a
three hour Joe Rogan style conversation
podcast with him last week but his whole
thing you have to be careful as a
company like Apple because Apple does a
tremendously good job of educating
consumers and helping consumer basis
interact with tech one of the best
advantages of Apple as a company is
taking raw tech and polishing it up for
a much nicer user experience within an
ecosystem but the danger of that is once
you've educated consumers to interact
with tech products they can start to
look at the rest of the market and see
what other benefits there might be so
home pod still for me fits into a
category kind of like the Google home
max where audio doesn't cycle like tech
does if you already own a really nice
home stereo system home audio system
you're not going to want to replace
major parts of that with janky little
consumer tech speakers that can talk to
you you might want to incorporate smart
assistant features but you'll want to
plug that into your existing framework
not replace your current audio solution
with the actual noise generating
hardware and Apple is coming at this
banking on their brand name so it's an
Apple premium product that the Apple
label carries a premium price tag
features won't be available at launch
and it doesn't out-compete current
solutions I mean Jason brought it up and
I think he's spot on it doesn't
compete products like Sonos and i think
i would be willing to wager that if we
did a blind taste test
mm-hmm that people listening to home pod
listening to Google home listening to
echo and listening to so knows that the
Sonos would probably win in a blind
showdown of audio quality between these
different solutions these different
devices and products and so this is the
trap that Apple finds themselves in they
are not leading the way they did not
create this product segment they're not
doing anything to radically move the
needle on this product segment and
they're just reacting to a market that
they're falling further behind
I'm putting Apple you know just above
Cortana right now like this this is not
this is not the killer app where I think
they could have leveraged their user
base on Apple TV to better incorporate
audio and smart speakers into an Apple
ecosystem to an Apple lifestyle
I don't think hold on gets the job done
Siri remote you know the implemented
skills like that it's been slow going
what why cuz now now you have a fracture
in the Apple ecosystem where Apple TV
could have been the backbone I mean my
Samsung TV
we just got a new Samsung TV is a new Q
LED and it's got a microphone in the
remote to do voice actions on our Smart
TV that then control our speaker's
interact with different apps and
services plugs directly into this whole
ecosystem
we're using our chromecast a little bit
less because it's got better interaction
with Amazon video streaming services
yeah but you know the Apple TV competes
with another with a whole bunch of
over-the-top services they're not
necessarily if people want an
integrating experience with TV they can
just get one with I don't know Google
sustain I don't know that's what I'm
saying is someone who was in the market
for the Apple ecosystem and wanted an
Apple TV that would have been your user
base for a home pod but already you know
like a lot of people their first line of
audio interaction is going to be their
TV or a soundbar connected to their TV
so what benefit does home pod bring over
the most accessed and most trafficked
room of the house having the best
speaker system in the house
and the best interaction capabilities
through Apple TV already
you can't keep carving into the same
market and not redefining this for new
consumers to find why Apple might be the
superior choice you know this this to me
is what's so confusing about the home
pod launch is I think they're trying to
shear the same sheep but Apple TV has
already sheared this sheep and how do
you convince people to double down on
this when the Apple TV solution is
superior I mean it's it's all in the
form factor I think because that that's
just it you're going after what people
recognize as the medium for a service
you know it's not Apple tu you the Apple
TV it has its chance and in fact you
know yeah it had taken till 2015 when
Amazon debuted a speaker of all things
and that's the you know that's where the
craze is now so unfortunately this bill
is still a decently performing segment
for for Apple I mean it doesn't have
quite the same other products and music
but it still it still represents a
growing market for products and services
the exact mix of that because they don't
they they don't ever disclose it but
they you know from their Quarterly's
they do talk about what segments are
growing and Apple TV is commonly listed
alongside services like like Apple music
so we know that there is a growing demo
there I just don't see how home pod
services that market any better than
other iTunes capable Wi-Fi speakers that
can be cross-platform or interact with
multiple voice assistants or deliver
better sound quality at a lower price
and the consumer who's really apt to do
just a little comparative shopping is
probably not gonna walk away with home
pod being the the victor in most show
downs especially when they might already
have something like an Apple TV to
interact with I think that we've lost
you've lost the fight
Apple things that media goes on TV and
smart assistants go to digital and
that's why they're doing the efforts
there silently the efforts that
you're doing like that and see but even
that was following on a whole bunch of
gross from Netflix and their biggest
competitor ever to hell
Amazon so even Apple yeah was there was
their platform for launching Siri in the
living room you know so again for
whatever whatever uses that consumers
might make in a smart assistant in the
Apple ecosystem I think they're I think
they're already handled and I think
that's why we see my gross speculation
on his stories I think that's why we see
home pod launching to very tempered
responses very you know very
conservative reactions and why you can
still buy one like they're not sold out
this isn't something that I think was
really gonna take the world by storm and
they're late to this product segment and
like Apple watch they need to now
justify why their solution will be
superior for consumers in a world where
Alexa's gotten really good Google Homes
been getting better and the sort of
smart periphery of devices that listen
to you and react to you and interact
with other smart home features has
gotten really good Apple now needs to
play catch-up winning the hearts and
minds of consumers against the two other
biggest tech companies on the planet so
it's gonna be an uphill battle I'm
messin Apple can't do it but I totally
appreciate I totally understand why home
pod was the the fizzle of a launch that
it was and here's a slack key and weekly
what would app will have to do to make
those on Android consider jumping ship
they're already making people jumping
ship as they have touted quarter after
quarter of growth of conversions from
Android to iOS so it's I mean you know
the phones are doing well for them and
there's always going to be the the
Android as right now at least as far the
growth far paces any porting out that is
happening so for them yeah I mean
especially in a mature market I don't
even know that it's necessarily I don't
know that it's necessarily a direct
situation where Apple needs to say we
can make Android users switch teams more
I think the company that's really going
to set the stage
for the next phase of internetting is
gonna be the company that finds some
killer hooks into the novel application
of data and services in augmented
reality in smart home and in making
services platform agnostic I was getting
into a conversation with Renato Laporte
just on Twitter here a couple tweets
back and forth and he was saying like
it'd be really cool if we have Windows
on arm you know I could make I could
have an Android phone that then turns
into a Windows PC when I plug it into a
laptop you know it'd be the same
hardware that has the same support and
we're getting to a point where I might
not need it I might not need Windows if
I can already do my my writing and
editing in Microsoft Office and I
already have apps and services that
follow my cloud onedrive I already have
video editing software that works sort
of platform agnostic the operating
system isn't really gonna matter that
much
so Apple I think just needs to get ahead
of what the next phase of their
relationship with consumers is going to
be they had this huge COO with consumers
putting smartphones into consumers hands
with the iPhone that gave them 10 years
of market dominance but I don't think
it's gonna carry them through if they
are late to the party on the next phase
of data and services I think they move
better than first that we can take well
in Apple was first for targeting
consumers you know before before the
iPhone smartphones were targeted at
business people and why would you need
email all the time what are you on some
kind of leash that's not sexy or
desirable blackberries are ugly windows
phones are clunky Palm Pilots are laggy
you know like everything was painful for
consumers until the iPhone gave you a
real web browser in your pocket that's
what's going to dictate the next phase
of the top most successful company in
tech ruling the ecosystem is who's
really got the balls to to make that
play first who's really got the hutzpah
to transition over into a new form of
interactivity with services that
consumers latch onto and right now no
one wants to be first no one wants to be
first because they'll be criticized
than people will actually go with them
on that experiment and then the second
company to come out with that will
actually win just because the first
company introduced the concept consumers
started to get comfortable with it and
then someone else came comes along and
makes it exciting and sexy that's why
we're in this big holding pattern I
think we could probably be further along
in a our heads up tech face computing
better audio interactions and AI if we
were able to convince consumers to go
along with a few more experiments rather
than being so conservative about
everything
Andrew Wallace also on the hashtag P and
weekly on Twitter we're still live
people you can still join in we'd like
to see some new faces to capital is to
iOS 11 like Android is to Ice Cream
Sandwich
I was about to comment that it would be
more like lollipop just because of how
inefficient it was in tie-in you know
time with the Qualcomm issue of that
year yeah but just in honestly just
because of how many bug fixes that you
know this had to happen Ice Cream
Sandwich also introduced you know it was
jelly bean and then it was and then the
photo time and the KitKat and I sort of
consider for as like this whole family
of updates thing as opposed to just one
certain thing and it just like well I
don't know that's fair we've been we've
been focused on iOS 11 bugs because
they've been they've been so
uncharacteristically aggressive from a
company like Apple like some some pretty
bad problems that iOS launched with that
that needed fixing after consumers
already got their hands on the update
but that shouldn't completely overshadow
some of the teething pains that we've
had for Android ate the Oreo has had a
few little gremlins that exacts a
stoppage of updates from rolling ends
you know they've been fixed a lot of
these have been fixed in android 8.1 but
then we have to have that conversation
about the Android ecosystem not pushing
out updates directly to consumers you
know how many phones will be getting
Android a I've got my huawei May 10 Pro
Android 8 that's super cool I've got my
xperia x z1 compact Android 8 that's
really cool when should I expect that
we'll get some of these power management
and device stability gremlins ironed out
with 8.1 updates and we'll those
companies skip 8.1 to do some future you
know 8.2 or 8.3 build of Android gonna
skip 8.0 for 8.1 yep and that's the
right play but it's also taking so long
there should have been in Android update
for the essential phone one should have
happened quicker just just well 8.1
should have happened quicker if 8.0 was
going to be that buggy then 8.1 should
have been just you know what that's
abandoned a point oh and just go for it
so and one final tweets in main engine
yeah I just got that one too oh you okay
yeah he was just interested slack using
the PM weekly hashtag premium audio
companies incorporating smart technology
is way better than buying speakers from
a tech company and I'm potentially
looking at hosting a debate on things
like the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
in the future of audio in a number of
different or really is people a new
audience on us and and harbin
representatives together design
Flynn Bowers and Wilkins are putting out
Bluetooth headsets with active noise
cancellation there's definitely
something turning in the world of audio
and I know what companies I trust for
high quality audio and a lot of them are
starting to embrace not only mobile but
just like home tech in general
Sennheiser put out a sound bar that's
crazy but I mean that's crazy Sennheiser
is like one of the most respected you
know recording audio technology
companies on the planet and they have
some really compelling consumer focused
tack on the horizon which could be very
disruptive and very exciting I was going
to end this on David Bautista desilva's
a cynical common folks nobody can make
sorry billions by spending money on
workers or quality
this is business 101 and he has chief of
mr. Smithers from The Simpsons just
wiggling his finger
yes well um we do want to wrap up this
week's show talking about just a little
thought experiment on some politics and
some business news that broke the White
House commented on some of the story got
kind of walked back a little bit some
fears in the market and just interesting
seeing different factions of excuse me
of White House communications discussing
these topics uh you know and finding
pushback from other agencies like the
FCC and that's of course we're talking
about the news on some of the internal
reports in the White House on Trump
looking to nationalize a future 5g
network for the United States cutting
China telecommunications equipment out
of the loop and potentially even taking
the future of 5g out of the hands of
corporations ISPs and cell phone
carriers to make it a state-run solution
for networking and telecommunications
you know American citizens would work
would do business directly with the
federal government to to utilize future
5g Services that story was walked back
that this report had was wasn't timely
that it was a dated report just an
internal sort of examination of the
market not necessary it was senior
National Security Council first right
and something that they weren't actively
looking at the potential for
implementation but was just sort of you
know sort of a political what-if
scenario that they were examining
internally and along the way both
conservative and liberal members of the
FCC expressing concern and you know
disagreeing with this as a potential
recourse for the future of
telecommunications this is definitely
one of the more interesting topics
because you know I don't know that I'd
ever would have considered myself
agreeing with FCC Chairman edgy PI on
anything yet his reply to this was
something that I found a number of
liberals and conservatives in the tech
space probably would have agreed on the
idea of a fully nationalized 5g net
work completely owned operated and
controlled by the the federal government
probably a bad idea
yeah so now I would be interested in
considering what it would be like if we
had a public infrastructure in the first
place because we have roads we have you
know telephone system has been dominated
by you know one company and it was
forced to break up and then bring
combined all together again there's been
a lot of alternate thing yeah the
telecommunication space mobile too and
but still very it's a very highly
competitive it's the frontier of
telecommunications at this point in
billions of dollars would be important
to it but what if the government decided
hey let's build the the network anyways
or if think if there was a ground level
kind of thing going on and they didn't
have to you know acquire existing
construction sites or whatnot well they
they could they could you leverage
eminent domain to build any way they
wanted you so this this would be if
we're if we're entertaining this is some
sort of intellectual exercise
immediately I think we can point to the
success of the network unrolling and
being built very very quickly I know a
lot of people would probably disagree
with me on oh the federal government
can't do anything right says straw man
who disagrees what you wouldn't have to
deal with freaking you know media
acquisitions and oh hey here's the
government trying to sell off a freaking
madman or something well think is it and
precisely because the government can
also you know enact and remove rules
which could have been barriers
immediately like they they make the
rules so the rules technically don't
apply to them because they can change
the rules on the fly for however they
want to utilize this network the other
thing that could be a net positive for
consumers would be having one universal
and unified standard across the entire
country it would immediately cut out the
fake competition we have between
carriers lie
Sprint and Verizon on one side using
CDMA for their fallback 3G uh opposite
t-mobile us is it US Cellular yeah US
Cellular and you were sorry to see the
advice to the USL your seating in me
also yeah I thought they were GSM okay
sorry flipped that reverse it but again
we have sort of a fake dichotomy of
competition between replicated
technologies there really wasn't any
positive or benefit for consumers having
CDMA and GSM based 3G in the market at
the same time we just reinvented the
wheel and it caused a significant amount
of consumer lock-in so you couldn't do
what they do in Europe where you could
take your phone to another carrier for
competition we lacked that capability
here we had much stricter consumer
lock-in because of those differing
technologies so that would be a
potential benefit is not monkeying
around with sort of artificial
constraint in the market if the federal
government dictates this is our network
this is how you connect to it and you
know this is the universal compatibility
that devices will have to adhere to well
there's still a lot of debate about you
know its relationship to the private
sector because they're still producing
the telecom equipment and the ultimate
end-user
component of all this stuff in you know
there's there has to be some jockeying
around of that too
yeah but but the but the government
would arrive on one standard you know
they would put enough they would put up
like no bid contracts so that American
infrastructure companies would
immediately profit to the tune of
billions and billions of dollars and
then we would have 1:1 throughput we
would have one method of connectivity
that they would have complete control
over so really as soon as you get out of
those two consumer benefits from my
perspective everything else is a tragic
negative for the federal government
owning operating and controlling every
aspect of a 5g network for consumers
everything after that point I think is
is downhill for us from Andrew Wallace
brings up the
point you would worry about government
intrusion government access to spy on us
if the 5g was completely controlled we
live in an era right now where net
neutrality doesn't exist so they would
be able to completely control search and
narrative get in between services and
consumers and not only spy but actively
redirect or change information that
consumers have access to and then you
would also have the bureaucratic
relationship of how is this whole thing
implemented you know as much as I am a
bleeding-heart liberal there are times
where it's it might my complaints about
living in California and not having
fiber gigabit internet a component of
that is the fact that I live in the most
liberal state in the in the nation and I
have to at least own my liberal shame
whenever we do things that screw up too
so I really feel like the the UK and the
EU implementation of having stricter
government regulation you know stricter
federal guidelines for how these
services unroll and then the
administration and in sort of iteration
at the ground level falls on state and
local governments and the companies that
do business with state and local
governments we have a huge uphill battle
to fight in competition at the state and
local level that that's still a major
problem and one of the things that I
think affects the the net neutrality
debate but I still think it's better to
have companies waging that battle and
competing against each other than it
would be to have one overall dictating
resource from the federal government
controlling those aspects and I think
this this current administration is a
perfect example of the fact that
government works and sometimes it works
even when we don't want it to you know
when we had the Obama administration in
place we saw guidelines moving towards
net neutrality people voted out liberals
voted in conservatives and within a year
we voted to remove net neutrality policy
whenever we have that pendulum swing
then that federal government will get to
dictate and decide what happens to the
internet and it's always going to be
this hard pendulum flip back and forth
and back and forth and I think that
would also cause a ton of market
instability you know for other companies
that have to do business on the inner
you can't trust in four years when the
new administration comes in what's their
policy on censorship what's their policy
on net neutrality what's their policy on
communications competition against
traditional cell phone and data carriers
I think just across the board this would
be ruinous for the North American
economy so I want to take at least a
cursory look at something you know where
government was involved in an
infrastructure project to this effect
that would be Australia with the
National Broadband Network and B n first
came out proposals first came out in
2010 and then it was started with a
oppose the opposing government taking
over and then carrying out the idea in
opposing the leader of the opposing
camera at the time was like no we're not
going to do this and you know I'm not
doing it anyway so yeah there's that but
it was a project to take ah replace all
the copper wiring with fiber mm-hmm over
time the politics of that the money of
that was kind of switched around and you
know we weren't dealing with you know
net neutrality with all these kind of
other you know contingent rules about
eminent of information domain and
whatnot but it was funny because like
there's fiber you know and then ended up
being well we have to connect to the
interchanges exchanges and then the
nodes and you know it was originally
going to be fiber to the door fiber to
the house fiber town now and then it
became fibre to the node and you know
and all the copper wiring that still
exists and still has to go through
speeds of gigabit you know it's now it's
25 yeah I can't even get I can barely
get a 20 megabit upload which again puts
a huge crimp on ability to stream to
create content to sort of leverage you
know a competitive stance in the world
economy when you know like our
editor-in-chief Tony is paying like 10
bucks a month for gigabit upload speeds
in Romania I'm suddenly less competitive
as a content creator in again one of the
world's largest economies and the most
liberal state
in the United States so this this is
another thing too we've gotten some
comments here using the the PN weekly
hash tag we we have we do need to do
sort of an accounting there were
numerous fees associated with cable
companies and cell phone carriers that
would be tacked on to your bills for
things like infrastructure and
improvement and there was a promise that
we would be building out
fiber-to-the-home
those companies largely sat on that cash
and it became - sort of another method
of profitability for those companies not
to say that there weren't Network
improvements we can all point to
marginal and iterative Network
improvements but we never got what was
promised us and I think that's why we're
also seeing a community backlash in
making more sort of community funded
initiatives for things like broadband
and we saw in Colorado with them
fighting a verizon lawsuit to do that so
this is from Renato Laporte in the
Netherlands every house has a telephone
cable because it was once made by a
state-run company who didn't look at the
costs now that same company which is
private has put Fiber to home in only
two percent of the houses because it's
costly so having the network being run
by the government and selling capacity
to providers could be a solution to
companies not covering rural areas
because it costs a lot of money and has
no returns but there are also many
downsides and this is another huge
debate that we're having here in the
United States with how vast you know the
the differing areas between urban and
rural communities are it can't just be a
market led decision this is the liberal
in me we can't rely solely on the market
because the market is perfectly happy to
write off a significant amount of this
population they are not worth investing
in improving data infrastructure data
services you just can't make enough
money on them so they just don't exist
and that is a terrible position for a
population segment in the United States
to just suddenly disappear from the
world economy they are no longer they
are currently not competitive and they
don't exist in this conversation
activism that's going on with via
connected internet premises their their
political power just drops - Oh totally
oh and they are not a part of this
conversation they and this becomes a
cyclical generational problem - they are
not worth investing in now which means
their schools their hospitals their
communities are already underperforming
and they're just gonna continue to fall
further and further and further behind
farther and farther and farther behind
the rest of the population more urban
and dense population centers so we need
to find some kind of balance there if
those people want to come together in
their community and build a network and
an infrastructure based on their own tax
dollars they should be allowed to if
they can show that companies refuse to
service them and we shouldn't have to
fear a Verizon going in to sue and under
you know underperforming poor
municipality and you know try and lawyer
them to death while they're also
disingenuously saying like oh we offer
you broadband you have you know a 1
megabit DSL connection that's kinda like
broadband we should be able to point to
better solutions than that but we're
also I mean that's also why we're
completely stuck on a number of these
issues laws that the state-level kind of
prevent a lot of that stuff and that's
also what Andrew sis lack is writing and
P and weekly is there a way the
government can subsidize the
implementations of 5g and I'm sure there
is but then we also get into some of the
the uglier discussions on the government
picking winners and losers
you know III do share some concerns with
my more libertarian leaning friends and
tech pundits because we're sort of stuck
in a holding pattern right now what
company is really going to invest in
smaller communities and more rural
communities and major cities that don't
have real competition at the same time
how can we make sure that the market
actually does perform the way it's
supposed to even under the guiding hand
of regulation and not just picking all
Verizon's kind of winning so we'll just
dump a whole bunch of money on Verizon
and they can solve all the problems that
doesn't really service the future of
American tell
Communications and it's a really ugly
problem to try and unravel that's that
is actually I make jokes about it but
that actually is what we're trying to
face here in Southern California is we
want to see what companies can truly
deliver fiber solutions to homes give
them Pole access give them zoning for
digging trenches if they need to data
centers but the host companies actually
need to be able to deliver on that in a
way that current cable and cell phone
companies have promised but not
delivered on those kinds of promises so
you get the sticky back and forth you
know if an 18t can't really deliver on a
u-verse for the entire Greater la
metropolitan area then we shouldn't be
giving them preferential zoning
treatment but if we don't give them
preferential zoning treatment and
they're not even going to try so I think
it's already a dirt on enforcing the
rules that it already has because you
know the free-market attitudes
prevailing in the current administration
but you know that's that's just oh yeah
free-market isn't really prevailing I
mean we see we're seeing them we're
seeing this administration absolutely
obviously favor certain industries over
others certain companies certain regions
over other regions and and again I think
we're always going to see some element
of bias regardless of who's president
it's just I don't know that I've ever
seen an administration that was so
obvious about what winners and losers
they wanted to pick you know when we
have a president in the State of the
Union talking about beautiful clean coal
as an energy strategy I think it's
pretty clear they're not even pretending
to be fair partial or you know objective
in this analysis so I just don't have
high hopes for any kind of government
run or government led initiative at this
point at least not until we can we can
find some stronger counter voice I least
in the Senate in the house and hopefully
in other regulatory agencies that can
kind of balance the executive at the
moment we just have the European Union
except the American Union come in and
well that's actually I mean Jules you're
not wrong in my fear is we're gonna be
seeing an increasing distance between
the most competitive European and Asian
markets and the United States I think
we're gonna keep falling behind in
general consumer adoption of new tech
and and new access and new services and
we already see that agree the standards
that we don't even adopt yeah well no
totally I mean and and we can't even
reach some of the standards at these
other companies these other companies
these other countries take for granted
at the moment so when when we're already
sort of playing a bad hand and working
from a deficit for a huge significant
portion of this population I don't see
this administration in this current
political climate being clever enough to
find ways to help us catch up let alone
lead the way we're pretending like we
still lead the way and we absolutely
don't who will is gonna again that's
going to be a an economic driver that's
going to have an impact on generations
of consumers in this space well that's a
thought to leave us I guess yeah let's
let's let's end on a bummer I think
that's always fun yes it's Friday I mean
you want to you know just or if you're
listening to the audio version of this
it's Monday or Tuesday and we got so
yeah you know I'm actually as soon as
we're out of this podcast I'm gonna
finish fixing my workstation and then I
am gonna go and grab hopefully get then
go into the fetal position
yeah and just cry myself to sleep in the
shower
wait no that's not no that's wrong Lexi
to deal with so oh my I slept my
daughter to cope with no we're gonna go
outside and play and have some fine
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say
everyone go outside take a nice deep
breath a breath of fresh air breathe in
some some Wi-Fi and 4G and be thankful
that you don't have
I went to the nude and and go go go do
something refreshing and life-affirming
so folks I think we're gonna put a pin
in it this episode of the pocket net
weekly has come and gone finally it's
over and of course the conversation
outside of this continues on Twitter
