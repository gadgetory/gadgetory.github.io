expert the f3 arrived on my doorstep a
little more than 24 hours before this
video was published so we'll have to
test those claims in a future video but
cracking this box open we can at least
share some first impressions very well
packaged and well accessorize - charger
cable case the papers will never read
and it took me a while to find them but
a pair of your buds to boot happy to see
these aren't your pod style buds either
but proper inner orals also this charger
and cabling looks familiar
hmm probably just a coincidence and then
we get to the phone
the only other out boy spent any time
with was the f1 plus where we again used
it to produce a selfie camera battle the
design language is exceedingly similar
on the f3 yet another company doing
interesting things with antenna oh sorry
home let me just there yeah yet another
company doing interesting things with
antenna bands this pinstriping looks
pretty keen and we're in familiar
territory for a rounded rectangle though
the slightly flatter sides are welcome
for holding on to such a large slab of
gadget booting up for the first time we
get to our setup screens well quick in
the login process is straightforward
registering a fingerprint on this beast
was not my favorite but then we're
dropped off into the UI dubbed color OS
if the hardware aesthetic might remind
you of another manufacturer style the
software will to this skin alters
Android by removing the app drawer and
splitting the notification shade
requiring a gesture to switch from
toggles to alert not exactly my favorite
way to use an Android handset but it's a
popular UI in Asian markets this phone
is big and it feels big the whole affair
powered by a Qualcomm 6 v - last year's
top mid-range er chipset we have enough
horsepower for UHD video from the 16
megapixel rear camera but no
stabilization to speak of the real draw
here is the new front camera combo
proper separate sensors for a normal and
a wide field of view 16 and 8 megapixel
cameras respectively I'm not going to
lie I like that the normal camera mode
for the selfie shooter does not blur my
skin all pack in some terrible beauty
mode I earned those
rekkles and crow's-feet we're happy to
see a goodly amount of storage onboard
and the older chips that gave us some
battery concerns until we saw the four
thousand milliamp our cell packed in so
that should even outrun time between the
hot chip set and the big screen a few
small bummers right off the bat though
this monster ships with Android
marshmallow and on an older security
patch I'm not a heavy FM radio user
anymore which this phone doesn't seem to
support but the lack of an NFC radio
will be a mark against for any folks who
like quick pairing tap and share or
mobile payments all in all it's a well
vetted collection of specs but at a
price climbing into very competitive
territory launching at almost 31
thousand rupee the f3 is priced just
above what we can find the one plus 3t
and that's also the same range where we
expect to see an axon 7 those are tough
phones to be unless you're that
individual who takes their selfie game
really seriously as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to the channel for more first
impressions like these and what say you
audience which phone would you most like
to see in a selfie battle against the f3
drop a comment down below this video
maybe we can make that happen
we're pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now
some gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram
and I will catch you all on the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
