iPhone will support the Apple pencil and
this time for real we get specifications
and information on the razor phone and
it's reportedly gonna scream and ask the
LGB 30 ghosts live deals start emerging
I'm Jaime Rivera and again for awesome
t-shirts like these ripped apparel there
is a link in the comments along with the
10% discount
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals appear in
the market for a new iPhone the iPhone 8
has got some very interesting deals if
you bring trade-ins in sprint we're
talking about the company guaranteeing
three hundred and fifty dollars for a
vast list of devices that are in the
link in the description some of these
are very old so I'm sure most of you
will probably have one in the drawer I
highly recommend you follow a link in
the description again other interesting
deals have to do with the lgb 30 our
final review unit arrived on Wednesday
some of you already have it and there
are deals in t-mobile where if you buy
one you get a $500 MasterCard that you
can use to get another V 30 a g6 or of V
20 if I were you out of these three
obviously I'd go for another V 30 but
then again if you're on a budget the g6
and the V 30 would be an amazing combo
now as well the spotlight over to
Samsung as the company is apparently
bringing a major update to Bixby on
October 18 and this is interesting as
I've been using Bixby ever since it got
really good recently up to the point
where it's pretty much the voice' system
that I'm defaulting to most because of
the button and everything so I'm really
curious to see number one of this is
true that there is going to be an update
number two what is the update going to
be about this victory as it is is rather
interesting I would highly suggest you
give it a try and how about if we
discuss iPhones no it's not the hottest
news today there's actually something
hotter we hear that there will be an
iPhone in 2019 that will be supporting a
stylus now we don't know exactly what
type of stylus we don't know if it's
going to be the same technology of the
Apple pencil on its own unique Apple
pencil or if you could just buy an Apple
pencil and be able to use it on the
iPhone whatever the case may be we've
wondered what's taken Apple so long to
be able to provide this technology if
thing where it's most useful as a
notepad of you would wanna jot notes
would be on the display size of a plus
iphone or in the case of an iPad Mini
which we haven't seen an iPad Mini Pro
so this makes a lot of sense let's see
evidence of happening as the sources
claim that this will happen and finally
the very hot news that they have to do
with the razor phone apparently number
one this is going to be the name the
razor phone and what we're getting here
are interesting spec Snapdragon 835
eight gigabytes of RAM in addition to 64
gigs of storage a 5.7 inch display and
obviously the whole concept that this
phone will be geared to gamers
I am extremely curious this wouldn't be
the first time that we get to see a
company build a phone focused on gamers
I mean we saw the Xperia Play I actually
still have that phone by the way and
then we saw all the attempts from Nvidia
the question today would be would you be
willing to buy a phone focused on gaming
and if so how much would you be willing
to pay in my case it all depends on the
package mainly because I've been testing
games recently focused on mobile gaming
like for example modern combat I even
tweeted about it this morning where I'm
like I'm looking at all the soldiers and
instead of them taking cover while I
shoot at you know they're actually
you're attacking them and they're still
running around so I feel that mobile
gaming still has a long way to go and I
would consider it not necessarily smart
to buy a phone just focused on this but
let's see what we get and I'd love to
know what you think in the comments down
below and friends again if you want to
