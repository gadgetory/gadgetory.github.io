tablets and smartphones last longer no
not that kind of longer we'll get into
that in today's episode of the Android
guy weekly all right so last week we
talked about batteries specifically we
talked about how batteries are holding
us back our processors our screens
our GPUs our radios everything that
we're doing inside of our phones and
tablets is using more and more power and
that little battery right there is kind
of holding us back because oh this guy
is where does it say it's like 1750
milliamp hours yep right there 1750
milliamp hours that's not that much and
the more powerful devices we get the
more power we need to have in our
batteries to be able to use them like
we'd expect it was a good topic and then
we went to the discussions the
discussions we got into a lot more
detail thank you guys for doing that and
then the people who didn't have a lot of
battery knowledge and expertise we're
able to ask a lot of questions that a
lot of the the people we had some guys
in there with like electrical
engineering degrees Wow
they were able to help out a lot so if
you haven't looked at the comments
please after the video look at the
comments add your own if you've got
something you can add to the
conversation please do if you've got a
question that wasn't answered please ask
that's what the Android guy weekly is
all about interestingly one of the
biggest topics from that whole
discussion was how can I make my battery
last longer
okay everybody wants more battery life
right exactly but that wasn't the
question the question was how can I
expand the lifespan
you see batteries have a shelf life just
like the gallon of milk that's in your
fridge they don't last forever
eventually they go sour batteries don't
go sour like milk does they just
kind of lose their ability to hold the
charge you can still charge them in
discharging but they lose the ability to
hold it or the ability to hold it gets
shorter and shorter and shorter so that
you might not be able to get through an
entire day so how can we make our
batteries last longer and why is it such
a big deal let's answer that second part
first it's a big deal because take a
look at your tablet I don't care if it's
an Android or an iOS device take a look
at it open it up tell me what size your
batteries you can't open it up you say
yeah your battery's stuck in there isn't
it not easy to get out sure with the
right tools and the right people you can
do it but generally speaking that's not
something an end-user is supposed to do
so essentially you have a non
replaceable battery in your tablet not
cool sorry but it's not let's go over to
smart phones the smart phones that I
have are all end-user battery
replaceable I can swap out a new battery
no problem that's an advantage if I want
to go on an extended trip and have a
couple batteries in my pocket when I run
out of juice I can turn it off pop the
battery pop a new one in turn it back on
I'm good to go or if I have a battery
that dies I can pop a new it in I'm good
to go or I can get an extended battery
and have an extended amount of time that
I can use my phone it's great I love it
and it's fabulous but a lot of phones
these days are coming out with non user
replaceable batteries there are some
advantages to that I'm not gonna go into
that in this video but there are
advantages and I don't I'm not gonna
knock manufacturers for doing that but
it does make our topic today even more
poignant
that's your vocabulary word for the day
by the way the problem that most of us
has is we don't know how to charge your
phones I didn't know how to charge a
battery did you know that I'm a ham
radio guy go ahead and get your
snickering over with okay great I was
providing emergency communications out
on antelope island you can look that up
on Google Maps there's no power out
there by the way well to a couple places
where I was there was not so
didn't have the power that we needed to
run the radios the laptops the repeaters
you know all of that stuff we had to
bring in our own and a lot of it was
battery based so we had a discussion
about batteries me and an Elmer if you
don't know what an Elmer is it's ham
radio lingo you can look that up too he
took some time to teach me about
batteries he had a laptop there with a
little digital sticky note on the screen
that said charging disabled I didn't
know why so he told me said you see I'm
running this laptop off the power but
I'm not charging the battery so I'm not
discharging the battery either when I
need the battery I have a battery when I
don't need the battery I'm using the
power it's great okay but why turn your
battery charging off said that's the
fastest way that you can kill a battery
is by keeping it always charged blew me
away I thought that that was completely
ironic and it probably still is but you
see batteries have an optimal run rate
so this battery for example generally
speaking I don't know this one
specifically works best between 20% and
80% charged that's kind of the sweet
spot for most batteries so you drop
below 20% you're shortening how much
life you can get out of your battery you
go above 80% you're shortening the life
that you get out of your battery now
that's another problem
see our smart phones aren't really
reporting the true state of charge of
our battery they're reporting something
else and I don't really know what it is
but it's to help you you know they want
you to see hey you've got a hundred
percent to you'll stay up really high
percentages longer than you should
and you'll stay above lower percentages
longer than you should so it's not a
straight line like one would imagine
that it should be I don't know why they
do that I don't know the whole ins and
outs of that if you do let us know but
by keeping your battery between 20 and
80 percent you are going to be able to
use it for a lot longer three or four
times longer than you normally would so
how long should you use them well about
two years is
about the average length of time that
you should expect to be able to use
efficiently use a lithium ion or lithium
polymer battery just so you know if you
keep that thing charged all the time
expect that to be cut in half if you
discharged it or deep discharged that's
where you run it below 20% specifically
down to where your phone has to power
off because it doesn't have enough juice
that's also going to cut down the
lifespan of your battery probably more
than in half okay that's when you might
get six to eight months if you
continually deep discharge it it's not
designed for deep discharge again and
again and again okay it is but it has
side effects okay don't do it so that's
the tip keep your batteries somewhere
between 20 and 80 percent that might
mean that you just leave it on your desk
throughout the day not plugged in until
an hour before you go home by doing that
you're going to be able to extend the
lifespan of your battery which if you've
got a device that you can't take the
battery out of and replace that means
you're going to expand or extend the
life of your device if you do have a
user replaceable battery like I do in my
devices that just means you're not going
to have to spend as much money on
replacement batteries which is always a
good thing and last thing to mention
whenever you do have a battery that goes
out make sure you take that back to your
battery store for proper recycling do
not just throw them away
lithium is toxic you don't want that
ending up in your groundwater okay so
there's the environmentally friendly
okay screw that I'm not environmentally
friendly today I just don't want my kids
to be poisoned tip of the day it's that
fun enough all right so for another
episode of Android guy weekly and how to
get more life out of your batteries i'm
joe levi and now it's your turn go down
