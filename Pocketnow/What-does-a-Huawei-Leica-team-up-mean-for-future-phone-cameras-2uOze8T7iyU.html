the more interesting announcements which
came out of MWC 2016 was actually pretty
quiet as huawei and like announced they
were entering into a long-term
partnership for future smartphone
cameras so what does that mean when a
traditional camera manufacturer works
with a smartphone manufacturer and how
might that affect future Huawei phones
I'm Vaughn Carlos back now for PocketNow
and we're gonna take a quick look at
mobile photography team-ups for
smartphones we like to think that each
manufacturer is an island and they're
waging war against their competing
rivals but there's actually a lot more
cooperation going on behind the scenes
than many people realize we already have
a pretty good idea that Qualcomm is
manufacturing a majority of the chipsets
and processors for phones out in the
ecosystem Samsung might be making RAM or
flash memory for phones other than
galaxies and of course Sony is probably
the most popular camera sensor
manufacturer so how important might it
be to have third-party branding for a
specific phone technology I mean if we
take a look at audio for example HTC has
a reputation for building really high
quality music playing phones either from
the speakers or from the headphone jack
and they've moved from beat licensing to
Dolby certification on their smartphones
so for Dolby to approve HTC slapping
their logo on their phones HTC has to
have built a phone which meets the
standards of Dolby licensing a
partnership for the camera is probably
gonna work in a similar way but there is
a little bit more room or a little bit
more range for how two companies might
interact with each other if we look at a
Lumia smartphone Zeiss is the company
responsible for the optics the actual
lenses in the phone but Microsoft has
their own branding for the camera sensor
technology it's called pure view the
result of that partnership is a camera
with excellent optics and fantastic
pixel level detail Zeiss as a lens
manufacturer doesn't seem to have any
qualifications for image processing we
saw noticeable improvements for
blackberry after a partnership deal the
camera on the passport I would have
rated as acceptable there's a huge jump
moving up to the prif now the privies
utilizing a Schneider lens and again we
saw improvements to pixel level detail
clarity contrast and color now part of
that is ISO just to the image processing
the camera app on the blackberry was a
huge improvement over the passport but
that's a
pretty magical combination when you can
improve both software and hardware in
one generation
now some manufacturers are able to
achieve very good results even when
they're building everything themselves
everything's in-house Samsung is
probably the gold standard for a company
which can do everything from the
fabrication of the image sensor to
grinding the glass to create all of the
lenses for their Galaxy smartphones well
when we look at manufacturers but don't
have the same kind of in-house
experience at building their own camera
equipment and they don't have any kind
of third-party relationship with some
kind of camera manufacturer we do see a
few weaknesses the LG v10 is packing my
favorite overall camera experience but
the lens performance on this phone is
actually one of its weakest aspects it's
a little more prone to aberrations and
distortions but that's got to be weighed
against having one of the absolute best
camera apps I've ever seen some
fantastic image processing and color
rendition and they're currently the only
manufacturer taking into account things
like audio control while shooting video
which in a roundabout way brings us back
to quality now Huawei makes good cameras
for their phones this is the honor 5x
$200 phone perfectly reasonable camera
experience at that price point and
before MWC we put out our review on the
mate 8 which had a respectable camera
just wasn't anything mind-blowing what's
interesting about this partnership liked
it in the past has been a very
conservative or traditional company a
long time ago they built their
reputation for building incredible film
cameras with fantastic lenses if you
take a second to look up with a
rangefinder camera is chances are
probably pretty good that they're going
to use a Leica as the example and for
many of their more recent camera bodies
they're actually taking parts from
Panasonic and kind of tweaking them to
their own Lycus standards if the Huawei
like a partnership is more than just
skin deep more than just like us
applying a couple lens elements for
huawei phones we could actually see some
pretty terrific benefits for both
companies Huawei earns instant respect
from camera enthusiasts in much the same
way that many people celebrate the Zeiss
optics on Lumia phones but like a stands
to benefit from having a firm producing
bleeding edge technology which can
introduce like a branding to a
completely new demographic of consumers
we already know that Leica and Panasonic
have a pretty decent relationship and
panasonic has tried to produce their own
android-powered hardware in the past
with the cm-1 huawei work
with Leica and utilizing Panasonic's one
inch camera sensor could be an
evolutionary leap over how we currently
produce smartphone cameras that's really
grandiose long-term thinking kind of my
personal wishlist for what I hope to see
in a future smartphone now thanks to
leaked Master General Evan blaze we've
already seen some really high quality
slides on what the qua way p9 is going
to look like and that's gonna be the
first phone with like a branding and one
of the interesting things about that
phone is it's going to be a dual-camera
sensor device now this is a really early
leak so we don't quite know yet how
those dual cameras are going to interact
with each other if they're going to be
used for depth of field tricks or 3d
imaging similar to what HTC was trying
to do on the m8 or if one camera sensor
is a wider angle lens and another's a
narrower angle lens like we see on the
LG g5 or if they're just two of the
exact same sensors designed to help
improve low-light imaging and HDR
performance thanks to advanced software
compositing it's really exciting
watching one of the highest selling
smartphone manufacturers partner up with
such a well-respected camera brand and I
think the benefits for both companies
here could be profound but of course we
want to hear from you what improvements
do you most want to see in a future
smartphone camera better optics higher
resolution sensors larger sensors faster
frame rates better image processing
definitely drop a comment below this is
the kind of stuff I love getting into
and hopefully we'll find some really fun
debates down in the comments as always

snob when you keep your phone's on
tables face down because you're more
worried about scratching the lens cover
