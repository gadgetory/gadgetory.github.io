know it not quite enough time for a
review but enough to learn it's high and
low points before sending back our demo
unit so here it is this is michael
fisher with pocket now and here's what
we love and what we don't about Yola the
new sailfish powered smartphone this
devices story is much more about
software than hardware so let's talk a
little about the sailfish OS it's origin
story is so complicated it requires a
flowchart to understand but suffice to
say it's smart phone software the
average non-geek would call brand new
and what we love about it is it's
totally new interface selfish is
vertically oriented so you start with a
lock screen which you get to buy a
reliable and consistent DoubleTap and
beneath that and an intermediate screen
is space for your active apps these are
a lot like blackberry 10 cards except
they remain active in minimized form and
even provide quick actions in some
situations letting you jump right into a
particular app function this vertical
layout is logical and it provides the
opportunity to implement menus in a
whole new way often accessing more
options is just a matter of pulling down
on a screen exposing an elastic list of
shortcuts above and sometimes forward
and back motions can be made simply by
swiping left or right notifications are
also just a swipe away and the trigger
gesture for that is down at the bottom
of the screen which makes so much more
sense than Android or iOS as top mounted
notification drawers sailfish also
brings some excellent account
integration that recalls the webOS
synergy features from years ago toss in
your Google account credentials and in
no time you're chatting and hangouts no
app required same for Twitter
notifications
finally you can clad the whole thing in
the color of your choice with the
platform's ambiance feature since
mimicked by iOS 7 so selfish is
customizable in addition to being smart
in the way that a phone OS should be
when it can it makes your life easier
without even asking the hallmark of any
solidly designed platform
but controlling that platform on a day
to day basis gets a little dicey mainly
thanks to the gesture based OS we love
gestures when they work and here they do
often the swipe down to lock motion
especially is nice but swiping in from
the bezel to go back home it just
doesn't feel right not with years of
conditioning to expect the home button
or home gesture at the bottom and the
inconsistency of the back and forward
gestures is pretty annoying sometimes
they're there and sometimes they're not
so the result is a confusing experience
overall at least for veterans Yola told
us about a grandmother who adapted
pretty quickly though so your mileage
may vary if you're a first-time
smartphone user more generally speaking
a lot of sailfish just seems undercooked
the Amazon and Yandex app stores help
close the app gap with Android titles
but both the Android apps and the stores
themselves crash a lot if you use
two-step Google integration you
constantly get kicked out of your
accounts requiring re-registration the
browser has trouble with some websites
the keyboard feels smaller than it
really is and it's autocorrect is
rudimentary so on we can forgive a lot
of this because the platform is still
technically in beta and it's also meant
for tinkerers and people for whom just
being different is enough but selfish
has a lot of room for improvement
thankfully Yola is getting an early
start on community feedback and it says
that feedback will have a heavy impact
on sailfish going forward you'll be
running that software on the same
hardware for a while and on the good
side we hear no complaints from folks we
talked to on Yola while noise
cancellation could use some improvement
voice calls are clear for the most part
yola's unique design is fun to trot out
in public and demoing the functionality
of the other half is a particular high
point it's a simple trick for a phone to
recognize the color of a snap-on
component and adjust its software to
match but it's still a big crowd-pleaser
and that's only going to get better as
more other half modules become available
we also like the removable battery and
microSD expansion both
endangered-species these days well we
don't really hate any part of the
hardware there's plenty here that's
probably best described as men the
display for example kicks out beautiful
color but it's low resolution is
definitely noticeable the chassis z'
feel in hand isn't cheap but it's also
not stellar sailfish suffers from some
optimization challenges so it's tough to
last a full day on its battery and the
camera while passable in most lighting
scenarios isn't really anything special
good shots are certainly possible but
focus is a little finicky and the end
results are fuzzy and washed out a
little more often than we'd like ending
the hardware section on an up note
yola's internals do alright with gaming
once you find one that'll run reliably
drag-racing keeps hanging on us for some
reason but jetpack joyride is smooth and
fluid and sound from the on-board
speakers is pretty good too once you
learn to get your fingers away from the
loudspeaker ports as we wrap up we'll
remind you that this is not a full
review Yola isn't built for the market
we're testing it in and it's being
updated all the time again it's very
much a beta product something the
company makes clear on its specs page so
if your goal is to get something new and
fresh at all costs and the idea of being
part of a small but passionate community
with the ability to affect the
platform's future appeals to you your
399 euro will be well spent if you're a
more traditional consumer though Yola
probably isn't for you as for us well
we're a bit more excited for yola's
future than its present form but given
the talent behind the project we think
that future has a good chance of being a
bright one
