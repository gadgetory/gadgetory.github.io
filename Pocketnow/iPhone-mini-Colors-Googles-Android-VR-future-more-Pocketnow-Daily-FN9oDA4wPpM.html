they might be louder than expected one
plus two just scored some major
discounts and it seems to be permanent
Google's plans for VR are bolder than we
thought I'm hi meri behna and you know
this new studio the same quirks as
always probable audio issues are
lighting but we'll get them fixed at
some point this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with tmobile
as the company has already begun its
valentines day deals if you're in the
market for a tablet for example there
are a couple of forgettable ones on the
list but there is also every variant of
the ipad for fifty dollars off and if
you're interested in smartphones for
example there is buy one get the other
fifty percent off so yeah you'll
obviously have to buy one but then again
these are valentine's day deals they're
supposed to make it a couple thing just
find a good friend and buy a phone now
and speaking of Veals those of you
interested in a 1 plus smartphone while
1 plus 2 just went from 389 to a
permanent 349 which makes a lot of sense
now that we're getting closer to mwc and
right now the whole news and the buzzer
about the galaxy s7 the LG g5 n
obviously the one m10 it makes a lot of
sense of the world for companies to try
to regain the limelight somehow and 349
for a one plus two is just crazy for me
it's the perfect price tag so yeah we
would highly recommend you look at that
now a company that isn't pretty much
making any noise about how many smart
watches are sold but is making headlines
as Apple as of analysts are kind of
fumbling with numbers right now for 2015
the links to the description you'll see
the full detail and how much there is
still a debate on the numbers here but
it seems that Apple still owns two
thirds of the SmartWatch market and then
everything else is being thrown away
between Fitbit and shall me meaning no
Motorola being mentioned no Huawei being
mentioned pretty much no Android we're
being mentioned up to the point where we
hope that something new comes the table
just to fix this and speaking of Apple
we just learn about the possible color
options for the iPhone 5s ER iphone mini
iphone 6 ec whatever you want to call
this thing and well even though we are
still expecting
this to be a smaller iPhone 6 or iPhone
6s it seems that the color options were
also be very close to it we were
expecting different colors like blue or
stuff like that but so far it seems that
there is a space gray a gold variant and
some sort of hot pink not rose gold but
hot pink which is rather weird but then
again you know how Apple handles its
budget market we just need to see a
budget price tag this time stay tuned
for that one and finally the very hot
news did they have to do with Google as
it seems that the company is planning
something major for VR to be announced
at Google i/o since that the companies
no longer wanting to work on cardboard
bidding no longer accessories that are
smartphone dependent it seems of the
idea is to create a new platform a new
version of Android sort of like what we
see with Android auto or where they
enjoyed where which is major apparently
there is an SDK to come a lot of really
cool things to come with that but we are
you know scratching our heads and asking
ourselves and the question of the day
what do you think about this you know do
you think that it's a good idea to
create a new version of Android would
you buy it for example because in my
case it depends on the price tag i mean
i have no problem by an accessory but to
buy a full-fledged a smartphone light
type gadget that you strapped to your
head and it's permanent to your head i'm
not really exactly sure that that would
work but leave us a comment down below
