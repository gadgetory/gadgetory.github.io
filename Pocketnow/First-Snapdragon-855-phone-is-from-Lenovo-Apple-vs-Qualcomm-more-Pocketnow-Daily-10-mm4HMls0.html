snapdragon 855 comes from lenovo and it
includes a crazy amount of ram iOS 12
point 1 point 2 is now available but
apparently it doesn't fix apples
problems with Qualcomm and Samsung's
Galaxy em line as close to being
official and they release the crazy
battery along with it
I'm Jaime Rivera and thank you thank you
finally no galaxy s 10 punch hole in the
screen protector leaks this is rocking
out daily sponsored by swap ah the
official dish today begin with a 5g and
not necessarily crazy news so AT&amp;amp;T has
just announced its deployment in 12
cities starting on December 21st you can
become part of the trial but guess get
this like for example the device the
nighthawk 5g device to provide the
service for your home as $600 which
you're getting for free it seems
temporarily and then each pack of like
15 gigabytes is 70 bucks like you don't
have to pay for that either but the
rumors are that that's just for three
months but like come on man like what
that that's crazy expensive now let's
talk about HTC believe it or not I
thought the company was dead it's not
but it I don't know if I should say it
might as well be or what it just
launched one phone that doesn't surprise
anybody it's the desire 12s which is
actually less respect them twelve if
then the twelve wasn't even that great
the specs are not necessarily fantastic
uh I get it it's a low-end phone I guess
we could call it but it just I wonder
exactly what HTC is doing here
particularly now that a sues is dropping
the zenfone line and HTC should work
harder for Taiwan now let's talk about
the Samsung Galaxy AM lineup as a I know
right another line of Galaxy devices but
the point here is that even though there
is nothing to be surprised about the
specs or anything they're just being
certified for Wi-Fi and guess what one
of these models has a five thousand
milliamp hour battery and given the fact
that we know that Samsung has been
trying out newer technologies on premium
mid Ranger's prepare for that battery
on your next lecture now let's talk
about iOS twelve point one point two as
you heard that version that Apple was
going to push in order to fix the issues
with Qualcomm well the company launched
it today it's available to you
but Paul Keim claims that it doesn't fix
the problems one and two Apple is not
really telling consumers what it's
switching off from that Qualcomm patent
so downloaders beware and finally the
hot new stay have to do with the lenovo
and i hear the crickets but no it's it's
a I know we've never covered Lenovo as
hot news but listen to this one they've
just launched the what they call the
first-ever Qualcomm Snapdragon 85
smartphone which will launch officially
in January we're talking about dual
cameras at the back a sleek carbon fiber
like design slider mechanism for the
selfie counter pretty much no bezels all
this is fine but the coolest part is the
ram 12 gigabytes so yeah this is coming
from lenovo let us know in the comments
I mean what do you think cuz my top of
mind of lenovo has never been great
after how they've treated motorola but
paved they launched this phone out
elsewhere usually not just China I would
totally be interested leave us a comment
