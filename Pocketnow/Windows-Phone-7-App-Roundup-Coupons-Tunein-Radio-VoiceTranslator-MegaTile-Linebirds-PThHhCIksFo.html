packing.com and this is another episode
of Windows Phone 7 f roundup in which we
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it coupons is a
free application of on the windows
marketplace allows you to find coupons
based upon the stores that you like and
what kind of interest you have online so
here if we go to stores that can view
what kind of the stores are having sales
and it looks as though ten percent off a
sixty-dollar order at petsmart calm so
that's pretty good so you can click on
there when you view the information and
it shows us the coupon code directly
from this application we can also be
many other coupons available for
retailers online and also in a physical
location tuning radio is a free
application of Illinois does marketplace
the lodge to listen to local music as
well as you can search for your own name
genre and location so let me search for
local radio so here it can listen to all
the radio stations that are broadcasting
in my area and there's even some firing
em as all those other great stations if
you want to listen to the police reports
what not and if I why I can search for
something and hear all the radio
stations that have to do with rock so
let me just play one of these and now we
can listen to the station directly
through the tunein radio application
voice translator is a free application
available in this marketplace allows you
to translate from one language to
another and I have many different
languages I can choose from so here i
have english and i'm just going to
translate to spanish so here it will say
hello how are you and now i can listen
to this so there will speak the
translated output and i can also tap and
hold and ask a question so where is a
popular restaurant and now we'll convert
the speech and also output it directly
onto the windows phone 7 application
pick a tile is a pain for application
villain with as a marketplace so what
this application does why did it turn
one of your photos into a live tile on
your home screen so here if I want to
choose a two by two or you can just
choose my image down here I can select a
photo from my albums so just go to crop
and create mega tile and now I can
select one of these tiles and have it
choose a various actions we can set the
action and let's see what I can pull
an email so there I can select that tile
to be an email so we'll just click on
here and then I can send an email lion
birds is a free progression game kind of
like that old game helicopter so we'll
begin playing and I can select my
difficulty and I can play and so what I
want to do is to tap the screen and I
want to tap and hold to fly up and
release the screen to fall back down and
to avoid these lines so it looks as
though I'm doing okay and I'm getting
kind of close to some of the lines and
if we're able to catch some of these
flying seeds then were able to get more
points and as you can see the game is
pretty difficult and further that you're
able to go along the higher your score
is so this has been another episode of
