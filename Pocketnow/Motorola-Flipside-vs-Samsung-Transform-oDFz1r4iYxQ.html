pocket now calm we're back for another
video featuring the motorola flipside so
far we've unboxed the device we've shown
you the hardware of the device we've
even gone a step further to show you the
software the device which is the
motoblur you i scan over android 2.1
well now we're going to actually test
the motorola flipside against another
mid-range android device from a
competitor the samsung transform so
let's get the race underway alright and
we're back in one of the first things
you want to get out of the way before we
get started are the availability of
these two devices the device on the
right is the motorola flipside and that
is available on AT&amp;amp;T the device on the
left is the samsung transform and that
is a sprint device both these are
android 2.1 devices in both our
mid-range android 2.1 devices now
another aspect is that the motorola
flipside has a 720 megahertz processor
it's an omap processor with 512
megabytes of ram now the samsung
transform as an 800 megahertz processor
with 256 megabytes of ram so there's a
little bit of a difference there we'll
have to see which one outperforms the
other now you're probably seeing
different screen variances as well they
are both on automatic so that's just
showing the difference in the sensors
there all right and with that we're
going to start a test that we run quite
often and that is the gameplay test and
we're going to actually use raging
thunder which is an app available from
the market on both these devices to see
how well it's going to run okay so now
we've started both the applications up
now as usual we're going to do our best
to actually show you the gameplay
performance while trying to steer with
the accelerometer on both devices we're
going to start here single player for
both and it's give me the same exact
track we're going through the quick race
now I'm going to take note of here the
samsung transform screen definitely
looks different from the flip side it's
also much larger so at the same time
we're going to our best to actually
start these up and now we're going to
play don't see how the performance is
now right off the bat you can see the
beam flip side which is on the top of
this test it's running much better than
the samsung transform the transforms on
the bottom and the framerate is pretty
much horrendous you can see it almost
looks like the transform is not even
really doing much here it's skipping
frames it's tough to keep up the whole
night guys I'm actually going to put
these two down and I'll zoom in a little
further so you can see I let them sit
still give me the judge for yourself he
transform is definitely having an issue
with the frame rate whereas the flip
side seems to be playing very smoothly
now that's most likely because of the
RAM on the flip side which is lacking on
the samsung transform now for our next
test we're going to a browser comparison
or a browser speed test we're going to
actually take both these devices and
navigate to pocket now calm and we're
going to see which one is able to do so
faster they are side by sides that will
give us a direct comparison let's go
ahead and press pocket now here at the
same time now it seemed to register the
actual click faster on the flip side so
this is the pocket now mobile site what
we can do is we can actually scroll down
to the bottom here to get the link for
the desktop version and we'll go ahead
and press at the same time now and again
it's noticing the click faster on the
flip side it's actually registering that
we've actually touched the screen in a
faster manner however it doesn't what
the transform is pulling ahead at least
right now the transform still looks to
be ahead it's already scaled and these
browsers do appear to be loading
differently yep and the transform seems
to be definitely pulling ahead it seems
that it's definitely going to win this
race here however on the progress bar
they're very close to one another now
this is probably going to be all in the
eye of the beholder if you want the
website to already have been scaled to
fit your screen as the transform is
doing that's more ready to go if you
will whereas the flip side is loading
the raw page it's not scaling it's not
on Zuma ng so you can just do all the
unzipping and the moving around your own
that may be a faster method but we'll
have to see which is able to actually
load faster here alright in the battles
over the transform has won it's already
zoomed out we can already move around as
you can see here the scrolling isn't
exactly the smoothest we are able to at
least navigate we're going to go ahead
and wait for the flipside to finish its
work and we'll test the actual
navigation in terms of the smoothness
okay now the flip side is also finished
loading it took about an extra 30
seconds on top of the transform which
isn't exactly the most impressing of
times but now we're going to do is we're
going to try to navigate so first we're
going to zoom out here with the flip
side and see which one is able to
navigate faster now if you look at some
of these side ads and these top ads it
appears that the flip side is actually
playing them in motion whereas the
transform is not now that made one of
the reasons why the flip side is loading
things slower now let's go ahead and try
have occasion here all right let's do
them actually one by one so the
transform as we said does seem to be
somewhat choppy it definitely does work
though it's very usable now the flip
side more or less the same story it does
seem to zoom in much faster this
actually seems a little smoother let me
transform overall and there's a little
jumpy toward the end of the zoom but
overall it's definitely seems smoother
than the transform especially in zooming
now for our third and final test we're
going to run the typical YouTube
comparison as well in the nest test
we're actually going to load the pocket
now video YouTube channel if we're going
to play the same video and see which
device is actually able to stream and
process the video faster so let's go
ahead and print up the channel first
pocket now video see which one's faster
doing this again the flip side seems to
recognize the click faster however these
samsung transform did load the site it's
so faster and let's go ahead and click
on the very top one the iphone 4 hands
on it's an older video and oldie but a
goodie and as you just saw it appears
that once again the flip side recognized
the touch from our finger much much
sooner but the transform is actually
able to play the video faster in terms
of the frame rate they both appear to be
doing very well they both look very
clear
so it seems that the processor of the
Samsung transformed 800 megahertz
processor did make the transform the
victor there what the flip side was not
far behind so there you have it the
slower processor of the flip side does
make it somewhat slower in rendering
webpages and rendering video but when it
comes to the gameplay as you saw the
flip side is definitely the clear winner
and that's likely because of the 512
megabytes of RAM that it has over the
Samsung transforms 256 megabytes of RAM
and that's going to do it for our
comparison and test video our next and
final video will be our final word and
final review on the motorola flipside
which features motoblur so be sure to
stay tuned for that video as well as the
written article on pocketnow.com as
always thank you very much for watching
everyone please leave this video a
thumbs up and we'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
