packing.com and i'm going to show you
beards and beaks a new Xbox game for
windows found now this is a actually the
first totally unique game from Microsoft
Studios for windows phone and it also
features in-game content that you can
buy so first let's show you a little bit
and play here's the map and all these
little things are levels and you see
some of them have one gnome head is read
some of them at three so it depends on
how well you score it there so let's
play this loan
and it's kind of like a tower defense
game you got to use your your gnomes to
fight the crows and down here you can
get mushroom power-ups now these are
little special features that help you
kill the crows and down here you can see
my first basket is free and then I can
get another one basket for 40 microsoft
points or five or 24 120 microsoft
points for 320 microsoft points so those
will help you on the really difficult
levels let's get back to the map
so it includes up to this area for free
well after you buy the game for 299 and
then you get this forest level is
another free add-on that we can download
and then you get a some more there's
more levels that we can unlock so
there's a mountain map now I happen to
have some codes so I'm just going to use
this one
so I just enter that a special code and
I'm just going to say yes
and now we're downloading a new level
so there we go we got a whole new set of
levels here there's one more
okay so I just entered a code to redeem
another set of levels I'm say okay there
and we say if you want to redeem this
item cave map yes and now it's
downloading the cave map so this is kind
of a cool way to extend games you know
kind of a good incentive for developers
because you know once they get the first
299 or whatever price they have after
that they can either just do updates for
free or not update the program at all or
release other programs so I having the
ability to extend a game that a lot of
people might like with new levels for a
small price is a pretty cool feature now
some of you might have looked at the
code already and trying to see if it
would work probably won't because I just
used it however I do have a bunch of
other cards like this with more codes so
I'm going to start giving them away
randomly so look for some posts either
on the YouTube comments the pocket out
tweets Twitter account or the comments
area on the pocket net web site for this
video i'll post them there maybe the
facebook page too maybe the talking
about facebook fan page so check those
out I got a bunch of kousaka way you do
have to buy this game first though
currently there is no way to give away
free games in the windows phone
marketplace but that feature is coming
later so maybe someday we'll have
special codes free games that's it for
now hope you enjoyed this video go sip
thumbs up fit it and keep looking for
those codes I'm going to give them away
