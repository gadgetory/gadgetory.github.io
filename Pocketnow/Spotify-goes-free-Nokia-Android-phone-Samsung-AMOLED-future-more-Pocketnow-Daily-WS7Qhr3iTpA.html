though there is a catch Nokia's new
rumors into a possible android
smartphone and rumors have it that
samsung may move away from AMOLED
displays I'm high memory that I and the
good thing about this rain is that I get
to pull these long sleeves off again
from the closet this is pocket now daily
letters out with some official news as
yes it has been a while since you boon
to announce their mobile operating
system since we had our hands on at CES
2013 and still at this point we do not
have it running officially on any
smartphone without a port obviously
that's just the case they're waiting for
an OEM to sign up and finally a boon to
has landed a partner the problem is
they're not disclosing which partner it
is but hopefully we will be seeing a
smartphone running this operating system
by CES 2014 so expect our coverage now
let's talk about Microsoft as things are
getting desperate over at Redmond as the
company is apparently working on making
windows RT and Windows Phone 8320 liam's
in order to obviously drop the price and
make Windows Phone smartphones and
Windows RT tablets more competitive
obviously it is difficult to compete
against Android wear everything there is
free and pretty much ad supported
through search engines but as it turns
out Microsoft apparently will plan to do
the same thing and we are hoping they do
because we do want Windows Phone to grow
stay tuned to see if that really happens
and now let's talk about Microsoft and
more specifically Nokia as the company
continues teasing a 5.3 inch display
smartphone to be released very soon
we're expecting this device to be
launched either at CES for mwc 2014 and
you can expect that we will be covering
everything live but even more
interesting as this new codename nokia
normandy and the reason why this phone
is hot because apparently it will be
running android so i don't really think
it will happen but hey you never know
this could be a proof of concept now
let's talk about Samsung has some
interesting twists in the rumors are
talking about a galaxy s5 with some
changes we have been hearing the rumors
of a variant that's more affordable in
the other but apparently Samsung is also
working on keeping things with LCD
displays valley the company wants to
move away from AMOLED displays because
they want to drop the cost of the galaxy
s5 other to improve their margins or to
make the phone more affordable the
rumours apparently point to making the
phone
more affordable obviously 2013 has been
kind of disruptive when it comes to
market price for smartphone so stay
tuned for the rumours let's see how that
goes and finally for the hot news of the
day Spotify has just gone free for
mobile devices meaning in the past you
can stream music for free on your
computer but now you can do it for free
on tablets then the case of smart phones
you can but with a catch you have to
shuffle your playlist and obviously you
will be getting ads on your smartphone
now this is a lot better than pandora
because you don't really have to be
skipping all the time or you don't have
a limit to the amount of songs that you
can skip you can actually select the
artists that you want you can shuffle
and skip whatever songs you want with no
limits so it's actually better but that
bitch is the question of the day what is
your preferred music service for
streaming or listening because in my
particular case i am a spotify premium
customer i do love to download my songs
and that's mainly because they have a
lot of 90s music that i love but leave
us a comment down below which is your
preferred and friends you know the drill
