top-of-the-line model isn't exactly what
you'd call fair then again it's not
supposed to be I'm Joe Levi with pocket
now and this is the htc desire 816
versus the HTC One m8 both the desire
816 and HTC One m8 run Android KitKat
4.4.2 with Sense UI 6 although certain
features found on the one I made are
missing in the desire a 16 tapped Wake
is missing on the 816 as are the quick
gestures to launch the camera you focus
and Zoe are also missing from the 816
rounding up software we doubt there will
be a Google Play edition of the desire
but thanks to all the refinements in
since UI 6 there probably doesn't need
to be speaking of the camera on the
surface the desire 816 s 13 megapixel
shooter looks like a huge improvement
over the one m8 4 megapixel sensor in
practice images shot and perfect
lighting have more detail and better
resolution than on the One m8
however since many pics are shot in less
than ideal situations the One m8 s
camera despite having fewer megapixels
edges out over the desire 816 the shape
of both devices is almost identical it's
the construction that's different the
desire 816 is made of plastic with matte
sides for superior grip but a glossy
fingerprint magnet back that's slippery
the One m8 features an aluminum back and
is much less squeaky than the desire in
everyday use despite their similar
design once you look a little deeper
obvious differences surfaced between the
desire and the one to start with the
desire is a little heavier than its big
brother
weighing in at 5.82 ounces for the 816
compared to 5.64 ounces for the one and
8
the batteries they sport are the same
capacities 2600 milliamp hours but the
screen on the desire is a bit bigger 5.5
inches versus the five inch or on the
one m8
that's not where the screen difference
is in the desire uses a super LCD to
panel with a 720p resolution and only
267 pixels per inch the One m8 smaller
screen uses LCD 3 technology to deliver
a 1080p resolution with 441 PPI don't
let that fool you though the display on
the desire is big bold bright and looks
fantastic HD video feels right at home
on a more than adequately sized screen
linking the screen on both devices are a
pair of front firing stereo speakers
although the grilles look different
thanks to boom sound both phones sound
great
but neatly behind the glass of the
desire 816 is a 1.6 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 400 and an Adreno 305 GPU the
One m8 on the other hand is powered by a
2.3 gigahertz or 2.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 801 with an Adreno 330 GPU
depending on configuration the designer
also includes a little bit less Ram
1.5 gig compared to the ones 2 gig we're
glad HTC split the difference and didn't
go with a single gig on the desire 816
it comes to data both phones have LTE
though we haven't been able to test how
well it works on the desire since it's
only compatible with t-mobile's edge
bands when it comes to Wi-Fi however the
desire doesn't include the 5 gigahertz
band at all which means it doesn't have
any 802 11a or AC like the One m8 does
for why that's important make sure you
check out our editorial on the topic the
link is down in the description below
another wireless technology that's
missing from the desire is NFC though we
can live without the Google Wallet and
Isis features not being able to tap to
beam content from one device to another
is a major disappointment it comes to
everyday performance of course the One
m8 is going to win hands down over the
desire 816 the processor and the RAM
just aren't going to let the desire
perform anywhere near what the One m8
does in practical use however we didn't
notice any lag we didn't notice any
slowdowns we really didn't miss any of
that speed but we did notice however
combined with the Snapdragon 400 and the
audrina 305 powering that 720p display
compared to what's on the One m8 battery
life on the desire 816 was phenomenal it
got us through not just a day but days
of work our phone that's supposed to be
the mid-tier line from HTC the desire
816 seems an awful lot more close to the
top tier than
does to the bottom if you don't mind a
little bit more heft and a little bit
more size combined with a little bit of
cuts to the performance and the specs
inside the desire 816 is a fabulous
device when compared to the HTC One m8
that's how HTC's desire 816 stacks up
against their very own One m8 we've got
a lot more coverage coming on the desire
816 and why it might be something you
should consider coming up here pocket
now make sure you've subscribed so you
don't miss out on any of that while
you're at it make sure you like
subscribe and share the video with your
friends if you liked what you saw here
for pocket now showing off phones
comparing them to others I'm Jill Levi
