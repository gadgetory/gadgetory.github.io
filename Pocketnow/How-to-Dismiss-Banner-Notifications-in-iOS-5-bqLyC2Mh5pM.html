pocket now calm iOS 5 notifications the
banner variety can be really annoying
because they cover up UI elements and
they don't go off the screen well
there's actually a way to get thee
notifications off the screen there's a
way to swipe them off and in this video
we're going to show you how to do it so
we tried to swipe the notification off
the screen like in Windows Phone 7 and
it just doesn't dismiss the banner
notifications in the iOS 5 there's
actually a way to do it it's not very
obvious not very intuitive which is
surprising to come from an Apple product
so real quick we're going to send an
email here we're going to go back into
the messaging app and show you how to
dismiss a notification the banner kind
in iOS 5 so we're gonna make a new email
here and hit Send go back to the home
screen into the messaging app and it's a
very subtle thing that you have to do
you pull down on it slightly and then it
goes away again let's see that again
we're gonna send a test message here so
we're going to forward that again we're
going to go back home screen watch what
happens you pull it down slightly and
release and it goes away a very simple
thing but it really solves a lot of
problems because those banner
notifications just don't go away in iOS
5 unless you turn them off completely
then you can't benefit from them so
again swipe it down slightly and then
the notification will pop off the screen
so you can get back to work that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
