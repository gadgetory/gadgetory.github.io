gingerbread is the big news the question
really is who's going to make it to
market first independent developers or
hardware manufacturers well when you've
got a device all to yourself and can
cook your own rom like Samsung did with
the Nexus S the Nexus S wins but for
everybody else it looks like it's going
to be the community developers and
thanks to one of our pocket mail readers
we can show you an early look of
cyanogenmod seven for the g2 running
Gingerbread let's go take a look all
right so here we go guys it's Android
version 2.3 point 1 which is cyanogenmod
7.0 point 0 RC 0 now what's RC RC is a
release candidate and 0 means it's not
even really officially been released I'm
once you get to RC one that's the first
hey I think this is ready for prime time
so I'm going to go ahead and release
this candidate that's that's kind of the
development process this isn't quite
there and why isn't it there well let's
go ahead and take a look back here this
is the phone settings you'll notice that
there are no cyanogenmod settings which
would be right up here they're not
they're not cooked yet they're not done
now ready for this bill they're not
included in it and those usually come
after all of the other stuff is complete
now what do I mean by other stuff well
take a look up here first of all you see
my new gingerbread style notification
bar I've got Bluetooth turned on I've
got Wi-Fi on Wi-Fi has good signal my
battery is all nice and charged up and
I've got my clock up there and it's that
nice dark black bar that we're coming to
become familiar with with Gingerbread
but other stuff doesn't work other
Hardware Wi-Fi doesn't work exactly
right now over here I've got the latest
version of google maps gps seems to be
working it's a little bit laggy and kind
of interesting at times but one of the
things that the location services on the
android does is it uses cell towers it
uses Wi-Fi access points and gps all
together to help pinpoint your location
and to help narrow that down quicker so
you don't really notice that you know it
took 60 seconds 90 seconds to get a GPS
fix because well it got a cell tower fix
almost immediately it got a wife I fix
within the next 5 10 seconds and then
you know you're well on your way to
knowing exactly where you are when the
GPS catches up because the satellites
take a while to come to view and whatnot
this isn't a video about GPS and how it
works though but the GPS wonkiness is
when I'm not under an active
umbrella-like am right now it'll just
turn off that sounds kind of like it
might be a feature because you don't
really need Wi-Fi when you're not under
Wi-Fi umbrella just choose a battery but
when you do that you also lose out on
your ability to get a quick location
with your GPS sensitive apps like Google
Maps so let's go ahead and move along
one other thing that's not working and I
don't know if this is going to throw an
error like it has been or not is the
camera app now this goes for both the
still camera and the video camera of
course the the g2 doesn't have a front
facing camera just the rear one but
normally it would throw an error message
here saying it can't even connect to the
camera and then you're just left with a
button to say okay in this case we'll
just have to hit home and go back home
again so camera isn't quite done you
also notice how long it took to do a
nori entation change that is also
because things aren't quite optimized
for the hardware yet that's still coming
along and it's to be expected something
else now this is more gingerbread than
it is cyanogenmod but i thought i'd show
you i've gone ahead and added a contact
to my desktop it's this guy named
brandon minimun he runs a website is
kind of really cool i like it a lot it's
called Paquime com if you haven't been
there I'd recommend doing that in fact
I'd also recommend you I subscribe to
their video channel if you haven't done
so already but anyway looking down at
this you've got this little ellipses
dots down at the bottom of his contact
icon now before that used to be a
colored bar I used to be a green bar
that went or a gray bar and some some
roms that went all the way across at the
bottom just kind of look like a drawer
handle that you could grab onto and pull
well now it lifts these points it's just
a little bit of a change in the metaphor
so when you tap on that it brings up
what I call a quick action bubble
because I don't know the real name of it
if you know the name of this please let
us know
the comments down below but you'll
notice i believe it's new to gingerbread
it's got this nice dark drop shadow
around it now that's because ginger
bread has some higher resolution so you
don't see banding and whatnot in here
you're saying deeper color depths and
what not really taking advantage of the
GPUs that are coming in most of today's
modern Android phones but you can see in
here various different ways that I can
contact Brandon either by phone or look
up his contact text gmail Twitter or
even review his website it also
aggregates in his latest comment on a
social network in this case 14 hours ago
by Twitter that's probably you guys I
haven't synced up with Twitter he's
probably said quite a bit because he
talks an awful lot about tech so again
plug in there for four following
pocketnow tweets on Twitter and pocket
mal video on on youtube so lots of cool
stuff if you're curious about this live
wallpaper this is the snow globe the
coca-cola live wallpaper that we showed
you over at pocketnow.com a few days ago
one thing that I would like to note this
is not the launcher that comes with
Gingerbread this is ADW launcher which
is a phenomenal launcher you can get
that in the marketplace we've talked
about it in the past it's faster and
more feature-filled than the stock
launcher and it generally comes with
cyanogenmod so once it's going to be
ready for your device well to put it
simply it'll be ready when it's ready
and not before cyanogen does not release
builds that don't have all of the
hardware functioning so make sure you
stay tuned we'll let you know when
cyanogenmod comes out for your device
over at pocketnow.com for pocket now i'm
