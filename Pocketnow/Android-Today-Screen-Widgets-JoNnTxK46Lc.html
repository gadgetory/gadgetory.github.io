pocketnow.com back when I was a windows
mobile guy part I like most about that
OS was the today screen specifically the
agenda view where I could see all of my
upcoming appointments and to-do items
right there on the home screen whenever
I turned on the phone I could tell at a
glance exactly where I was supposed to
be what I needed to prepare for next was
great when I moved over to Android I
really didn't have that because the
stock widgets from google just kind of
breezed past that and even today they
don't do a really great job so what I've
done is I've got out and I found a
couple suggestions for widgets for you
that I think you might like i'll show
you what i use and i'll show you some
other options so let's go do that now
okay so the first thing that we have
this is a nexus one with the stock
android 2.1 operating system on it it
doesn't have HTC Sense UI and it doesn't
have a motoblur so you're just going to
see the raw stuff that comes from google
the first thing to show you is the
calendar icon calendar icon simply
launches the calendar app that's it in
previous versions there was a number 25
on the calendar icon which was kind of
confusing if it wasn't the 25th day of
the month which today is not it looks
kind of nice doesn't have much
functionality other than just launching
the app so to help give you a little bit
more information at a glance Google
decided they would also release a widget
and they call that widget simply
calendar so we'll put that on the home
screen first thing to note about this it
does show the day of the week it also
shows the day of the month it shows your
next upcoming appointment what time it
is what day it is what the title is and
where it's located but it's not all that
configurable you can't do to do tasks
you can't change the color of this bar
you can't make it transparent or
translucent it just is stock it does
what it's supposed to do and that's all
it does
is just fine but let's look at something
a little bit nicer than that what I'd
like to show you first is a free widget
right down here called smooth calendar
go to the market search for smooth
calendar download it install it there
you go the first thing you'll note is
this is a 1 by 4 widget it's one tile
high by four tiles why'd you also have
this nice little flip calendar that
shows the month and the calendar date
doesn't show the day of the week like
the last one did but you'll notice on
here I've got my next three upcoming
appointments shown right there really
nice at a glance easy to see if I tap on
it it asks me what I want to do
configure it launched my calendar or
refresh the app so one touch access you
know real nice and easy to get into it
if I move it down here over the grass
you'll see that it's also
semi-transparent shows all the animation
of your live wallpaper really nicely and
hey the price is right it's free it
looks really nice it does what it's
supposed to do not all that configurable
but clean pure and shows a lot more
information at a glance if you want
configurability however you're going to
want to get these guys right down here
which are the pure calendar widget and
you'll notice you get a whole bunch now
these aren't free but they're pretty
darn cheap and they're worth every penny
I'm not going to tell you the price
because prices on the marketplace change
all the time but we're talking just a
couple bucks at most so coming to look
at this and you can pick what size do
you want a 2 by 2 2 by 3 all the way
down for x 14 x 24 x 3 or a full page 4
by 4 they even have a calendar grid
widget which is it's a separate purchase
but it shows your entire calendar in a
four by four widget in a grid on your
screen so it's really nice what I'd like
to show you here since I showed you the
four by one widget before let's see what
they have with their four by one
first thing that you'll notice is this
gets into an awful lot of configuration
but you can tie it to your regular
Google Calendar HTC Sense calendar droid
exchange calendar yada yada yada yada
yada yada I mean there's tons of stuff
and this developer is always adding more
we're going to stick with the stock
regular google calendar and i'm not
going to show you all this because
honestly i don't have time what I'm
going to focus on instead however is
right down here which is the continued
and skin so we're going to tap that from
here it's going to go out grab some data
from the internet this will take a
little bit of time depending on your
connection but basically this is a
skinnable widget and he's continually
updating the skins for this widget new
stuffs come in all the time really
you're going to stick with a couple I'm
going to go ahead and do this one we're
going to tap on that to select it and
then we're going to tap on it again a
little bit confusing here hit
transparency and then we can set the
transparency of this via a slider to
wherever we want from all the way
transparent to opaque I like it
somewhere in the 25 range and I'm having
a real hard time doing this on camera
for you will save and exit and there you
go you've got a nice very transparent
glass looking calendar widget really
cool now the thing that I like about
this you can tie in your Google Tasks
orgy tasks with it and display those as
well but in the same amount of space
you've got not only your upcoming
appointment but you've also got the day
of the week a month the calendar day
you've got a configuration button and
then a quick ad which just really nice
let me come over and show you on my home
screen where I've got a four by two
widget this shows me the current day my
day's appointments appointments on
Monday on Tuesday so in just a little
teeny bit more space I've got six
appointment showing on my screen and its
really really worthwhile
this is not only appointments but to do
tasks as well now I know I'm going to
get asked this so I'm just going to
answer it right away this widget on the
top I feel as indispensable was the very
first widget in fact the very first app
that I spent money on when i got my
android this is called beautiful widgets
by levelup studios and it is just that
it's gorgeous skinnable as well in this
case i've got what's called a naked skin
so it doesn't have any background on it
it's just entirely transparent nice big
clock you can choose from flip clocks to
cyanogen clocks to vacuum tube style
blocks just really cool stuff shows me
again the day of the week the month the
calendar day shows me where I am and
what the weather is like and yes we have
just gone through a whole bunch of
thunderstorms current temperatures 52
degrees high of 62 low of 44 that's at a
glance what my weather is going to be
like tap on that and it brings up an
animated screen showing my four day
forecast along with a bit more
information win relative humidity and
whatnot beautiful app it does exactly
what it's supposed to do and it does it
gorgeously I would highly recommend
anybody that wants to get weather
information on their phone go ahead and
get this it is entirely wonderful so
those are the apps that I find or those
of the widgets rather than I find most
helpful and I would highly recommend
going out and spending the money on
these if you don't want to spend any
money go ahead and try smooth calendar
widget out it's free it shows you quite
a bit of information really nice but
this is the kind of functionality that
was missing from Android that I really
have gotten used to with windows mobile
and with just a couple widgets I've
restored all of that functionality and
added quite a bit of aesthetics it looks
really nice too I think you'd agree I
mean this home screen really looks good
so I'd be interested to see what you've
got on your home screen what widgets you
like what widgets you don't like if you
think the configuration for smooth or
excuse me pure calendar widget is just
way too complicated like I do
because you've got all that stuff that I
didn't even show you so please leave a
comment let me know and let's see who's
got the best home screen out there for
pocketnow.com I'm Joe Levi with today
