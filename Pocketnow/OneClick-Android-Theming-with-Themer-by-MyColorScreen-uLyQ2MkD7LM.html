involved in the creation of an app
called themer by my color screen it's a
true one click theming app that's going
to really change the way you use your
phone if you're using an Android device
hey guys it's brandon in a min from
pocket now and in this video i'm going
to show you themer let's get to it so
femur is based off of the website my
color screen calm a site which really
shows the versatility and the openness
of android with Android you can make
your home screen whatever you want it to
be with custom icons custom widgets
really there are limitless possibilities
the problem with android customization
is that it takes a really long time to
set up widgets configure icons and get
everything just right which is why he
mer comes into the picture here so right
now theme is available in Google Play
it's free and all of the themes are free
it's in beta so right now you need a
code to access the app and the way you
do that is you go to femur app com
putting your email address and then
you'll get a code email to you when it's
ready so this is what most people look
at dozens and dozens of times per day
the home screen it's boring it's ugly in
most cases unless you spend the time to
really craft it and make it look nice
it's not very useful it's just a bunch
of icons in most cases for most people
it's not particularly beautiful either
which is why themer has come along so
themer czar launcher actually so i'm
going to go to always here and here's an
example of a theme that I've applied
with themer it's a 5 screen home screen
we start off with some app shortcuts
here we've got a dialer here which is
actually a real dialer up here you get
contacts and your call history as well
if you want to look at that to the left
we've got a calendar which is based on
simple calendar widget to the right
we've got some news from TechCrunch and
CNN a live news widget here and all the
way to the right there's weather with a
forecast a really bold theme here so
let's take a look at actually how themer
works I'm going to tap and hold on the
home screen and hit browse themes then
I'm going to go into the themer gallery
every theme you see here is a pliable in
one click and it sets up all of the
widgets all of the wallpapers and all of
the icons exactly as you see it here so
scroll down and take a look at some of
these so there are themes for all kinds
of tastes are minimal themes retro
themes themes that have a particular
specialty like there's a Breaking Bad
themed here some colorful themes and you
can tap on any of the themes and get a
preview of what it's going to look like
before you hit apply or you can just
scroll down and kind of look through all
of them right now there are about 50
themes with more being added each day
this one I'm going to show here it's
called gray and peach so I'm gonna hit
apply it's going to prepare the theme
download it if you haven't already which
takes about five seconds and in no time
at all you've got the theme applied to
your home screen so that every time you
hit the home button you are taken back
to that particular home screen this
becomes your new home screen which is a
lot more beautiful and useful than what
you might have had before so in this
case we have an RSS feed on linked to
the phone SMS Play Store to the right
we've got weather with some other
shortcuts like camera and maps and
battery percentage at the top and all
the way to the right here we've got some
favorite applications let's go back into
the Browse theme section and look at
some other themes this one in particular
is called sky this is one of my
favorites i'm gonna hit apply and here
we are with one called sky which is
absolutely gorgeous now there's a
problem inherent to one a one-click
theming app what if you use Spotify but
your friends uses Pandora and maybe
there might be a music icon like there
is here in this particular theme how
will themer know or that app know which
music app you like so there's this thing
called themer actions and femur and it
works for weather and music and maps and
cloud storage and file manager in all
sorts of app category so in the case of
music if I tap on music themer will look
at my device and look at a wide variety
of music apps it knows that I've Spotify
Pandora and Google Music installed on my
device Spotify is my favorite I'm going
to hit Spotify so that the next time I
click on music it goes directly to
Spotify it doesn't ask me now let's say
down the road I get pandora I fall in
love with Pandora and I want my music
action to link to Pandora you can
actually reset your theme or action so
I'm going to go to browse themes again
and over here in settings femur at
preferences I can click reset on new
such that when I go back to the home
screen go back to music it'll ask me
again this time I hit Pandora and every
time I hit music no matter what theme I
use in themer it will always go to
Pandora just like I want it to let's
take a look at another themer and go
back into browse themes so this one's
called Molotov and it's one of the more
customizable themes available in themer
so it's going to apply so Molotov is a
more minimal theme for people that don't
want a lot of clutter the cool thing
about this particular theme is I can
take these shortcuts and drag them
around and flip them off the screen if I
don't want them and really customize it
to look like what I want it to look like
something that really works for me so I
am super proud to be a part of themer
it's a kind of app that I've dreamed of
having on my phone over the years I get
all of these android phones that I tests
and the interfaces the home screens are
just so boring and there's always the
same and then there's this huge world of
Android customization but it just takes
too much time to apply a theme so with
themer finally one click theming is
available to everyone it's something
that wasn't really possible a few years
ago but now it's it's a reality so I
hope you download it and you love it as
much as I do and thanks for watching
this video that's it for now
