greatest in mobile technologies we're
all interested in one answer how fast is
it but with different SOC CPUs GPUs
different numbers of cores running at
different clock speeds answering that
question isn't quite as simple as just
looking at the lines on the spec sheet
that's something that we turn to
benchmarks to try and answer for us I'm
Joe Levi with pocket now and the latest
version of antutu helps you answer that
many claim the synthetic benchmarks
aren't a true representation of how fast
the device is there's some truth to that
benchmarking programs generally run a
series of tests through the system upon
which it's being run various notes about
how those tests are run or logged the
results are tallied and a score is
presented to the end user that first
part isn't usually debated since running
a game watching a movie or loading a web
page or all activities that a typical
user would do and measuring how fast or
how high the resolution goes is a pretty
good metric when the debate comes to a
head is in the calculation and
presentation of scores many of which are
arguably arbitrary where things get
dicey is when multiple variables are
being evaluated such as the CPU GPU
amount of RAM and more the part that's
not often debated is the fact that the
benchmarks themselves become the single
variable against which devices with all
of those components can be measured as
time and technology progress benchmarks
quickly become outdate requiring updates
or entirely new versions or they'll face
obsolescence to combat that
inevitability and two to a leading
manufacturer of benchmarking software is
prepping an update to it benchmarking
sweet what's new in an 225 point oh this
was a windows mobile pocket pc up until
a little while ago we didn't have to
worry about how benchmarking app handled
multithread performance all of our
devices had one cpu core now however
you'll be hard-pressed to find anything
below a dual-core processor and many
have significantly more this muddies the
test results measuring raw processing
performance sometimes means distilling
the test down to the lowest common
denominator CPU single-threaded
performance testing though more cores
undoubtedly bring better performance
many apps have not yet been optimized to
take advantage of this feature many
games only use one or maybe two cores
and power saving modes often turn off
all but one core to extend the amount of
time you get on a single charge in the
past benchmark utilities have created
their own graphics engines to measure
how well the GPU performs these tests
measure the number of polygons
reflections water and particle effects
and so on unfortunately they're not very
representative of the games that we
actually play n22 is addressing this by
including two different gaming engines
used by actual games cocos2d and havoc
vision the latter is being used on many
platforms being on Android like windows
xbox playstation Nintendo Wii Wii U and
even iOS the web is evolving and the
pages you view are getting more complex
and capable shadows lighting animation
and more are all starting to arrive in
your web browser blurring the line
between app and web page in the long run
this is a very positive direction but
for now benchmarking utilities need to
be able to measure how well your device
can handle content on the World Wide Web
an 225 point 0 includes a new section to
see just how prepared your devices for
the web pages that are being developed
today last but certainly not least is
something that we've seen coming for
quite a while but has always been an
optional feature for developers and
powered users art the Android runtime is
set to replace dalvik on Android powered
devices when Android L lands this new
runtime provides added features and
benefits that are beyond the scope of
this video nonetheless benchmarking in
this new runtime environment brings new
challenges the version of an 225 that we
tested isn't quite there yet at least
one of the tests tells us that it's not
compatible with art and it skipped the
changelog however indicates that art
optimizations are being built in and
we'll likely see more progress closer to
win the final code drops so that's what
an-225 looks like at least in its
current incarnation it bears mentioning
that this is an alpha the pre-release
just to make sure that the technology is
sound and to get it out there in front
of people like you and I so we can put
our faith behind it thank you very much
for watching and if you liked what you
saw please give the video a thumbs up if

us on any one of your favorite social
media sites we're there we would love to
chat
4-pocket now showing off ways that you
can find out just exactly how fast your
device is I'm jovi by and catch you next
