apples second place in sales that they
want to go for the crowns set your
calendars again for October third or
fourth as LG seems to be announcing
their v40 it looks like the headphone
jack is going to die on the oneplus 60
I'm Jaime Matt iveta and it's funny I
talked to the hotel manager and I asked
for a brighter room and I think he took
it the opposite way this is parking out
daily powered by qualcomm the official
news today begin with deals as expected
we've got new iPhones announced which
means that devices like Apple watch
series one two and three in addition to
iPhone 7s as well are currently on sale
at apple.com we didn't know that the
series three was gonna get less
expensive but that starts as of today
you can learn more about it in the link
in the description some of these devices
are refurbished though when it comes to
the older product so again just buyers
beware even though you still get the
full warranty that would starve out
oneplus as a the company has just
announced its new bullets wired
headphones for 20 bucks which I always
find these headphones to be incredibly
affordable for the quality of product
that you get guess what the problem is
that these ones have USB C so for those
of you that were concerned about the
next generation 1 plus 16 losing the
headphone jack
I guess we're heading in that direction
and speaking of things that might be
discontinued one thing that is not a mic
is for example devices like the iPhone
10 it is now no longer available at
Apple comm devices like the iPhone se
rest and peace it is no longer available
and at the same time the iPhone 6
success lineup meaning there are no
Apple devices with a headphone jack now
like at all going forward and God I just
I feel so bad for the death of the
iPhone S II I hope that Apple comes up
with something eventually because a lot
of people really like that form factor
and I hope they also pull off their
larger display on the same footprint
we'll see now let's talk about LG as the
company has just sent out press
invitations for its event in October
October 3rd or 4th depending on which
date because it's gonna happen first in
New York and then
where we are going to see the new leaf
for tea we've heard a ton of things like
for example logn they're cameras which
is a first in addition to the wider
camera we've heard rumors of up to five
cameras here I am looking forward to
LG's offerings the V lineup has always
been one of my favorites let's see what
they pull off here as well and finally
the hot news is they have to do with a
Huawei as well we're very close to the
huawei mate 20 and 20 Pro according to
all the rumors but the company is a CEO
of mobile Richard you just came on
record to stake that well it is now
official that the company has surpassed
Apple when it comes to sales for the
first time it is also a plan of the
company to surpass Samsung which is a
very bold one as the difference between
Apple and Samsung is huge when it comes
to sales but yeah apparently that's what
they're working on they're also working
on a foldable device he also teased a
ton of things there's more information
in the description but let us know in
the comments what do you think we've
seen amazing changes from Huawei lately
when it comes to photography
particularly let us know what do you
think do you think that they deserve a
higher spot or not there's no in the
comments down below I definitely liked
what they were doing so far it's no
secret that we've spent most of 2018
praising the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
mobile platform and it's Adreno 630 GPU
every comparison that we've done this
year has seen a device with this power
combo winning we've got the best
performance best gaming best battery
life best data speeds definitely an
essential component you should consider
on your next smartphone follow the link
in the description below to learn why
the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 mobile
platform is so cool friends again if you
