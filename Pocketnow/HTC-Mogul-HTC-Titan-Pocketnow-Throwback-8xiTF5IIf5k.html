Avril Lavigne and Fall Out Boy led the
pop charts the final installment in the
Harry Potter series became the fastest
selling book in history and the film's
ocean's 13 and live free or die hard
proved there was still money to be made
in Hollywood sequel meanwhile in little
old Norfolk Virginia I was preparing to
leave my job at wireless carrier sprint
nextel and I was in the market for the
biggest beefiest smartphone I could buy
to see me through the next two years in
2007 that slab of smartphone hot sauce
was the HTC mogul you might know it as
the Titan the xB 6800 or the P 4000 but
whatever you call it at launch it was
one of the best Windows Mobile
smartphones you could find
so as HTC prepares to launch its 2014
flagship smartphone let's take a look
back at the best of what the company had
to offer seven years ago I'm Michael
Fisher this is the HTC mogul and this is
PocketNow throwback the mogul debuted at
a time when brawny dimensions were par
for the course when it came to
smartphones while it was fairly light
and fit in a pocket better than its
predecessor thanks to its internal
antenna it clocked in at a girthy 18
millimeters thick and its surface was
peppered with buttons from the d-pad and
ctrl collective below the screen to the
messaging and browser shortcuts up top
from the typical power and camera keys
to the strange hardware Wi-Fi switch to
the sign of the times jog dial and back
key the Mogul featured 16 physical
buttons on its casing and that's before
you take into account the sliding QWERTY
keyboard the Mogul was powered by a 400
megahertz Qualcomm processor backed up
by 64 Meg's of RAM all of it powering
Windows Mobile five and later six on a
two point eight inch QVGA screen that
used resistive touch and a stylus for
precision input but buried here and
there on our borrowed throwback unit are
little hints of modernity
despite the moguls age the phone's IR
port is
flanked by a microSD card slot and the
camera around back is only 2 megapixels
shy of the resolution of HTC's 2013
flagship of course much more than
resolution has changed in the past 7
years I wouldn't want to use the Mogul
as a photo companion today but for the
time 2 megapixels was top of the line
even in 2007 though the Moghuls software
was beginning to show its cracks while
Windows Mobile was much more powerful
and versatile than competitors like the
palm OS and Blackberry platforms it was
also tremendously sluggish even on the
Moghuls powerful hardware a handicap
noted by reviewers of the day and one
which went unresolved by the update to
6.1 and even though that keyboard was
big and beautiful
I found that Windows Mobile could never
quite keep up with my keystrokes finally
this was the Summer of Apple's mobile
emergence with the first an iPhone
already showing people what a slick and
responsive user interface could feel
like Microsoft's mobile platform would
soon start losing its luster still the
extensibility and raw power of the
device cemented it as a favorite in the
hearts of many with an enthusiastic
developer community cooking up handfuls
of custom roms combined with Sprint's
relatively speedy EVDO Network and the
still significant novelty of carrying a
computer in your pocket the Mogul
quickly earned a special place in the
memory of mobile mavens everywhere
helping to kick-start the recognition of
a then new smartphone brand that's since
become one of the world's most respected

siblings if so drop your remember it
