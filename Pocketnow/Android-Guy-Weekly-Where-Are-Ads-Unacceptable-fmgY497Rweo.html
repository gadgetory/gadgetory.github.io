advertisements where are they acceptable
and where are they not that's what we're
gonna talk about in this week's episode
of the Android guy weekly so a quick
history of Google Google had some free
stuff search engine for example Gmail
they were free well they were paid for
by ads that you had to look at when you
were using their products but you didn't
have to pay money out of your pocket to
use them well all of a sudden Google
kind of started putting feelers out for
a cell phone os and eventually ended up
buying Android they didn't announce any
plans with it right away we all know
what happened but way back in the day
speculation started to fly is Google
going to make a phone a Google phone in
fact that's what a lot of people thought
that g1 was going to be was the Google
phone fact we thought the phones were
gonna be called g1 g2 g3 all the way up
for Google one Google 2 etc etc we know
that didn't happen either but that's
kind of what we thought in addition
there were some rumors that flew that
said these phones were going to be free
the plans were going to be free or maybe
the plans would cost money and the
phones would be free or the phones would
be free to play whatever essentially
free why because people said while
Google makes their money off of ads so
obviously they're going to make an ad
based phone and an ad based operating
system we know that didn't happen but
that was what speculation and rumor was
back in the day now Google does make
money off of ads most of the stuff is
inside their apps not inside the OS
itself Google Maps for example if you
want to find a restaurant open up Google
Maps or Google Places it's really the
same app search for something you're
going to get an advertisement or two or
three at the top that's relevant to your
search
just like when you're searching on
google.com makes a lot of sense to do it
that way right but that's still inside
the app and it's an app not in the OS
fair enough
t-mobile recently had a well an update
shall we call it to their account app
now this account app is pretty cool it
lets you see how many texts you've sent
and received how many minutes you've
used and how much data you've basically
burned through on your plan and it shows
you how much usually expect to pay at
the end of the month when the billing
cycle is up kind of cool bathed in a lot
of magenta which I don't particularly
like but the application itself is very
very nice this recent update however
people started reporting some ads and
I'm not talking ads because the app is
free I'm not talking apps like or ads
like we're used to in apps that are at
the top or the bottom or both what I'm
talking about is ads that were up here
in the notification tray so you get a
notification that you've had a new ad
you pull down your shade here and there
would be your advertisement not very
cool in fact that sounds awfully
reminiscent to what some other people
were doing in effort to make more money
now app developers have to make money
somehow they're not just making these
apps out of the goodness of their hearts
well maybe a couple of them are but most
of the time they want to be compensated
for their work and we don't blame them
right it's something that they do they
want to get paid let's pay them we can
either buy their apps with money up
front and get an ad-free experience it's
the way it's supposed to work or get
them for free then pay for them over
time by watching their ads and hopefully
clicking on them eventually when we get
a relevant ad that helps us find a good
or a service that we didn't know we
needed that's what advertising is all
about but t-mobile was doing this in
such a way that the ads were showing up
even when you weren't running their app
this is what another company did this
other company basically sold a plugin
for lack of a better term to developers
to put their ad distribution network
inside these developers apps people
would then download and install them and
because these ads were getting presented
in a diff
Manor the thought was you get a better
click-through rate everybody would be
paid more great not a problem except it
was a problem you see there are two
problems with that distribution metaphor
the first problem is that's your
notification tray when you pull down
that shade you expect to see information
that's important not just fluff you
expect it to be a new email a new text
message calendar appointment you know a
chat something like that that needs your
attention right away an ad let's face it
doesn't need your attention they may
want your attention but if you don't
look at an ad for 10 minutes or even 10
days no big deal if you don't look at
your calendar reminder for 10 minutes
you might have a problem if you don't
look at it for 10 days you probably
missed a bunch of meetings fair enough
it's not an appropriate place to put ads
first problem second problem those ads
run even when the app isn't running that
means they have to have something
running in the background all the time
to present the ads something running in
the background all the time to go to the
net get the ads download them to your
phone using your data I might add and
your battery and slowing things down in
the process to be able to present those
ads to you they're now costing you money
to look at those ads that's not cool at
all don't do it there was such a
backlash over this that I can't name a
single app that still uses that
distribution mechanism there are
probably still some out there I just
don't know of any because those are all
lower tier apps in my opinion t-mobile
has now risen to the lower tier app bar
congratulations t-mobile well they
started getting a backlash - and they
have since apologized saying that it was
an error it was a mistake it was kind of
a worded like a technical glitch I don't
see how crafting an ad that is presented
to users could be a mistake a technical
glitch somebody had to say let's do this
somebody had to actually do it and then
it was
implemented but that's not the big
problem the big problem is now there's
an app installed on my phone that's
sitting there even when I'm not using it
potentially gobbling up system resources
and checking the web to see if there is
a new ad that I need to get all the time
even when there's not the mechanism to
display those ads is built into this t
mobile app and even though they
apologize
they haven't at the time of this
recording updated it to remove that
mechanism and they need to t-mobile is
an industry leader because they are a
carrier they need to set an example to
everyone and that example is ads don't
go in the notification bar that app when
you're not running it needs to not sit
there in gobble stuff so t-mobile thank
you for the apology you've got another
step to go so that's my rant on ads and
apps and apps in ads and ads in outside
wow that's confusing but now it's your
turn what do you think where our ads
appropriate where where would you like
to see ads where would you not like to
see ads and where should ads never be of
course I biased you so you can just say
I agree with you or I disagree with you
that's fine but put some thought into it
and let me know from a consumer
perspective from someone who uses apps
who uses the OS where would you like to
see ads and where would you not and how
much is a reasonable amount to pay for
an app to get an ad free version that's
your homework go ahead and post the
comments down below so we know and we
can of course participate in this
discussion because after all that's what
the Android guy weekly is all about it's
about the discussion it's about you and
it's now your turn
to read oh yes and to read the articles
about that tee mobile app head on over
to pocketnow.com there will be a link
down below down there and of course for
Pocket nail and the Android guy weekly
