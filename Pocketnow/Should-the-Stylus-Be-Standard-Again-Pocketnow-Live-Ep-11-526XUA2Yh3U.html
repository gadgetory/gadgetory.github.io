pretty much not Houston anymore westlaw
i believe ya westside how about you
which part let's send again which part
of houston north side
oh nice nice that's good that's good so
tell us a little about you what do you
do for a living I'm a network technician
oh nice nice I just wanted to mention
that i have a nexus 7 here and I first
started watching pocket now because of
brandon's nexus 7 review and I've been
watching you guys ever since yeah that's
nice man big fans of the nexus 7 here
let me try to pull mine out of a drawer
exactly mine is it was come on let's do
a nexus 7 thing right yeah my god I mean
mine is the white one yeah you got the
limited edition white one yeah so so
tell us about your year nexus 7 what do
you like about the tablet the most I
mean me it's like yeah the sizes is
perfect you know I actually went ipad
mini because you know I i I've been an
apple customer for about three or four
years and it just made sense for me to
go to the ipad mini and I'll tell you
this much I am still not as satisfied by
the ipad mini as i am with the nexus 7
i'm not a big fan of the display but i
do love the fact that you know it's so
cheap it's it is a powerful tablet um
and i don't know i just i considered
convenient that's what I feel it is I
think it pretty good a tavern as well
and I like the camera on it I was
actually playing with it a few months
ago and I was surprised at how how good
the hardware so uh I think iPad Mini is
pretty cool yeah yeah no no tell me
something we have we have like a
question here for today on our hangout
and the question is should the stylus be
a standard again so you are rocking a
tablet right now do you think that using
a stylus would make your experience with
the nexus 7 any better as long as it's
not capacitive I would love to have a
tablet like a 7 or 8 inch tablet with a
stylus and I do think the was a the note
8 that just came out I think I was
pretty nice yeah we just reviewed it
it's a I actually I actually worked on
on editing the video review and it's it
is a good tablet the thing about that
and and this is my same gripe with the
note 2 which i'm actually using right
now
um everything is nice up until the time
when you need to eat rest your palm on
the display and you know sometimes it
does a really good job it not detecting
your palm and only detecting the stylus
which is good but it's hit or miss so I
still feel that you know it's hit or
miss it'll be there someday but I don't
know it's it's it's it's good but it's
still a novelty for something that
wouldn't well I'm sorry I do know that
supposedly if you approach it with the
stylist first that that'll basically
prevent your you know the plan from
being noticed but it a lot of times it's
these are people to hit it with the palm
earth and in it so that that could be an
issue yeah yeah what phone to use an
atrix 2 8520 that's a good phone I have
the HD but but the Atrix 2 it's really
good that one would still work with that
computer doc didn't it yes I got that I
do not have that but I've watched a
number of videos on this bike connected
to my TV via hdmi and last number of
video series with it so yeah those are
the rent those were the really good
Motorola phones man I i miss that yeah
I'd love to get a nexus 4 or maybe the
next generation but I'm also interested
in seeing what Motorola has to offer
when they release release whatever phone
they have so yeah so well do you have
any questions for the team before we
wrap up maybe so when we look real quick
I did write something down Oh a one
actually a couple things one a
resolution and one on aspect ratio I do
know that you know everything is moving
towards 1080p as far as certainly
smartphones I was wondering if you guys
if you haven't already maybe consider
writing like a sort of a master piece on
like the 1080p phones like there's a lot
of them even some like the Aqua find 5
is it like mkbhd you know is your big
fan of them even like the asus padfone
that I know Tony likes the phone itself
is a 5-inch phone i believe it's 1080p
firstly i think it looks awesome so
maybe if you guys could either write a
piece i'm sitting a lot of those and
maybe even a video discussion about it
because i just think i can i can
definitely do a top five on the best
1080p phones in the market you know
we're just waiting we're just waiting
for the galaxy s4 de to reach the market
i mean that that's a new 1080p and it's
gonna be like ubiquitous in the next
couple of months so it's kind of hard to
build it now but you know if i had to
give you a list right now I know tony is
a you're a fan of the PadFone Tony so I
always as I said I think in my mind WC
coverage every year I go to mwc I see a
new bat phone I want the new bat phone I
never get the new bad film because of
the huge price point yeah yeah but you
know in my case the first thing and I'm
just gonna pull it out of it this is
just to give it right you got a pesto
and I'm gonna commit suicide no I am
going to pull the Xperia ZL from the
from the drawer oh this is a very
beautiful phone with a terrible display
it is it is a great display as long as
you look at it from the front but the
promise when you put it on the table and
everybody's like man you guys are always
so much about viewing angles and I'm
like yeah when when I'm eating on a
table and I get an email what I do is I
turn on the phone and I want to see at
least something from the from the table
so that I don't have to pick up the
phone and as it turns out this display
this is a beautiful phone I just hate
the display so this factor is really
nice on that it man listen I have my
hands are big and look at this look at
this I'm touching all four corners of
the phone with the one hand it is really
good 5-inch 1080p display but you know
again I will work on that that's that's
definitely something that's coming but
so far the best 1080p display is the
sadly that the HTC One mr. Tony can tell
you more about that and I was I was just
about to jump in real quick here and of
course you guys know what this is this
is the HTC One and you guys know that
this is the blinkfeed so all of you guys
who are now participating in this and
who are watching this life or the
recording you're hearing it here first
pocket now is officially on HTC
blinkfeed it's it's the top story right
there and if you click on it here it is
so we are right now on blinkfeed so
cheers for a team who made that happen
and yeah
more one more channel for us to keep you
guys entertained and back to you after
de stainless no no Nick it's been a
pleasure we're trying to keep this 25
minutes we've extended a little but it's
been a pleasure meeting you thank you
for joining us and with more since we're
since we're waiting for more people to
join the broadcast we'd love to what
we'd appreciate a view good you know
leaves em so that other people and you
can follow us in the live feed we're
still be there definitely have a great
day thank you guys pleasure to meet you
thank you what mr. Adam doubt please be
my guest okay all right I'm thinking how
about Nathaniel Smith a frequent common
term hello hello Nathaniel how you just
how you doing today I'm good thanks how
are you oh awesome is always good so uh
so what's your stance on style is as I
actually wrote a piece wasn't this week
or last week and I say bring back the
styles as I'm all about Silas but what's
your what's your take I honestly use a
stylus that much I I just tend to
normally lose them perf that's just me
me am I made my achievement lautner
nintendo DS and they've come star that's
all you always used to lose them again
not the first week again and so I I just
don't find any use of them really I I
particularly enjoyed the Michael Fisher
video when he was talking about the
stylus for the worst of video that he
just didn't he was actually Scott taping
the stylist at the back of the phone
yeah that was awesome hilarious I was
hilarious also yeah yeah what what LG
does I haven't seen an LG phone
regardless if it's a phablet or a jumbo
Atlas LG thinks that you usually use
your finger as your stylist and it's
been the same with the view with the
view to a / intuition or what his name
is and the it's the same with the
optimus g pro yeah if you're going to
ship that thing with a stylus you need
to have a place to put it so you just
can't rely on people keeping those
things in their pockets or whatever
because you know you're right you're
gonna lose
yes so get you loose and easy enough
about you know any pocket yeah so some
Facebook home comes out today I know
it's us only but you know we have two
extra us folks here who have managed to
install Facebook home are you gonna give
it a shot or could you care less this is
this is ridiculous look at this I'm
sorry to interrupt this is my facebook
home right now and guess who's on it oh
god oh god oh god I'm trying my sexiest
face there a bad that's happening you is
this this this is your sexy piece no
wait who was the one that posted that
who is the sexiest member on pocket now
well it wasn't me it doesn't I'll give
me a hand she was probably trying to
solicit some votes for himself it oh
well but I gotta say I what I was a
little disappointed but not entirely
surprised i did not even get a mention
in that thread so i did a search and
then you know making the votes you would
have loved who have been there I know Oh
fan so anyway uh so anything else that
you want to want to talk about their or
well yeah um alright i would give
Facebook i'ma try but that main reason I
wanted it was for the chat heads I think
they're quite good you know because
there's our messages you like way
watching YouTube video sort of awkward
you know opening that and I just got an
update to messenger and as Jack heads
included so you know yeah i've been
using chat heads all morning you know i
install the first thing when I got up
this morning and it is pretty sweet so I
I post a message on facebook saying
quick someone messaged me and like I got
like five of them all right and it was
just like I'll tap on that one I'll tap
on that one I'll drag it over it was be
awesome and you know for the record what
makes the chat heads cool is that I have
never seen facebook so reliable in my
life I mean it's immediate it doesn't
stutter it refreshes immediately
everything works as it should you know
like a reliable messenger for the first
time ever that's nice mmm-hmm so I was
under the impression during the demo
video that Chad had was going to be part
of Facebook home but I mean if since
it's not then I think Facebook home
might be going away but chad has is
definitely here to stay at least in my
and my phone yeah so I would definitely
like to see and I don't even know if
they can do this I mean I would love to
see something like chat heads come to
iOS and Windows Phone as well and even
blackberry yeah I know I know I don't
even think it's possible because I mean
I've never seen anything like chat heads
except on an android phone so I mean I
just not built that way or whatever but
yeah so your singing voice is amazing
tongue you know I know right so all
right I think we're gonna just about
wrap it up here did you want to share
your Twitter handle and get some get
some follow and get some follow love
come from this sir um okay yeah saw me
on Twitter I nut man 18 and I deal with
Google+ yeah I'd never pass on mainly

out oh man yeah we were flattered we're
flattered yeah I could have made it I
couldn't make it to the last two
episodes so I wanted to get into this
work so i skipped a class education it
comes first so yeah but we were talking
what are you talking about Tony we're
talking about phones here this is no
education I wanted to be the good guy
for just once in my life and the yang
sir come on Adam skipping a Cubs game
right now I mean look at it right look
at his face look at his face the guy is
about to cry come on Anna do you want to
talk about styluses or do you want to
talk about anything else let's start
first with stylus I think is is good
that these titles came back from the
dead actually because seeing st. note I
think don't one right if this toilet was
these turtles disappear however I think
it's more this more is to expand the
experiencing phone fabrics and tablets
with big screens I don't see it I also
stand stylist in small forms like for
4.5 inches or something like that is I
don't think that more every child should
have done style but he's good as a good
idea to integrate integrate it I have a
question for you every time Michael
Fisher and I meet if regardless if it's
timberglen or in Barcelona and we talked
about phablets we end up arguing so
Michael Fisher thinks that a phablet is
a phablet because of the stylist and the
added functionality and I
think that a phablet is a phablet
because of its size because of its form
factor which is so close to the tablet
what do you think yeah I asked my myself
that that question also but however you
can see phablets or big phone with no
stylus i think is rather write more for
the stylus is for the size of the screen
i seasoned load two icons here like more
than five inches is I consider that that
phone as a father it's my sleep I don't
talking about what are you talking about
I think that's it you know five inches
is like from me the top the top side for
a phone I follow these five inches and
more uncover how r 5 inches is pretty
much alike to walk about one of all the
samsung galaxy mega 6.3 ya hear I hear I
hear that and I read the news and i
would like only I don't know what to
think about life actually almost more
like a tablet I don't know I was in a
little interesting about to me make I
like what galaxy mega alone time to
really know how to pick their their name
or their branding and that stuff do ya i
just wish they bitch the galaxy I mean
so many galaxies and now we have a metal
galaxy actually too yeah you know what
man galaxy s makes a little bit sentence
like notes it's okay for me but make it
like what I I don't know how big they
may because it's you know it's terrible
oh you have a team sitting out down at
the table a marketing team and they
write down names on this blackboard at
like I guess did there were like the
galaxy win right like I like the again
yeah i'm not sure what they want with
that phone i had a question about the
mega ohms and its are they going to
bring the stylers or not i see you again
please are they going to bring
integrated stylus know so that the
megaphones don't have styluses or stylee
but most probably if you'll buy either a
samsung alone aftermarket stylist it
will work but they will not come
bundle with the with the phone like the
es men with what not not only that but
but for example the the 5.8 has a qHD
display yeah you think of that Oh God us
yesterday i was doing pocket out that i
was like oh my god they're trashing the
galaxy brand with these rounds yeah well
so it is so if i understand correctly
does that mean the Megas are going to
have the walk on technology built-in
they're just not me no state offices
they don't have welcomed technology
there will be capacitive stylus Oh
capacitive cells okay all right yeah
continue as you were I would you I'm
just want to add something to the mental
explanation to the mega Brandon did you
go on it's like something is going that
is doing very well with selling their
phones like you get they know to and the
history and what the s brand and the
notes brand is what it's doing so well
that something don't waste money in
introducing new stuff and trying from
like mega and green fault media range
phones is like they have demote this
money to try to test these phones and if
they stick with you with people they
leave it like that him if its people
reject the project is like okay well we
don't know anything we just
experimenting and that's all the main
reason I think yeah but you know when is
what is too much I mean how many phones
the sensor has to release just to be too
much last year they had like a two dozen
or something like that so yes well yeah
i think they release at too many phones
but it's not actually to make it too
many phones like like is to assure you
sir that I I don't know how to say but
are the variance of the same phone that
doesn't bother me like we have is to as
well in the u.s. you have skyrocket you
have so many local knowledge to ivus
Marion's to know if we're just talking
about but work in Mexico we have this is
one is what the days of the galaxy s
advance and if the label different stone
at the galaxy ace
we're like well nobody's going to buy
that those phones there's hotties gonna
buy them I mean oh yes well I have a
question of about leaving the stylus
thing aha do you think like a like big
boy like Samson like oh gee this is a
good idea to keep the middle range
phones because well I see the people
like they the only the only as you seen
in the TV I like for the taxi for the
different companies like Samsung Apple
that kind of stuff and people just want
those phones well surely not necessarily
I mean you and me and probably everybody
on this hangout once the flagship phones
but just a typical user and you're just
getting your first smartphone or you are
living in a country and you don't have
that much luck to afford yourself a
galaxy s4 you most probably go with
either a prepaid version of the galaxy
ace 25 or with with something else so
Americans are good just don't flood the
market with them no yeah I know but well
in some cases well the case is well in
here Mexico this one is world it works
like this well if take samsung galaxy s4
comes out to the market and everybody
biases and well survive some some people
done because it's too expensive or
whatever well the people wait till the
first drop the price today for them to
buy the phone is like they don't deal
with let's say captain money to buy a
mule race phone but they don't want it
they wait till it's really price drops
so they buy iphone that's why i think
like well if you're gonna wear most
people way to the phone drops the price
why we have made arrangements i don'ts
my question well this this this this
must be a specific for your market for
your region but you cannot globalize
this entire concept i think they they
are PR a marketing team and even product
development teams have made their
homeworks and they decided that it is
good to have mid-range phones regardless
if it's answer now or not yet with their
lumia 510 525 21 6 10 and so on the mid
rangers are good they bring the money to
the company and they don't sell volumes
of a single mid-range but more madrid
jurors sell almost as much as a flagship
in some cases so I believe that yes
there is a sense for mid Rangers I love
made Rangers but just don't don't bring
me 25 min Rangers per year yeah well
they're not gonna bring 25 open 30 yeah
then do you have any final closing
thoughts yeah they have you have you
feel the legality the xperia c tablet i
have seen it i have held it i have used
it for a little bit in in barcelona at
this year's MWC well the sweet hat is a
problem as the phone like DF steer the
end of viewing angles yeah yeah the
screen the spittle e at straight shows
there's either very very poor lighting
or there's very horrible super huge
lighting so you can't really get a sense
of of how the display is and just to be
completely honest with you I cannot
remember because I was filming a Fisher
was doing the hands-on but don't go to
go to youtube and check out the hands on
Fisher was handling it personally and I
was behind the camera on that video and
I think that if there would have been
some issues with the viewing angles on
the display we would have said something
about it in that video okay thank you
one last question we well I see the
update for the Play Store and i think is
very nice and well here mexico will have
it yet like I I download the apk that
you put in okay NASA huh but bullish it
shows they catch iOS but it doesn't show
anything else but it goes in it takes
time to talk to the group like that
totally understand what you're saying
because if I am right now to launch my
own google play store and I'll show you
it is completely naked I mean I barely I
don't have I only have apps and i only
have magazines that's it you think
happens let me show you what one trying
to talking about like four wait what
like if didn't show anything oh yeah
that that just sucks most probably
that's because it
a leaked version and it's not the
official yeah yeah I know well what I'm
saying like we just get like the food
movies and Google Play Books and we wait
wait waiting to they will play music and
the other stuff however I think like the
good that takes a while to get those
those stuff here that because there are
very many people asking those services
and asking for the gift card you know
that the gift I to do and because
because making people in Mexico do not
have credit cards and is like nothing
that you can buy anything you can do you
want me to be completely honest with you
yep nobody cares about your country and
nobody cares my country there I don't
have Google Play working in my country
actually Google doesn't give a crap
about other countries decide from like
five or six or seven us k Spain Italy
France Australia and time again Anakin
concur to us nobody gives a crap about
us it's all about those huge countries I
wish google would come to countries like
mine and yours but it doesn't happen and
i'm not sure if it will happen which is
such an irony because even though apple
used to be the same like three or four
years ago you can have all the cert all
the Apple services are available now on
any country that he was almost every
country is supported and that's one
thing but then if your country is not
supported even Apple teaches you ways to
create a u.s. account is everything so
does yeah but I just always compared to
apple because I will go get it baby
ahead and look anything you know
Google's game getting a very important
here and hope it doesn't support it like
very well no it's complicated awesome
hang on tell everybody where they can
find you on Twitter or Google+ or
Facebook or whatever they can find you
well you can find me on my google plus
page is it is my with my name like this
the camera is locked on you so everybody
will see your name now okay thank you

have look nokia n900 mia 920 oh and this
is tablet oh which one which one do you
have it's a first-generation tf101 oh
that was a good tablet that was a really
good yeah it is I have jelly bean
running on it I was gonna ask users so
you have an Android tablet and a windows
phone how is that again rings it's fun I
like windows because super smooth I had
a sony android phone before but it kind
of broke no I was rooting a lot then I
think hardware broke so i bought Lumia
not only something out of out of you you
know your friends and everybody around
you there
in mangalore how many if you would have
from one to ten how many of your friends
use windows phones because I've heard
that Windows Phone is big in India yes I
mean if you say I don't what of them at
have windows and five of them have
Android Play probably one has an apple
oh it's interesting because for example
here and Lotus it's like eight have no
way like three have a blackberry three
have an iphone to have Android and
amount of numbers for Windows Phone
don't see them here I'm d I'm the only I
think I'm the only hunter with the
Windows Phone seriously but Windows
Phone is what we have the cheaper one
its Lumia 920 it's very rare well it's
partially it's around saying it sells
for around nine hundred thousand dollars
okay sir hey I can imagine I could
imagine phones the phones here crazy but
ok back to the question that we have for
everybody so would you like to use a
stylus on your products only on a tablet
not on a phone no way ok and what would
you what would you consider to be your
usage of a stylus on a tablet I mean
would you really replace a notepad just
because you're you're trying to use your
tablet more nope since see I come from a
civil background construction ok I I
might use it to draw something other
than that no not really interested I
really wouldn't use it for anything else
but it would really help I have this
architectural software on my tablet if I
had a stylist it will be really helpful
no interesting interesting so what do
you care what are you currently use on
your computer for example you have a
drop at ya know it's a autocad software
from AutoCAD itself ok but you draw with
the mouse then you can actually yes yeah
on computer yeah uh dr. Anand freaking I
mean same moss I remember that I
remember that there was this can
somebody correct me here there was this
service I think it was for the ipad
where you could you could use it an ipad
to draw everything but everything was
being portrayed on the computer am I
correct through I'm I heard about a
service where you could use an iphone to
draw as like a touchpad
yeah and and I I want to say that I want
to say it's like a citrix application my
brother he works in like networking
sales and tech and stuff like that and
he was telling me about something that
he had I don't remember if it was iphone
ipad iphone to display but it was some
type of networking at app where you
could use the iphone as a touchpad and
then do the stuff up there so yeah I
can't say more specifically those sorry
it's okay it's okay so anyways any
questions for the team anything you'd
like to know yes I do have a question
for you as well as for Anton yes I'm
here and I'm listening well I was the I
was wondering why is my facebook home
full of high may develop pictures I mean
come on I'm your only trash come on I'm
your only friend that's why okay I'll
flood you with my gym pictures to look
at what I'm looking at oh by the way I
finally got it to work good luck okay
okay so oh look this is gross Oh in
Carlo's it it is your friends all right
all right ok so far away what's
requested discussion is battery size
because see my lumia is around 185 grams
right it's supposed to be heavy for
everyone I would not mind this weight
but if the battery was bigger exactly
same goes to say HTC One they're very
thin I wouldn't mind a little more
thicker but battery should be bigger
saying i can i can talk from my
experience that i cannot kill the HTC
One I'm getting two and a half days of
battery life and I'm tweeting
screenshots all the time and I think the
last week which I did was with my
battery is at two days and still
forty-five percent left so if you check
my Twitter account you will see
screenshots it's it's it handles battery
life exceptionally but to your question
I don't mind having thick substantial
phones actually I hate I hate them
phones because I have huge hands where's
your Tony phone where's your Tony phone
which one is the hell we call that we
thought you know a cure
yeah yeah only human being that I know
it owns that thing listen II but this is
gross this is how then the HTC One is
and look at the the PureView I mean just
don't look at the hump look at the body
of it I mean it just and I don't mind
it's it's a perfect phone and the
battery life is good but it's also good
on the HTC one too so inside my
particular case for example I have a
note to as daily driver number one and I
use an iphone 5s daily driver um so
battery life up I am not really about
sizes it's about optimization I'll give
you an example like the Xperia ZL has
got better battery life than my iphone
and at times it does go better than the
galaxy note 2 but the thing about my
note 2 is that this is a tmobile
optimized phone it's not been unlocked
variants so um it I've learned this
about LTE and n hspa+ that works for
some reason if your phone is not
unlocked and you're not using on a
specific carrier the battery does not
last as much if I'm in the United States
and I use this on tmobile it lasts for
two days if I'm in the United States and
i'm using the s3 which is an AT&amp;amp;T phone
it lasts for two days if I'm using yes
three but it's not the same case when
I'm traveling abroad so there's
something that's changed with HSPA
pleasant LTE phones that don't allow
them to behave their best outside their
network so it's just interesting but you
know for me it's not really about size
it's about optimization if the company
can figure out how to optimize their
software in order to make your
experience well like sony has with the
xperia ZL and that's really what you're
looking for and so far I'd say Samsung I
while HTC has figured it out with the
one but I'd say that sony and samsung
were like the tops before that before
that but HTC is showing everybody how
it's done with this phone seriously so
anyways um if you don't if you don't
have any other questions I don't know if
you'd like to share your trigger your
Twitter handle for everybody i know i
usually follow twitter so i don't want
it I like following that's it you sound
like you're talking about Google+ listen
it has been a real pleasure hopefully i
will someday
go to your country and and actually and
actually meet everybody you know what my
friends have talked about so much about
that country they talked so many
beautiful things about it I haven't been
there yet but hopefully i will so it's
been a pleasure meeting you by than a
Jamie one one more thing yeah bangla
it's much better than bombay babes much
better leave said but it's a beautiful
city I really like you know what a
little all year around temperature this
I don't say 70 to 80 Fahrenheit it
doesn't cook whoa I'm down that is
amazing that is amazing that is amazing
I yesterday this country was 110
Fahrenheit a hundred and ten Fahrenheit
I am not kidding you but anyways it's
been a pleasure meeting you and and as
with everybody else we'd ask you to drop
off the call somebody else enjoy
pleasure take care thank you nice but
Adam down ah yes sir i am going to go
with i think i'm pronouncing this right
gesh gir is that right yeah that's you
unmute okay yeah there you are how you
doing gosh what's what's going on today
yeah good um it's nice to finally be
here for the first time welcome welcome
its nest out a few times so I thought
you know try to make it brush my dinner
and stuff definitely definitely okay so
yeah okay Oh from how long did you say
yeah yeah very nice very nice so uh
anything in particular you want to talk
about our topic du jour is styluses or
facebook home in or outside the united
states or anything you want to talk
about I just want to ask about well why
do see one is getting so many good
reviews like is it really that good yeah
the the only reason I'm answering this
is because I'm the only one on this team
here who has an HTC One and I think yes
the only reason why the HTC One is
getting good reviews is because it's a
helluva phone oh and by the way by the
way the guy that's telling you that
right now is a guy that actually sold
this one x yeah
Ashton he hated it I bashed it every day
and I keep on bashing at the camera
sucked on a look so for the record you
know just to help you amplify the 1x was
a phone that all of us wanted and all of
us got and none of us are using or
continued using um because it was you
know and we hated the fact we were
really bashed when our reviews came live
and everybody was like why are you
bashing the phone every other outlet is
talking great things about the 1x so
yeah everybody everybody out there is
saying that this is a great phone and
you're saying that it sucks and well
that's why I didn't sell that well
because it sucks but then with the HTC
One there is a different story Tony up
to you yeah it is a different story and
and you can I can talk about the HTC One
until tomorrow and I don't want to
convince you and i'm not sure i will
convince you the best way you can get a
feel of how the HTC one feels in the
hand and how the user experiences is to
go down to your local store play with it
for 15 minutes snap pictures just jump
through blinkfeed and applications and
and I know whether you fall in love with
it or not it's up to you but I
completely love it yeah cuz I just I've
just been handed an HTC and Sony Xperia
z4 my job I was really lucky to get one
it was uh mandatory and I've been pretty
impressed with it so far so I don't
really see how the HTC can improve from
that what if you guys say it said good
luckily they did and I don't want to
hijack Adams conversation so go let's go
back to Adam no that's why I mean hey
tony is the resident HTC One expert here
so I will defer to his greater knowledge
I've never even had a hand on it so I
mean but I mean the more and more I hear
about it the more and more it sounds
like a really good phone having said
that however I actually was presented
with a choice do I want a galaxy s3 or
do I won an HTC One X and I fought
myself for a long time until I finally
settled on the gs3 Android and and after
hearing you know like what all my
colleagues have said about it I'm just I
can't believe I dodged that bullet but I
mean HTC really impressed me with their
presentation of the One X you know I
remember watching it live and it seemed
like
really solid really great device and
from what I hear it's crap so all right
winter clothes don't get me wrong the
phone the phone and was the beautiful
colony it's a great design the
polycarbonate feels good but it was the
display the display remember Tony it was
you it was the best display on the
market last year was very close yes so
it was good two things that bother me
number one was the crappy camera and
number two it was lagging oh yeah yeah
it was really it was really laggy and it
would piss you off because sets was so
beautiful but you're in behind man we
were in Barcelona together and we were
yeah we were the presentation but we
were at the presentation we were seeing
we were there with Peter Chao and he was
talking and the guy convinced me I mean
I don't think I was sold so much by
actually holding the phone than by the
guys presentation you know he may not
have the best English but he is a great
show man he is really good and you know
he sold his phone really well and I was
like Tony I don't care the company gives
me a phone or not I am buying this phone
and i actually did i bought my phone and
till this day i repent I'm i bought my
plunging but then again I sold it yeah
lucky you I haven't been able to sell it
nobody in this country knows about the
one extra knew about it when it was like
believe it but everybody here it's you
see the toilets filled with ads of the
galaxy s so what I had to go get me one
I had to go get me 10 anyways that's
what you okay so okay so is the HTC One
a great phone yes okay so anything else
you are the time you guys think of the
upcoming s4 because I don't know the way
I see it as the HTC One might be a
better phone but because Samsung has
better marketing baby no that's that's
the best phone but I think what the s4
is basically aspect bomb from the from
the s3 I mean it's if you have an s3
like I do I have absolutely no
interesting going out to buy the s4
especially considering that everything
in the tech world says that the s3
yet others samsung phones are all going
to get the same software that the s4 was
touting with their horrible horrible
acting so having said that you know the
HTC One has a remarkable product with um
you know great feel great design great
everything and the s4 has you know great
software and an already great phone
that's a little bit greater so it's
going to be it's really going to be a
clash of the titans I honestly think
Samsung is probably going to come out on
top um but I think HTC is going to take
quite a big piece of their of their
cherry pie away from them so I'll people
Peter's Peter bravados making the
comment here that's because Sam's
actually supports their phones you make
a good point that but HTC is picked
picked it up a bit there they're doing a
better job in with software updates
let's just see how they treat their
older devices yeah see ya okay anything
else do you want to do do you want to
share your twitter handle or anything or
well I'm not really active on Twitter
I'm just following but you can follow
what you can add me on Google+ sure go
on just tell everybody spell it out or
or tell it the where where I just like
in the end of church i can give gesture
so let me spell try to spell it out it's
g e sh j e double r yeah yeah awesome
well great to have you on and you know
again we're going to have you go ahead
and drop off let somebody else in the
door and enjoy the rest of your day see
you next week maybe I here and since
since the ladies don't really want to
talk to me that's that's the sense i'm
getting from from the Chad I'm gonna
talk to somebody who has something to
say or at least I think like that Peter
let's let's unmute and let's talk hey
how's it going everything is awesome
where are you from I'm from New York
your friend here yes how's the weather
in Europe all right now it's raining
yeah
it's just the same every time I talk
with my guys from from the east coast
the weather is exactly the same like it
is here in Romania because we're
probably at the same latitude so what do
you want to talk about styluses or
anything else stylist I'll go with
stylists let's talk about styluses uh I
think back in the day um it was needed
because the screens were smaller you
know less a more compact and everything
but now the screens are so big I don't I
don't really think you need them anymore
well the the thing would I i agree with
you and I would agree with you up to a
point but I have to I want to pull out
an older here look at this tummy look at
this whole lot i feel like my camera on
you leave this man oh i was one stylist
to man that's gross so I was a beater I
would agree with you but the Samsung has
managed to back a lot of functionality
in this this thing in this plastic
little thing I mean aside from the fact
that is sure sensitive and it has a
button this coupled with the software
which we which they are offering offers
you a complete and unique user
experience and I can talk right now
about whether you can have notes with
pressure sensitivity whether you can
DoubleTap the launch it's just adds a
plus to that user experience while I'm
gonna invent the concept now this is the
smart stylist and what we had back in
the day was the dumb stylist because
that was just this yeah that was just a
piece of metal with a plastic tip and
this this is harder than that okay just
piece of plastic so that's that what I
think about styluses do do I use the
stylus on the note to know well I
definitely agree with you is it a good
thing that it's there for those who
might want to use I know Fisher use it
all the time yeah so bring it on it it
doesn't hurt to be there no you're right
but you know I never read got a galaxy
note 2 so I never really had the stylus
support but my friend had it and he uses
it when he needs it but for the most
part it's there like you said I used it
so when I when I got the the note 2
Fisher brought it to me
to barcelona i use the S Pen non-stop
for the first day and then I just take
it up never I show it to you guys we're
talking about the s pen yeah I know
that's what she said thing here switch
well you're probably looking for a
bigger Espen aren't you ok let's go
let's not go there let's get back here
like most people say like about the S
Pen they usually say they use it to sign
off contracts you know real business use
uh me I I don't see what what I i think
i don't i'm not a fan of writing my
notes with the s pen on the phone but i
find this interesting for instance when
i'm browsing something i just want to
maybe cut out a segment as a screenshot
paste it into an email and send to
somebody or if I'm looking at the aim
apps on Google and I want to have a
screenshot of that I just double tap and
immediately annotate meet me here or
party here and I just send it out as an
email something which I couldn't do or I
be doing in more steps if I'd be using
this stylish so it's just innovation
those little small things at a get it
going yeah anything else you want to
talk about regardless of topic um you
know the HTC one that's been the biggest
topic for like the last month and a half
or whatever yeah but it will it will
stop being that once the galaxy s4 comes
out because all the media is gonna get
the it's going to get the attention of
the entire media but I think that this
year will have a huge fight last year
the HTC One X was no match to the galaxy
s3 this year the one might stand a
chance it will probably not sell ten
percent of what the galaxy s4 will sell
but that the game the match the faceoff
will be more fair and balanced honestly
um it was about maybe in december or
something when i first heard about the
m7 hmm i didn't really think it was
gonna be a flagship i thought was just
gonna be a new HTC phone you know leave
it at that but it
really blew up like that immediately you
know I'm stime the camera freak and for
me the HTC one would be the perfect
phone if it had a better camera now the
four ultrapixel camera on the HTC One
does not suck but it's not your flagship
smartphone camera either so it's I I
great the camera a six point five or
seven depending on what what you use it
for if you're using it for printing then
don't buy it if you're using it for
social media and lots of low light
images then that's the camera for you
alright well my last question would be
um this phone the HTC amaze 4g this is
what i bought because it was the best
camera at the time as well it was a good
phone yep yeah what would you rate the
HTC is one camera compared to this well
to be honest i have not used that phone
so i'll probably pass on this i I'll
tell you compare compared to I can
compare it to the iphone to the PureView
to the note 2 to the s3 it is below all
of these but not not by a huge margin so
it stands out it definitely wins the
entire show when you compare low-light
images it has exceptional low light
image sensitivity but if you are taking
a shot in a bright sunny day outside and
you're taking that shot with the iphone
5 with the galaxy s3 and with the HTC
One in my opinion the one is on the
third place but it's not put to shame
but it's just my personal perspective
that I'm seeing a little bit of noise
and single bit washed out things and and
you know I'm like Brenda minimum is a
freak of pixels I'm a freak of cameras I
think that if you keep the photos for
facebook only it'll be fine yeah
absolutely which is mostly what
everybody does yeah plus it has those
awesome camera effects in the
application which you can apply on the
fly or you can apply after you take the
image and I usually just always bump up
the saturation and contrast and Adam
Lane used to mock me that hey that's a
crappy camera it has all the white
balance and the exposures off I mean
it's an effect yeah but it's not the
classic so yeah
let's call the Instagram they're
supposed to look bad that you're dead
here do you have any any final thoughts
or questions for either one of us no
that's it but thank you guys for having
me thank you for joining and if if your
Twitter or Google+ or Facebook guy tell
everybody where they can find you google
and facebook it's a fork / peter da
privato that's it so you're not a
Twitter fan I have it but I don't even
use it not a fan understand so you're
not buying that the Twitter phone I'll
follow you love Twitter phone thanks for
dropping by please come back whatever
have time sure thing take care bye bye
and uh mr. Rivera luera you can use a
browser nobody better buddy better let's
talk to Madeline she's been waiting yeah
yeah I'm a bad guy cuz I don't want to
talk to her and you're a good guy cuz
you talk to her thank you thank you Matt
a little pleasure to meet you no thank
you now is your flag from Sweden or
Switzerland I didn't like wow thank you
I sorry all right sorry a pleasure to
meet you how are you I'm great great
great which part of Denmark I used to
have a classmate from in high school
would God hi matt has friends all over
the place seriously you know you rescue
his mother was what is of a service that
a community service that would bring
donations to the country back after a
hurricane that happened here and so he
was a really good friend but sadly I
have not been able to find them on
Facebook or any social network sadly
completely lost contact he was ruined he
was from Copenhagen oh well that's the
main big city I'm farmer-owned sir okay
I don't know how crowns Danny don't
worry don't worry just pronounce it the
way you do in your country and that's be
the best pronounce yeah I don't say
rivera or jamie i say hey maybe I don't
know it's it's named after the god Odin
Oh interesting interesting okay so tell
us about you tell us about you what
devices to use well the HTC it's in my
pocket um
with the quad oh that was oh what that
was a that was the anybody remember me
that was the g2 yeah uh but it had a
name I'm trying to remember that was the
desire it's all right desire c said
desire z yeah man I really wanted that
phone and came out I I had the touch pro
two and since i love the keyboard so
much i love the fact that I was
staggered and I'm trying to look for the
phone and I can't find it but I i love
it there we go i love the fact that the
keyboard on that phone was like this one
this was a really good fun well i think
it's a bit different there's no space
between oh yeah that keyboard was much
bigger trust me so um well it's fine but
i wouldn't buy this film oh really why
not Gus uh um I like nokia and sony whoa
I've told this before so so why did you
get that phone my sister handled it over
to me when my old phone broke my god
okay so anyways we are talking about
styluses today and the question being is
uh would you use it do you want it on
your device's it's something you feel
you need well I don't know what I had um
an HP smart smart touch smart once oh
yeah yeah yeah but that was a yeah that
was a capacitive display yeah yeah and
it had a stylist with it and sometimes I
used it and sometimes I didn't and while
it was mainly in the beginning and then
a dish did so yeah yeah you know the
software implementation on those HP
TouchSmart they were so bloated that
they were they would always lag i
remember i wanted to buy one at some
point it was either that or a macbook
pro and i ended up buying the macbook
pro I just felt it was too laggy out of
the box yeah I wasted so much money on
that really good product you can say
leavin soon vanish you can say the
Danish
oh yes oh but your experience with
styluses has been bad but that means
that you were actually looking for a
product that had you actually wanted it
actually I want to have a stylist that
is so great that i can use it to drawn
on a tablet hmm interesting interesting
yeah you should probably give out any of
these note products from samson a try
they they actually do a good job much
better than HP I'll tell you that yeah
but um if I'll want to get a tablet they
have to be a windows really yeah i don't
know i like the interface but i have to
face some of the problems okay don't
don't ask us if we like what those
tablets please I'm you didn't don't push
us there ask us any quit it's your turn
to ask a question but ask us anything
except if we like Windows that well
aren't you going to ask if you would
review more windows tablets so I am
sorry I am sorry you know we okay just
for a round that we we program with Tony
the the different videos that we're
going to do so which devices are coming
up for after the buzz and which devices
are coming up for worse gadgets ever and
so we were like which is the next worst
gadgets ever and I'm like surface RT
yeah well the RTI agree with it was some
mistake you know I think I commend
Microsoft I i salute Microsoft for doing
something very smart I feel I hate I I'm
being honest here I hate that I need to
use a mac for work and then an ipad for
play because one is not good for the
other and the other is not good for the
other and i love the idea of the surface
pro especially the surface pro i like
the concept of having one product that
does everything the problem is that the
technology is not there yet it is not
there yet and i think it will make sense
with windows 9 probably uh when tablets
get you know because the problem with
those surface pro is that it's a thick
tablet
gonna be wanting to haul that thing well
I don't know Adam Lane will disagree
with you well Adam Adam disagrees with
about everything well great too because
i like when products is a bit more thick
than others yeah yeah again I feel that
it was a it was a bold move and you know
the reason why we don't review more
windows tablets is you know first of all
the tablets that we focus on or the
slate tablets not the keyboard ones and
as it turns out for example you were
waking we were waiting for the Samsung
of TV tab and it was pulled it was
pulled from the map it didn't even make
it um then just think about how many
other certain how many other windows
tablets are there except for the envy x2
that that we had a tough time getting
for review and then eventually Michael
add to buy and we you know we just
didn't review that product altogether
but it's just it's there are a lot of
products but it's interesting I mean
even delos saying that they have no
faith in windows 8 and so we are if you
if you want to compare how many windows
seven products were launched last year
in comparison to windows 8 products this
year that will reveal why we haven't
reviewed more windows tablet sadly well
have you heard about the new racer
gaming tub yeah yeah we have uh what was
that do Tony by the way I have no idea
i've not heard of it well on unbox
therapy they have one now really really
happy we're so looking well thank
yesterday all earlier this morning oh
please share please share the link of
you can on the comments we'd love to see
it i love to see you have to find it oh
don't worry take your time take your
time this video is gonna be live for
about an hour thanks but but again you
know i feel that again you're a Windows
fan but do you currently have any tablet
or any windows salad or you're just
wrong I'm looking for tablet and I don't
know what to get because I'm really I'm
really Peggy well if you're into windows
I will tell you this much the surface
pro is something it is we were not
expecting this tablet to be so good uh
we had high hopes for it but not as high
it is a very powerful product so do not
spend money on Windows RT
it is a waste of money if I were you
just save up a little more money and go
for the surface pro if you're into a
tablet that's also a computer I think
that's like your best pic well that's
what that wasn't my plan but I don't
think we have the pro and Denmark yet
mmm well it's it was recently launched
here in there it's been a month old in
the United States so it'll take some
time but again you know if you're gonna
go windows surface pro I think it's your
best pic so far you know Adam you know
Adam it may be he may be a Windows fan
but he's not a fanboy he'll tell you if
the product is not good and so far he's
he's telling he's told us that the
products just like out of this world out
of this world in comparison so it's
really good so anyways any other
questions for the team well I think I
doom remember the earldom phone I think
it was one of the first smartphones with
a stylus is it had a code named diamond
I'll see if you Dixie touch diamonds ya
know to us are from being the first
smart that was far from being the first
well it was the first one in Denmark Oh
interesting and also I think it was the
first with a vga displayed but my might
be wrong ah no well there were pocket
pcs with vga display psychedelic seem
the dell xing five and five or something
like that uh that was like the first vga
displayed but the thing about the touch
diamond that it was a two inch display
with a vga resolution it was a really
beautiful phone and even if it was
windows mobile i think that that was
like the best version of touch what was
it touch fellow Tony yep that you know
touchflo back then was not laggy at all
so it really pissed me off when I picked
up this HTC touch pro2 because it was
extremely laggy on this phone in
comparison to the touch diamond which
was much more under power than this
thing so anyways anyways oh that was
everyone I remember and my friend had
that one and I just remember it was so I
don't want I really didn't like it I
loved it something I just my job I love
that phone it was a beautiful phone it
was HTC showing their thoughtfulness you
pulled out the style is and it turned on
to display was my manager
remember those days yeah it was magnetic
oh man you're so old boy thanks art okay
so here's the deal if you remember what
phones were sold at the time that the
touch diamond was out it was this thing
which was the the herald determining the
airman's and yeah and then we had
devices like this for example we had the
the Q so i can't believe i still have
this all about sometimes a museum will
pay good money for thank you thank you
but the point being is devices were so
ugly well this was a pretty fun but this
was ugly and then when you shot a touch
dines in such a beautiful phones wait it
was really pretty i remember the first
time that i turned it on and then there
was this little circle in the bar at the
bottom yeah you remember that thing
would like that was your LED indicator I
was like man HTC you guys are amazing I
remember that and the battery cover with
all the angles in the triangles with the
diamond shape that that that was awesome
that was a good phone knows I think
that's what subscript e back then no but
it's a good it was a good phone but
anyways Madeline it's been a pleasure
meeting you would you like us to follow
you on any specific social network I
think I left my tour to ya oh let me
just lock my camera on you yeah yeah

freaking cool hello I'm a bit because
it's so freaking cold okay yesterday it

keep fighting that well
you it's a pleasure see ya ah everyone
over to Tony before I hand it over
myself to Adam I'm desperately trying to
keep up with the comments on YouTube but
they're just scrolling like infinitely
and just just the answer a couple of
questions if you guys on YouTube have
specific questions for us just write
question all caps and have the comment
like that so it pops up from everything
and yes I'm half hungarian half romanian
i speak both languages I have both
citizenships thank you for that back to
Adam all right i am gonna go with is
it's a czar or a caesar or how am I
supposed to pronounce that hey za a
romanian friend yeah i was actually
closer the first time so how you doing
today well just fine i got home from iu
school I you know I enjoy it every day
when i get home so um so our topic du
jour today is the stylist should it be
standard again and if you say no you're
wrong mom but now i'm just kidding um so
but yeah what do you what do you think
about Silas should we bring it back or
should we leave it buried first let me
show you a device I don't know if anyone
knows this it's a chick d 689 I think
was a weird phone with the stylus which
I lost which had dual sim capabilities
in some other funky shit long way back
so if I enjoy a stylist I would use it
for recreational purposes yeah I
remember I'm one of my first smartphones
was the treo 650 and I just remember no
yeah you're gonna make nice never pop I
used I used to use this stylus all the
time it I lost a couple of them I've you
have no choice you have no choice anyway
well it was either that or you know a
closed pen
do that but yeah i just i miss styluses
I really do so um just like just a
little half well there is always that
but now I just I just I need to have
that precision I need to have that
accuracy the the current workarounds
that are in place you know the drag
handles and stuff like that it's just
not good enough for me i want that
precision I want that I just I want to
be able to you know say oh I screwed up
typing something I'm gonna tap right
there and get rid of that extra letter
and said try it out there now there nope
you're gonna get it r rating man come on
and there's Adam there's this new thing
where were you tap and hold and the
entire cursor turns into a magnifying
glass and you can go letter by letter
and then you relax enough not good
enough I want you first try you remember
those days when you would pull out your
stylist and you will look so
businesslike you know you were there on
the subway or something you were writing
something down back in the day would
Paul when palm pilots were not common
and everybody would look at you like wow
hi may I still look there's this like
right anyway so um yeah so um good stuff
so I hear you are you on the stylist
train then sound like it kind of work so
okay I'm waiting for the next Nexus 7
and I hoping I'll get the stylus or
something from a market that works with
it I want some stylus capability for
relaxation a little drawing something
like that yeah and you know that's
another thing about drawing is if you've
ever played draw something oh yeah I
need a stylist for that game because man
I just my big fingers here I can't I
can't I can't even draw a dog without
being like it looks like balloon animal
I mean so you're talking about big
fingers what are you talking about big
figures the jumping thing is being this
I love fair enough
yes yeah I definitely am on board that
train so was there anything you want to
talk about aside from how awesome
styluses are actually wondering
something from what I understand fuckin
else an editorial how does how do you
guys make revenue out of it you get
sponsorships or what can you talk about
that I'm going to defer to Tony on that
if he can even just I'm the new guy so I
really don't know where the money comes
from what's that I was muted and I was
checking through the comments can you
please repeat what the question was
about how the spike in now make revenue
oh well it's very easy when you go to
our website and you see our beautiful
content you also see our beautiful ads
so make sure to click on as much as
possible and the side front death no
turning turning this into a real answer
if you go to pocket now and i'll
probably drop a link or i'll post it on
twitter if you follow me to an article
written by brandon minimum like six or
seven months ago explaining exactly how
we function and there there you can see
everything but the main idea is that we
function by by ads and the as just any
other media outlet we are not sponsored
by any huge company like others are with
AOL or sprint but the click on those and
i will make us happy okay i was good not
gonna get back to the comments let me
get back to your comments so uh yeah so
I mean I I kind of figured it was
something like that you know you know we
we uh you know we do do a lot of
editorials we do a lot of reviews and so
um you know like any website we're
interested in traffic so um you know
that's it's just kind of how we roll so
that's easy peasy yeah and for the
record pocket now has been we've been on
the air since tues as the year 2000 when
pocket pcs rule the world and they made
palm look like nothing sorry Adam sorry
God go ahead kick the dead guy yeah you
think yeah it works out
oh yeah but but we've we've been here
for forever ever since blogs begun what
they are and so you know what has helped
Pachelbel succeed well it's been the
amount of time that we've been on the
air most most of the mostly because of
that and you know a lot of our readers
are have been here since the old days
since we clearly didn't know what
capacitive this place were back then Oh
lots of things it's it's a lot of
history here a lot of history so I was
listening to some of that history on the
pocket down weekly where you were
talking about um well sassy bob was it
oh yeah I was intrigued enough to go
watch a couple of those videos and and
you saw Sarah shrimp you saw that HTC
Rhyme video that was genius you know I
she came up with the whole idea you know
for example a lot of the videos that we
do like for example after the buzz was
Michael Fisher's idea fully Michael
Fisher's idea worst gadgets ever was his
idea and so usually what we do is we you
know he tells us okay this is our idea
this is the way we should do the video
we brainstorm we decided with Tony and
when Brandon we and we implemented um
but in that case she was alone she was
like okay I'm gonna do something
different I'm gonna do something
uniquely you guys gonna love it and it
was really good I mean sexy Bob is very
talented very every time yes she is she
has a creative talent that I don't but
at the same time and I and I said this
yesterday on Twitter I said small doses
small doses for sassy Bob for me so but
yes so uh since already anything else
you want to talk about or no just
congratulation for the great war keep it
up thank you my internet was down for a
week and I have to make up with all the
videos podcasts and so on tonight will
be nice and busy so did you want to
Jerry did you want to share any type of
a social media name is really my
favorite artists just to follow you guys
in a few other editorials fair enough
fair enough are all right well everybody
says are as awesome and we thank you for
joining us and and I have enjoyed the
rest of your evening
and I will turn it back on over to Tony
then yeah thank you i will hold before I
pick the next person to talk to I will
try to answer a couple of questions
which we're getting on the YouTube feed
so in no specific order I just catching
them as they're flying in and copy
pasting it into something else so for
instance i received the question for we
received the question from RTE CPC he
says will there be a nexus 5 this year
it will be a nexus 5 it will not be a
google i/o this is my personal opinion
google i/o is the time if you remember
last year when google introduced the
nexus 7 so it's time for a nexus 7
update and we will probably get that and
towards autumn when when there's a one
year cycle of from the nexus 4 to the
nexus 5 they're probably be a nexus 5
now whether if it would be 5 inches or
it will be the fifth iteration of the
nexus phone that's yet unknown another
question is and guys feel free to
interrupt me if you have any other ideas
or you don't agree with what i say
another question is from h1 is the HTC
One not the same design as the butterfly
except an aluminum aluminum won't know
it's not the same design if you pull up
a picture of the HTC One and compared
with the HTC butterfly or j butterfly
you will see that first of all the
butterfly is not so thin and it's not so
tapered towards the edges now if you
come to the front of it you'll see that
the HTC One has dual speakers on top and
on the bottom and the bottom layout is
not the same turning it to the back you
also see some differences so it's not
it's not by far the same situation as it
is with the s3 s4 and last but not least
and this I think it will handle hand
this over to Adam zoni TV says what do
you think of webos overlay for android
devices I tried using webos courtesy of
Adam doubt who sent me a awesome the
smallest phone on this planet I would
not like that on an android phone but
probably Adam will disagree with me um a
webos overlay I mean we can depend on
how was implemented I mean if you could
make
android run like webos there's a riot
the paradigm would be awesome you know
the card the card you I was really
interesting yeah form a preferred for me
what killed it with webos was using the
most powerful webos phone out there
which was the pre three which I gave
over to Michael because it was a
sluggish phone well and it's interesting
that you mentioned parts because as far
as Android is concerned this is as close
as it gets to the cards this is the the
multi-user multi multi tasking interface
on the HTC One and these are cards and
you just wipe them off as as you would
on any web wise device yeah but it's
it's the double tap it was good cool
true true coo coo I just I just I really
like the gesture based system to you
know just swipe up from the bottom my
phones like I still swipe up from the
bottom because I want to get to the card
view and so I just I you know if you
could make that work it would be great I
would definitely I would definitely use
it whether or not i kept it would be a
different story but you know i still
have mytouch fed and it still runs web
of us so i mean i haven't put android on
it or i had android down and I took it
off I'm just because I wanted webos
better so okay thank you for your input
let me talk to mr. whole hunter hi guys
I hear you how are you damn fine we had
talked I think last week you have to
talk to one of my colleagues you're from
Germany right yeah it's that's right I
talked to Brandon out to Brandon okay
now you're talking to me so nice I'm not
gonna make a Robert DeNiro impression
like you're talking to me okay so what
do you want to talk about styluses or
anything else don't let hymen um yeah
well I personally don't need statuses I
am I just my pocket pc saw windows
mobile phones
um yeah the first windows mobile phone
was fitted HTC touch with cash flow 2d
oh yeah but I think that was a work that
was a 1d but it was asked there was so
late but do you guys remember what was
this entire touchflo thing introduced i
think it was introduced on the HTC elf
the initial touch the small round one
the fat one and I used to call it the
cube because you would slide up and then
you would her head and it would switch
like a queue but it was a triangle yeah
and it would it wasn't only that you
could you know HTC one was the first
windows mobile phone that you can flick
squirrel like you could on the iphone oh
yeah you remember that yeah I'm too old
yeah thanks for reminding me back to you
both yeah so but after i switch to
android I don't need this Islands
anymore okay tell me have you used a
galaxy note or no 2 or note 10.1 and I
never owned one but my father-in-law has
an a galaxy note 10.1 and yeah it's okay
when you have a template such a big
tablet I've got a nexus 7 but on it on a
10 inch tablet okay and it's maybe
there's room to use the stylus but some
for me personally I only do on the phone
I do typing so i use guess you're typing
more swiftkey something like that stylus
like on Windows more well I'm not gonna
be I'm gonna play devil's advocate
because for a sake of conversation not
because i'm a fanboy of the stylist I
couldn't care less about it just to be
honest don't you think that it will it
would make your life easier under a
couple of circumstances like i said i'm
not sure if you watch the show before
for instance when you just snap a
screenshot of a map and make an
annotation on that with your hand and
you send it off by an email or you just
cut out the section of a web page when
you're browsing and send
add to somebody or you make annotations
on your calendar these are probably the
only things I can think of using the
stylus on my phone I don't Michael
Fisher used to play with the with
editing his his pictures and using the
status as a brush that's not me yeah
that's not me but I I would probably use
it for us don't you think it would be
useful under these circumstances do you
have a stylist sure so well if i use
screeches I crop them to fear anything
too much yeah if you really need this I
mean if it's theirs it's okay if you
it's a depends on you if you use it or
not so it's nice to have told me it's
you can use it if you want but
personally for me yes it's not I don't
need it I understood and the most
probably the two of us are on the same
wavelength because I I don't care about
the stylish either is there anything
else you want to talk about about I
don't know whatever crosses your mind
yeah and this goes to you Hyneman um I I
pronounce your name right is right you
try you try to drive the German language
too small Thank You slot and i think
sundays ago Google make this offer with
this giveaway and you make a fun pasta
here I wanted you to use Twitter and not
google glass though i'm on twitter yeah
yeah but the the reason why i want to
ask us m do you prefer a facebook or
twitter morning class or is he a to the
plus i agree ok yeah I what okay the
problem Google+ is that um you know I
feel ok this is me particularly first of
all not nobody that I know is on google+
let's start with that only my you know
my pocket now friends are there but then
none of my personal friends are in
Google+ because you know I think that
Facebook has been able to
satisfy their needs up to the point
where they have not one tomorrow wanted
to migrate um that's the first thing the
second thing is my problem with Google+
is that it's not any better than
facebook or twitter it's just it's just
a combination of both and so I feel that
Google is bold enough to build something
that actually makes you want to use it
and they just not put enough head to it
so and you know what when I saw that
it's like you have to follow the google
play store drills like what that is
hilarious following where I was like
well what happens to go up was I'm like
Google this is terrible forget about
your giveaway fine give away your
talents and proxxon whatever you want
you want people to follow you on another
social network that is embarrassing it's
like asking Apple you remember when they
brought their ping social know that that
feel that just sucked I mean seriously
they were so contient that they had
screwed up with the concept that they
killed it and I feel that they're trying
you know they're trying to make google+
something hot but it's not any better
than anything else and that's the reason
why I don't like it it's except for the
hangouts the only reason why I have
Google+ is for the hangouts that's the
only reason okay maybe maybe Google
flush ago by appt net so a negative and
they could like go meet up at a bar and
drink their sours of Sorrows under the
table so yeah yeah serious okay meantime
yeah I wasn't be monitoring because them
especially here in Germany people care
about privacy so if you think of
Facebook you think of oversharing yes on
google+ it's all optional it's up to you
if you use an option on that but in an
on facebook and it's launched and it's
activated in the limit this is gonna
sound funny the other thing i don't like
about google+ is the app it is
everything is just yeah well you can't
see more than through two things at once
on my note 2 good because of this
because of the design of the cards i
feel that they're trying to be modern
but there are certain it's like it's
like when Johnny I and he you need a
bigger
yeah no I you know it's not a bigger
phone like for example when Johnny I've
came up with the original the for the
second generation macbook pro I mean the
the USB ports were so connected together
that the computer was beautiful but it
didn't make sense you couldn't use them
at the same time and it was stupid so in
the in the case in the case of Google+
when you're in a feed what you want to
see is you want to see the more in the
less the least amount of efforts and
since the cards are so big and beautiful
they're not functional and it's just
stupid on my book that's me all right
okay I understand done and the next
thing you never got interrupted by
social games or something no I hate
those facebook you you always got this
them hoes I'm actually I'm actually
deleting out my friends the minute I see
they're posting something for the
inviting me to a stupid game show no
thank you i know exactly your let me go
let me go log on to my farm bill right
now okay I'll be right back Col de ver
me front of your gym pictures thank you
spare me from your polar watchman come
on well you know hey all those games
they all spam me exactly once because
then I block them and it's no longer a
problems that's the thing about Facebook
it's gotten smarter it's not the same
thing as it started so that's the reason
why people are still there yeah okay
bowl do you have any any final thoughts
yeah well it's great to be here and
thank you for your comments today it's
you it's good to have you here thank you
very much for joining the camera has
been locked on you for the past couple
of seconds so that people can see her
twitter handle go follow bowhunter on
that twitter account he's an awesome guy
thank you very much for joining us have
a nice weekend there you do take care
bye bye before I hand it over to him and
I'm gonna try to answer quickly the last
batch of questions from YouTube I cannot
say your name I'm sorry a question what
I the idea is what do you think should
he get the note 2 or should he wait for
the galaxy s4 now it's it all depends on
what you want from your phone if you
want a big phone a phablet phone you
want the S
and definitely go with the note 2 or if
you can wait wait for Aoife because
we'll have the note 3 if you want a
phone and you don't care about the s pen
and you want a fast them because the s4
is about fastest android phone out there
then definitely get the s4 and the same
person asked me and i think he answered
his own question can i get the galaxy s4
from the US or the UK absolutely in the
UK our friends club that code at UK in
the US are friends negri electronics and
last question are you going to review
the Padfone infinity or the fonepad yes
as soon as we get them we will review
them and I'm gonna hand it over to time
and thank you guys everybody for your
questions on YouTube and trying to catch
up with all the comments but it's kind
of difficult ok a party of este momento
omaha continual hang out again spaniels
and translate means as of this moment
will continue in Spanish but anyways
dematha hello get to see me oh really
how are things in Santiago um the only
time to expand into English now let's go
English come on come on we have lots of
yours we don't want to go up there's a
hangout lately has been extremely hot
it's been terrible in the tropics lately
and then that's because we have a lot of
cold fronts coming in which is ironic in
this time of year but I never years ago
um I used to live in a house and the
trees will go from one side of the
street to the other yellow boys hot
shadow and yeah um from me all the way
to July you will rave constantly now if
it raised one day it's a miracle don't
know your ears yeah yeah for the record
everybody the tropics of this season are
are terrible we we get south winds here
so in our case my neighboring countries
Nicaragua and they burn a lot of
sugarcane there and so all that smoke
from Nicaragua comes over through the
south winds here and it creates a
greenhouse effect so that's the reason
why we have 110 degrees sell Fahrenheit
that's the reason is suffocating over
there it's it's horrible it's horrible
but anyways I
i forgot what phone you had you have an
HTC phone I have the HTC Sensation XL
okay so tell us are you interested in a
stylist not necessarily for that phone
but obviously a smarter stylist to work
on your future phone okay i'm going to
show you that something is going to be
on my face this is the phone that I used
to have is the sony ericsson yes
diamonds Frankie on the corner yeah I'm
trying to remember the does anybody
remember what operating system that ran
you remember Tony the p900 I think it
was oh yeah yeah he 9910 it was it was a
custom operating system yes I don't
think it all sony ericsson's had at the
time had the same operating system it
was basically the same but just started
what does the differences that was
symbian they used to use a version of
symbian for those phones you think yeah
it was symbian i remember it was symbian
those were the days those phones are
really expensive extremely expensive
they were they were um I don't know like
300-400 father sometimes three hundred
four hundred dollars they cost a
thousand dollars here already yo yeah
yeah that one was product that the
people nine ten you remember it was a
fun it was it had a touch screen and
then it had a flip with the numbers yes
some of the flip that phone was
extremely expensive those were those
were the place I don't want to go back
to that this one it wasn't that
expensive because it doesn't have a
camera it was just touch screen and it
had a stylist but I'm going back to the
thing I had that phone and I never lost
the side of this but at the same time I
never actually used it i will use just
my fingernail cuz it wasn't with them
lucky you cuffing your nails you got
fingernails look at you hey by the way
you know that's an interesting question
does anybody remember which was the last
phone you had that didn't have a camera
my last phone was the Motorola be 60
Tony do you rember know my first thought
was the HTC Trinity and that had a
crappy but still carried it it had a
camera Adam what did you have I'm
looking around for I think my kids have
it it was a nokia um do you remember the
n-gage yeah yeah that was a yeah it
wasn't the end gage was the pre
cursor to that it was the same shape as
the n-gage and it had a full qwerty
keyboard on either side of the screen
yeah it was a nokia 3100 i think as well
was it the one which popped out like
this you could open it no there was no
topping it was just whatever fixed it
was fixed yeah yeah the second one the
second version was the one that popped
in and out and I used to hand the phone
on my wife so she could talk and she's
like which end do I talked into it
looked like a game remote but it was
like it was a full keyboard i love that
phone so I remember yeah I answered
because I had the impression that we
were talking about smartphones but since
we're not talking about smartphones I
had lots of phones without any cameras
and I'm gonna probably do a picture in
both the twitter i still have a couple
of hanging around here numboat you know
what we were talking with Michael
because in the in the podcast yesterday
we were talking about aluminum and if
it's the adequate material for you to
build a phone and so we we debated you
know because if you drop this iphone 5
the Shatford edges are just going dead
so we remembered that it that the
motorola be 60 had brushed aluminum and
it worked out fine you can drop that
phone and it was a very resilient so I
and I think it's probably well let's do
the stylus conversation since we're
talking about this hold on just one
thing I have to tell this do you
remember the good old HTC hd2 not this
yeah yeah there's no aluminum and I
shrink I'm not sure if it was stainless
steel or not but this you couldn't see a
shit you couldn't bend it this was like
freaking titanium yeah I don't know that
was a good phone such a good friend but
about anyways but anyways then SSO you
don't think you need a stylist step well
got all the pants cuz I always try to
look at it sorry oh no you gotta share
that you gotta share that come on sorry
it's my ringtone for when i get messages
no no it's not only your ringtone from
now on you're gonna share with everybody
come on that's super mario using you and
you rule whomever gets a notification
notification live while we broadcast
they have to show it off they need to
read it
absolutely okay let's ask let's ask
another word Preston which was the first
version of mario brothers that you
played I faith I played the original
first one what about you yes I played
the original well I don't know if it was
the reason or what but me and my brother
when I was little when Nintendo came the
first concert 88 bit the 8-bit Nintendo
yes like the first console man oh I
think it no it not the first one but the
Super Nintendo the kind of honored that
was a second one that was the second one
yeah but that was more that was mario
world that was that was even ten times
better than the first one well we had
that and a Sega and we got a whole bunch
of video games and that was like that
was my main activity as a child that was
it has been my world since then video
games all the way oh wow Tony with Tony
which was your first version the
original but do you keep on forgetting
that we are old man we're both far from
let me look at these young people come
on uh Adam help i go back i go back to
donkey kong so I don't want you the
original Mario Brothers come on that was
the first operation that Ohio did but he
didn't even have a name he was exactly
he was in Donkey Kong and on that when
Donkey Kong became a game on itself and
he was on come on that other that you
had to go up the things oh yeah yeah
yeah we are so geeks we're okay but you
want to know exactly how much of a geek
I am I am not lying to you how many can
you believe i have never owned the game
console ever works I have never had one
and it's just funny because I'm really
good for by I love playing games but you
know my family was very poor we couldn't
afford one yeah uh and you know
eventually ended up growing up and I
don't know I've been debating over
buying a PlayStation but try to convince
me well the thing is I was just like you
be living
third world country most people are not
no don't have the money and those
councils back then and even now they're
extremely expensive if you compare mean
one dollar one u.s. dollar years 38
pesos I mean I'm okay here here's 20
here it's 20 so I have a worse than you
and um the only console that I've ever
owned are the Sega the Nintendo
disappearing Nintendo a dreamcast and it
was a second handed and a playstation 2
oh she was like salinity the only
consoles that I had yeah but then we
always like secondhand all have it I
don't I don't I am serious I'll give you
an idea you know it's it's it's still a
thing you know my mother she still has
the same job that she had back then and
a PlayStation is still a full months
gallery of my mother sadly that's that's
how bad that's gross dad that's how bad
things are here sadly so you know thank
God for for forever you know the
evolution and everything and thank God
that I'm able to serve my mother but
that's how bad things are now can you
imagine the way they were back then
because of consoles being so cheap I
turn into a pc gamer because my brother
had got his faith his first shopping his
dream was to have this amazing computer
so we can play video games and ever
since then I've been a pc gamer yeah as
well well we we gotta cut it short we're
running out of we ran out of time yes we
did yeah Dean answer any questions or
anything you'd like to share before we
go yes to finish the conversation that
completely can not change because of my
reins on earth sciences I have two sides
of the story I mean on one side it is
good for people that do specific things
on their phones for trying and things
like that exactly but for people like me
I mean I had one on the on the phone on
the m6 m600 and it didn't have a camera
that was the last one I had a camera
that i own and i didn't use it because
it was shows i had to keep the qwerty
keyboard and hide everything else I
could do everything with my fingers up
with
that actually you also do certain
specific things it's a good thing but
having them back is really good because
they're always something that you can do
with them yeah you will never like just
disregard them completely definitely
yeah it's all about it or something if
it's nice to have it's nice to have but
well anyways the nesa it is always a
pleasure talking to you thank you for
joining thank you for joining the
Hangout as always it's a pleasure
talking to you and I am handing it over
to Tony now yeah and we're gonna go
forth full circle we are out of time and
we are over time but let's let's go to
Adam and this is going to be our last
call oh I was anticipating not having
anyone okay uh let's go with how about
Jeremy Finley yeah that's you alright
cool hey there is I ask you everything I
was going to get into this cow you're
gonna get it either so that makes two of
us natural I again button you've dropped
in and out like a hundred times I think
so what part where are you from I am
from Canada more specifically
Newfoundland right on the East Coast
alright alright that's pretty cool so uh
so I did you want to talk about styluses
you want to talk about some Facebook or
you want to talk about something else Oh
talk but Stiles asusta it's the current
topic all right yeah I could see I would
actually like to see Stiles has brought
back into the fold for like general
features on most phones you're not going
to get it on every phone blowjob I mean
like um like I forget her name the girl
she was just on there um d she said
something very very good there she said
that you'll always have a reason to use
like you'll always find something to use
it for like myself on hoping to one day
get into architecture or something along
those lines and to have have a
our phone in your hand uh I mean using
your finger it's you could get by but
I'm just trying to imagine I'm trying to
imagine somebody drawing a building with
their finger just like hey look over
here over by this squiggle over here
that's that's the river just use your
imagination we're gonna have this we're
gonna have this big crop blob of green
and that's gonna be your porch okay so
Adam Adam doubt is is about the newest
member of our team and if I or anybody
else had a probably a little little
question about his sanity we got the
answer he's insane just like all the
rest of us yeah yeah we're set to report
he's not a new pretty much pretty much
certifiable I thought I actually I
thought that's what got me hired so that
was part of the requisites all right
glad I met that quota for you so all
right so uh okay so you are your pro
stylist but not for everybody i get that
so if what what would you use a stylist
for if you you have a phone with a
stylist and you're like I've met the
stylist I'm going to do something
awesome with it what is that um see you
can't really pinpoint it down to anyone
use but I mean it's like Anton I think
yeah Anton said earlier was like the the
old-style Stiles's there's not really a
place for them anymore I got it all that
is just a substitute for your finger but
like these new smart statuses are I
believe that they're going to be the way
to go in terms of Silas in general all
right you know oh you're right I did
kind of leave that open let me flip it
around for you what do you do on your
smartphone that you say darn it i wish i
had a stylist for this that would be
awesome that's an awesome question
probably drawing more than anything like
you know you just if you just got an
idea or
something like that and you just want to
kind of draw something up right quick
just so you wouldn't have to have like a
pen paper sure you could kind of do the
same kind of thing and you've always
have it on yet rather than kinda like
where's that piece of paper where's a
pen you know even Joe I want some
contact info I agree and you know I'm a
bit of a musician so um you know what
you know so therefore i'm artistic
that's at least how i see it i don't
know if anybody else does but I draw I
draw and I've never used this thing for
drawing well I mean for me when I when I
have an idea whether it's a musical idea
or whatever type of artistic flow it
just seems to me like writing is a much
more artistic flowy kind of way rather
than typing it's like I don't want to
pull out my phone and open up SS note
and just start typing I don't want to do
that I just want to be like oh oh wait
wait this isn't done ok just for me ok
what one thing that we we've come to a
consensus with Michael and tony is you
know probably it's not that the stylist
is there the problem is the display does
not feel like if you're writing on paper
wouldn't it be awesome if they brought
like a matte sort of display that would
feel like if you're scribbling on paper
yep ok hi I'm link yeah there you go I
think we should just start making phones
out of pillows so that way you know it's
the perfect material you don't worry
about dropping it and you know if you're
right on it it feels nice and soft and
you can cuddle with it so and if you
throw it at the wall and rage break
exactly then you know what
ex-girlfriends around the world would
love that particular feet well you have
to stop giving samsung ideas this will
turn into the next product with Samsung
Galaxy pin or whatever oh the next door
the next marketing campaign the
ex-girlfriend just throwing things at
the wall because the husband didn't want
to watch the video they kept thinking
they can send me a check for that one so
ok uh anything that you want to do a
talk about or you want to get your name
out there ok
uh yeah actually one topic that I was
hoping to kind of bounce off you guys
I've been heard about like through
YouTube and other stuff like that um
sapphire displays like instead of
Gorilla Glass you would act like the
actual glass itself would be this
sapphire material which apparently can
only be scratched or caught by diamond
but in being the victim of a cracked
screen the same galaxy nexus with a
crack display yeah if the glass and
eases is apparently pretty bad for
brittleness it's pretty good for like
scratch resistance but it when it comes
to cracking it's very thin apparently up
from the very top yeah but that that
problem will not be solved with sapphire
glass because that is even more brittle
and the internal tension within sapphire
is even higher than on Gorilla Glass one
two or three so it might protect you
against scratches sure but it's just as
if not more brittle than galaxies the
galaxies o'meara here is really less not
my poor thing there it is oh god yeah
yeah yeah mine went all the way down all
the way down right across the middle
here yes and here minus minus oddly they
crack the same way I guess yeah they ply
this yeah I mean is really come like a
screen protector would probably be a bit
more of a useful thing for the Sapphire
well it depends if if we're still
talking about brittleness and shattering
know nothing will protect that and
probably a bumper case and you'll have
to probably eat in those two seconds
where you see it full say a quick prayer
that it lands on on its sides and on the
bumper itself but if you get an impact
on the sapphire screen it will it'll
break you know you you haven't really
seen many people with an HTC phone in a
shattered display and the reason why is
because well HTC did a better job in
building a plastic rim around the design
of the phone so that's the problem with
samsung phones when they fall up this
border is falling directly on the floor
because it
has little protection on the edges so
you know I think that the whole race for
the edge to edge no bezel display is
sadly going to give us this problem you
know that this plays are obviously going
to last or are going to be more exposed
to shattering I keep on saying this
guy's girls don't drop your phones I
i've been using phones my entire life
and I have never dropped the phone okay
if you take the average of me never
dropping a phone and brand them probably
dropping like every film or tossing it
around he tosses it around he tells us
it around we have an awesome average but
but just take care of your phones and
they'll be nice to you and shiny yeah I
mean in in the probably you know four or
five years and you know great i said i'm
i'm a newbie to this whole smartphone
thing i mean i've really only been on
the scene since 2009 and in that time
we've my wife and I have broken each
shattered one screen so thank you kyle
so ladies and gentlemen my son Kyle now
so anyway as I as a saying in the in you
know for years you know both being my
wife we've shattered one screen each
both palm phones actually so um you know
what I'm going back I I made this
decision the other day I'm going back to
the holster you know I know twitter says
put the phone in your pocket it's meant
to be in your pocket I'm going back to
the holster I don't care how geeky and
stupid I look because you know what my
phone's last so I've got the s3 that
I've had since you know what October and
there's very a scratch on this thing you
know why it doesn't go in my pocket it
goes in my holster it goes right on my
belt where it should screen in yeah so
yeah anyway that'd just be so if I'm
still on the broken screen topic
ironically when this broke it was in an
otterbox and it landed on screen up hey
does the best problem okay so here's the
but here's the problem the reason why is
because the way the way glass works is
usually your phone will not crack on its
first of all but if the fall is strong
enough
for that to chip at least one small edge
any sort of fall that happens regardless
if you have it on a case will shatter
the display sadly that's a no the straw
that broke the camel's back it's more
prone to shatter there where there's a
microscopic even invisible scratch so if
you compare the the today's glasses with
sapphire glass and if you take this
theory sapphire is unscramble so the
tension there will not be released it is
still brittle but there's a possibility
that it will not shatter as quickly as
gorilla glass which gets tiny little
microscopic little scratches where we
retention just pops and releases and
there it's just broken yeah yeah oh well
that's that's the theory no well good
Adam any final thoughts or final
questions to our invitee Jeremy on I
