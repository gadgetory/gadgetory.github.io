your boyband microphone okay as much as
I really want to I want you rather say
this is everybody say hey take note
everybody and know not just about this
microphone that is on my face I am using
this for the podcast right now so before
you get into the comment sections down
below you can go in and tell me what you
think but we're talking about taking
note of the brand new Samsung device the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is officially here
and we do talk about it on the majority
of this podcast where you can also see
video footage being taken on the note 9
itself we also take out the S Pen and
double click on that button in order to
make that recording happen so if you're
curious as to what the video quality is
like on there this might be one good
example for you on top of that however
we do talk a little bit about Android Pi
and wonder if it is just sweet enough
for us for our future pixel and other
Android devices it's Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and welcome to
the weekly a special video podcast here
on location in David Cogan's own
apartment so if you're wondering how the
unlocker lives well we got a glimpse
into it today thank you so much for
tuning in and welcome to the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers well I think I think the
best I think the best way to even get
started is just saying thank you to that
guy to this guy right here yeah number
one having a great spot for us to do the
learning us his apartment it is at 200
the secret location we're at was the 201
well I was the idiot that arrows to like
buzz Marcy Avenue and then going down
south
I love this area more time I've so hey I
need to spend more time and I live here
like cuz I'm traveling all time like for
everything but like it's like all people
our age it's nobody that has a real job
what I mean but I was like like they're
like creatives they all work in a coffee
shop they're all graphic designers
whatever else you should come hang out
no want to come do you go to Smorgasburg
a lot we're here know so s'mores berries
like I take your friends to that once a
while but like it's honestly super
overpriced and it's delicious though a
lot of those places actually you could
they're around here so if you just go to
them on normal time they're actually
cheaper than when you go to Smorgasburg
my favorite place there's like a premium
just for being at Smorgasburg which is
kaizen pies pies it's great and that's
not expensive there it's more sense of
you know what they sell yeah you know
what that's actually it that's gonna be
the weirdest but also like perfect segue
that's gonna be 30 no way where's PP 260
so that's like I can't count way down
it's down there yeah it's not so I've
been so busy with all this other stuff I
haven't time what have you done I did I
played with them for like a little bit
so how do you feel about where it's
going
I like it yeah although again I didn't
play with very much and my my first vid
only thing my video are the gestures in
it
Oh things beta one that's why you like
it yeah tell me more I just I just can't
stand full screen gestures like I used
the iPhone for a hot minute and I just
could not stand using that phone oh but
see I got used to that pretty quick with
the iPhone that's the thing I got used
to it but doesn't mean I liked it
no I mean I don't know I don't know I
don't think it bothered me I don't think
I can get used to it I think it's I
don't really I don't know all of my
friends who were trying what is he doing
yes no I don't mind that I like that my
OCD likes to swipe things away like that
it's great I don't know what I have to
blur there whatever there's one thing
alright there's one thing that I like
about the fullscreen gestures and it's
just a quick way like quick changing
between apps is that quick swipe on the
bottom ok I can see that being a few
pulls in between 1 or 2 which is very
common for me I think for most people
probably yeah and you go pull one button
on there and tell me to flick it like
that's pretty much that's pretty much
all ever do it it means well um but is
there is there no way and again I
haven't gotten to use it very much is
there no way to put them back ok there's
speculation I imagine that there's gotta
be an option okay so okay on on Android
Pi on the pixel - at least right now
yeah you go - it's not the gestures if
you install it on pixel - you go into
system and then you go to gestures then
you turn it on yeah there's speculation
that upcoming Google upcoming Android PI
devices are just gonna have that at
default with no option to change it got
it and then I'll give quite a record to
do android police broke that story but
they also got a clarification yeah I was
disord then came back with a
clarification and said I never said that
it was going to be like the only but
default probably default make sense to
me because that's the way you get people
to try something new
yeah as you just force them to I mean
what if they give the OP to turn off I'm
ok with that I don't care I've had a
very extreme I think they will do that
because I at least for the first
iterations they'll give it a couple of
maintenance reviews but somebody gets
Android thigh it'll be baked in but till
then it's gonna be alright I think oh my
god if it's not Android team time I'm
East Coast man sorry no this is I got
nothing alright so it's like two freakin
wafer there's like glued together with
chocolate and you bite one end you bite
the other end it's a coffee straw
and it softens everything in the middle
okay what's have to have you have they
starting to show up in the US now you go
to you know like any superstore Wegmans
for me and like I go there and see the
British Isles like oh wow Wegmans wide
Wegmans it man based out of Rochester
Rochester home of the trash plates which
I love no-good garbage plate I'm dating
well my only my only problem with the
reason why I have a problem with the
whole full screen jesters thing is
because it's going to radically change
what we expect out of not forked by
skinned versions of Android because this
is a system-level thing where you're
going to have that level of navigation
so fundamentally the way people
understand their Samsung's to work the
way then they understand their LG's
toward it's gonna be different
I've been hearing that oneplus has been
executing that Pro Tok in terms of
people being able to live with it on the
oneplus X 6 has that built in it's
almost identical isn't it it's the rest
of the package really helps out that but
you know what I think I mean even if
it's a system level thing I think it's
probably gonna well unless you you and
the sources you're talking about have
something better to say but like it'll
Samsung will still be able to skin it
however they want if they want to leave
buttons like they still put the buttons
backwards for them they've been putting
a backwards forever change on the notes
don't you say yeah the first thing I do
too is I put the back with the back
button on the left where it belongs
yeah but like this is all I'm saying
like there's nothing stopping them from
doing that I would imagine like why
wouldn't they be a person there are
certain things that PI is bringing to
the table that I'm so looking forward to
like the smart rotate for so simple so
bones have had gyroscopes forever yeah I
think you just need to you don't have to
freaking pull down the notification
shade anymore just right there yeah how
did you feel about the name PI yeah I
kiss mom's gonna be peppermint cuz the
colors when they first showed them like
that teaser was like pink and red it
looks weird he looked like a cane oh
yeah we're like a candy cane peppermints
what I
show it off this reminds but now
apparently it's PI by the way what do
you want to see hold on one sec I'm
showing off this and then I'll be going
away I wanted to go hey hey I wanted to
go into the system settings on this
thing I am assuming that marki was right
because it was just a little too easy
are we live yes we're talking about PI
okay we're talking about right now
without pi PI is here okay I was really
I was really disappointed in the Easter
Egg for Android pi I think I've seen it
cuz I kept going like this and holding
and all that nothing was happening
okay it's a pinch that's kind of cool so
it's kind of psychedelic it's very that
is a rare bottle of whiskey that it's
hard to find oh no no I'm so happy to
find it finally I'm telling you you're
gonna like so I'm gonna destroy it on
something to destroy it on the rocks
Oh neat please he's gonna make fun of me
I'm sorry Josh I need your taking a sip
of mine just so you can have we're not
gonna lose our friendship over that okay
so how do you feel about my uh my boy
then let him have it
yeah very swear he's gonna get up and do
dance moves and Brandon was calling me
fancy look at this and I welcome you
like this hood too we were talking about
get more on that later
if parking is just the way it was right
now of course I'm gonna like yeah that's
impressive I really hope you have of our
keys I'm hoping there was no parking no
sorry
the s-pen by the way has low-energy
Bluetooth that allows you to the phone
turning off your musics is a raunchy
song - this case should be for you man
like seriously but I don't like the case
in general well I'm gonna use it in the
reviews of their why did I press play is
there a play button no if you if that
controls media if you push that button
when music is up it'll turn on and off
oh ok as demonstrated accidentally by
Josh we talked about Android PI for a
little bit but I did want to get your
thoughts on it
I am never gonna like full screen
gestures so this might be problem with
it so I guess and I'm I I can't quote
anybody on this but I heard of the
philosophy for the gestures was to not
make it difficult for people to switch
to Android just the whole concept of
they come from another operating system
where there's either just one button
which you see there's just one button
now or now there's gesture so they're
giving you a little of both I can't
quote anybody on this so I just wish to
the gestures would have been the same
we're here if you swipe up what you get
is the multitasking pane yeah pretty
much I do like this like quick switching
back that's the one thing I like which
is which is something that I love from
the iPhone 10 by the way I love that B
swipe left or right yeah to move from
one app today when I use the iPhone 10 I
like for me that is just so logical just
so practical but then I'm having a hard
time remembering that you have to press
this and not swipe up to go home you
know it's it's I've only been using it
for two days yeah I was really concerned
at the beginning by the way this is a
pixel to excel and this is second batch
so this is not the one with the bad
screen but I have been noticing that the
brightness automatic brightness is
taking the screen all the way to the top
so like on the first day battery life
was excruciating ly bad but then we have
AI aka machine learning because that's
the correct name and now even you like
I've had great battery life on the
second two days
so it was just like the first day was
really bad and then following up it was
great so I don't know I gestures are a
thing like I don't like the gestures on
the 1 plus 6 for example because there
is no gesture for the Google assistant
and I actually use it constantly what's
the gesture for Google assistant if
you're doing this you still have the
squeeze the phone and you get it yeah
whereas on the 1 plus 6 you have 0
options it's only call on the Google
assistant okay which is trash if you're
in the city it's just not gonna you know
okay that makes sense it's gonna be the
worse okay so it's literally the one
button that you flick I'm always gonna
call it that like yeah because that's
all it really is flicking one thing I
guess I'm a little annoyed at the
minimalism companies bring with the
exception of LG where it's no button for
the assistant yeah I prefer a button
over the squeeze gesture because I'm
constantly squeezing the phone
accidentally yeah you know so it's yeah
I have a strong grip okay that's fine
even when even when I'm taking the phone
out of my pocket sometimes it triggers
and it's kind of annoying when that
happens yeah but I totally get you there
yeah top tip if you do get the note 9
and you have the S Pen which is
Bluetooth enabled you hold the button to
go straight to the camera I already have
it framed up we just lock the focus on
there you go
and then it's a double tap to record I
have it on silent actually you would
normally hear like a boom so the note 9
this is the story for me like this is
all that I really loved the most about
it yeah for the first time ever yeah I
like Alex you know my first Galaxy Note
was the note 3 okay and my favorite note
this I'm still on verdicts out on this
though
but my favorite note will always be the
floor huh cuz that that was my least
favorite note what well I had the Note
edge not the note 4 and it was buggy it
felt great in the hand though my
favorite note would always be because he
hasn't melted on my side
my favorite no will always be the note 3
because that was the first time where
they they made the tip feel like a
sharpie on the screen Oh true so my I
had my first one was - no - I love the
no.3 because then acid the Snapdragon
800 we had great battery life for me it
was the best of all and it just it felt
like a sharpie the software was crap
back then back then it was the word
Samsung software up until up until the
7th mr7 series it got a lot better
ok much otherwise I would have
immediately ripped it off and put on a
custom ROM and what was your favorite I
don't know honestly I I know you never
used the new I used a bunch of notes I
can't remember which ones though cuz I
um and I again I also like loaded custom
roms on them all the time back then um
so to speak of the software would be
very different than what you're talking
about but I like these new ones like the
no date the note 9 like I mean I really
like this note already I just I just
design-wise like I don't know I think
this is not a controversial statement
but like I actually until the crap
happened yeah I had no issues with my
note 7 by the way and in my case no
sadly I made the mistake of well let's
not call it a mistake because then
people will cause out in the comments
wasn't that box oh so here's the thing I
know the thing is if you remember I was
literally the first person to unbox it I
will not reveal the source of how I got
my phone there I just loved that it was
like our first-ever viral video was that
not the unboxing but like the 24 hours
video where I went through all the
features that it had so I really liked
the note 7 because it was the to go from
the note 7 to the node 8 was like a huge
contrast size-wise yeah like the node 8
was it still is I consider just too
uncomfortable it was you know I in my
after the buzz video I call it literally
this reminds me of a muscle car it's
bragging rights it's a beautiful piece
of machinery but the problem is you
won't be able to drive it at its speed
you won't be able to take advantage of
it and it's just too large for a sports
car
and so that was a thing like for me it
was just so cumbersome to use the no
date and it's no BS like I literally
tore a pair of jeans just because like
just the design of it you just been
working your quads Abdul much and the
oddity is this the note 9 is literally
the same size of the notate what is
which I'm actually happy about because
the note I like the size of this phone
well the note 8 is the limit I also have
some quads than use so honestly which I
have here yeah is almost the same size
it's just what makes it different is the
curves I feel that it's a more
comfortable phone to handle and I love
that leather case by the way this is
nice and all and there's a card slot I
know yeah the the note 7 to me was ok 7
seems to be the the magic number for a
lot of these companies cuz if you ask me
the most solid phones the note the most
solid phones in a lot of different lines
are 7 like right now we have the g7 and
everyone agrees it's a pretty solid
device it's great on the iPhone 7 is
widely regarded as a great phone through
and through and to me Samsung's best
phone ever is the S I agree with you but
the smaller s7 to me was the most
accessible it was the most widely easily
used and it was solid I take the SAT
over there
we all disagree if I would have to say
what has been my favorite Samsung Galaxy
ever it would be the s9 + okay okay
because I feel that's more in line with
what I think they worked on are the
newer ones so wow I like like because
for me what killed it was literally the
placement of the fingerprint scanner I
have large hands and it was always that
pain and then the iris scanner that
whole intelligent scan was never really
what I would call reliable it takes a
while right and so I have like mine
never works it for like the this has
been the first phone to have good
battery life for me the first galaxy
yeah
like every other galaxy which one this
so obviously I'm by the way for
everybody responding to my Instagram Q&amp;amp;A
and all your questions about battery
life maybe just let me use the phone for
24 hours and I saw you - how's the
battery right now seems good I had an
average there were I would say like 150
questions I would say that at least 80
of those were how's the battery okay
this is what I this is what a note is
about and for this what I said - in your
video was it like this is the first time
it was another first time it's last year
we didn't get a note with a proper sized
battery for reasons that we all know
right yes because of the battery issues
they had this time we did all right this
is like a proper so like I'm curious
about it - like I'm of course I'd be
doing a battery test but as I was saying
you're like gosh it's the biggest
question is we've we've already if you
guys have not watched josh's video about
asking every all of us in 20 seconds
what we think about the the note 9
please do so Mike dude how do you do
those transitions from one first is like
the coolest thing plug definitely go
watch it what's funny is I should use
that more often but it just it just felt
like the 20 every 20 seconds video has
those winds just became that's why I do
it digitally like you do it with the in
camera yeah you do yeah so it's the it's
the coolest thing but what I said in
that video is I've used the Galaxy s8
active I've used an s7 active we're not
we're used to four thousand milliamp
hours right in galaxies and the problem
is the software like in the case of the
no date I could leave the phone and in
the SAS eight active which I use for
running every now and then I will leave
it on the table without any use and it
will lose twenty percent of battery just
during the morning no reason of what so
right right just that it's it's
connecting to the network yes I don't
know what it's doing but it's yeah I had
it on 4k sixty so it stopped I think it
was what's the limit the 10-minute limit
let me try no way is it Tim it's five
five minutes at least less
allow me to change yeah it's review
coverage anyways yeah you're that way
you get a you get an idea of what the
video is like on this try super slow-mo
right now I'm just gonna go to food
prepared this is the this is by far my
favorite thing ever
cuz honestly I've had a lot of Chinese
phones where they have the remotes and
the other shudders Oh PO did it all
remember I still have that in three by
the way
really I do oh man what's it like mint
condition I have it here if you want it
maybe oh well if you have the remote
with it - yeah oh great I'll do it could
be like a flashback huh no do you want
to do a throwback go forever and I would
love to by all means
it's in mint condition you see the thing
is back then because it is an item that
is uh so obviously an accessory we kind
of didn't paid that much mind no you
know like it's cool that you can double
tap it and then the camera flips over
you get the the motor and all that but
this this is like this is the level of
genius that we give tech companies
credit for hmm and I'm just so happy
that they did it with this but you know
I call it genius that is the same size S
Pen as the last like last year is pretty
much yeah I don't notice any differences
in size I want people to be able to buy
this pen with their note eights and get
the same features I don't know if that
would be possible because it's
technically that would be a problem is
wrong yeah I would I would love to do
that video but technically I think it's
it is yeah we need some software a curry
to do it aren't you the right person for
that yeah I'm yes Samsung definitely is
gonna block that as much as a humanly
can I guess it's one of the features
that they want for you to upgrade to
that and you know the other thing is
like okay this button makes me not hate
that button the button oh my god things
I don't like about this phone have you
noticed the power button was
was moved up a little bit ya know in the
fingerprint I don't know where in that
closet is okay oh you know you and it
makes sense actually you're right
because the Bigsby button I think is
where used to be yeah used to be level
with that yeah yeah and so why did they
make it alright that's it is just it's
just slightly uncomfortable not a good
reason because like the iPhone 8 plus
and iPhone 7 plus are like I'm like dear
Jonathan Ive I know your hands aren't
bigger than mine dude like like they're
you did not need to just blow up the
iPhone 7 could you please just move the
button to a logical position please yeah
I agree and I think sympathizes just a
little further down you know what they
what they should have done then is you
should be able to switch the power and
Bixby buttons yeah that would be cool
now is I constantly push this big P
button because it is right where my
thumb goes which obviously they plan but
then you don't but like I want fault to
uh stupid big B's there every time I
open my phone well thing is already
ready to do things so I don't need him
to do hi David waking the device don't
you default to the hard pressing the
home button
I do so give me your give me your day
one impressions right now let me face
before beauty
true no arguments no I like it a lot I
think I mean but it has the same things
that I liked about the s night plus in
the s9 like it's the design like some
that attention to detail I think this is
more of a refined product right compared
to say like the note 7 being like a big
change you know like this is this is
them kind of like honing in on what
makes this phone good and like putting
no finger for instance you're in the
right place kind of hide it is yeah it
is I mean because it's a very tall phone
yeah if we're honest and the same thing
for the power button I think is that
that's also kind of weird but like
whatever it's cool I would like to see
the battery life but so far it's been
doing pretty well I love this little
like that you don't have this by
lopen I am sorry I am going to talk to
our contacts so hard to get a black
phone with the yellow wait a second so I
noticed you know who as I was uh Ricky
yeah Ricky doesn't like Ricky has
everybody from the year of the black pen
know yes but everybody from the euros
guy from the European team they all
receive black units okay like they thank
you Samsung Samsung for giving us the
blue finally giving us I I wouldn't have
cared if they gave me the lab even
lavender silver silver I would have
knocked oh my god that copper I want the
cars no it's I don't think it's here in
the US yet you know the announced it is
one of the colors but I don't think it's
it's the same thing it's only this one
has the yellow one but for me that was
my favorite color honestly what the
copper yeah it was one again I love that
this has a different color like it's
that it's that attention detail that
refinement thing I'm talking about like
they did something fun with the design
because they know that the rest of this
is all right it's just easier for you to
find like like yeah you'll never lose it
how do you call those a little notebooks
molesky how do you pronounce most small
skin I've heard most kind also sure okay
but I've seen I've seen them in that
sort of like copper color but I've never
seen one in this color or stuff like
that
oh those yeah I'm sure yeah like for me
my first impression for this phone is I
really like it I wish I could use it
without a case because this is too large
to be used with a case sounds like
sounds like you need a pops I never know
that's the last thing you need I know
it's ridiculous looks like if it came
from Bali or something like where'd you
get this it's called a chocolate called
a chakra my friend
alright hello bugs on the quick s-pen
note that Charlie don't just jump in on
um they did say that you can buy s-pen
separately so if I if I were to get a
black phone it's very possible I can get
the only thing is how do you pair them
that's what I was saying that's the
question that also makes me wonder about
the whole know date well last night when
I was with you
can the question is how yeah right last
night when we were at 8:37 would David
Emmel I we we swapped pens and tried to
do the Bluetooth function yeah but it
just I was like when your own pen is
that I when I was at the other side of
the balcony and I press the button and
his phone went off and it was kinda
funny yeah you have 30 30 feet yeah that
is significant yeah so I don't know what
the pairing process is we thought it
would be like the switch it's holding
down on the button putting it in like
there's because you know what I've
noticed actually when this phone first
if you turn on airplane mode and you
turn back off there's a little pen
symbol that shows up in the status bar
yeah blinks for a little bit and then
disappears as if like it's pairing or
connecting back to the pen huh so
there's it's connected via bluetooth
like any other Bluetooth accessory they
just so I managed it's gonna be wet
apparent like there has to be I don't
know if our contacts will be able to
swap my unit but if anything I'll
probably skin the hell out of this to
make it black and then by the yellow
think it's a cool I think Ricky wanted
the lavender one what is the thing I you
could swap Ricky you would totally swap
that I'm happy to have this because with
the s9 Plus this is the listen it's just
the reason why I don't care what color
it is so long as it's not a dollar yeah
is like I totally don't mind after the
review period the problem is trying to
film yeah that huge black yeah it's just
like trying to film on the mirror and
like for example in the case of the
pixel there's no problem because it's
matte yeah well you know what else
Ricky's I saw his and we actually
compared the back of our phones ours
actually has like a little diffusion to
it like if you look at your reflection
in it this is weird I know but whatever
if you look at your reflection video
problems
you leave your reflection in the back of
the phone it's actually like you'll see
like a couple of different versions of
yourself it's like kind of like yeah a
couple of images like kind of mesh
together if you leave the black one it's
straight up a mirror like you just see
yourself clear again for the same as you
I'm like oh please
cool yeah yeah I would I would take the
copper color any day for me that was my
favorite I also like that it's different
it's it's not a color that a lot of
phones come now only the may 10 program
right yeah yeah did either of you not
give your day one impressions it wasn't
you
on me I think I did it already go yeah
um I like it
I I have fallen in love with devices
like the 1 plus 6 it's the first ever
one Plus that I say wow I love that
phone I in Barren like watch all my
reviews like in the past I would always
be like for the price yeah buy it right
now you're like no no it's just
oh my god it's such a good phone and in
that red color with colors today by that
red color is sick so Wow for me to stop
using that phone is just it's really
difficult but I do have been a note user
like for years my android phone was
always a note yeah but I was just so
disappointed on cases like the note 5
where the battery life was just terrible
man and so if they figure out the
battery I could totally give it a second
shot I will be doing a battery test very
soon good good good yeah like for me
that said like what I care about mostly
in phones is definitely camera which we
have here yeah and was definitely
definitely battery life man I mean I I
really like I I don't know if it's
called if what I have is anxiety or what
is it but I do suffer battery and
anxiety yeah like for me most people do
if we're honest like for me once I hit
once the phone hits 50% I'm already like
crap yeah shoot I need to find an outlet
I'm not gonna lie I'm carrying a
backpack just because it's a battery
pack though for me those things are
annoying if I can avoid that hmm that'll
be my phone yeah
and it's funny cuz like I think that's
the level we're at right now like a lot
of phones have power they have this they
have that it's the simple things that
now we're more focused on like I just
want the damn thing to last and I would
like you know a good camera they're
still they're still Achilles heels
though because I've been using this as
my vlogging Camel day mm-hmm I think I'm
at like 30% right now battery yeah okay
I'll do a screen on time looking at it
after this but yeah there's some obvious
things that will bog it down yeah but
like most people are not vlogging all
day on it yeah and in
in 4k 60x identity oh using the slow-mo
even or the air like that so if you
think about it you've got your s9 plus
you could use that instead actually
don't have one I'm happy to have a
Samsung device again I think that's my
number one thing right you don't have it
anymore not after you remind me yeah
I've been on the 1 plus 6 and my pixel
pixel was my the one that I was allowed
to keep I was happy to have the pixel
because that thing has been great what
I'm really looking forward to how that's
going to stack up to this so she won't
the remote the remote school but this is
the same module as the s9 + yeah pretty
much
Jenica yeah it is and with that in mind
the s9 plus it does a great job with the
vlog yeah
all I need is a moment case personally
yeah thanks I'm sure will come soon oh
yeah we met the moment guys at unpacked
and I wish I hit them up after really a
couple of them were there yeah and I
talked to them again to my card and
thank you yeah I talked to them in a
while and what's funny is like they're
so they're so in the current generation
of like like business acumen because
they're like oh yeah we have cards but
here's our Twitter handles I do
Liam like but I have a car yeah I mean
it's nice like this but I still used
that I am terrible at it no I was trying
to bring them I grab I put them in my
wallet and then I remember three months
down the road that they're there see I
have I have a scan that is so bad I have
a scan snap and I'm making it a habit
that whenever there's something in my
wallet it has to be scanned so no matter
what it is that habit but in any case
they they are making the case for of the
note 9 and they did invite me to come
and shoot with them during sunset last
night but there's no time to go I think
they had a prototype case I know we got
to a 37 a bit late by the way is anybody
who doesn't know Samsung 87 is their
flagship store here it is cool you
should go do that moonwalk thing I still
haven't done it but it was funny
it looks like what's the best way to put
it cuz don't they have did you stop the
bun GVR yeah yeah that's what it is is
that what you're talking about okay yeah
yeah Jules did it do you get immersed
enough in the VR with that or so Adams
Alain got all rigged up like him straps
everywhere across his body and it was
and he added the suit too he had the
helmet with the gear VR and it was last
nine plus and then he was led on to
another rig which they use I think at
the NASA facilities there's something
like that but because of the atrium
which is three stories high they're able
to take the most advantage of that space
take the moat and the pulleys are all
the way up there and I don't know I felt
like he was able to because has the most
impressive airspace move like he could
be on Space Jam
okay I'm gonna invite him do so this
weekend he's gonna come down this
weekend nice NATO well I think a good
way of capping the last 5-10 minutes and
this would be I made it I made a point
in a number of people's round up videos
that and I think I was it was probably
one of you guys I put this idea in my
head this is the phone that is meant to
tide us over until the as ten simply put
like there are some great things that
they put into it obviously they put some
thought into it but this is definitely
not gonna be the evolutionary phone that
the iPhone 10 was which is which is an
easy thing to say but what are you
looking forward to then in an s10 in the
next iteration or anything like that
because if this is gonna be what we have
for now then what does I mean for our
next one better camera what would you
add to that camera though better so
David David we were in Barcelona with
when the s9 when the s9 was long
and for it was like really impressive
when when he when you pointed out how it
did a terrible job with moving subjects
yeah so the biggest problem is we're
making this drop in aperture drop in
aperture that's not necessarily a great
a great thing like for me I still
consider the camera on the note 5 and
the s6 to be the best where F 1.8 was
like that sweet spot where you didn't
get too many highlights in low-light
like it didn't blow up the highlights
and and just it provides a visually
pleasing photo up until you throw it
into a computer and you notice that just
the whites are just too white things
like that and so I remember that I would
I would even be able to capture the
Crescent Moon on in the case of the note
5 the problem was that it was slow and
also if anything I would continue doing
like for example will always doing
always not trying to fight the whole
aperture fight they're not trying to do
that they're just trying to work on just
blending their software with their
hardware and just they want a good photo
and it's not bragging rights over what
aperture there is so for me Samsung has
nailed a ton of essentials when it comes
to photography but definitely moving
subjects in low-light well but that's a
software thing too right like they could
have that high aperture or fast aperture
but then they need to adjust the ISO and
like all the other components exactly
it's a photo and it just doesn't it
doesn't work that well when things start
moving because it's not the it puts the
shutter speed to slow it is and so
that's what causes the blur but you know
some a better version of that I don't I
don't mind the low aperture or fast
aperture but um but like the software
itself need to take a better photo you
know I mean like it's ain't it's like
with pixel right like doesn't have the
I'm sure but the software is amazing
yeah doesn't matter like it always takes
it could vote exactly and like into your
point of like Huawei that night mode is
incredible and I'm surprised that nobody
has done that yet knowing that that
exists because when I did a video on it
it was just like just I just explained
night mode and like how it works and
like the sensor or size and that's
nothing to the size of the sensor in the
the p20 Pro versus like all these are
the photos Mike is insane like yeah
their software's not great but they're
being kept like up by their hardware and
that night
oh yeah is that it software I do agree
like there's plenty look forward to is
what I think I'm saying it's like camera
wise I just can't like I don't have an
image in my
head of what that would look like you
know because I'm hoping that it looks
radically different like for me it's you
mean like design-wise oh just just just
in that particular sense yes but I mean
wow he's really tabbed as far as camera
goes to your point well I always really
tapped into what I think should be the
future of smart phone photography
because what all of the companies have
been doing up until this point is trying
to emulate a real camera using what bits
they have yeah one in when it's on the
flip side Huawei is like oh well we have
like a billion sensors and a phone let's
use them all to the advantage I think
that was smart we're just one larger
simply get us closer to the proper
sensor size from that camera a mixture
of that would be that would be M reto
saying yeah I mean obviously expensive
and it could take a while but like
whatever like these cameras are cheaper
than these phones some of them right
look we're out there they're comparable
they're saying that have larger sensor
sizes so the sensor can't be that
excitin oh I don't know anything about
manufacturing of phones but like I'm
just assuming that like it can't be that
hard to do for me it would be well we
have that Sony 48 megapixel sensor it
now exists obviously Samsung is one of
the biggest customers yep obviously
Samsung is obviously gonna have a large
hurdle because obviously Apple pretty
much grabs all the supply that Sony
produces pretty much which LG all you
know LG also deals with the same problem
and so when Samsung ends up being able
to grab anything like they'd have to end
up making a blend between some phones
have their ISO cell sensor others have
their the Sony sensor you can't really
tell the difference now where did that
go that term ISO so yeah that's the
first time I've heard in years yeah but
it's there no it's there like in in the
in the case of the s7 it was there yeah
he was highly mentioned in the case of
the 8 side oh I don't remember honestly
but the again the technology is gonna be
there with that 48 megapixel camera
right let's I have really hoping those
pixels please I am really hoping because
ok one of the things that we've learned
and I think this trip that we did in the
this euro trip which is awesome that we
were all there was honestly just the
advantage just the advantage of a larger
sensor like you were pointing out the
shallow depth-of-field you really do not
know okay you don't need a secondary
sensor yeah so because we're seeing this
from the
so where the rumors are that it's just
gonna be one sensor I'm honestly
wondering if that's what Google's gonna
do if it's that they're gonna pull in
that 48 megapixel sensor oh wait hi oh
yeah and if it's gonna be that they're
gonna pull in that 48 megapixel sensor
and because of that they already get
natural bokeh from the camera yeah they
won't need any software gimmicks or
anything like that well we got our food
some of it ooh okay we're not gonna lose
our friendship I'm not gonna make you
sound good so your name Jelani good nice
so this is the Galaxy Note 9 okay what
do you think straight up the best thing
yes oh the phone well I have an iPhone 7
plus I hope it's large I'll tell you
right now I hate the iPhone 7 plus and
things the worst iPhone to ever come out
I've had so many issues the worst okay
with ATT I thought yeah it was it was
the the service is bad the battery life
is bad my microphones have crashed out
so I've literally got seven this is my
seventh replacement of the same phone so
yeah but I'm an apple person but no I I
do enjoy this the Samsung phones that I
think their build quality is really good
this phone feels nice and the screen
the best I think yeah they are as far as
like the features I was seeing that they
like upgraded bigsby or whatever because
they have the new the new speaker or
whatever but I like the phone
I think big suite has a lot to learn I
think that's the problem what makes me
is that you see how the speaker looked
yeah it looks it's pretty big it looks
big I don't know a lien man I think
Bixby has a lot to learn I think big
speech needs to be a little smarter but
I think that like I kind of like how
Samsung's like still pushing it there oh
yeah we're gonna give up on it because I
think competi competition is good I
think series horrible I think Google
assistants great so yeah this is the
best honestly but I just hate that that
thing has legs man yeah it's the dumbest
looking speaks have you seen any like
old like really old sixties or seventies
I don't know if it's Braun or what
company which is leader Rams like he is
one of the most famous designers ever I
but I'm this is just me talking BS I'm
not exactly sure but it mimics like this
blend of the past and the future I agree
with the bottom is the past the top is
the future mm-hm and then it looks like
the movie alien man like the video
montage yeah they used to announce it
was so epic and then once the camera
panned down and those legs appeared I
was like ya know it's like this tall so
it's made to sit on the floor and you
can maybe look on that table no dude
that thing is large like it was shocking
I don't know if it's real or not I don't
think a company can lie about that they
had 160 of these yes at the event and
like we were literally sitting in like
it sounded good it sounded really good
you know what the one they played the
the one that was in that little demo
area yeah it sounded I hate to say this
because I like bass but it sounded bass
heavy honestly really okay so the whole
thing is like from what I saw is the
design is weird it looks like it
supposed to be like you're literally a
furniture piece add it to your Leo what
version I think like they they want
knock out like the competition as far as
like Samsung's known the kind of like oh
this is what people are doing what we're
gonna try to do it better Harman Kardon
man it wonderful sound quality and like
that's what I'm saying they're focused
on Bigsby and things like that and so I
think it's smart that they're doing that
yeah but also I you know I know what
Samsung they're first generation of
stuff isn't always the best but then as
they upgrade it it kind of gets better
sure because like even with this phone
it's the same design since the 7 but it
doesn't explode this time and has better
features so I think like oh yeah no
problem yeah I I think the phone is sick
though I saw that with the announcement
it looks like I like when phone
manufacturers like refine their products
versus like just like putting out some
so much new stuff
oh sure that doesn't necessarily make
sense sometime yeah exactly and I think
it's like one of the things where like
the consumers the average consumers
people like don't care about necessarily
they don't always get the newest the
latest and greatest that usually you're
just like I want a phone that works well
and looks nice okay okay so let me ask
you mmm-hmm but this has to be like you
know assume you're not sitting here with
us okay what would you change from that
phone for you to be willing to buy it it
could be anything for the Samsung phones
yeah I'll tell you the main issue I have
a samsung phones is I don't like was it
TouchWiz or there you just call it
Samsung yeah I don't I don't like it I I
wish that I could just like it comes
pre-installed with like just like
straight Android like or you can choose
yeah I don't I don't like that I don't
like how Samsung has a lot of like
carrier bloatware and stuff like that on
their phones the main thing the only
thing that keeps me on iPhone and all I
know honesty is I'm in the ecosystem
yeah and then also I do a good job I
really like iMessage so if you know what
a lot of people just say that I messaged
weren't you saying that one time
honestly no like for me it's not
iMessage it's just for me like I meet a
macbook pro for video and i've all the
ecosystem is and i've never experienced
that because i've never had more than
one Apple product at one time but that's
the problem the problem is that I
very early and it was a mistake because
the moment I you know we filmed a lot of
b-roll using an iPhone 10 plus yeah an
iPhone 10 yesterday and oh my god like
it's like brandon was like but why do
you like using that Mac and I'm like let
me show you and so I just opened my
MacBook Pro we filmed a lot of b-roll
with the phone simply bap bap bap air
drop boom they're in the computer
already he's like what i'm sorry thats
it yeah i can just go straight through
and edit my that's it you know and so
it's it's those things and then when you
grab Final Cut I'm like listen for all
the video editing purists I do
understand Premiere Pro is a far more
complete product the thing about it is
we're youtubers we're not Francis Ford
Coppola so here's the thing like Final
Cut is so practical yeah so simple like
I learned how to use video editing
software through Final Cut then when I
was 18 I actually got a job at Apple I
worked at the Apple Store and their
software for free so I've had Final Cut
for free for the last eight years ago
now and that's the pin I paid for it
once mm-hmm 30 bucks yeah but I think
it's 50 because I have the Creative
Suite of everything okay yeah because of
you you do the 30 if it's I think two
apps yeah and you can only pick two
yeah and I can't just pick two abs come
on
so going back to your question what
would I change about that phone what
would I improve for the s10 okay what do
I like about the iPhone 10 it's
literally the fact that you have a large
phone on a small form-factor you know
showing it to Jules the other day where
it was like I can actually use the
iPhone 10 with one hand and my biggest
problem with the s9 + why do I grab the
s9 + instead of the s9 because of
battery life because it's a larger
battery it's just physics but in the
case of the iPhone 10 it's just it's a
small phone it's a large phone and a
small form-factor
if Apple the sorry if Samson can get rid
of the bezels fully come up with
something creative and you know instead
of being that because the problem
Samsung is this they have reduced the
bezels but instead of get
a smaller film they give me a larger
screen yeah I don't need a larger screen
you know let's just kept a limit on it
you know I don't need a six point four
inch display
why don't we just leave it at six inches
and give me a phone that I can handle
with great battery life that for me
which is what Huawei's been doing to a
certain degree to agree yeah yeah but
everybody has their thing because yeah
they make their bigger screen they keep
making bigger screens and an Apple keep
trying to make their phones thinner and
at the end of the day we just want a
bigger battery and we want less like
less body and like just we want
everything that everyone's doing just in
one phone so that exactly I think a
mixture of really what all of you guys
have said because I understand where
David is coming from with the key with
the camera talk because there's so much
that other competitors are doing that
really is just killing the wrong way
Samsung's doing great don't get me wrong
it's just that if you're able to blend
everything together computational with
AI well AI but using the sensors in the
phone like Huawei does I think that'd be
amazing I agree with you though I've
liked the note 8 is too tall what do you
got put a pop saw get on the phone
everyone makes fun of me but I'm like
you know what I have better use of usin
oil everybody make fun of them yeah you
can make fun me for everything I'm
wearing a my great concert yeah we were
just about like who's gonna choreograph
like who's first like the camera I
wanted to ask you do you like Samsung's
cameras there's nothing yes nothing
particularly wrong with the camera it's
just that other people have been really
going for okay so I do you know outside
of delivering food I do photography and
I don't like how Samsung's phone day I
feel like they like boost the saturation
too much and I don't like that I don't
think it looks good on the photos and
the reason why I like the iPhone photos
is even though there's better cameras I
think I think iPhones don't process it
too much where it's it's it gives me
like yeah so I can edit and make the
photos feel the way I want them to feel
just like I feel like Samsung cigs great
photos for people that don't take photos
but if I take photos and I want to like
edit and tweak them it's like I have to
like reduce saturation on a photo just
taking straight for all from the bone
interesting oh the s-pen thing is sick
oh yeah that is really sick and like all
the things you can do with it that's
super cool like my parents actually used
to be dedicated Samsung people like my
stepdad had the note and my mom had like
the s-series they actually like two
years ago switched over and got pixels
because they like straight into that
pixel to excel it's a lateral move
that's not that bad yes loves the pixel
do you really think that do you really
yeah that it's like for me like the
pixel to excel looks like no Android
phone and honestly like it doesn't even
feel like any Android phone it said for
me what things do I like about the pixel
to excel well we're about to do a video
it's a collab with somebody really
special it's gonna be really awesome
okay oh and okay this is a large phone
that is so light it's just so light like
the way it was designed I don't know
what it is the weight distribution I
don't care yeah but the problem with
going all glasses glasses heavier I'm
certain degree it I don't know what it
is but it's just this phone is like if
it was meant to be large
is that new I've dropped it a few times
it looks brand new that's why I was like
you know my my little brother has one of
these and then my parents have it and
the meemers eye switches the updates
they were like I'm tired of waiting a
year and a half to get the latest
software yeah
from Android takes forever yeah I know
it's the worst that's what my parents
left bus doors but anyways you want to
follow people follow you on it yeah yeah
yeah okay so I'm photographer you can
follow me at at Andy Rockhampton so it's
a and D Y ro ck hnp but yeah I take
photos I've shot for a lot of different
places billboard vice Wilhemina a lot of
places so nice find me on there and if
you want good barbecue and you're on
Williamsburg
Mabel's oh yeah I've heard of Mabel's
yeah
[Laughter]
yeah I still do I am super excited now
I've told you heard of this place
yeah well I'm having issues with the
Internet but I'll definitely man thank
you that was that was the coolest thing
you could have asked for
