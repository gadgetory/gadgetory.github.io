Paco calm and if you're going to be
planning a trip over the summer most
likely you'll be taking an airline and
if so you want this application called
flight stats and there are two versions
available a flights at light and the
full version which I will show you in
just a minute so let's get started okay
so here we are on flight stats and this
is the four dollar and 99 cent version
on android market there's also a free
version available which is pretty good
unfortunately it only shows up to I
think three days of flights so the great
thing about the paid version is it shows
you much more so the first thing I do is
go into flights and if you want to view
flights in your area all you do is go to
my air by airport and select an airport
I'm just going to pick the airport
that's closest to me and an airline
let's try oh I don't know Delta or
something and let's see if it loaded
Delta okay there we go and let's look
for arrivals and search now it's going
to search so we'll go down to the end
and look at n route and the cool thing
about this program is it actually shows
you a map of where the aircraft is in
the air so click here and it shows us
that the aircraft is right here and it's
traveling at 667 kilometers an hour and
also the altitude of 11,300 8 meters
bearing at 148 degrees and it shows the
longitude and latitude and how close it
is so if you are going to be picking up
someone from the airport this will be a
vital application to know exactly when
their flight will come in because
sometimes of course flights can be
delayed so you can also add your own
trip so I have a few here let's see
here's one for disneyland and it will
just load my trip so i can get all my
flight information and it says it's a
long time of course because it's about a
month away and also my hotel information
and it will also save my car information
so that's great in case you do forget or
lose your paperwork of course you always
probably have your
device with you so you can show them
your confirmation number on all that
great stuff and call ahead if you need
to so this is another Android Market
pick and the parents called flightstats
and it is there are two versions
available there's a free version which
only shows about three days of flights
and there is the paid version which is
four dollars and ninety-nine cents on
android market thanks for watching and
if any time you want to download this
program to your device just navigate
using google goggles to the image of the
QR code on the screen and snap a picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
