manufacturer in the world but can its
latest smartphone compete with other
smartphones like the one in mate galaxy
s5 or LG g3 I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is our full review of
the Xiaomi me for one last time we'd
like to thank 28 mobile for lending us
this me--for for review if you'd like a
me--for to call your own click the link
in the description below or go to 28
mobile comm or you can also browse
dozens of other devices and smartphones
to purchase throughout our time with the
me for now approaching 7 days we've
remained impressed by its design and
build quality the key feature of the
design is the stainless steel core which
has been precision machined through a
193 step process this precision is
evidenced through the machined holes for
the speaker grille on the bottom edge
and even the SIM tray which is also
steel and fits very snugly into the
frame from the front and sides this
phone is beautiful I'll be it lacking
some imagination it's been said by many
to resemble the newest iPhones and even
the Lumia icon which we won't deny
however we're not terribly fond of the
glossy plastic around back makes the
phone unreasonably slick while
contrasting the high-end steel around
the edges still we're very happy with
the me force design and we're happy that
the back plates are swappable more
designs and color options will be
available in the future xiaomi didn't
give us much to complain about on the
inside
either the me--for comes with some of
the best specifications you can find in
a high-end smartphone today a Snapdragon
801 with a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core Krait
400 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU run the show
it has three gigabytes of RAM 16 or 64
gigabytes of storage with no option to
expand and a non-removable 3080 milliamp
hour battery the primary camera on the
me 4 is a 13 megapixel sensor capable of
recording 4k video and the front camera
is an impressive 8 megapixels one of the
most notable features of the me 4
however is the display at 5 inches
diagonally with a resolution of 1080p
the IPS LCD bares of respectable density
of 441 pixels per inch colors pop quite
a bit and the black levels are
relatively deep it also has a wide
brightness range stretching from barely
visible to painful to look at
it's a gorgeous display and are only too
complaints are how warm it is in
comparison to other displays and the
side visibility which seems to taper off
at certain angles and all the me for is
built exceptionally well and we would go
as far as to say it's one of the nicest
pieces of Android hardware around today
the me--for comes running Xiaomi zone
custom version of Android me UI atop
Android 4.4.2 kitkat our unit shipped
with me UI 5 although 6 is in beta the
first thing we noticed about this
version of me UI on this Chinese model
is that it doesn't come prepackaged with
Google Play services no Google Play
Store Gmail hangouts maps etc instead
it's loaded with Xiaomi zone services
out-of-the-box we market its own theme
store and ami store app fortunately
Google Play services can be unofficially
added with minimal effort and without
rooting we did this to install the
benchmarking and test applications we
use on Android phones one of the
defining features of new UI is the lack
of an application drawer all
applications reside on the home screens
the other differentiator is a very
powerful theme engine various themes can
be purchased and downloaded in the
dedicated theme store these allow users
to greatly alter the appearance of the
phone's UI lock screens home screens
notification shades and even the
settings application the nitty-gritty
features however are the highlight of me
UI the more you dig through settings the
more things you will find a tweak there
are standard features like guest mode
and do not disturb but you can also
customize what long pressing a hardware
button will do or how the settings
toggles in the notification shade appear
as a bar at the bottom or as a dedicated
page you can also customize what the
inline buttons on headphones will do
however there's a darker side to me UI a
side that's filled with quirks bugs and
glitches we lost count of how many times
the phone completely froze and the
touchscreen quit working entirely this
usually happened but wasn't limited to
selecting a new theme pop-up
applications like Lync bubble in the
fill window and LastPass simply didn't
work and applications which required
location services regularly could not
detect our correct location as nice as
me UI is on the surface it's a hot mess
underneath to the point that it's very
frustrating to use at times on the
upshot the me--for is a monster when it
comes to performance thanks to the
Snapdragon 801 inside gaming on the
me--for has been spectacular with no
notable sluggishness or framerate jobs
it slices through normal activities with
ease scrolling is especially smooth and
launching applications happens almost
instantaneously
however some animations seem to drag out
things and makes part of the homescreen
it's fill slower than it should be this
was limited to the homescreen
but shouldn't happen on a home with this
much horsepower benchmark show about the
same thing great scores but not nearly
the highest we've ever seen
what isn't terribly impressive with a
meet for is it speaker quality
positioned along the bottom sound
emitted from the single speaker is tinny
muffled and just not that impressive the
same goes for call quality which we
won't harp on too much since this is a
Chinese model not optimized for use here
in the States
calls were loud and clear but not
remarkable in any way and speeds since
we've been limited to HSPA+ here in the
Piedmont Triad of North Carolina have
been mediocre we've averaged 6 megabits
per second down and 1 point 5 megabits
per second top without proper network
optimization we also can't give solid
battery metrics but we can say all
things considered we've been very
impressed with the battery life with a
v4 it comes with a fixed three thousand
eighty milliamp hour battery which
easily lasted us around a day and a half
of use with over 4 hours of screen on
time per charge however we found the
better usage in settings to be
unreliable after playing around 10
minutes of modern combat 5 watching some
YouTube videos of benchmarking and
browsing the web for our comparison
videos the screen on time was listed as
55 seconds the 13 megapixel camera
around back is about as average as it
gets its performance in great lighting
outdoors is passable saturation is a
little heavy side which is par for the
course and smartphone image sensing but
contrast is a little lower than we'd
like we were happy with more than a few
photos taken with them before but there
were just as many if not more that
turned out dull blurry
out-of-focus or unusable especially in
low-light the before is particularly bad
indoors and in low-light situations
images are noisy dark and under
saturated fortunately HDR mode worked
exceptionally well we shot a few HDR
photos on an overcast day and it made
the photo pop with a high contrast
without a noticeable halo effect
although it was obviously an HDR photo
and the front camera despite the higher
than normal resolution isn't all that
great sure it's better than most front
cameras and has several times the
resolution
but the images were washed out and
lifeless we found some competing
front-facing cameras to be better than
the me fours despite low resolutions so
where does that leave us
well the Xiaomi me--for is a seriously
impressive handset especially for the
price straight out of China this thing
retails for the equivalent of
approximately three hundred and
twenty-five dollars though importing it
to other countries will undoubtedly
raise the price a bit the hardware is
solid inside and out
and me UI has potential maybe me UI six
will bring much-needed stability but for
now is the software and its
idiosyncrasies that keep it from being a
full package would we recommend it if
you want exceptional hardware for cheap
and can deal with some bugs
absolutely otherwise we'd recommend
something a little more reliable and
refined like the g3 what a mate or
galaxy s5
