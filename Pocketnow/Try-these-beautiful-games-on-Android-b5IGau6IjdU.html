than we ever would have imagined just a
couple of years ago and that's evidenced
by some of the great games that have
made their way to mobile platforms I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
these are some great games you should
try out on your Android device with the
ever improving processor capabilities
and graphics a new level of gaming has
been unleashed
and naturally Android has become home to
many popular titles many of those games
provide beautiful captivating and truly
impressive graphics period much less for
a mobile device not every game has to be
an in-depth psychological first-person
shooter or RPG to be a great game and
slingshot racing is a perfect testament
to that
it's a third-person racing game that
sticks to the roots of the slot cars and
tracks we use to get as presents when we
were kids you get an overhead view of
the track and your opponents and the
controls are quite simple touch the
display when you're near turn to sling
your car around a corner and release
when you want to go straight again each
track is visually stunning and the game
itself is dangerously addictive if
you're looking for more relaxing game
check out Osmos HD the graphics are
beautiful and original and the ambient
electronica soundtrack is hypnotizing in
essence you control a tiny organism that
must absorb various types of smaller
organisms to grow larger and become the
largest in each level the levels get
progressively more difficult with the
addition of gravity and repulsors that
propel themselves away from other
organisms it's a perfect balance of
relaxing and challenging for an awesome
and unique experience World of Goo is a
totally different type of visually
stimulating game the object is to use
the living goo balls to create
structures and bridges to complete
different tasks the visualizations and
all the different levels are great but
while the graphics and goo balls
themselves may look friendly and
inviting the game can get rather
challenging a similar style game with
similar graphics but an entirely
different type of gameplay is sprinkle
you man a water cannon and try to put
out the fires before they do too much
damage while using as little water as
possible
if these leisure games don't do it for
you we recommend giving battleheart ago
this RPG realtime strategy offers
beautiful graphics and simple fun
fantasy style combat level up and unlock
different powers to take on more
powerful enemies and groups of enemies
it's both wildly addictive and fun for
more console like style game recent
Marvel titles from Gameloft are a nice
option the amazing spider-man for
example offers stunning graphics that
rival console graphics from a few years
back the gameplay itself is a little
cheesy compared to the in-depth stories
from their console counterparts but for
a pocket-sized device there's nothing to
complain about the graphics and rendered
new york city streets are beautiful and
beating up bad guys is always fun it
makes a great time-waster
Iron Man 3 is also a great looking game
but if you're more of a DC Comics fan
check out the Dark Knight Rises if
you're into more realistic style combat
give modern combat for a spin for some
of the best graphics and gameplay you
can find on a mobile OS
madfinger games has been killing it in
the mobile gaming industry for a couple
years now
first was Shadowgun which showed off the
true power of mobile gaming the graphics
were just as incredible when Shadowgun
first released as they are now
the latest title format finger is dead
trigger a first person shooter zombie
survival game that offers stunning
visuals and tons of gore if that's your
sort of thing both shadow gun and dead
trigger offer enhanced graphics and
effects on Tegra 3 powered devices for
an even more impressive experience
lastly we can't make a video about
beautiful Android games and not include
Real Racing 3 we're not particularly
fans of the freemium gameplay style
which makes you literally wait five
minutes an hour or more for car repairs
and other in-game settings but the
graphics and racing experience on Real
Racing 3 is phenomenal especially for a
mobile platform that's all we've got for
now so if we miss one of the games that
you play or a game on Android with great
graphics be sure to drop it in the
