Android and they each have a pretty
close relationship with Google but they
come from different manufacturers and
one is aimed at the mass market while
the other is aimed at the enthusiast
segmental how do they stack up let's
find out I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Google Moto X vs.
HTC one Google Play edition as some of
you might have deduced from our on-site
reporting at the Moto X announcement
yesterday in New York City we're
obviously still quite new to the phone
only a day into the review period in
fact as a result we're still gathering a
lot of data and we're not going to be
comparing these phones on all metrics
but just on the points we can even so
we've got a lot to talk about so if
you're wondering which version of the
pure Android experience is better for
you tune in for our comparison of
hardware software camera performance and
a few tests notes and follow PocketNow
at all the usual watering holes so you
don't miss our full moto x review when
it lands you don't need to get under the
hood to see the physical differences
here these phones convey completely
different intentions right out of the
box though they both feature 4.7 inch
displays Motorola's is an AMOLED panel
at 720p meaning it's brighter and more
saturated but less sharp than the ones
1080p s LCD 3 is the difference in
pixels per inch detectable it depends on
how sharp your eyes are but most people
probably won't notice the resolution
reduction on the X nor will they find
much difference in direct sunlight
performance it's what surrounds the
displays that really differs and we're
not just talking about the fact that the
Moto X will come in a bevy of
customizable colors the materials are
quite different as well with the X's
composite frame feeling soft and
substantial to the touch even brand new
it feels totally natural to just throw
this phone in a pocket with some keys
and coins because it seems like it can
take it the HTC One on the other hand
with its polycarbonate accented unibody
aluminum precision machined speaker
grills and chamfered trim work feels
almost more like a piece of jewelry it's
not that it feels fragile but it almost
feels too nice
throw around like you'd throw around the
X and it definitely doesn't have the
splash-resistant nano-coating that the X
does either the one is also much larger
in the hand thanks to its boom sound
speakers at top and bottom in fact it's
hard to believe the Moto X packs the
same size display as the one considering
how much more compact it feels Google
has done it's best to de-emphasize specs
in its marketing and literature for the
Moto X reinforcing the position that
this is a phone for the every person not
the gadget geek but that latter group is
pretty passionate about its numbers so a
quick glance at the heart of these
phones is in order the one is the more
conventional device with a quad-core
Snapdragon 600 at 1.7 gigahertz backed
up by 2 gigs of ram and 32 gigs of
non-expandable storage along with a
non-removable battery rated at 2,300
milliamp hours the X retains the non
removable battery but bumps its capacity
down to 2,200 milliamp hours and it also
offers a lower capacity 16 gigabyte
storage version alongside a 32 gig model
once again no microSD here but Moto X
buyers will receive 50 gigs of free
Google Drive storage which should help
somewhat the real difference here is in
the processing guts there's still two
gigs of ram on board but the system
architecture is built around Motorola's
x8 mobile computing system that's a
Snapdragon s4 pro at 1.7 gigahertz with
the Adreno 320 GPU linked to two
additional cores one for natural
language processing and the other for
contextual computing while the raw power
of this system or lack thereof compared
to quad-core devices like the one is
being criticized in comment sections all
across the internet but once again it's
not designed for horse power it's
designed to offer a very specific
software experience that experience runs
atop Android 4.2.2 in our demo unit the
same version found on our Google Edition
HTC One but there are some added
features specific to the Moto X that
Google will be pushing hard to consumers
we'll check them out more completely in
our full review but these features
include something called touchless
control which leverages that language
processing core to allow the Moto X to
constantly listen for a key phrase
saying okay Google now within earshot of
the X even when it's idly sitting in
standby mode triggers touchless control
that allows you to set calendar
appointments look something up on the
internet start a navigation session set
an alarm and so on there's also
Motorola's new active display which uses
the X's contextual computing core to
keep an eye on the gyro and proximity
sensors so that when you pick it up or
flip it over you'll get a quick preview
of the notifications you missed you can
then act on the notifications or dismiss
or ignore them
without ever unlocking the phone another
feature called motorola assist also
helps the phone stay in context a little
better modifying notification behavior
if it detects you're driving in a car
say or in a meeting or asleep and
Motorola Connect works with Google
Chrome to allow you to display caller ID
and send and receive text messages right
from your computer neither HTC nor
Motorola have historically been lauded
for their smart phone camera performance
HTC has recently been making a push to
change that with the four megapixel
ultra pixel camera on the one with its
optical image stabilization and superior
low-light performance but that's on the
stock HTC One the Google Play edition of
the device retains the hardware but
removes HTC's software customizations
leaving you with the vanilla Android
viewfinder that's clean but not exactly
easy or intuitive on the Moto X the
software customization starts right on
the first boot of its 10 megapixel clear
pixel camera if you want you can skip
tapping an icon and jump right into the
viewfinder with a double flick of the
wrist it's pretty awkward but it might
come in handy with more practice once
the camera is open you're given a pretty
smooth and pretty fluid UI with a
rotating disc off to the left for
controlling just a few tweakable options
for Stills and video it's simple and
other features like tap to focus and
snap and the scroll directly into the
gallery remind us a lot of Windows
Phones
shooting experience that's a good thing
in terms of the results well there hit
and miss on both of these phones in
bright sunlight or other similarly even
and bright lighting they perform fairly
well though it might take some tweaking
of the HDR settings to get the balance
you're looking for on
but even in these brightly lit samples
the Moto X is color reproduction is
pretty obviously inferior to the one the
shots come out oddly tinted the colors
substantially more muted than on the one
now motorola calls this the clear pixel
camera owing partially to the quick
exposures it can capture but if the cost
is saturation dampening like this which
doesn't seem correctable no matter what
settings we use it's not worth it that
holds true in low-light photos as well
while the one puts out plenty of noise
in its own low-light pics it's nothing
compared to the X which produces photos
heavy and artefacts and once again
subpar saturation
despite the ostensibly quick captures
the exes shots are also prone to motion
blur and lens flare if there's a closed
off camera light source it's just not a
terribly good low-light camera and
frankly without HTC's software neither
is the Google Play edition one all this
holds true in video as well with the HTC
One having a harder time keeping up with
focus but on the whole delivering richer
colors and sharper results than the dull
and sort of dead Motorola X footage this
may well be due to some overly
aggressive HDR on the Moto X and we'll
take a closer look in the full review
but as of now our vote for the superior
shooter goes to the HTC One and that
extends to its wider angle front-facing
shooter as well fortunately things pick
back up again in more conventional
testing areas using both of these
devices on AT&amp;amp;T in rural New York State
gave us the opportunity to test them on
both 3G and 4G LTE and they consistently
provide comparable if not identical
reception voice quality is similar with
excellent noise cancellation on both
units in fact the only complaint we
heard in voice testing was that
background noise from our and sounded to
quiet as though the call had been
dropped when we weren't speaking that's
despite some stiff breeze on our side
too so each of these phones can be
trusted to deliver a solid voice
experience for what it's worth we found
the Moto X the more comfortable of the
two to talk on physically thanks to its
more substantial curve to build
in terms of loud speaker audio putting
any device up against HTC's boomsound
dual front speakers usually results in a
bloodbath but not this time motorola
knows what it's doing acoustically and
when streaming music the ex delivers
clear sound that's actually
substantially louder than the one it's
not as dynamic maybe and it's around
back which is as annoying here as it
ever is but it's pretty solid
nonetheless all that brings us back to
the question of what you're looking for
with the HTC One only available at
nearly $600 unlocked from the Play Store
it's an enthusiast phone a niche product
for developers and those who want the
superior hardware of the one with the
untainted software of stock Android and
superior though lower resolution camera
the Moto X will be cheaper at $1.99 on
contract when it launches on the major
US Nationals this month and it includes
some added value as well in terms of
Google's futuristic new features and a
more rough-and-tumble but still
comfortable design so while the one may
be the more powerful device it may also
be the more limited one depending on
your mobile lifestyle as Google recently
reminded us with the X's initial
marketing material it's not always about
the specs folks we have a lot more
posted and a lot more to come on the
Moto X from Google both here on our
YouTube channel page and at
