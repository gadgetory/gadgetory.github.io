MWC it's still around and it's still not
officially released but we did get the
opportunity to go hands-on for the first
time at Aoife 2015 so we thought we'd
share the experience brief as it was I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and high
auto houston's behind the camera this is
a quick look at the Isuzu phone zoom if
you've seen the earlier rundowns there's
nothing really different here but that
doesn't make it any less impressive on
the front this may as well be a
higher-end zenfone 2 with 4 gigs of ram
up to 128 gigs of internal storage
microSD expansion and the brand-new
intel z 35 90 clocked at 2.5 gigahertz
the battery is a fairly large 3000
milliamp hours which combined with the
middle-of-the-road 1080p resolution of
the five and a half inch display should
lead a pretty solid battery life but you
know what they say zenfone in the front
zoom in the back this phone is all about
that camera which in this case is a 13
megapixel Panasonic's smart FSI sensor
with a 10 element high lens optical
stabilization laser-assisted autofocus a
dual tone flash and a special design
that allows for three times optical zoom
without the need for a protruding lens
along with the usual asou software perks
like super resolution low-light and so
on
this Hardware should make for a solid
camera experience in theory anyway
we weren't allowed to take any test
shots of our own just yet will the
camera experience be worth the bulky
build well call me a weirdo but I really
like the zooms feel in hand
it's huge camera crater shiny aluminum
trim and 185 gram mass suggests a blend
of galaxy note 2 Lumia 1020 and HTC One
m8 yeah it's a strange combination but
it sure feels like a winning one whether
the reality lives up to the feeling it
will have to wait for the full review to
find out
have you seen the new Zen watch yet
we've gotten all handsy with it so check
it out here on the tube then follow all
the coverage from Aoife 2015 from a soos
and everyone else at pocketnow.com til
next time this has been michael fisher
and Hayatou huesemann for PocketNow
thanks for watching we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
