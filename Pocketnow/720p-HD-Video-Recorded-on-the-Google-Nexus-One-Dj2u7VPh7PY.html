today my video is going to be a little
bit different you see I'm recording it
directly on my nexus one with a neat new
hack that lets you record 720p right on
the phone so there are some
prerequisites to this it's kind of
detailed and kind of technical for that
visit the article that goes along with
this video but in the meantime I'd like
to show you what 720p means on your
phone so let's go take a look at some
stuff the first thing I'd like to show
you is a rose now regular video recorder
them a nexus one is a little bit blurry
but pretty good for a phone but at 720p
you get a lot more detail just a lot
more resolution let's go look at another
flower this time a little bit smaller
zoom in and get really close up here and
then let's step back and look at some
more detail here you can see an apple
tree that I have in my front yard and
you can see the individual leaves you
can see detail all the branches right
there coming out so very nice 720p right
there in the palm of your hand so 720p
basically that's high def you can still
go up to 1080p in the high def scale of
course not on the nexus one or any other
phone that i know of right now but being
able to record 720p video in the palm of
your hand is something that's relatively
difficult high-def video is very
processor intensive and it's of course a
lot larger file sizes than regular video
so you're going to have some downsides
but being able to select from just
standard video that's YouTube quality
all the way up to 720p that's really
impressive and it shows really the power
of what you can do on modern cell phones
especially the nexus one so come on over
to the article and i'll show you all the
details that you need to do to be able
to flash this update on to your phone
and get 720p video right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
