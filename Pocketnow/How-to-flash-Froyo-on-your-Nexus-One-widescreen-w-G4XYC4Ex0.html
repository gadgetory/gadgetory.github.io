cool thing happened just the other day
and that was Google i/o 2010 now that's
the Google Developers Conference and in
day 2 they showed us Android 2.2
codenamed Froyo running on the Nexus One
now that's really neat today we found
out that a lot of people are getting
Froyo pushed over-the-air to their Nexus
ones but a lot of people aren't it looks
like the press release versions of the
phone are getting it but everybody else
is gonna have to wait unless you're
watching this video and I'm going to
show you how so what I've got is a nexus
one running CyanogenMod it's unlocked
it's rooted and running a custom
recovery ROM and a custom ROM so I've
got a lot of work to do to be able to
get this update but if you come with me
I'll show you how to do that let's go
okay for us to be able to install this
update we have to go back from
CyanogenMod to the stock rom so anytime
we do that first thing we want to do is
make a backup I've already done that
I've booted up into recovery mode and
I'm running the allman raw recovery bran
nexus 1.7 point 0 really awesome
recovery round by the way so I've gone
ahead and done that back up next thing
that I need to do is wipe everything so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that we're
gonna wipe there and I'm going to keep
stepping through all of these options to
wipe absolutely everything except for
the SD card ext extension so that's
going to take me a minute or so here
and we're good to go
now I'm gonna go back to the main menu
and now we are going to flash a zip file
from the SD card this one is ERD 79
which is the stock rom we'll go ahead
and flash that now and this is going to
take a couple minutes so I'm going to
let that run and I'll be right back
I'm not done yet for this to work not
only do I have to have the stock rom on
the phone but I also have to have the
stock recovery rom on the phone now it's
important to note this is not going to
relock your phone you're still going to
have the Nexus unlock symbol every time
you boot I still don't know how to go
about relocking your phone so like I
said in previous videos once you've
unlocked it you've unlocked it you can't
go back but what we do need to do is put
the stock recovery ROM on so to do that
we're going to reboot the system and
we're going to boot it back up into our
fastboot mode go ahead and reboot the
system now hold down the volume down
button and there's our H boot menu now
you can see here we've got options for
fastboot recovery clear storage and sim
lock we want to go into fastboot so
we'll select that and press the power
key to choose it and now we're in
fastboot mode so from here I'm going to
plug in my phone and then we're going to
go over to the desktop computer or the
laptop in this case and I'm going to
show you what I've got and what we're
going to do from there to get the
recovery image back on I've gone ahead
and downloaded and installed the Android
SDK for Windows where to get that is
going to be in the article that
accompanies this video on pocketnow.com
in fact all of the files that I'm going
to reference here are going to be
hyperlinked in that article so if you
wonder where to get it
go to pocketnow.com look up this article
and you can find it all there that said
what I've done is inside this tools
folder there's a whole bunch of tools
that come with the SDK I've added some
things to this most importantly is
fastboot again check the article for the
link for that and after that is the
recovery image just right here it's only
2.3 megabytes so not very big but that's
the stock recovery image and we have to
put that back on the phone to be able to
flash the updated
froyo version so what we're gonna do now
is we're gonna switch over here to a
command prompt in administrator mode and
I'm gonna run you'll notice that I'm in
that same folder in the tools folder
I'm gonna run fast boot space devices
make sure I spelled that right we're
gonna press ENTER now the reason we do
that is to make sure that the device is
not only connected what you can see
there it is but also that it's
recognized and right there you can see
yes we have a device showing up if the
device wasn't connected it would either
return nothing or throw an error so we
should be good to go
now this next part gets a little bit
tricky I need to check my notes to get
the syntax exactly correct
okay here is that syntax again we're
running flash boot and this time we're
passing it the flash parameter and we
want to flash into the recovery
partition the recovery dot IMG so this
recovery dot IMG needs to be in that
tools folder right along with flash boot
which I just showed you so we'll go
ahead and do that now
it's sending it writing it and done so
all of one point two seven seconds so
awesome what we need to do now is reboot
our phone okay I've booted the system up
for the first time and I'm getting the
welcome to Nexus One Touch Android to
begin prompt so I'm gonna go ahead and
do that but I'm gonna skip through
absolutely everything and at this point
I'm looking at the stock wallpaper the
the stock icon layout everything so I
know that so far so good
let's go in here and see if there's an
update available for the phone menu
settings gonna go to down to about phone
and we are on firmware version 2.1 build
number ERD
79 so so far so good we're gonna check
for system updates and it has not noted
that there are any updates yet so we're
going to check a couple other things and
be right back
and the next thing we're gonna do is
force an over-the-air check in so to do
this on your dialer you dial star pound
star pound two four three two five four
six pound star pound star when you do
that the screen should go blank and you
should get a update that says check and
results success you cannot do this over
Wi-Fi or it will fail you have to do it
over your carrier so you do have to have
your SIM card installed an active plan
blah blah blah all that but once you do
that hopefully when we come back here to
settings and go to about phone and check
for system updates you'll see that we
are now getting an update in this case
we're getting Android update 2.1 update
1 now we could have gone ahead and
flashed that version to begin with or
flash the version that we did and then
flash this update but the reason I want
to do this is I want to make sure that
that recovery ROM is doing its job if
this update fails we know we've got
something else to do and we cannot flash
that Froyo update so we're going to go
ahead and do this now it's going to take
a little bit of time to finish
downloading it's 15.2 megabytes so we'll
do that and be right back ok after that
system update has been downloaded it'll
ask you if you want to install now later
or get more information we want to
install now so we'll go ahead and do
that it's now going to boot up into
recovery mode and this is where we get
to see if that work that we did flashing
the stock recovery ROM did what it was
supposed to do now if you try this with
the almond Raw ROM it will fail so you
have to go through those steps ok now if
we take a look here this is in the phone
about information again we can see that
the firmware version has now been
updated to 2.1 update 1 the build number
is e re 27 so we know that over the year
update just worked successfully we're
going to come in here to system updates
it still says there are none we could
check to see if there is another update
and force it that way but we know that
there
are not at least not at this point so
what we're gonna do is reboot the phone
again into recovery mode to do that we
wait for it to power off and then we
boot up and hold the down of volume
while it's booting so here we are in H
boot we wait for it to do its initial
load it's doing then we go down to
recovery select that with the power and
it reboots into recovery mode now we've
already got the Froyo update zip file on
the root of the SD card if you don't you
should have we're going to go back in to
flash their recovery in here
when that should be power there we go
and volume up and we are going to scroll
down to apply SD card update dot zip and
it's finding opening and verifying and
this should take another couple minutes
okay and we're up with the initial
wallpaper let's go in and check the
build so we'll unlock now the first
thing that you'll notice this is indeed
Froyo
we now have down in the launcher area
and I'm sorry I did the pinkie point
again for that individual who commented
that I pinkie point a lot you've got a
phone icon your launcher icon and then
your global icon which is the browser
you also now have your Google search in
color with some other options in the
drop down menu you can search everything
the web apps contacts etc etc but let's
go back home the launcher is now even
faster than it was before it seems to
scroll through more than just one line
at a time now when you do it so that's
really cool but like I was saying let's
go into about so we'll go into settings
all the way at the bottom about phone
and right there Android version 2.2 this
is build number f RF 50 and we are
running kernel version 2.6 point 32 0.9
yada yada yada
so there you go guys how to take a
hacked or a customized version of your
Nexus One restore it back to stock then
flash Froyo or Android 2.2 on it so
sorry about the length but this has been
a pretty in-depth video for
pocketnow.com I am Joe Levi and enjoy
your frozen yogurt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
