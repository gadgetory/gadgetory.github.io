it's the perfect time for an Android
comparison let's explain that in the US
the name samsung has become synonymous
with Android to much of the buying
public Samsung is the iPhone alternative
a perception the company spends billions
each year reinforcing so it can be tough
for other contenders to make a dent but
with its new high-end smartphone the
second generation Moto X Motorola is
giving it a try
if you're in the market for an Android
this iPhone shopping season these are
two great choices to consider so which
one should you buy
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
try to find out in moto x versus galaxy
s5 they don't look much alike but these
smartphones have a lot in common on the
spec sheet they're almost identical in
mass screen size and pixel density and
horsepower with each driven by some of
the best silicon around their cameras
are comparable in resolution their
radios capable of the same high speed
LTE connections and they're each built
to run the latest version of Android on
this basic level these phones are very
similar but you don't have to dig much
deeper to see that the priorities which
shaped these phones are very dissimilar
nearly five years ago Samsung built its
Galaxy S line on a foundation of raw
power and expandability and that's
carried through to today the galaxy s5 s
battery is larger than the motos for one
thing and it's also removable and
replaceable instead of sealed in meaning
you can carry more than one power pack
if you're planning a long stretch away
from a charger and you can boost the
galaxy's onboard memory to two 128 gigs
with a microSD card the galaxy s5 also
includes a veritable fountain of
features with a fingerprint scanner a
heartrate monitor a TV remote control
USB 3.0 and my most support for
accelerated downloads
it's screen can be made either much
brighter or much dimmer than many other
smartphones and the whole thing is
wrapped up in a dust proof casing that's
also capable of
for a swim the Moto X offers none of
that but where the galaxy s5 comes in
only a handful of available colors for
its stippled plastic casing the Moto X
can be customized in up to 500 different
combinations with material choices
including real wood and leather
Motorola's edges are also real aluminum
which is often cool to the touch and its
frame is curved to fit the palm
meanwhile the galaxy's entire chassis is
slab-sided polycarbonate that doesn't
look or feel terribly inspired in an
aesthetic sense the Moto X definitely
looks and feels more like it was
designed for humans
sorry Samsung if you're the kind of
person who loves extravagance though
Samsung's custom software is right up
your alley
visually it favors colors that pop and
icons that jump off the page and
functionally it features almost every
option you could imagine on a smartphone
and a few things you'd never think to
expect the former category is useful
stuff like multi window which lets you
run two apps side-by-side so you don't
have to pause your YouTube video every
time you get a message and ultra power
saving mode for when you really need to
squeeze the absolute most from your
battery in the less useful category is
so much stuff most of which is only
marginally useful or only works
sporadically stuff like hovering your
finger over the screen to preview
pictures waving your hand over the phone
to browse Motorola isn't shy about
bundling features of its own but it
makes sure they're one implemented
properly and to actually helpful being
able to interact with your phone by
speaking to it from across the room
might seem like a party trick but it's
so versatile that it comes in handy very
often so does having your text messages
read aloud to you when you're driving or
just busy so does having your screen
turn on using only the pixels it needs
when you pull the phone from your pocket
or when you reach for it when it's
sitting idle and Motorola blends these
features seamlessly into the clean pure
Android experience it's a stark contrast
to Samsung's interface which is dotted
with endless pop-up windows and dated
aesthetics and is more prone to bogging
down over time then the stock build is
where Samsung's kitchen-sink philosophy
serves it well isn't photography the
viewfinder on the galaxy s5 may be
intimidating with its endless layers of
options and toggles but that provides a
granular level of control not found on
the Moto X while Motorola has included a
handy gesture that helps to launch the
camera quickly which we love it's also
sacrificed too much controllability in
the name of simplicity that might be
okay with us if the camera delivered
better shots in return but it doesn't
the Galaxy s5 is a little aggressive
when it comes to saturation but mostly
the difference in vibrance you're seeing
here is a result of the Moto X just
making everything look dead HDR helps
the Moto somewhat in this regard but
Samsung still trounces it for color also
evident are the different aspect ratios
Motorola confines you to a more
squared-off frame if you want to use all
13 of its megapixels while the galaxy
lets you shoot in full 16 megapixel
resolution in widescreen and while we
chastised Samsung for poor low-light
performance in our galaxy s5 review it's
nowhere near as bad as what Motorola is
bringing to the table here about the
only thing the Moto X has going for it
on the still side is a more powerful
flash but since we prefer to avoid flash
shooting we're not ready to call that a
real advantage same deal in video while
we like the Moto X is excellent sound
capture and smoother software
stabilization we continue to prefer the
Galaxy s5s more dynamic and true to life
colors more camera samples including
selfie shots are available in the full
review for each phone and pocket now
when motorola is allowed to play to its
strengths things go better for the new
EX testing on ATT callers report that
quality is significantly clearer
brighter and crisper on the X verses the
muffled galaxy and Motorola's front
mounted loudspeaker helps out a lot with
speaker phone calls when compared to the
rear firing unit on the Samsung phone
media playback is the same deal
you
performance on high demand gaming and
such is basically on par at least with
our Snapdragon equipped s5 so the last
point is battery life and it goes to
Samsung while it can be a stretch to get
to the end of the day with heavy use on
either phone the s5 gives us 25% more
screen on time on average plus it's got
that ultra power saving mode and that
replaceable battery so what's it all
come down to for you folks not meant for
the Apple ecosystem well using the new
Moto X feels almost like you're using
Google's version of the iPhone an Apple
product not made by Apple that's because
it's more limited but in a smarter way
it has fewer customizable options and
fewer features overall but the features
it does offer work better and we find
them more useful it feels like a more
thoughtful more refined product from
software to fit and finish and it's
available in trims for every taste
by contrast the Samsung product feels
more like the anti iPhone which is of
course where the Samsung Galaxy family
has always come from the cameras better
it's more water-resistant there are five
times as many features but they're less
polished as is the plastic chassis and
the whole user experience really but if
you don't really care about elegance and
your main goal and smartphone shopping
is to find a device that can do all the
things the galaxy s5 was built just for
you which philosophy is built the better
phone that's for you to argue about down
in the comments but keep it civil and be
sure to check out our full review of
each of these phones linked in the
description down below hey follow us on
social media too and subscribe here on
YouTube if you don't want to miss future
coverage from PocketNow and thanks as
always for watching till next time this
has been michael fisher captain two
phones on twitter reminding you that the
only true galaxy is on Orion's belt
we'll see you next time
