inflection point about three years ago
innovation is somewhat dead and it wants
to battle that with this year's flagship
I'm hi Mary vana with PocketNow when
this is our hands on of the HTC ten
let's have the first question off our
back folks
why did HTC drop the one from its
branding well according to the company
10 is a magical number it represents the
perfect score the number used by the
best soccer players and even more 10 is
about perfection and that's what the
company sought out with the HTC 10
during our recent briefing the company
explained how its new flagship may look
similar to past iterations but it's far
from it the new design is being dubbed
as an iconic silhouette sculpted by
light has to refer to the brand new
champers those look kind of ugly on the
leaks but once in the hand it's hard to
take your eyes off of them this is a
satin blasted surface that reflects
light differently depending on the angle
you're holding it from and I'm really
growing fond of it I'm also really
loving the build quality the 10 feels
incredibly solid in the hand hinting to
a product that can take a good beating
HTC claims that it went through 10,000
hours of drop tests and 168 hours of
extreme temperatures to achieve that
capacitive buttons have made a comeback
for better for worse in the front-facing
fingerprint scanner that doubles as a
home button is also here if you're
looking for the boom sound speakers
they're here but packaged differently
the Twitter is now placed on the
earpiece while the base is at the bottom
speaker HTC is dubbing this boom sound
hi Fayed ition it includes Dolby audio
support for audio enhancements across
any application you use and the nifty
pair of headphones to take advantage of
it in addition to even audio profiles
that are tailored to whatever your audio
needs are the company made a big deal
about this display this is a 5.2 inch
quad HD Super LCD 5 mounted under 2.5 de
guarulhos glass but the story is
actually deeper the company claims that
this is a faster more responsive and
immaculate touch
Rean experience according to HTC this is
a cinema grade display with 30% more
color depth than traditional LCD and 30%
faster responsive times than even the
galaxy s7 that responsiveness is also
part of the company's new focus and
software HTC has partnered with Google
to eliminate bloat all around the
interface in this new version of Sense
material design takes charge and the
best application of each world will
prevail meaning that you no longer have
to calculator applications just googles
and the HTC camera instead of Google's
camera and instead of HTC's gallery you
now get Google photos they're just an
app dragon 820 processor running the
show along with four gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of expandable storage the battery
is of only 3000 milliamp hours but the
company is claiming that this phone is
capable of 2 days of battery life and
we'll see about that
there's Qualcomm fast charging 3.0
included through USB type-c and HTC has
even tweaked the adapter to absorb heat
and allow you to reach up to 50% of
battery in under 13 minutes this time
the charger is included in the box as
well and finally HTC also made a big
deal about this new camera this is a
twelve ultrapixel camera match with F
1.8 aperture the company claims that
it's 3 times faster at focusing than the
one m9 and the camera application
apparently also launches faster we have
oh is and laser autofocus and the doozy
here is that there is also a front
facing five megapixel shooter with
optical image stabilization as well
there's also a range of accessories
that's coming starting with this new HTC
ice view case which replaces the dot
view that we saw before providing added
functionality and also a better viewing
experience in my opinion double swipe to
the bottom and you're able to launch the
cameras viewfinder and even see
everything through the ice view case I
actually find this to be genius and very
practical so far all this sounds like of
HTC finally decided to end the trend of
compromise we've seen for the last two
years and that's actually good because
this phone is priced along with other
flagships at $6.99
unlocked obviously that changes
depending on whatever
carrier you're choosing color options
range from topaz gold carbon grey
glacier silver and camellia red as well
on certain markets whether all this
lives up to the htc we remember is still
up for grabs
but our review unit is already at the
pocket now lab and we will be reporting
back very soon for now make sure you
