they're small enough to go in our pocket
we take them with us everywhere but i'm
starting to see an interesting trend and
i'm sure you are too we have phablets we
have tablets we have mini tablets we
have all this other stuff why because
the screen on the smartphone well it
just might be too small to do a lot of
the stuff that we want to do so what do
we do do we carry around two devices a
smartphone and a tablet or a phablet or
a mini tablet or whatever we're calling
it this week then I've got my data
across two different devices or maybe I
have it stored in the cloud and I have
to sync it over my limited use data plan
to two different devices there by using
twice as much data it sounds like a
conspiracy from the carriers doesn't it
but it's separate isn't there something
that I can do to bring a a tablet or
even like a laptop experience to my
smartphone well some people think there
are of course asus has their pad phone
Motorola has their discontinued product
that's all we'll say about that is there
something that you can do with a device
that wasn't specifically designed for
being convertible well I've got
something in hand today you're either
going to love this or you're going to
hate it but I want to show it to you
because I think the idea is really cool
it's another product from on lap it's a
battery powered monitor let's go take a
look
now if you remember my last video that
had to do with portable monitors it was
kind of interesting I had this kind of
Frankenstein of cords and all you guys
were saying I can do this so much easier
with this or with that or with the other
well apparently these guys over at G
chic were we're listening so what we've
got now this is a battery powered
monitor it has speakers back here if you
can see one over on that side one over
on this side it's got these nice
controls over on the side it even has
this little magnetic mount if you want
to put a little cradle for your set your
smartphone or even a tablet if you want
it to right in here over on this side
we've got an on-off switch we've got a
power in at via a micro USB connector
we've got a VGA port in and it comes
with an adapter so you can take vga or
with the right connections you could
even do DVI and plug it in here but
these are the two things that I'm really
excited about it's got MHL so if you've
got an MHL connection theoretically and
I can get this to work on my device but
I've only got one device to try on I
could take this and with one cord plug
it from this port into my smartphone and
that's it I'm done I have sound I have
power I have video all coming through
this one little connector again for
whatever reason I couldn't get that to
work so I had to go over here to my hdmi
port so this hdmi is like you saw before
it comes to the table this is what it
looks like this round just a nice little
90-degree connector there and then on
the other end it's got an HDMI connector
so into that i'm going to plug my
samsung hdmi adapter that plugs into the
micro USB port on the bottom of my
galaxy nexus and then right in there now
one downside to this it does have to be
powered okay so if that's an MHL
connection great it'll work but I don't
have the right cables to do that so in
this case I do have to provide power to
this little guy right there so let's go
ahead and hook everything up
show you how it works go ahead and plug
that in take my USB power plug that in
now all of this can stay wherever you've
got your monitor so if you want to set
up like a virtual work station fabulous
you can do that let's go ahead and set
the monitor up it comes with these cool
little brick things of course you
wouldn't have to use these if you had a
another kind of stand but it's quick
it's easy it doesn't require any kind of
permanent mounting I can get everything
to fit down there and that's it I've got
a monitor now that I can set up anywhere
and have an instant workstation or I can
have that sitting on my lap then I need
to take this cord plug it in over here
to this connector just like that and of
course I can route that cable wherever I
want to get it out of the way next I've
got my smartphone going to go ahead and
unlock it this like I said is the Galaxy
Nexus and I'm just going to plug this
connector into the bottom we're going to
fire up some netflix we're going to play
some Star Trek Enterprise I've got audio
coming from the back of the monitor
which might be an issue because you're
firing the sound away from you well most
tablets do that these days some of the
new ones are changing the display is
pretty good you can see I'm viewing the
entire screen and it is 720 so that's
fabulous is great I can now have this
solution not quite as portable as you
might think right there and on the go
now what else can you do with this if
you've got a bluetooth keyboard you can
very quickly and easily tether up a
keyboard and have a full screen text
input experience really kind of cool
we've seen something like this in the
past with Windows Mobile taking it way
back to like 2008 where there was
literally a clamshell doc that had a
screen and a keyboard and you would pair
your device up to it make sure you head
over to pocketnow.com i'll have a link
down at the bottom of this video so that
you can take a trip back in time and see
what we were doing way back then this
this is my work station on the go this
can vary
easily go into a briefcase or a backpack
I can have big screen movie watching if
i want to or at least bigger screen than
i could on a tablet and I can have a
workstation right there with that
keyboard or even a bluetooth mouse if I
wanted to really kind of a cool concept
I like the whole mobile desk warrior
concept interested to know what you
think about it for more information
about the product and if you want to
give us some ideas and thoughts and let
us know if they've improved the design
head over to pocketnow.com and let us
know / pocket now I'm Joe Levi thanks
