pocket now calm and we're closing at the
HTC freestyle this is HTC's only non
smart it's running on the brew MP
platforms I've never actually used this
kind of platform so you're going to be
looking at it for the first time sort of
along with me so this is what it looks
like it's going to be on ATT specs are
kind of lackluster but again this is
going to be an inexpensive film 3.2 inch
hvga display so that's 480 x 320 3.2
megapixel camera it's got this sense
interface but kind of toned down 528
megahertz processor only 256 megabytes
of RAM anyway let's look at it for the
first time I've never actually played
with a phone like this before so I don't
know what's going on here there's a back
button there okay so we've got HTC Sense
like look and these dots on the bottom
telling me that there are multiple home
screens kind of like Andrew so we swipe
around there's got to be a way to get to
a program tray maybe it's this one right
here no that's not it maybe there is no
program train okay so it's got an
android like notification system overall
it feels fast I can't really knock it
all right here we go menu go to menu
these are the applications that you can
access to check out the mobile web this
is a 3g phone not for cheap okay so
we've got a browser here full HTML looks
like on-screen keyboard the keyboard
looks pretty sensitive which is nice see
what we get here it'll it'll have to
commute back everything ok no Wi-Fi no
sim card so when i press enter nothing
is going to happen so i'm not even going
to try as this nice man told me so we'll
go back here see what happens when we
press the phone button sim card missing
so it can't access the phone function
but that's what the dialer looks like
scroll to the right looks like we have a
screen add contacts screen to look
through and scroll through messages kind
of like you get on android and even
windows mobile but not we just phone
going the other way we have shortcuts so
we can press the plus button scroll
through say I want that one click and
there it is photo frame tap and hold
assuming it's happened for what happens
yes you can resize it out over and over
here weather data so certain of this HTC
Sense like experience but brought to a
device that's not as powerful but it
feels darn fast which is a which is nice
for those looking for something that's
not quite a smartphone buy us more or
less expensive that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
