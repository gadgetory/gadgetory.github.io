LG g2 LG really really really wants to
be a major player with Samsung and HTC
and I guess Motorola and Sony elevator
not as high up as I HTC and Samsung but
they really haven't been able to do it
and last year was the first time that we
actually saw something really noteworthy
from from LG which was the optimus G
which of course went on to be the nexus
4 and a year has gone by and it's time
for LG to do it again and hopefully up
the ante because the oxy s4 is out HTC
one is out and LG needs to answer them
and they've got the advantage of time on
their side so the LG g2 is about to be
announced it's going to be we already
know a device with a Snapdragon 800 CPU
which is an awesome amazingly fast cpu
we're gonna get a 1080p screen and LG
keeps touting this idea of the phone
learning from you so I think they're
going to pull a samsung and have a host
of added on software to Android the
tries to innovate a little bit with me
I've got Taylor and Jaime and some first
impressions guys in alphabetical order
we'll start with hi May what do you
think we're gonna see today oh I think
we're gonna see the feature Nexus 5 you
think it's gonna be the future Nexus 5
no no meaning uh we're gonna we're going
to see everything that we want to know
about the feature Nexus smartphone
that's pretty much it I have a lot of
respect for LG for trying I have just
never been overwhelmed or or wowed by
anything they've done now the odd the
Optimus G was a phone that I really did
want and still you know it was good it
just wasn't as great as I wanted it to
so uh let's just say that I my
expectations are level they're not hot
they're not cold let's see what we get
did you did you ever get a chance to
play with the g2 I mean I g to an
optimal what the optimus G yeah yeah
yeah I think it was a well done phone I
just hated the fact that I fell off the
table all the time uh yeah that's still
pretty back yeah but what I'm a said
might not be too off base at least in
terms of future Nexus if if LG is making
the next Nexus which I guess that seems
kind
like a pattern because Samsung made two
with the exception of HTC Samsung made
two handsets and a sous is now made two
7-inch tablets and apparently samsung is
making the second Nexus 10 so LG could
be making the next Nexus handset which
was basically the Optimus G so maybe
maybe we're only a few months out so
what do you guys think about this volume
button on the back which is really the
first time we've ever seen that um it's
not actually hate to contradict you but
uh I said that in an editorial and
somebody was quick to call me out that
it's happened several times and I can't
remember which phones it was on but it
was uh said we've been done before and
to me it seems like a decent idea
because if you get your phone to you
here which is part of the time when i'm
going to use the volume records right
there where your index finger is its
then I think it's the next gimmick to
reach smartphone land it's it doesn't it
doesn't make sense unless you're in a
call right so if you're looking at it if
you're looking at a video and you want
to turn up the volume it's kind of
awkward to like go behind and if the
speakers are in the way you're going to
block the speakers when it's on the side
it just you know you can just tap it you
know exactly where it is so yeah I think
it's if different just for the sake of
different which is not not only that but
whenever you lay the phone on the table
it's got this hump that'll probably not
allow for you to press any of the
buttons but still I usually don't lay my
phone's flat on the table I look for a
case or I look for for any area that
will not scratch the back uh so most
likely it'll you know raise your volume
or I don't know I think it'll be awkward
like whenever you're honest whenever
you're on speakerphone for whatever
reason and it's on your lap or something
I think it's just gonna be uncomfortable
but you know it's a high praise a LG for
trying let's see what they bring to the
table against we're getting a countdown
3 2 1 1 and the event has begun and guys
we should also mention that Michael
Fisher is in New York City right now
he's gonna have hands-on video with the
optimist I keep saying optimist it's the
g2 no optimum CEO but listen why did
they ditched that
named what did they ditch the optimist
is from transformers right yeah I had
speculated that it might have been
through a lawsuit or maybe some kind of
court settlement or something because a
sous get sued for using transformer
prime and Optimus is also a transformer
term so I don't know so let's dissect a
little bit of these messages on the
screen they're talking about that there
it sits these sentences in the first
person I need a phone that lasts all day
I need a phone that's faster than
anything else out there I mean that
allows me to leave my camera at home
that allows me my camera at home so far
this pretty obvious stuff it's got to
have good battery life it's gotta have a
good camera um many lips bones says
they're gonna do that and every phone
says gonna do that i really wonder how
the phone is going to learn from you and
they keep having this this slogan which
is to me you are perfect it reminds me
of the HTC you campaign you remember
that mmm a little bit a little bit it's
it's a little bit more like a i twist i
think on that yeah yeah phone
personalization wasn't one of LG's a
little I guess slogans for this teaser
wasn't it like machines are better than
humans or something it's really weird
it's just really weird that the machines
machines are better than human no yeah
that's it was like technology is better
than humans or machines are better than
humans I can't remember what it was but
I saw it tweeted somewhere um also you
need a phone that doubles as a platter
like a tray for your drink and I can put
a sandwich on this side you see easily
the ultra as a lunch tray uh tailoring
we leased up geez don't don't show i
agree that he'll be a lemon wait wait
all right so we're my own bills either
right now oh man drinking my oatmeal all
right Alan let's focus on the other so
you're telling me that everything fits
on that phone oh my god here use this
cup of coffee try this out and try this
bottle of water while you added come on
Ryan's gonna kill me
we've got a really touchy feely video
that talks about your desires and life
surprises and the video is frozen yep
there goes and it's just like these
pretty young people you know doing
things a man with a jackhammer he's
getting Miriam er this is about living
life things you love there's there some
older people you know oh there's someone
pregnant yeah loading 25% ahead that's
funny yeah that was cool this is cool
god this is just because there's no
technology more perfect than you this is
getting very learning from you this is
getting very strange and I really hope
that this phone can actually um how can
the phone learn from you what does that
even mean like context-aware at least I
hope so I don't think I don't think
that's really ever happened I mean Syria
was opposed to learn from you and it
never did Siri is dumb she is not it is
he's not good Google now kill Siri and
end it and the fact that the voice
recognition is not real time on the
iphone it's just so annoying yeah we're
at president the president CEO of LG is
now on stage uh let's see what we get
yes thank you for joining us yes yes
Michael Fisher you're lucky you get the
free drinks and everything so did anyone
get a glimpse of Michael on the on the
when they were showing the audience or
no but I saw someone trying to rip my
style somebody had won our hats on away
so you did not see iron man on stage man
that's too bad Oh iron man now tell me
something Brandon you didn't give us
your impressions of what you're
expecting for this phone I mean you had
a Jew had an optimistic the problem with
the optimus G was the same thing that
was wrong with the nexus 4 which was
touch responsiveness they used in cell
like the iphone 5 in the ipad mini and
it's just not as good as the last best
generation technology um I I I bought an
optimist g and used it for daily driver
for like three weeks and there were just
some problems with it first of all oh my
the it was running Android 4.2 went into
there was a there was a 4 there's a
jelly bean update and if you went into
the software I hit up
it would say server error and then you
try to do it again and it would say you
can't check for a software update until
23 hours and 59 minutes so I could never
get the jelly bean update um yeah LG I
don't know LG I think they pushed the
bar really good when it came to hardware
with that phone but their software is
never up to speed you know we might go
ahead agree i think the last generation
they actually did something cool with
their software well I did I reviewed the
optimus g pro and it was basically a
galaxy s4 next note to mimic I mean
everything from their voice recognition
software to the widgets everything
looked like TouchWiz and it didn't pour
for it didn't perform as well even
remotely so I don't know I don't know LG
is just the I commend them for trying
for me there optimus g was a big leap in
comparison to anything we had seen
before I mean I remember we were in
Barcelona with Tony no phones crashed as
much as these LG phones on display hey
it was just terrible is it is it me or
has this term innovation become cliche
it has been hearing through innovation
in mobile now at least not i will say
that motorola has come the closest with
having their custom processor
architecture with always on listening
but that's not even true just innovation
that's that's building on a small build
on something that already existed but
that is that is really innovative
because like if you fast-forward the
software in five years when this when
you can do everything with voice and the
fact that it's always paying attention
to you it's like a it's like a dream
feature right yeah and no I totally
agree with you but but no everyone over
uses that that word now innovative
innovative you're not innovative if
you're copying features that every other
company is already done you know what
you know what is so lame and this
happens at every phone launch they over
use pictures of people doing great stuff
people get married babies are on the
screen there's
someone surfing because they rated
istockphoto yeah yeah yeah yeah but
trust me anything is better than seeing
dancers on stage oh now with the gaseous
form of it Tommy the tap dancer yeah
they've got people of all ages people of
all races and ethnicities and there Nell
someone's playing a violin and someone's
playing a timpani and then it's just not
know funny how phone launches have
become like these um de smelly ism now
let me tell you something I I did not
see the galaxy s3 with such a quick
adoption as I've seen the galaxy s4 on
the street everybody man everybody here
has a GS for everybody it's like wow I
mean everybody has a gs4 right here
everyone still has a galaxy s3 and
they're all pissed because the four came
out right after they bought it I saw an
HTC one in person the other day on the
street oh that's a first you don't see a
lot of that around here because a lot of
people still have blackberries and stuff
no man people don't sell the HTC One
here yet can you believe that that's how
good HTC is sorry sorry for the burn so
there are more features they have yet to
show the phone they learned from you or
see you in design yeah oh my gosh
finally show it Oh show me the phone
that the whole world has already seen
please yeah show it to me now oh my gosh
it's just a wireframe there's no need
for this there's no answer this we all
we all read even know what it a lot of
them were probably even like scheduled
wait a second rumors that a gigantic
phone on hangers what's that look at
that look at that there are two wires
holding that gigantic thing on the floor
he just knocked on the screen in it
turned on those bezels are ultra mega
thin holy moly it reminds me of a moto x
just a little over ultra mega thin isn't
it the other way around I hate the name
I really really honestly truly hate the
name LG g2 it so there was the food
really nice LG whispah
there was this company that would sell
toys when I was when I was a kid and it
was called GG so it just reminds me of
that well maybe a maybe this will be
like a toy seriously GG toys all right
so we were it's it's exactly what we've
seen it's it's really nice looking i
mean it is yeah front is beautiful I but
but I I just got to know what this
learning from you means at and I've got
my audio off are you guys hearing
anything about learning from you David
no he's talking about the volume rocker
Oh start with the volume rocker he's
talking about rumors actually right now
he said this is the feature everyone's
been talking about something different
it's just the sake of being different
what is the book the center of the
volume rocker dude is that like a mute
might be us like standby button people
thought it was the fingerprint scanner
and then apparently they pulled back in
the last couple of days I wonder if
that's the power button oh I hope it's
not that phone is gonna be turning on
all the time when it does a table but
even even he even the CEO saying LG g2
yeah so it sounds terrible LG g2 it does
sound real just g2 is fine by LG g2 they
should have changed the letter G to
something that isn't G yeah lgf to s2
are too cute dicks to know stop with the
use of X everything's x come on so it's
got so the back is is black and shiny or
white and shiny it's not soft touch it's
a piper kameez ish right yeah why it
looks good impress renders but not after
you've used it for five minutes and
you're as greasy as us three cows yes
seriously I don't know man come on could
you please stop talking about the
buttons all right oh it's got air flow
on the bottom I'm just kidding so so so
the top of the ergonomic design like a
lot of phones these days it's very
interesting the HTC One the Moto X
they're having this nice shape because
it's kind of unnatural to be honest like
the iPhone really rough edges very very
hard edges it just doesn't feel right oh
my gosh the z ultra's the war
ergonomic phone in the world but it's
got some other cool stuff why are you
complaining so much about that phone
Taylor come on this is a nexus 7 and
this is the Z ultra oh my lord you were
oh god why why even get that show that
again show that again oh my you know I
can't even tell the difference I don't
even know which ones which that's why
let's get that's one let's get back to
the G to you guys notice something very
interesting look how many live people
are watching the LG of it not the pile
by the LG event um I can't see how many
17,000 people are watching this that's
nothing that's nothing compared to
google which had like like 900,000 yeah
we have a hundred and eighty-nine views
so thank you for tuning in and watching
us blab about this phone that we've
heard about a million times yes thank
you everybody or for tuning in Taylor
anything about what this phone does to
learn from you yet nothing yeah
seriously this is just I can't really
understand him you can't understand him
right because he's an accent well part
accent part because my volume is low
because I still want to hear you guys
and two because I'm I see Miriam from
engadget but uh no I don't I can't hear
so the comp is confirmed 5.2 inch screen
1080p display Snapdragon 800 coming to
t-mobile which is a little bit of a not
a win because t-mobile is the smallest
US carrier the cpu is 2.26 gigahertz
it's gonna be a fast fast phone no doubt
all right somebody saying in our
comments on YouTube that it looked like
r2d2 as funny the back looks like r2d2
let's see if there is um trying to
figure out what this step button is on
the back so that's really a same here
not yet not yet no press release him um
so apparently it's designed for
one-handed operation two gigs of ram
3,000 pound that is great um but it
depends on how well the software
software is optimized I mean the
Snapdragon 800 I wonder how will I know
that it's gonna be great I just depends
on the software always it does depend on
the software always and I I'm really
curious if they're gonna they're
probably have android 4.2 point2 it's
just too early for 4.3 but Thor e3's got
that trim support which I apparently
will reduce the chances of your phone
slowing down over time but see that
stone but see that's a paddlin Brandon
last year the optimus G was launched
after jellybean was launched like two
months after jellybean was launched with
the Nexus 7 and who you know you got ice
cream sandwich that's why that's really
my prom with LG I'm actually surprised
that Sony for example has already pushed
for point-to-point to to their phones
and HTC hasn't done it Samsung hasn't
done it to their current generation you
know to their older generation phones so
I'll see you not gonna believe this well
I made that is a power button on the
back that's what I've thought that's
what I said a purpose of standby yeah
there are no buttons on the sides oh my
god their reasoning is because the
phones larger has better one-handed
usability if you don't have to like
reach to the top of the phone or like to
the side and I kind of agree with that
but you look what Samsung's doing
they're bringing the power button down
along the side well yeah but just think
about it how big is this canvas how how
easy is it for you to find that button I
mean it's so much easier to find the
button here on the edge than it is do
you know to carry a gigantor phone and
look for the button somewhere around
there especially you Taylor it's Lily
meeting this might be the the g2
supports LTE Advanced which is what is
making it I think the second phone in
the world besides a galaxy s4 the newer
version galaxy s4 them and of course
lte-advanced is like LTE but much faster
no network in the US has it yet there's
a I think one of well yeah there's going
to be a bit there but there's going to
be rushes number one at the United
States
we will start deploying by the end of
this year i believe yeah i think i think
verizon's going to be the first duality
advances they were the first with LTE
yeah just just just think about how big
the the note 2 is trying to look for
that power button is going to be
annoying i'm going to look at looking at
the back and then just pressing it go
ahead yeah not even just that if you're
holding the phone in your power buttons
here if you're holding it to where your
fingers near or around the power button
it's not one-handed use because you're
still going to have to use your other
hand if you're having the phone like
this you can still reach the side
buttons with your thumb and your middle
or index finger you have a solid point
there my friend so one-handed uses and
there so there's pretty much nothing on
the sides there's no camera but nothing
which is you know the usual for Android
late so I've got some got some more
updates it's got an IR blaster and it's
got some features like a galaxy s4 has
where if you're raising your phone to
your ear it automatically answers an
incoming call there's a feature which
guess is what you might want to do when
you plug in your headphones I mean this
is very basic stuff there's a guest's
mode feature um so the Qualcomm CEO just
still left the stage and the stream is
what do you wonder okay so we're getting
a video now and it's asking we wonder
what's true about other what I don't
know where we're in space now so I don't
know it was chopped up we're in space
right now exactly this is such a weird
so many videos and like wait I still
don't know why it learns you I don't
know why it won't you this seems I like
this car yeah I like what they're now we
are eight sorry no rose the other day
okay so control the volume of what
you're listening to because you have
those really accessible buttons right
capture the scenery of what you want to
hold a perfect fit for one hand right
but then you're not going to be able to
reach those buttons easy for self
portrait because you're going to take
the photo with the volume buttons you're
gonna miss
make for the power but yeah if you use a
hardware shutter key as like the volume
rocker on the back and you're trying to
take a picture in landscape which you
should do anyway you're going to be
covering up the camera sensor yeah I
want to see I want to see a one of these
promotional videos with really ugly
people in a very crime-ridden terrible
neighborhood you wanna see these people
is just extra la can we shoot their next
commercial in Detroit I just gonna say
it's doing Detroit what's wrong with
Detroit I've never been there long yeah
like Crimea is like four or five times
the national average all right these are
the Mesa people stop complaining let's
film that in helotes then let's bring
them over here we'll just say we're not
going five you are look places where we
get to where I could take them where I'm
not sure if they're gonna be able to get
out of there but they could film
whatever they want um by the way guys I
have to leave shortly I wasn't supposed
to be here but someone convinced me so
I've got to leave in a few minutes yeah
and then I'll leave you two guys to
gossip about the cheek to and whether
you want to own one no I can already
tell you that no come on just work you
gotta wait you gotta hear about all the
futures right oh man oh man ok so the
James fischler senior vice president of
LG electronics and USA is talking now
most likely they're going to talk about
partnerships partnerships ok so this by
the way listeners is another smartphone
we still don't understand what it does
to learn what you do um it definitely
doesn't understand how you hold the
phone um there's a comment on the stream
like on the YouTube stream somebody
commented wait it's basically been
designed to take selfies that's really a
selling point I take a lot of okay so
apparently the key features here design
display camera sounds and the un's a
user experience yeah user experience
been there done that
I see that is see that's that's I don't
know last time I don't know who wrote
this editorial but I'm just I'm just
trying to figure out what is different
about this film what is the selling
point what is gonna make it excel in
comparison to anything else it's already
in the market what else that is guy talk
he's talking about the width of a phone
how much the width of a phone has
changed yeah change from 2.4 22 points
seven inches uh I'd like to know what
this one is four feet I don't think
you've got a ruler that big it's
basically my desktop I just took my desk
and turned it into a phone okay I got it
I got a jump off now it's been real and
curious to see what else they've got to
talk about with this G too nice a
someone is using chromecast to watch the
stream on their television us watch us
on their television I can't believe they
want to see our access to that thing it
must be a hard cuz appreciate all right
well I'm gonna jump off see you guys
David see you later for joining us bro
take care he's my boy okay so listen I'm
looking into the comments that we have
on YouTube I am trying to we're trying
to figure out I mean a lot of the
comments are like LG is trying to be it
innovatively wrong let me see heavy
legacy 001 Assange LG is trying to
innovate in a wrong way and it's true i
mean what is it a bit of about buttons I
mean Taylor I don't um I'm sorry am I
just too disappointed right now he's
talking about it right now uh-huh what's
he saying he's saying that the battery
is he saying that having a button on the
back of the phone reduces the size of
battery and requires the chassis to be
smaller which okay but it's I but is it
sick is it thinner than an iphone I mean
is it that in the gs4 I don't think so I
don't think so hold on I've got the I
have the dimensions right here
okay so this phone is not a thinner than
the gs1 see this is this is what happens
when you get a manufacturer like Sam
saying i'm sorry i'm not a samsung
fanboy guys but seriously Samson puts
everybody to shame you know they're like
to know we have inner than the HTC One
but thick a millimeter thicker than the
s4 okay so Samson was able to figure out
how to put all the buttons on the side
and give us a replaceable battery and
give us expandable stores you just threw
out everything and you know that's the
justification for these people to add
these buttons to the back you know I
guess I like you said one-handed
usability is pretty much lost here yeah
and he's saying that it's it's
ambidextrous so you can use it left or
right handed the same exact way which
that's a good point but i don't really
unless handed and that doesn't affect me
it doesn't affect how i use a phone
because a phone i'm not doing a whole
lot with my left or right hand it's not
like writing or eating or throwing a
baseball right right right and they're
still using this learning from you
moniker I mean what's the whole point of
this learning from you an anti
fingerprint sapphire crystal glass on
the lens which okay it's still gonna
have to be wiped off you know all the
oleophobic coverings and yeah okay so
here is a sapphire crystal lens and let
me touch it right now and oh a
fingerprint there yes oleophobic
materials are not really that great at
what they do okay so I'll tell you this
much for example the Xperia ZL does not
have folio phobic coating and it is
terrible it is you know it's what helps
but it doesn't necessarily fix
everything it's just it makes it a
little bit less worse I don't say better
less worse i guess the smudges just
don't really stick to the display it's
easier to clean but it doesn't
necessarily mean that it gets you know
that it that's that it remains clean
that's I guess that's what I'm trying to
okay so what is the largest possible
screen you get on the phone Taylor if
you please tell them which is the
largest possible well don't go for point
there being six point four inches hey
what's the width of that phone by the
way cuz it looked really thin on video
I'm gonna have to look it up yes
tomorrow I don't know I I'm will soon
yeah is 92.2 millimeters which is 3.6
three inches whatever anyways listen
listeners we are still the LG event is
still happening I'm looking at a lot of
tired faces on the audience right now
and I'm sure that you guys are getting
the same feeling we are getting the same
feeling right now we are getting another
smartphone um I'm happy that the nexus 5
because it'll most probably be called
the nexus 5 but it's gonna be based on
this phone will have monster Snapdragon
800 X lte-advanced hopefully it'll have
three gigs of ram and just about
everything but the LG g2 is not better
than anything that you can already buy
on the market i guess is what I'm trying
to say these buttons are not a selling
point unless you tell me otherwise tail
ya know I think it's safe to say that
the the nexus 5 will probably not have
buttons on the back Google would
probably backhand LG and say no this is
not happening because the last three
Nexus devices looked similar so I don't
think they'll do anything drastic anyway
now now this display does keep a sort of
a nexus light design am i right what the
one on the g2 the one of the g2 the
borders and everything it looked sort of
round I guess it looks sort of round I
guess all right dual routing
yeah oh well oh well so I guess Taylor
excited not excited not excited and I've
owned three LG devices and reviewed a
few and that's all i've got to say
that's all i gotta say what did you keep
any of them no no did not you know I'm
really sorry that Tony's not hear Tony's
currently on vacation by the way um but
tony is a strong advocate for LG he
loves LG I still haven't figured out why
but he loves LG um I I have never owned
an LG phone actually I you know I guess
I've had such bad experiences on trade
shows like my first experience with an
LG smartphone was with the spectrum back
at CES 2012 and it was so you know it
had the 720p display just about
everything you wanted but the you I was
just so bad and so clunky that I was
like oh man let's hope we never get to
review this problem because it's gonna
be a very bad review and I'm sad for LG
because the phone looks pretty and all
but design is and everything the phone
isn't isn't going to perform that it's
just not it's pointless to have the
optimus g pro which was the last LG
phone ahead ok I take that back the only
LG phone that I've kept is the nexus 4
ok so I bought that and I've kept it
since i bought it but the optimus g pro
felt like an hat like a happy meal toy I
get it not yeah like you press the
button and you can feel the vibration
like you can feel the vibrate motor spin
around when you press the home button I
mean it's just like Hollow so I'll cheap
it felt himself Jeezy it felt more cheap
than the s4 no way which is a feat
that's a feat now tell me something what
are you know judging by your impressions
I mean you do use a nexus for every now
and then mmm not eat not even after your
experiences with the nexus 4 you know
you're still not excited over this phone
I guess nope because it doesn't bring
anything you I'm more excited over the
Moto X than this ok that's a big
statement at
it's a truth it's the truth because I'm
I'm all about you know voice activation
and stuff if I can ask my phone a
question without touching it that's
awesome but this doesn't do anything
it's nothing truly new oh look at that
it brings optical image civilization in
the camera that's not interesting that's
nice that's a nice inclusion okay
listeners the gs4 does not have optical
image stabilization only the HTC One the
Lumia 920 of the Lumia 1020 uh the 925
the 928 obviously these are pretty much
the only four or five phones that have
this feature included still how are you
how are the photos of of the g pro i
haven't taken any no no what would you
throw um they were ok ok so apparently
one of the another selling point for
this g2 will be the fact that you will
be able to take you know night shots and
probably get do probably do a better job
now I have a problem with what he said
what he said was that on most optical
image stabilization was only available
on 4 megapixel and 8 megapixel cameras
which would be the HTC One and Lumia 920
living around but he said this is the
first time it's available on a 13
megapixel camera but you're not getting
a whole lot extra whole lot of extra
data out of 13 verses 8 megapixels
because you're probably using the same
sensor size which means that you're
basically mixels yeah you're shrinking
the size of your pixels which is yeah
the pixels are smaller I've you know for
for me you know 13 megapixels has still
not been able to amaze me on any phone
yet I know you you I've never used that
I have a gs4 here but I haven't really
taken photos as much with it so I
current take a panoramic photo and tell
me that's not amazing with that phone
you can take the best panoramic shots
other than that I didn't find the camera
impressive yeah well i don't know i
don't know let's see can you believe you
try to get this thing out of the box
alright so we're getting a demo and what
are these other two phones Taylor um one
looks like a covered up iphone but it
actually looks kind of fake and the
other one looks like an s3 but I don't
know also those hand the wooden hands
are really awkward I kind of freaking me
out Wow all right there taking the video
of how good a picture looked on a phone
you can't show how good it looks on a
video all right let's go through some
YouTube comments here the Moto X does
bring a lot of good innovation to the
table and wood for the backing is a
pretty cool feat Taylor you agree I
don't like the wood um wood on the back
of the Moto X yeah oh yeah I'd carry a
wooden phone but not me you can't
impress me with anything you say about a
smartphone camera after nokia announced
this yeah like you you can't now so
don't try to impress me with your camera
okay so today David Connelly what are
the megapixels we've got 13 megapixels
uh let's see yeah yeah char I'll Shalom
if you don't like LG then why are you
covering it well it's a press event we
cover all presidents sorry I mean we're
this is our hangout we're giving you our
first impressions on everything that's
happening on the show floor and sadly
you know I'd hate to break it to you but
we you know we've already got
communication with Michael Fisher and
everybody's born there sadly yeah so now
I want to say that I don't hate LG I
don't dislike LG I don't favor their
products I try to be unbiased but
they've never really truly done anything
to blow me away and for the past two or
three years they've basically been a
shadow of Samsung they do exactly what
Samsung does okay the butter
configuration here is a total different
direction and it's not necessarily a
good direction so yeah I you know just
watch some of the official promo videos
of LG UK UK I'm curious about the camera
stabilization feature yes we are to this
would be the fourth phone or fifth phone
in the market that's capable of doing
optical images
Shin um and so far there haven't really
been you know all these phones do a good
job you know even the HTC one would just
form it ultrapixels does a good job not
the best job but it does a good job it
does a decent job uh let me see not
really excited either I'm not crazy
about um I'm not a crazy instagram user
no need for selfies right right buns on
the back man not really a good selling
point agreed see that's the problem I
mean if the only selling point here is
going to be those buttons at the back
they're lost they're completely lost
they're using it by the way listeners
and viewers they're using it as an
excuse to make the phone thinner
according to them and this phone is one
millimeter thicker than the galaxy s be
the fourth breakthrough with this phone
I don't I didn't catch the other three
but the fourth breakthrough is high
fidelity audio I'd like to see how it
compares to boom sound yeah well say and
beats audio oh oh yes this is the creepy
part ringtones of the vienna's about a
Vienna Boys Choir I don't want a ring
tone of a boy's choir on my phone I'm
sorry maybe that's a geological like a
geographic thing but ok the Jack of
Clubs where is the speaker hole that's a
good question i didn't see where the
speaker hole is yeah 23 bit audio oh oh
yeah wait a second there at the bottom I
noticed that there at the bottom of the
diagram but they're not front-facing now
you have to cover them up to push your
power button 23 bit audio a sauna for
Billups 24-bit audio it's actually the
the right thing um let's see you know on
paper there's a saying in spanish paper
paper test stands with anything you know
let me just test it first and obviously
by the way Michael Fisher is on the show
floor he will be able to have all the
hands-on times that we need and will
most likely see a couple of videos go
live in the next couple of hours so Mike
will definitely answer all our questions
about this phone very soon um I thought
LG was some kind of had some kind of
better screen technology you know LG
does ok so IPS technology is LG
technology you see it on every I
phone and every iPad in the market ever
since their inception so yes they do
have a million good creating technology
oh yeah screen video time again so yeah
LG does have good good screen technology
and by the way for those people to think
that we're LG haters I have a for LG TVs
in my house actually the two biggest
ones and most expensive our LG and I am
extremely satisfied with my TV's I have
nothing against LG it's just that they
have not been able to provide a really
compelling smartphone right yet yeah
they make great products and other
markets but cell phone industry they're
not doing quite as well as samsung or
HTC they're not up to that standard yet
I guess they seemed to be kind of I mean
okay I take that back they've done
several breakthroughs they were the
first with a dual core smartphone I
think first one else no not LTE because
HTC was the first for the LTE but they
were first with a dual core smartphone
they were first with 1080p if i'm not
mistaken yeah it were the first in
several different categories if you ever
they were they were referring to ed you
remember the 3d display they reversed
with 3d they've done so many different
things they're quick to jump on new
things but they're really not that great
at refining things yeah they're graded
just bursting through the doors with a
new technology and not really getting
behind it you know it seems like if the
hardware department doesn't get along
with the softcore the department um
because you know for some reason I do
love LG design they design really cool
phones but the problem is that their
software implementation is nothing as
cool that's what the phone looks like I
mean I the optimus G was a cool phone it
looked physically cool it look really
nice yeah take the negative or for
example hardware great software great
guess who didn't touch the software LG
LG yeah seriously let me see other
comments here your uh let me see iphone
for the win now honestly
yeah yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry uh
listeners reader is the only reason why
I'm using this phone right now is
because my lumia 1020 hasn't arrived yet
uh and no yeah this was the Windows
Phone hater that you knew um sadly my
excuses for not using Windows Phone
pretty much ended how has your
experience been with it with a 1020 so
far on a cyclic and I'm still trying to
find alternatives for all the apps I use
I still have to use an android phone
alongside because I need google plus I
need hangouts and there are some
alternatives for old google talk clients
but it's not really hang out so i mean
i'm having to deal with alternatives
which are not ever really quite as great
as the original other than that i love
it speeds are great battery life is not
bad i just ordered the camera grip the
display is fine the camera is phenomenal
so I've enjoyed it yeah from LG only the
nexus 4 was worth it watching you from
Brazil Gustavo us thank you Gustavo for
watching from Brazil uh I really cannot
pronounce your name I'm really sorry but
the Nexus 5 is going to be cool that's
though yeah you're right it will does
this have a nano-sim yeah it has an an
ocean okay you're going to the sodas
iced tea yeah cording to a leak user
manual it will have a nano-sim so uh why
why why you prob the thing is we're
phone swampers so for me I guess my prom
with the nano-sim is that you know on
devices like HTC I can't like cut the
the nano SIM and then use the old
portion of the sin as an adapter because
it'll get stuck within the scent ray
what I don't know if you can see that
yeah yeah so I have to use an adapter
almost every single day yeah same here
well the thing is I think it's not in
several samsung phones that's my problem
that's my problem so what I do is that I
keep the nano-sim in the iphone and what
I did is I got a another phone line and
that's the second phone that i use and
then I keep as a micro-sim and that's
the one that I swap around every
day so yeah I'm usually I do keep an
iphone around and handy because so far
this is sadly still the best camera that
I have still waiting for the 1020 I was
uh I was gonna sell my iphone 5 I told
Brandon the other day I said I'm selling
my iphone 5 he said you can't I will not
allow you to sell your iphone 5 why not
because I I think he wants me to review
the the new iphone yeah we'll see i
think i think Fisher wanted the new
iphone 4 review we'll see oh he wouldn't
let me sell mine so yeah well see Wow ok
guys motors cool but it's not a first
it's not a Hearst um now me you I or my
UI or however you want to pronounce it
has guest mode its head guest mode for
years probably two and a half three
years yeah for whoever hates my t-shirt
sorry you know i'm sorry i'm not gonna
dig it off in the comments uh how's the
camera of the Lumia 1020 we already
heard that um Daniel Seifert from the
verge on Twitter said LG has gone off
the deep end someone called the psych
ward oh sorry oh look at that so there's
a special gesture for the guest mode was
that the implemented as well on the
other one I don't know I didn't see it
what was the gesture so you know you can
re-edit it with more fingers well
apparently you can define two different
gestures to unlock your phone one for
your normal mode and another for guest
mode that's cool well the guest mode on
me you i erm I you I was in the
notification shade you just pull it down
and hit fence and it was basically just
lets you control what other people could
see or use okay so but which which found
that used with guest mode oh it was it
was a custom rom oh okay yeah becca and
and android has multiple user support
built-in so yeah the new uh multiple
user support is actually quite awesome
with restricted profiles yeah can
control individually what apps people
use
yeah i'm actually using it on the on the
you know i still have the old generation
Nexus 7 I haven't been able to get the
new one and it's it's good it's good
it's good okay what 11 what I love about
this phone is that there's literally no
bezel um where is it oh yeah knock to
turn on and turn off your phone nock on
the string nock on the screen oh wow oh
um there were like four people that
clamped yeah I think they're what okay
so no bezel here is the Xperia ZL you
want to know bezel experience this is
your ha you need a volume rocker on the
back of that phone I'm a oh yeah you're
right you're right I'm sorry I'm sorry
alright so let's go through some more
comments of Vienna's Boys Choir being a
boy's choir singing a summer of the
ringtone i had never heard that before
um you can hear them right now if you
listen to the audio oh god somebody's
gonna sing Oh up there doing the
performance this is the Vienna Boys
Choir listen why this LG do everything
that Samsung does I don't know if
Samsung didn't do anything this creepy
these people the Vienna Boys Choir have
made the ringtones for the g2 all rights
this is what you would hear if somebody
calls you this song is playing right now
is what you would hear somebody calls
you ok so true travel ization is asking
I still don't understand what is the
learning from your point I am sorry none
of us can uh because as the buttons at
the back are not learning from me
particularly I don't look I don't know I
don't look for my buns at the back no
bezel your palm I touch the screen by
accident yeah well I don't really have
enough column with the Xperia ZL well
mark Flores tweeted huge LG g2 just gave
birth to a singing boy
that makes my abs hurt oh so these
asking so I guess we go for it a boot to
edge right Hyneman Taylor uh I don't
know uh I'd love to see that oh boo to
edge get released first I would be lying
if I said I knew really anything about
that phone I've been so crazy busy over
the last two weeks I don't know because
i've been playing video games on the
Nvidia shield and dealing with this
thing how is that thing by the way uh
I'll some with not a lot of games so
wait a second you have to use the Tegra
though the TegraZone on that thing yeah
basically use the shield store you can
play other games but not all of them
actually very important if they don't
have yeah so then you're playing really
weird like a combination of on-screen
and using a controller is it like it's
really good for racing because you can
turn the controller which is actually
really nice too bad you didn't have this
one to compare I'm glad I didn't have
that phone when I worked at a dog I was
sent that phone for a review or
something and I'm just like at I don't
want to touch it I don't know is it just
me or is the e event pretty much over I
hope it is what is it just me or is the
event pretty much over I hope it is I
think it's pretty much over I think it
is I think it is okay so and if it's not
we're just gonna go through a last round
of comments I guess sorry samsung is
cheesy LG is creepy yes you are right
we're reading some comments here first
time broadcast for me on you too okay
why don't they sell the nexus one
central america they're asking in
Spanish vivillon um sadly that's a
google policy buddy I have to have to
buy it with a VPN online uh marques
Brownlee from mkbhd on YouTube tweeted
LG just tried to out-weird samsung at
the end of the LG to event sorry ok
everybody the event is thankfully over
um the seats are clearing out pretty
quickly I think the seats were already
cleared out and they're just all right
so we have a new device a new smartphone
that we have no clue what it's going to
get launched we have no clue only
t-mobile's that said was gonna be
carrying it right yeah officially all I
heard was tmobile up to check out
Stephen but uh who did we get a spice I
we didn't get a price point uh yeah
listen not sorry it's if we're extremely
underwhelmed it's because sadly this
device is nothing innovative we I guess
we were expecting a lot with all the
fanfare and all the teasers that we got
you know a phone that would learn from
you sadly we still don't understand what
LG thinks that learning from you means
um and again you know don't get me wrong
the phone is very beautiful the design
is pretty um it looks very elegant up
sadly the software is gonna be this you
know it's really going to be the selling
point that the specifications are great
yeah they're awesome but we didn't get a
lot of information on the phone we were
told like it learns you how yeah it may
have been because I was paying more
attention to you but I didn't hear an
explanation of that once through that
whole presentation we were trying to
Fayette exit but i don't know i think we
were just not trying to get bored and
sadly LG ended up pulling a samsung by
the end of the by the end of the show so
anyways also i should miss operators
it's on all four okay we got that from
what the bid on twitter which is stephen
 and constant and SQ trust oh I got
it constant and SQ cool dude he's uh his
guest he's been a guest on the podcast
before yeah really cool guy really cool
guy so anyways final impressionists
Taylor are you getting this phone no ok
so i guess the last question that's left
for you readers and viewers to this are
you getting this phone is the LG g2
something that you're interested on um
and my particular opinion just like I do
on every pocket now daily I will sadly
have to tell
no there is no reason for me to wait for
this phone if I know that the galaxy s4
is already better than this phone and
the HTC One and the sadly you know I
just do see that the you know at least I
know that the nexus 5 or nexus for next
generation is going to be a pretty phone
because it'll most likely be you know
they'll most likely use this film to
base it on and it'll probably be called
the Nexus 5 because of the new display
size I would well yeah I'd love for it
to be a 5-inch phone the nexus 5 but I
want to amend my answer no I will not
buy this phone in its current form if it
turns out to be like the Nexus 4 was to
the optimus G then yes I'll buy the
nexus 5 but with all these phones on the
horizon the only one that I'm really
looking forward to is the note 3 because
after all this time I'm still using the
note 2 I mean I'm not using it currently
because i'm reviewing v z ultra but ya
know two is monday lee driver alongside
the Lumia 1020 yeah you know I'm really
sad for LG I do commend them for trying
um I just you know a little tip for the
LG executives please have your software
Department visit the hardware guys
obviously we won't know if the software
is cool until we get it on our labs so
wait for a review unit and you can also
expect our hands on videos please do not
make your final opinions with this phone
just yet Michael Fisher will have all
the hands-on videos that we need plus
all the comparison videos that we need
very shortly so stay tuned for that and
probably we will be getting a review
unit today not really sure Taylor you're
gonna say something um yes i'm looking
through the the stream of youtube
comments and it's just flying by but i
just saw like 40 nose and one yes for ya
are you getting this oh wait a second
let me let me try to refresh sure each
other and then someone else commented
knocks on phone to wake it up breaks
glass oh there's somebody here saying
hell no yeah no no no no ok create a
build a site for us to vote no ok hell
no ok no I'm getting an HTC One max no
nothing really here to see absolutely no
um I would wait for the nexus 5
I have no no Nexus 5 no note uh come on
use another world like like that for
itself I think that speaks for itself
yeah yeah sadly I'm not not really good
showmanship is willing I think LG come
up just a bit short this time and and
the showmanship in this event was very
strange it very awkward yeah Aaron and I
don't know how to take it so anyway stay
I am going to go on my google play music
all access and listen to some singing
choir boys for a few hours just kill
anyways Taylor any final thoughts before
we go um nice try LG but you're not
gonna win me over this time okay viewers
you can follow mr. Taylor martinet
Casper tech on Twitter and any other any
other place google+ is your favorite
yeah google+ and twitter just search my
name and the guy with the hat and and
look out on the site for us the ultra
content over the next week or so as well
as nvidia shield review at summit
whenever i get around to it i can't wait
for that i really can't wait for your
review i mean for the price point of the
Nvidia shield I can't wait for that but
I am hi Natalie wet i thank you very
much for watching can follow me on
twitter to hang underscore iveta um I
don't really use Google+ that much so
don't bother there just follow me on
Twitter just follow me on Twitter that's
gonna be enough um that's pretty much it
my final thoughts are in the same line
as Taylor oh my god we have to be new
comments of people saying no its just oh
yeah no no Mike Hales though okay my
final thoughts are I like the design I'm
gonna wait until Michael shows us his
hands on videos and first impressions
will most likely hear about this on the
podcast during the rest of the week I
wouldn't be surprised if you put like a
Twilight song like The Twilight Zone
playing in the background seriously you
know just oh so again we've got a lot of
editorials coming up on everything that
we saw and you pretty much already more
it is on this thing you can expect more
hands-on videos from Michael coming up
comparison videos and you can expect a
lot of commentary about this phone on
the podcast if we do have a lot
things to talk about so far we didn't
get much from the event both very much
for watching yeah good I was just going
to me this week is a special podcast oh
yes we've got reader how many reader
males have we skipped on the podcast at
least four because we've been on it at
least the last three oh ok just a teaser
for everybody this podcast will be
special because almost every one of us
is going to be on the podcast trying to
respond to all the questions that we've
got clogged in the tools for the longest
time so please join our podcast then we
will try to dedicate at least 30 seconds
to the LG g2 we promise we promise so
