now calm in the last HTC droid
incredible video we took a look at the
sense interface and HTC widgets so in
this video we'll be focusing on some of
the other features found on the device
like live wallpapers camera and video
settings apps multi-touch usage and
flash implementation in the browser so
one of my favorite features of android
2.1 is the live wallpapers it instantly
spruces up the home screen with animated
and sometimes interactive backgrounds it
does consume slightly more battery but
for many people it's one of those
features where you're willing to give up
some of that precious battery life in
favor of some eye candy so the wallpaper
i currently have enabled is probably my
favorite it's basically a pond and when
you tap on the screen you can see that
it interacts with the wallpaper and has
this cool little ripple effect also
there are some leaves that float along
the water so let's check out some other
wallpapers will go to live wallpapers
the first one is called galaxy which i
guess is cool if you're into astronomy
and will go back to the lot of
wallpapers this one's called grass this
one's neat because the blades of grass
will actually move like there's a slight
breeze and the background will change
depending on the time of day so when the
sun is out it'll be a light blue color
when the sun goes up or it goes down
there'll be an orange tint and at night
you'll see a dark background so very
cool HTC Sense this is HTC's custom
wallpaper with spotlights that move
around and fluctuating colors in the
background very retro magic smoke this
is one of my favorites too because you
have many choices and color combinations
so let's check them out
so again many choices this one is for
music fans it actually interacts with
your music player so the needle will
bounce around and the wavelengths will
fluctuate let's actually test this out I
have the music player muted right now
but as you can see it's moving with the
beat go back to the live wallpapers maps
will basically put the google maps right
in your background and it has a cool
factor to it but it's going to use a
more battery because it has to locate
where you are polar clock if you want to
unique clock on your background spectrum
another wallpaper that interacts with
your music player here's that meter you
can see the needle bouncing around and
waveform which is a visually visually
loud wallpaper so those were live
wallpapers let's actually go to the app
tray and check out some of the apps that
come loaded on the device we have a
calculator we have shortcuts to calendar
and call history the video camera camera
which will cover later car panel which
is a finger friendly way to access some
options that you would want in your car
we have footprints for geotagging photos
google navigation which has turn by turn
voice directions google voice search
google maps text search and you can have
some calling options
city ID clocks Facebook FM radio you'll
need to plug in a set of headphones to
act as an antenna footprints live stream
french stream I mean which is your
social networking client the Gmail
application internet browser male Google
Maps Android Market PDF viewer your
music player peep which is HTC's Twitter
client quickoffice is wha an application
for viewing your documents and
spreadsheets office related items google
talk teeter is a labyrinth type game
voice dialer is cool because you can
make calls and and open applications
using your voice here's a visual
voicemail application as you can see you
can easily play messages just by going
to this area of your device voice
recorder which has same interface as the
FM radio google voice search the weather
application and the standard YouTube
application so some nice applications
here if we go to the android market you
can see that verizon has its own little
section for V CAST apps here we have
skype mobile which i believe is limited
to verizon customers at the moment NFL
mobile for football fans my verizon is
for viewing account information visual
voicemail verizon wireless tones for
searching and buying ringtones vcast
media manager is to manage content
between your device and your computer
and the rest look like they're just
recommended
occasions so those are the apps on the
device moving on the droid incredible
does support multitouch HTC has actually
implemented a cool multi-touch gesture
for easily jumping from one side of the
home screen to another you just pinch on
the screen and then you select a
different screen so it's very convenient
of course multi-touch is all the rage
these days because of the ability to
pinch zoom on pictures and in the
internet browser so let's first check it
out in pictures this photo looks good we
can pinch to zoom in and pinch to zoom
out you can also double tap to zoom in
and out if you prefer to do it that way
so let's check it out in the internet
browser and here we are at pocketnow.com
so we can just zoom in and as you can
see the text reflows nicely with the
screen here you can double tap as well
so that's pinch to zoom so let's
actually go back to the browser and
check out some flash implementation I'm
going to do this by going to flash calm
and I'll use voice recognition software
flash calm as you can see it filled out
flash calm quickly I'll press ENTER and
load up the adobe website
alright it looks like it's done
rendering here we have some content
below and some flash video should start
playing in a second this is over
verizon's 3g network
alright so it's not the smoothest but as
you can see it does play and it works so
let's go home and finally let me give
you a rundown of the camera settings the
incredible does have an 8 megapixel
autofocus camera with dual-led flash so
we'll give you a glimpse at the settings
click camera and here we can set the
flash settings if you want it to be on
auto on or off you can zoom in easily by
pressing that and using the touch screen
this will pull up the picture album here
we can switch between photo and video
brightness settings contrast saturation
sharpness settings we can add some
effects like grayscale sepia negative
Solarize in case you want to pretend
you're the predator poster eyes aqua
here we can change some other settings
like white balance camera resolution
again it is an 8 megapixel camera you
can set if you want widescreen or
standard image quality timer geotag
photos metering mode the review duration
turn on auto focus shutter sound time
stamp and grid let's go to the video
settings these three are basically the
same let's go down here we can record in
wvga that's 800 x 480 vga CIF key vga
recording length in case you don't want
to use up all of your storage recording
a really long
video and the rest look about the same
so let's actually take a picture of an
object to go to photo and you just tap
on the screen to zoom in and then you
press the joypad button in to take the
picture so there's a shot of that you
can also take the picture by tapping and
holding on the screen let's try it again
ah there we go and we get some extra
settings like going back to the camera
deleting sharing which we can share with
Bluetooth facebook flickr gmail mail
messaging twitter and picasa so some
nice features there so this was part two
of our software tour for the HTC droid
