going to take a look at the samsung
intrepid on sprint's network so first
we're going to do an unboxing and then
we're going to take a hardcore tour and
then compare the device to other devices
on the market right now so let's go
ahead and do the unboxing of the
intrepid so in the box when you open it
up you have the phone go ahead and take
it out and put it aside for justice back
in we have a charger which is actually
an energy star rated charger so it
actually conserves energy when it's not
charging which is a great thing for the
environment we have a USB sync cable to
connect to your computer head thumbs and
some manuals go ahead and take a look
and see what's included in the manual
sheet of paper asking you to give your
feedback to spring about your new phone
looks like some terms of the Terms of
Service Agreement a pouch to recycle
your old phone which is a great green
move made by Sprint and Samsung product
registration a getting started manual
and a manual on how to set up your email
guides to some of the features and then
a basic guide it should also be noted
that most of these guys are also
available in Spanish on the reverse side
as well so let's go ahead and put this
all signed and do a hardware tour of the
samsung intrepid the intrepid is a
windows mobile 6.5 device that has a
full qwerty keyboard on the bottom
hardware navigation keys and a
two-and-a-half-inch resistive
touchscreen display so unlike a
blackberry it actually has the keyboard
and eight
screen on the front it also has this
tungsten dark chrome that surrounds the
front face on the right side of the
device you have the lanyard loop a power
button soft reset pole a camera button
and the stylists is actually on the site
on this device rather than on the bottom
so you pull it out and it's a
collapsible stylist on the bottom you
have a clean surface with a microphone
and then on the other side of the device
you have a micro USB charging port
underneath this plastic flap up and down
volume controls on the top you have a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack go ahead and take a look at the
back of the device you have a
self-portrait near a 3.2 megapixel
camera speaker grill and then we're
going to remove the battery and see
what's below you have a fourteen eighty
milliamp per hour battery which is of
sizable sizable capacity and a sim card
for global roaming so this device will
perform on sprint cdma ev-do rev a
network at home and will be on gsm /
HSPA networks for global roaming let's
go ahead and compare the device to other
devices here we have the blackberry tour
compared to the tour the device is
actually slightly wider and longer than
the tour it's about the same thickness
the larger size is actually great
because you have this large contiguous
keyboard there are no spacing between
the keyboard but it actually works quite
well next to its cousin the samsung jack
on
tese network this device is actually a
windows mobile 6.1 standard device
meaning that it has the keyboard but no
touchscreen the samsung jack is a lot
narrower and a little bit shorter but
about the same thickness both devices
feel about the same in weight and over
here we have the verizon wireless
omaggio which doesn't have a keyboard
but has a full three point six inch
touchscreen compared to the imagio the
Sprint intrepid is actually still a
little bit wider although it's tapered
back does help make it feel a little bit
slimmer and it is still a little bit
taller the intrepid the biggest of all
the devices actually feels good it's
actually light it doesn't feel heavy the
keyboard actually has a nice click to it
and we're going to cover some of the
shortcuts that the keyboard offers in
the software tour as well that could
screen is actually a cue vga resolution
so it's 320 x 240 in landscape mode and
you can also scroll through so this is
chun win and we're taking a first look
at the samsung intrepid thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
