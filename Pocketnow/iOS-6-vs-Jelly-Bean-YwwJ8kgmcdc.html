pocket now calm in this video we're
gonna compare and throw a jelly bean on
the Galaxy Nexus with iOS 6 on the
iPhone 5 let's get to it so we're going
to cover 6 different areas in this
comparison video we're gonna cover home
screens notifications app stores cloud
services built-in apps and voice
services obviously these are two very
different platforms and they've changed
and evolved little by little over time
and today they have grown kind of even
further apart and yet in some ways
they've grown closer together like in
notifications so let's start off by
unlocking both devices and what you're
going to notice right off the bat is
that here on the Galaxy Nexus
I have no unlock screen you have that
choice in Android you can have slide to
unlock you can have pin unlock pattern
unlock face unlock or no unlock at all
or you can get a third party app that
allows you to overtake the built-in
unlock screen really have it customized
however you want and iOS 6 all you can
do is have a slide to unlock or a pin
unlock some like care some might not
it's just a lock screen just pointing
out the differences here so one of the
hallmarks of Android has always been its
customized ability in terms of widgets
on the home screen whereas iOS 6 and iOS
5 and I was four and three and two and
one have always been about icons
although in a previous generation of iOS
iOS 5 Apple added two widgets to the
notification shade we're going to talk
about that in a second so of course an
Android you know this you can take a
wide variety of widgets thousands of
widgets that you can download you can
customize them you can resize them and
they can provide real life functionality
on your home screens so that you don't
always have to go in and out of apps
which is what you have to do in iOS so
of course an iOS and Android just like
you've been able to do for a while you
can create folders
although folders open a lot faster in
Android so for example if we make a new
folder here look at the difference here
in Android they open instantly iOS you
get that fancy animation what
you want it or not okay so that's
homescreens that's been the same story
for a while now something that's changed
in iOS 6 and jelly beans the
notification shade one of the strengths
of Android has always been this
Notification Center or notification
shade they really named never came up
with a brilliant name for it where you
can pull down and you can see a lot of
information at your fingertips and in
Ice Cream Sandwich they added the
ability to swipe off individual
notifications and in jellybean they
added sort of live notifications and so
if you have a missed call it will say
call back if you've got some email
messages you can sort of see many
previews right on the screen here which
really adds a lot of usability to your
notification shade and of course you can
clear all your notifications with one
press in iOS 6 now you have some new
options in the notification shade you
can tap to tweet or tap to add a
Facebook post which is a really great
idea if you really are busy on social
networks there's two new widgets well
they're not really new for iOS 6 they've
been there since iOS 5 weather and
stocks that's the only two widgets you
can add the world has been crying and
calling out for developers to be able to
tap into this because how cool would it
be if you could have say a words with
friends widget or or think of your
favorite app showing live information up
there speaking of words with friends it
looks like it's my move and this is how
iOS 6 does notifications you cannot
swipe them off the screen if you tap on
them you will go right into that area
and it will disappear if you action on
it the trouble is with the notifications
and iOS 6 is that if you have four mail
messages and you want to only swipe away
two of them you cannot do that it's
all-or-nothing you hit the X this tiny X
which is impossible to hear you hit you
hit it twice and then it moves off the
screen so notifications are still
superior and Android in fact I spend a
lot of time in the notification chain in
andra just because it's kind of this
real center hub that acts on my terms
and kind of acts as a rolling to-do list
for what I need to action on next thing
what I talk about here is the App Store
so we're going to the Play Store and
over here in the iOS App Store and one
thing that Apple does differently
compared to Android is that Apple has
different stores this is the App Store
if you want to go to the iTunes Store
that's a completely different place to
go you go into here this is where you go
for your books and for your movies well
actually that's where you go for your
movies and for your TV shows and music
and then if you want to download a book
and I bought Gora
or a newspaper you go into newsstand yet
another store so really lots of
different places and you could say that
this is actually part of the main store
but that's not the parent and Android
brilliantly Google has put everything
under one roof apps music magazines
movies and TV shows and books everything
is within one one spot new for iOS 6 is
a redesigned app store and let's compare
the search experience we're gonna go
here search and search and we are going
to type Facebook where's just start
typing faizal's compare the search
experiences so here in jelly bean the
second result is the actual Facebook
match so you can go directly towards
that or you can go into search results
over here on the iPhone you hit Facebook
and it takes you to the search results
and you can only see now in iOS 6 you
can only see one item at a time
so if you get a so if you get results
with 75 apps you're gonna be swiping a
lot as you can see there are seven
thousand three hundred and eleven apps
here that I have to scroll through to
see them there's no way to change the
display but if we were to go to the
basic Facebook search results here you
just scroll down the screen scroll down
and just flip through but some may say
that now in iOS 6 when you actually tap
on the app it's an improved user
interface so we've got these nice little
screenshots here everything seems to be
colored differently there's gray
backgrounds and white backgrounds and
different tabs here just a really nice
display a really spur stuff app store in
iOS 6 although I've got to say that the
Google Play Store is faster especially
to find things because everything is
under one roof and it seems to be just
easier to navigate especially if you're
searching through a lot of applications
okay so now let's talk about cloud
services this is idea of storing things
in the cloud so you don't always have to
back them up and so thats things are
synchronous
across multiple devices iCloud is
expanded in iOS 6 as you can see these
are all the things you can synchronize
documents and photos photo stream of
course the basic mail contacts counter
reminders things that you've been able
to do in android but they've had things
like notes passbook and of course you
can do a backup right from your device
every day now in Android there's not
that much flexibility in terms of cloud
options offered by Google but there's a
third-party app to do everything for
example you can get Dropbox to act like
photo stream so you take a picture on
your Galaxy Nexus or any Android phone
that you might be using and it will go
into the Dropbox cloud it'll show up on
your your Android tablet on your PC on
your Mac whatever you have it's the same
exact thing or notes there's ever notes
for for Android it does the exact same
thing as notes here but some might say
in an even more powerful way so an
Android is kind of plug and play you you
have to download different apps to do
different things and those particular
third-party apps might very well be more
powerful than what you get in iCloud but
the great thing about iCloud is that
everything is here everything works very
well sometimes there's an outage but
Apple has done a great job with making
iCloud a one-stop solution for backing
up your data and keeping it synchronized
across multiple devices ok now let's
talk about web browsers of course on
both of these devices you can get
third-party web browsers like opera like
Chrome but let's just talk about the
built in stock browser so let's open
them at the same time open a little bit
faster here in iOS 6 and from here you
get a very similar experience at the end
of the day you've got a tabs button
here's a tabs button down here you open
up your bookmarks kind of with an extra
press you press the three dots and then
you go to bookmarks whereas in iOS 6 you
just press bookmarks and there you go so
speaking of which let's actually just go
to pocketnow.com and see you know these
browsers display the page perhaps a
little bit differently they go at the
same time although this is not a speed
test necessarily because these have very
different internals and we're just
comparing the kind of experiences of the
operating system so here we go
they're coming through and
if it matters the iphone5 finished first
we found the iPhone 5 so far to beat out
every device we've tested this against
even the quad-core Galaxy s3 so that is
very impressive ok they're both done yet
similar browsing experience in typical
iOS fashion the scrolling is a little
bit notchy a little bit slower in other
words in jelly bean you can do one flick
go all the way to the bottom all the way
at the top that's just not really
possible in iOS 6
so we zoom in zoom in let's let go
clears up faster here in iOS 6 and let's
check out how landscape looks so here we
are in landscape we both get pretty full
screen views here there's an option to
hide the the status bar at the top of
the screen but in iOS 6 now you have
this full screen view except for when
you get to the top of the screen then
you actually see the information there
something they didn't do in iOS 6 which
is frustrating is that they didn't
combine the URL bar with the search bar
they still have it over here and in
Android this top bar doubles as a search
bar so you don't have to choose between
whether you put a search here or just
put it in the generic URL bar so very
good web browsing performance in both
jellybean does that make huge strides in
making the device devices that run the
operating system feel a lot faster and
they certainly succeeded in doing so
finally let's compare voice services
we've Google now with jellybean and
we've got Siri with iOS 6 they're
different because who will not actually
goes a step further by suggesting things
for you it'll tell you how long it'll
take to drive back home before you drive
back home it'll start to remember where
you live where you work it can bring up
relevant context sensitive information
which is great
Siri is just something that you have to
initiate for it to do anything but let's
test it out
what's the weather going to be tomorrow
okay
faster here on the Galaxy Nexus in that
case we get a multi-day forecast in both
cases which is nice let's let's ask it
something else set alarm for 7:00 a.m.
tomorrow so iron alarms and reminders
only support time of day but not dates
okay so there's a limitation let's do
something else
what's 4000 divided by 286 all right
Android got it faster seems that I Oh s6
is is having a little trouble here
overall Google now is a lot more
responsive and more consistent than Siri
it seems to always work and not only
does it always work but you can speak
really fast and it converts it extremely
quickly it looks like a total Siri fail
here we're not even going to let it
finish so we're just going to stop it
where it is but let's do one more test
how old is Mitt Romney 65 years old
beautiful nice little picture date of
birth over here in iOS 6 we get kind of
a printout from WolframAlpha still tells
you how old he is right yep
65 years 6 months and 11 days and it was
a little bit slower but there are
obviously limitations to what Google now
can do like it cannot access certain
part of your phones like Siri can so
both of these operating systems are very
different it would seem that Android is
more progressive it helps you in a lot
of ways get things done more quickly
with fewer steps whereas iOS 6 is what
you see what you get it is familiar it
is stable it is reliable which is not to
say that Android is not reliable in fact
with jellybean something dramatic has
changed jellybean suddenly has brought
the operating system to the level of the
reliability and the smoothness of iOS
there I say that so it's it's it's
getting very close in terms of which
operating system provides the smoothest
best most reliable experience it's just
a matter of how much you want to
customize and how much you want to live
in different ecosystems versus just
apples ecosystem so really it's up to
you there are particular features that
you want us to compare of these two
great operating systems let us know in
the comments and we'll do our best to
put up the follow-up video please give
us a thumbs up for this video if you
liked it and thanks for watching that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
