shown us their upcoming versions of
their mobile operating systems Android L
and iOS 8 respectively which is the
better update which has the cooler
features I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is Android L versus
iOS 8 visually Android got the larger
treatment in this update the UI overhaul
for iOS came last year with iOS 7 in
which Apple cleaned up the 3d elements
flattened the visuals and gave the
entire interface a more visible
hierarchy iOS 8 on the other hand looks
virtually identical to iOS 7 not much
has changed visually with the exception
of a few minor tweaks like Notification
Center or spotlight search this year
Google introduced a new design language
for Android called
material design in contrast to recent
years where practically all software
designs have become monotonous ly flat
and bland Google took strides to find a
middle ground between overdone
skeuomorph sand utterly flat UIs Android
L has depth and almost every tap results
in a water like ripple it's somewhere
between the new since six or LG's custom
UI both of which we've really enjoyed
and KitKat
one of the biggest visual changes in the
upcoming Android release is the
notification shade it's been more
closely integrated with the lockscreen
any pending notifications you have will
appear on the lock screen and they can
be swiped away or double tapped to be
opened swiping down from the top edge of
the display from the lockscreen
or when there are no notifications the
quick settings panel will appear this
looks a lot like the custom shade from
Asus there is now a brightness slider in
quick toggles for Wi-Fi Bluetooth
orientation lock casting the screen
airplane mode notifications and location
there are many minor and major tweaks
from top to bottom in this version of
Android the soft navigation buttons for
example are also different triangle for
back circle for home and square for
recent apps as far as the settings go
we like the direction both operating
systems are headed it took us a while to
warm up to the pastels of iOS 7 but both
OS s are looking better than ever and we
can't wait to see the finished products
many of the most important changes for
both operating systems however are
behind the scenes this is probably more
true
for ios8 since it arguably needed the
update the most the two big features
you'll see in iOS 8 are continuity and
extensibility continuity is what will
make all of your Apple products work
together better in the future you'll be
able to start typing a message on your
iPad and finish from your iPhone or
start an email on your Mac in the mail
app and finish from the iPad you'll be
able to answer calls from your iPhone on
your desktop or open a document you've
been editing on your iPad on your Mac
using iCloud drive there'll be a lot of
extended functionality and
interoperability between Apple devices
once iOS 8 and Yosemite are ready for
consumer release but a much more
important feature is what Apple calls
extensibility or in short the ability
for third-party developers to integrate
their applications deeper into iOS you
will soon be able to share pictures to
Evernote from within the Photos app
share to your third-party Twitter client
from Safari or open iCloud Drive files
in Dropbox all without ever leaving the
app third-party keyboards are also on
the way alongside Apple's new predictive
text keyboard that means gesture typing
on iOS as well as unusual keyboards like
my personal favorite menuhim Android has
its fair share behind the scenes magic
too one is project Volta or a strong
focus on better battery life from the
same team that brought the vast
improvements of project butter in this
you will find a battery saver mode in
the battery usage menu as well as more
in-depth information on what's eating
your battery other battery improvements
are present as well google also
announced Android L will operate
entirely on art runtime no more dalvik
and it comes with 64-bit compatibility
even more all the animations and visuals
run at 60 frames per second
like continuity on iOS Android will work
more closely with Chrome OS you'll be
able to run Android apps on Chrome OS
and notifications like battery state
text message calls Google now etc will
also sing in short Android is running
buttery smooth and has a team dedicated
to improving battery life and iOS will
soon give third-party developers some
control over the user experience
crazy right that isn't although both
Android L and iOS 8 come with a handful
of other user focused features iOS for
instance takes families into
consideration with a family share
feature you'll be able to set up family
accounts in iTunes linking various
iTunes account
to one main account so everyone in the
family can share purchases from iTunes
and the App Store no longer will
families need to buy multiples of the
same apps songs movies or books
spotlight now delivers inline
information cards from various sources
simply begin typing and spotlight will
provide nearby locations Wikipedia pages
IMDB entries and other information right
from within spotlight and so long as
your iOS device is charging you can
activate Siri hands-free finally for
quick access to your favorite and recent
contacts that will be located above the
application previews in the recent apps
menu double press the home button and
tap a contact icon to interact with that
contact one of the coolest Android L
features is personal unlocking like
Motorola's trusted devices on its 2013
flagships you will be able to set
particular trusted environments your
home Wi-Fi specific Bluetooth devices or
your Android wear watch to bypass your
device security for those looking to
separate work from play Google will also
incorporate Samsung's Knox security
features into all Android devices
heads-up notifications on Android or
actionable notifications on iOS are also
coming in both updates without leaving
the app you're in you will be able to
enter specific notifications flick an
SMS banner notification down to quickly
reply from within the current app or
dismiss an incoming call on Android
without leaving the app iOS 8 will also
cater to fitness and health fanatics
with health kit the application doesn't
do bunch now but will with compatible
hardware the same could be said for
google fit a health focused set of api's
for better health tracking the more
google and apple update the mobile
operating systems a more like they
become between KitKat and the not yet
named Android L release and iOS 7 and
iOS 8 Android and iOS are nearly
blow-for-blow both look incredible run
better than ever and are addressing
their biggest shortcomings to date the
final releases of both of these updates
can't come soon enough
