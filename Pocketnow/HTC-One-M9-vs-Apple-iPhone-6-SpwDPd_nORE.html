consumers waffling between iOS and
Android the choice can be a tough one
because each is a solid product in its
own right I'm Michael Fisher and today
on PocketNow it's a high-end smartphone
showdown HTC One m9 vs. Apple iPhone 6
by now many folks are pretty clear on
the distinction between Apple's iOS and
Google's Android platforms but for the
sake of completeness we'll quickly touch
on them globally Android is by far the
bigger player with almost 80% market
share to apples 15% in the United States
that distribution is far more even with
nearly a 50/50 split between the two as
of January 2015 the ecosystem situation
mirrors that both platforms are very
healthy with Android leading the way a
number of available apps but each app
store boasting over a million titles
apiece
the upshot if there's an app on one
platform odds are it's also going to be
on the other the real differences are
found in the interface comparison which
hasn't changed much over the past few
years either broadly speaking
performance and fluidity is almost
identical now the real disparity is in
philosophy Apple's iOS is the more
locked down and arguably the simpler of
the two while Android is the more
expandable and customizable that's
especially true in the case of these
specific phones the m9 doesn't just run
Android it runs HTC's Sense layer atop
it and that makes almost every corner of
the operating system tweakable you can
change fonts accent colors background
images almost anything you can think of
either by downloading a theme from HTC
or having the phone create one based on
a picture you download or a picture you
take you can use your lockscreen to show
you venue recommendations at mealtimes
or it build custom shortcut buttons into
your home key row so you don't have to
reach to the top of the screen to get
your notifications you can mix up your
homescreen with widgets to bring you
information at a glance and if none of
that appeals to you you can throw the
whole thing out and use a custom
launcher for
control over the look and feel if
Android is the experimental free spirit
then iOS is the set in its ways
traditionalist you can change the
wallpapers icon scale and the
notification sounds but otherwise it's
the same home screen we've seen for the
past eight years a grid of icons and
folders that serves as a launchpad into
various apps the closest thing you get
to a widget is the animated clock icon
if you're a fan of making a phone your
own this sounds dreary and conformist
but if you're more concerned with
simplicity then iOS absolutely delivers
there are nice usability touches here
and there
the swipe up control panel provides easy
one-handed access to system functions
and the iPhone has a fix of its own for
its tall screen in the reach ability
function and if you don't want to hunt
and peck for apps spotlight is just a
swipe away to quickly find the one
you're looking for or you can jump right
into a web search on the other side of
the display glass these phones basically
have one thing in common
aluminum the iPhone 6 definitely wins
some hardware points here it's shorter
and narrower and it's 32% thinner making
it more pocket-friendly
but also more fragile it's also rounded
on every edge which makes it
exceptionally comfortable in the hand
its volume and power standby keys are
placed on separate sides making them
easier to find by feel and there's a
manual mute switch too for quick
silencing the iPhone also bears a touch
ID fingerprint scanner that works
exceptionally well and beneath that sits
the port for the lightning cable it's a
proprietary Apple standard which is
annoying but the hardware itself is tiny
and reversible making it a little less
cumbersome than the m9 s USB but it's
subjective opinion alert the design
elements that Apple appropriated from
HTC are uglier on the iPhone the
embedded antenna channels following
corners that aren't really there by
contrast the one m9 keeps its antenna
arrays crisp and continuous the m9 s
display is also larger and much higher
in resolution and it can be activated
with a tap or a swipe if you don't want
to deal with the phone's crowded side
rail
speaking of the m9 offers microSD
expansion and an IR port while the
iPhone doesn't again Android is the more
versatile platform and it's impossible
to miss the twin Dolby optimized boom
sound speakers above and below the
display they don't get quite as loud as
the iPhones bottom firing port but they
do throw the sound right at your face
when you're watching a video playing a
game or taking a speaker phone call and
the faux surround sound makes for a much
more dynamic experience
the iPhone is often lauded as having one
of the best smartphone cameras on the
market no doubt thanks to its simplicity
and reliability the 8 megapixel iPhone
camera certainly doesn't take the cake
in specs here dwarfed as it is by the 20
megapixel monster and the one m9 but to
paraphrase dr. Dre pixels/inch that was
that was not cool sorry about that
anyway yeah there's no clearer way to
put it the iPhone wins this category
decisively tackling a low-light first as
I demonstrated in the full one m9 review
the HTC phone has more trouble keeping
focus that dimmer the light gets the m9
output is also much more prone to
digital noise even when night mode is
activated for a longer exposure
sometimes the difference is subtle other
times it's stark the m9 does
occasionally manage to produce a picture
that's brighter than the iPhones but
that's usually not a good thing because
there's so much heat on the lighted
areas that they get washed out the
iPhones example here is darker but it's
much easier to read the labels on the
individual bottles the iPhones low-light
superiority holds true in the shot of
the unofficial narragansett mascot the
m9 s photo is brighter but again we lose
the detail and we get a lot more fuzz I
didn't manage to find any low-light
situation where I preferred the m9 s
camera to the iPhones unless and this is
important if you take a lot of selfies
you're factoring the front-facing camera
into the equation where HTC's ultrapixel
FFC annihilates the iPhones puny selfie
cam back to the main cameras put your
lights on and things get a little closer
photos with dramatic contrasts and
colors are probably the closest to
equivalent here the more light you can
give each phone the better the results
will be in video mode with each phone
shooting at its maximum resolution 4k
for the HTC and 1080p for the iPhone I
don't like the wandering focus of the m9
but at least outdoors I do prefer its
richer color and higher contrast
the m9 also manages a few points with
its HDR mode which is much more
effective than Apple's and drawing out
highlights from darkened areas at the
cost of contrast and saturation now
importantly I did have a lot more fun
with the m9 if you follow me or
PocketNow on instagram you'll know that
I'm a huge fan of its various new
software effects in the review I call it
the most fun out of box smartphone
camera on the market but you can
duplicate a lot of those features with
an app on the iPhone and for the
purposes of this comparison comparing
raw photos side by side one after the
other
the iPhones advantage is real and it's
substantial finally the shortest of our
segments the day-to-day this is the part
of the comparison filled with the little
things the fact that the one m9 is a
little harsher on the ear with its sharp
corners but at least it doesn't pull
your hair out like the iPhone 6
trust me the struggle is real it hurts
to use and the architectural differences
between the Apple a8 chip and the
Snapdragon 810 are interesting from a
techie standpoint but for me the
differences are confined to benchmarks
even battery life seems to be comparable
on our demo units but one our m9 is not
a US model so our data is incomplete
there and - we always point you to the
full reviews for those details anyway
and the full reviews are where you
should go if you want to decide whether
either of these is the phone for you
because declaring a winner or loser here
is frankly stupid the iPhone 6 is the
best iPhone that's ever existed and it's
one of only two current generation
iPhones you can buy the HTC One m9 is
the epitome of premium Android hardware
and it's interface is the best you can
find outside of stock Android if you
throw specs out the window which you
should the deciding factors here our
platform ecosystem and camera so at the
risk of oversimplifying get apples bump
if you want a solid shooter and a
simpler experience get the HTC if you
want to be able to do more
and do it bigger one last time our full
review of each phone has much more
detail than we could have included here
