tragic that we have never reviewed an
item like this before
well that's all about to change as
PocketNow visits the king of gadget
pockets Scottevest
what would you do with 29 pockets I'm
Adam Dowd this is PocketNow and this is
a review of the Scottevest OTG jacket
Scottevest has made a name for itself in
this industry and hasn't gone completely
unnoticed by our sight in the interest
of disclosure I need to mention that
Scottevest sponsored the pocket not
weekly but it has been over a year since
that happened but put that aside and
this is a review that we've been looking
forward to doing carrying around a
gaggle of gadgets is often the task of a
backpack or a bag but what if you could
carry around everything you'd normally
carry in the bag just not in the bag the
Scottevest
OTG jacket is just such a garment
sporting 29 pockets designed to make the
most of your outerwear the OTG jacket is
cozy warm standing up to 30 minutes of
32 degrees check our weather waiting for
the train which is late again the
quilted pattern on the outside is not
our preferred look but if this were a
fashion video that might affect the
overall score but on the inside this
jacket is all about utility pockets for
your pens pockets for your glasses
pockets for your phone's pockets for
your tablets and yes a pocket for your
laptop you can carry everything you
might carry in a normal bag but without
the bag keeping everything neat and
organized at the same time most of your
pockets are located on the inside of the
coat or via to quick access zippers
there are two pockets for phones with
clear panels that do not affect touch in
the slightest
though fingerprint reading is spotty at
best accessing your phone as a short
zipper pull and velcro tab away some
other specialized pockets include an
RFID blocking silver pocket to keep
identity thieves at bay plus some
smaller pockets designed for memory
cards and USB drives running throughout
the jacket are channels for cables in
what Scottevest calls the personal area
network these channels allow you to run
cables such as battery charging cables
or headphones throughout the jacket it
allows you to keep all of your
accessories contained and at the ready
should you need them overall we're
impressive the amount of storage of this
coat comes with it seems a shame that so
many other jackets leaves so much space
unused but it needs to be said that
while you can carry everything around in
your pocket you need to decide if you
should the weight distribution of the
coat is fantastic so walking around my
neighborhood of gear didn't hurt but I
did feel it more importantly though
having a laptop tucked into your coat
isn't the most comfortable feeling in
the world
but like so much else in technology the
real power here is having it when you
need it and it being out of the way when
you don't plus if you're traveling this
coat can hold a carry-ons worth of items
by itself and that's value thanks for

Scottevest
OTG jacket be sure to give this video a
