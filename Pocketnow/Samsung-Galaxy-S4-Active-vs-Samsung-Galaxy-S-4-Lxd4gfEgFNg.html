here in London at the Samsung event and
we're going to compare the samsung
galaxy s4 with the samsung galaxy s4
active it's ruggedized version as you
can see they look almost identical the
main difference on the front is that we
have three actual hardware buttons right
here on the active while the galaxy s4
as you see has be home button + T
capacitive buttons for menu and back the
screens are also identical in terms of
display land mention so we have 5 inch
display share 5 inch display here Full
HD resolution but this one is a super
amoled screen and this one is an LCD
screen now flipping them over to their
backs is going to be a little bit
difficult but there's also a difference
right here
the galaxy s this is the s4 right now
has a 13 megapixel camera on the back
and the galaxy s4 active has an 8
megapixel sensor that aside there's two
gigs of RAM on each of these these
storage options on the active are 16
gigabytes expandable via micro SD but
probably the main difference is that
well I would probably not like to drop
my galaxy s4 in a tank of water you can
drop the galaxy s4 active because it's
been rated ip67 for up to 30 minutes
simmers and up to one meter of water so
this was it a very short comparison of
the galaxy s4 vs the galaxy s4 active
here we can see a holiday look side by
side and in terms of thickness they look
almost the same and in terms of I'd say
that they're about the same that was it
for now this was an time front pocket
now taking a look at the s4 vs the s4
active thank you very much for watching
stay tuned we have a lot more videos to
come
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
