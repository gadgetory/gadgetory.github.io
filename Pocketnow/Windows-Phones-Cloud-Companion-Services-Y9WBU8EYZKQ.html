now calm and with the new windows phone
7.5 upgrade we also saw a an upgrade to
the Windows Phone calm website so we're
going to take a look at that and we'll
see some new features in there some
pretty cool let's check it out so first
off here's the Windows Phone calm
website we got a little ad but we have
some funds up here and if you signed in
these buttons become more useful first
up there's marketplace so we can switch
that and this is the new web-based
marketplace you can still do it through
zune but this is a pretty nice you don't
have to install zune and we can just
browse through all sorts of apps
available for Windows Phone we can
easily buy it I can see some screenshots
you can see the reviews and if you
already own one of these you can
actually make a review right here so
that's pretty nice and it we can send a
link strike your phone for easy download
now here's the other one my phone is a
good one so if i switch to that this is
what you get in the my phone section so
there's the phone you can click that to
show other phones if you own more than
one here's our pictures those are
automatically uploaded to SkyDrive if
you have that feature turned on there's
the location of your phone if you have
that feature turned on as well you can
ring it lock it same features as before
but here's a new one see your recent
check-ins so if i switch to this window
this is what you get when i click on
that it's an ice beam map and it's
called scrapbook so here's the settings
i'll just show you that if i clicked it
correctly there we can delete the
history so this is keeping track of all
this all
check-ins that I might have done with
Windows Phone mango from my meat aisle
so there's a check in and this will post
a facebook and windows live if I choose
it and since my windows live ID is
connected to my facebook account it can
remember the use chickens as well so if
I click on one there we are that's where
i was on october first at 146 p.m. i set
a restaurant and we can zoom and there's
that your normal bing stuff and some
zoom buttons but we have multi touch and
I can go to the previous one there's
another check-in
there's another one with the picture
so pretty nice little scrapbook of
places that you checked in pretty cool
now another thing we got pictures so
this is pretty nice you can real easily
see pictures from your phone and we can
fade through to the mall pretty neat and
i will show you this you got links to
office so if i go there i can see all
the documents then it switches over to
SkyDrive so I can see all the documents
that are going to show up in my office
Huglin so there's SkyDrive and here they
are see the same files so easy access
both of those we can also edit stuff on
your phone on the website so this is a
OneNote notebook and we can see all that
information it's like a pretty close to
full OneNote application actually it's
missing a lot features but still very
usable so you have easy access to those
both on the phone and on the web and
what else we have we got xbox live I can
see achievements play games really
should say play game because there's
only one here this is the two-player
chess game you can play it on the
browser against the phone against
somebody else either using the phone or
using the browser and you can switch
between taking turns on the web or on
the phone
and we can do customized this is going
to log me into xbox live load some
silverlight application stuff and then
from here i can customize my xbox live
gamer avatar so let's try i think i want
now it's loading still
can switch to a different prop
help save that and now he's going to
have that crop on my phone and on xbox
so that's pretty nice and finally we
have quick access to your contacts your
calendar as well as your to do's if you
have a mango device and the inbox this
is just the windows live account if you
have exchanged or gmail account those
are not going to show up here but you
can access those from gmail com or
whatever and at the bottom we have some
little ads get your zoom path so that
I'll tell you how to get unlimited music
on your phone and also a suggestion to
install zoom so you can sync other stuff
so that's new Windows Phone com website
some cool additions good useful features
for interacting with your Windows Phone
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
