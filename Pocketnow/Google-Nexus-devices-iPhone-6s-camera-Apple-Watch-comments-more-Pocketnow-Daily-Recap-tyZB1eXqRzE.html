not easy to pull off a video every day
I'll tell you that nothing like pocket
now before bed and that didn't sound
right I reached the point where my
morning routine starts with the pocket
out daily it gets me out of bed and
thanks man it means a lot to us trust me
that's right it's that time of the week
and I am hi Matt leave it up this is
pocket now and this is the bargain out
daily recap for two weeks ago actually
so on Monday asked you if you would
prefer an LG Nexus smartphone or a
huawei Nexus phablet as the rumors are
that there is an LG Nexus a regular
sized smartphone in the works we have
790 comments out of which boutique 195
says I'm having with my Nexus 5 I won't
buy a nexus that isn't from hcc your LG
well but this is an LG Nexus whatever it
seems that that's going to be the case
so I guess you will buy it then Saul
says I would go for the LG Nexus because
of the beautiful software it has built
in and of course the amazing LG camera
if they implement the LG camera I bet
sales would go off the roof quickly
remember this is a nexus this is google
software fully running on LG neck
hardware so I don't necessarily think
that will be the case and will frame
says even if it's essentially a g4 with
stock Android and won't take photos in
the same quality LG's camera software
optimizations have a lot to do with the
pictures it produces Google still hasn't
figured out how to code a good camera
application and I do agree with you
Google's desperately needs to go back to
the drawing board but it would be cool
is that what the other commenters said
it would be cool if they would implement
at least the camera software that would
be amazing or at least give users the
option until they ask you what did you
want Apple to bring to the next
generation iphone as we've got a ton of
rumors including a gold or should we say
rose gold colored iPhone addition to
other Cameron provements we have twelve
hundred and one comments thanks a lot
guys out of which one of them says sadly
you can't expect much from Apple but the
same design and the spec bump and true
that that's the case for this generation
tech birdie says only a bigger battery
that's what we need for the new iphone I
do agree with you the smaller size
iphone could have a better battery life
and text flash says even if they aren't
making much external changes to the
iphone success or whatever
might be called it would be nice for
them to fix that protruding camera in
addition to that protruding camera those
ugly marks of the back for the antennas
that would be amazing on Wednesday ask
you if you feel that Apple should
implement a kill switch for the Apple
watch as it seems that for you to be
able to steal an Apple watch and then
just pair it to your current smartphone
is as easy as anything else in the world
we have 400 comments out of which one of
them says I believe if you wear
something on your wrist it's less likely
to be stolen so yeah I think it's not
needed that's actually the other way
around and see the problem is not
necessarily the fact that people are
going to come up and steal it from you
whenever you implement the kill switch
on smartphones the advantage is that it
you can't activate the phone anymore so
therefore it's pointless for anybody to
steal it from you and that's the whole
reason for there to be a kill switch on
a watch because the technology is there
then another commenter says 349 dollar
base price and seventeen thousand dollar
top and model I think Apple should do
anything or everything that fixes any
issues for the price they charge and I
have to agree with you truly this is not
a Rolex but then again hey it's still an
expensive smartwatch and hey you still
have the software there so why not just
build it in inicia go says they should
for the price they're charging might as
well make it a paperweight if it gets
stolen and i agree with you i mean truly
again it's not a Rolex but then again
that's the point it's a smart watch it
should be that smart for the price
there's a ass you what is your current
music service and would you pay for
apple music as the news are that Apple
is rebranding beats music to be called
Apple music and there's this whole
pricing scheme we have 663 comments out
of which Sloan says google play all
access it's worth ten dollars honestly
and you will be the first person i know
that uses it and paint great power
that's the fon says currently i do not
have a music streaming service i just
use youtube and that is a music
streaming service and victor says
Spotify I will never switch to Apple
music and dude I use Spotify as well it
is my favorite thing on the planet
seriously uh there is this just music
out there that I wouldn't be willing to
buy but it's great for you to be able to
access it through a subscription that's
the main reason why I like it and
finally on Friday ass
if megapixels matter to you when buying
a smartphone as the rumors are that even
though the iphone 6s and 6s plus we'll
have a spec bump when it comes to the
camera going to 12 megapixels it seems
that the sensor will remain the same
size that's not necessarily a good thing
there are other rumors that the bunk the
way it's going to be done but we have
612 comments out of which danny Shin
says it doesn't matter as long as it is
not any lower than 8 megapixels any
lower than 10 megapixels makes the image
look a little bit crunchy but ideally i
prefer 12 megapixels and i agree with
you anything below 8 megapixels is a
unacceptable in my opinion but again
that's my opinion in yours as well then
Alex Castro says yes but in the end we
take photos for facebook and instagram i
think it may pixels but better
performance and image processing is the
way to go not all of us a lot of people
rely on their smartphones for trips and
so many other issues mainly because they
want to avoid the theft of a camera or
buying an expensive camera when
smartphones are doing a really good job
but i do get your point as well then
another commoner says 12 megapixel
should be the new standard not much
needed after that i take 12 megapixels
with the best optics over a 16 or 20
megapixel that with just good optics and
yeah I do agree with you for me optics
or everything software optimization is
also everything as well companies like
Nokia Samsung or doing an amazing job
here LG is well so for me it wouldn't be
an excuse for Apple to not figure this
out with the new iPhones that's it for
the bargain i was a lee recap thank you
very much for watching a couple of tips
if you want your comments to be featured
