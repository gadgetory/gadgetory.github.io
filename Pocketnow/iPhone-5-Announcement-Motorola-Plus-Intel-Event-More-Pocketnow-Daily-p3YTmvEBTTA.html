teases intel with their next event and
the windows phone marketplace was his
name I'm hi Mary vetta waiting for the
iphone 6 rumors to begin and this is
pocket now daily that's right Apple has
just announced the iphone 5 with a new
design that's taller thinner lighter and
faster with the new a6 processor in 4G
LTE sadly the only bad news is that
you'll be getting iOS 6 completely
untouched now call this apples worst
kept secret as a design looked exactly
like the leaks that we've seen months
ago but well launch state is on sep
tember 21st with pre-orders starting
tomorrow iOS 6 launches on September 19
I guess the only surprise yesterday was
apple's new ipod lineup which features a
new ipod touch that has all the design
elements that we were waiting for the
iphone 5 this new ipod touch has every
new feature that the iphone 5 brings
obviously with a thinner chassis and no
cell phone radio the device will be
launching on october along with a new
ipod nano that's just begging for a
lawsuit because it looks exactly like
the Lumia 800 and non apple news
Motorola has just seasoned event for
September 18th along with Intel where we
hope to be getting the droid razr m
variant that we leaked ever since
februari running on an Intel processor
though we don't know details now it's
just interesting to see this image from
the leak ever since februari and see
that the droid razr m design was final
ever since then and another non apple
news microsoft has just changed the name
of the Windows Phone marketplaces to
call it the Windows Phone store as if
everything wasn't already called windows
over at Redmond and set for the
bathrooms now there are no clear
enhancements with this new store all we
know is that it will be launching along
with Windows Phone 8 but you guessed it
not even Microsoft knows that lunch date
and finally well I guess my predictions
on the iphone 5 when completely wrong
since the lease were real so yes i doooo
a couple of friends some beer but does a
lot of people have asked me what i think
about the device i'll start by telling
you that i do like the design i feel the
four-inch form factor is the sweet spot
at times when jumbo phones are the
mainstream but
I'm just disappointed on the bottom of
the device and also on the fact that it
runs iOS 6 but that leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about the iphone 5 are you going to buy
it and in what color leave us a comment
down below and if you want to know what
we want for the iphone 5 make sure you
follow our next pocket net weekly we're
going to be talking about what we think
about the iphone 5 and which color are
we getting now if you want an early or
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world matreya
