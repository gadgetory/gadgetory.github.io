take the cake and leaving a dramatic
first impression and that's exactly how
I felt when I held the HTC u ultra back
in January in Vegas the presentation
sold me on a few concepts that make this
film essential and now it's time to take
it for a spin I'm hanging out a better
with pocket now and these are my first
impressions so the key selling point for
the HTC u ultra during our first look
back in Vegas were two things
HTC was bored of making aluminum phones
and wanted to try something different
and the company also wanted to make
software smarter as the company
considers that AI is the new industrial
revolution of our time when it comes to
hardware the company has succeeded I
mean really do I need to say more than
what the camera already shows the HTC u
ultra is simply gorgeous as opposed to
your standard glass finish the phone
features a set of curves on the edges
that almost make it feel like if you're
holding polished aluminum the sapphire
blue color is simply striking from a
distance software is where things took a
slight curve in the company's intent I
mean if you go through the setup process
it's more like your typical HTC phone
than your standard Android phone you
follow some elements of HTC Sense some
elements of Android you had your
fingerprint for security and then you
personalize your phone once all this is
done you're greeted with HTC Sense
almost as you remember it with the old
HTC 10 I'm a big fan of sense so I won't
complain but it does seem like if the
spacey grid of icons still hasn't been
updated to take more advantage of the
screen real estate now where things go
wrong is I don't know if you noticed
that there's actually something missing
well actually see spent a great deal of
their presentation in Vegas telling us
about how important a I was to this
phone and how the HTC companion app was
going to be able to pull that off but
well it's not here it apparently won't
be ready for another month so we're kind
of left to judge the U ultra just like
we judge any other smartphone as a
smartphone on its own there are a few
good things and bad things to talk about
on a positive front I am very very
impressed by this 5.7 inch Super LCD 5
it's only when you turn it on that you
notice the display lighting up black the
rest of the time the blacks are simply
imperceptible and the level of
saturation of this display is striking
favoring reg more than I've ever seen
before even on the HTC 10 the secondary
display is meant to not rip off the LGB
20 and just being another screen but
without the HTC companion application
its current operation is limited to
everything we already know from the b20
another major positive is HTC z sonic
boom sound which has grown to no longer
require input to be set up simply plug
in your earphones let the software
detect the noise around you and that is
it and you can adjust it for different
noise profiles when needed like if when
you're in the subway or something and
the resulting sound is as expected from
HTC just amazing now something else that
is a very pleasant surprise and that's
also a positive is this camera combo I
mean HTC has spent years struggling with
its cameras but the U ultra brings a
genius 12 ultra pixel primary camera
that has really shined in saturation in
both day and night and I actually love
this whole concept of the 16 megapixel
selfie shooter that turns into a four
ultra pixel camera even though I'm not
much of a fan of selfies the point being
is I've taken photos of flowers which is
really hard to come by in the winter in
New York and I'm just shocked at how
well this camera balances things like
okay we're the HTC 10 was always hit or
miss
where things kind of go wrong really
depends on your taste and it mainly have
to do with design choices for example I
am still trying to understand why this
phone is so large its larger than the
iPhone 7 plus which is logical since it
has a larger screen but then it's larger
than the LG B 20 even if it's sporting
the same display size and it's even
larger than the huawei mate 9 and the
main tonight has a larger screen than
this HD see you ultra and so you ask
yourself you have such a large phone and
you wonder why there aren't essentials
like a headphone jack where there is
clearly enough real estate for that to
happen now in HTC is the sense the
company has been an amazing job in
providing really good weight
distribution for this phone it doesn't
really feel heavy in the hand and
obviously the glass makes it feel
pleasant the problem is when you try to
fumble around reaching buttons all
around there are times when even my
large hands aren't able to reach
navigation buttons at the bottom of the
phone all in all this is definitely a
two-handed phone so make sure you use
the case that comes in the box as you
will definitely drop this phone trying
to fumble using it
overall the honeymoon phase with the HTC
u ultra has proven to be more
interesting than I thought this is
probably one of the most beautiful
phones that I've ever seen and there's a
lot of promise in what this phone will
do with the software included over time
I actually even find it unfair to start
this review process with a phone that's
not really ready to meet its full
potential but given the fact that this
phone is already available to certain
consumers at a hefty price tag that is
only fair that we get to work and tell
you what you're really buying into right
at this moment
while our testing process continues the
easiest way to know in our next video
goes live is if you follow us on social
media and subscribe to our channel you

net any meta please give this video
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
I'm never going I think so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
