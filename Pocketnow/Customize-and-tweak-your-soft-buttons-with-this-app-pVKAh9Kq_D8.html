both have the ability to run soft
buttons on your home screen some
manufacturers opt for physical buttons
instead but you can still put soft
buttons there this app lets you
configure customize change and even hide
those soft buttons with one caveat I'm
Joe Levi for Pocket now let's go take a
look what we're talking about here is
your navbar or your soft buttons some
devices have physical buttons on-screen
some have soft buttons in this case
these are soft buttons this is a nexus 4
it is routed you are going to need super
user to be able to get this to work the
name of the app is ultimate dynamic
navbar stay tuned to the end will tell
you how to get it on your device the
first thing you're going to do after
installing the app is turn it on you can
see I've already done that all of these
are the default settings start at boot
so you'll always have this when your
device starts up display notification
that's that little arrow up there in
your notification bar and get rid of
that if you want to toggle mode that
will never hide itself automatically
blah blah blah let's get right to it ok
if you notice I've got this little teeny
grey arrow down here in the bottom if I
tap on that I get a nav bar or soft
buttons and it automatically hides away
that's great but you can see it double
stacks I'll tell you why it does that at
the end of the video for the meantime
let's just take a look at this really
cool it's got some translucency to it
it's got all of your common buttons and
then you can even customize them so
let's look at that let's go ahead and go
back that's enable buttons from here you
can see what we've got button one is
back and long press is that menu now
that's not this button that's that
button so let's go ahead and long press
that there's no menu settings here so
it's not doing anything for me button 2
is home with a long click action of none
let's go ahead and change that let's
change that one I don't know what we
want to do let's change that to home to
just because we can button 4 is our
recent apps
excuse me that was three number four
then let's make that a search button and
now you can see quickly we have search
now that's neat I always like having
search right there but it's not really
what I want to show you so in addition
to being able to customize what buttons
show up and what long presses do for
those buttons this is really what's kind
of neat you've also got you know The
Hideaway which will really be cool
liberating some of that screen real
estate
once the developer can remove it this
stock navigation bar down at the bottom
safely we'll just leave it at that the
other thing that you can do is change
the theme and behavior let's take a look
at themes first right now we're running
the default Nexus theme so if you look
at it the icons look identical to what
I'm running at the bottom that's cool I
like it but you know let's change it how
about Motorola there's the Motorola
theme change it again HTC that looks
like your HTC buttons change it again
Facebook Facebook buttons and last but
not least Xperia and that's what the
experiment ins look like just to make it
look a little bit different let's let's
set it to Motorola for the time being
just so you can see we can also change
the height of the panel if 48 pixels is
too big you can change it make smaller
just like that
save even more space when it's in its
open State you don't have to hide it
that's another thing so you can have
that unhidden and just drop that down
from the space that it occupies now to
whatever size you want or if you've got
it set to auto hide you can make the
buttons even bigger just like that
really kind of neat you can do what you
want with it again as soon as the
developer can get rid of this safely and
version 0.94 he did version 0.95 he
turned that off because it was somewhat
dangerous you can also get into
transparency so let's go ahead and make
the transparency a bit higher so now you
can see through it a little bit more
kind of reducing the impact that it has
the visual impact on your your
experience you can see the background
behind it that doesn't do a lot here but
I'll show you on the home screen let's
make it last a little bit longer the
showing State let's make that last a
little longer too so let's come on over
here to
my background how do you like that and
you can see big buttons with
transparency I probably want to go back
in and make that a little bit darker a
little bit less transparent but that's
my preference and yours could be
different the name of the app is
ultimate dynamic navbar and it is
available at xda-developers we'll have a
link to the exact thread and where you
can download the app over in the article
at pocketnow.com this version was
version point zero nine five it is a
beta it is a work in progress it works
pretty well with one caveat the ability
to hide your stock soft buttons has been
temporarily disabled because there was
some kind of a problem with people
breaking devices which isn't a good
thing so for now you have to that might
be okay if you want to hide your navbar
some other way which you can do or if
you just want to go in and customize or
add other frequently used buttons that
you don't want taking up screen real
estate if you've got questions comments
or want to participate in the discussion

stuff with your friends on any of your
