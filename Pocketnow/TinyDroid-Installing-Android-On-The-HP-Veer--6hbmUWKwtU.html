now now we've seen android running on
some pretty small devices before like
the Xperia Mini but I've never run it on
something quite so small as this before
this is the HP veer and some
enterprising folks have figured out how
to replace its webOS operating system
with Android so we're going to give it a
try ourselves and see how well this
early build runs on such a small device
or we're going to break it stay tuned
okay for this procedure we're going to
need a PC the USB cable that came with
the veer remember it's a special one and
the HP veer itself with at least one gig
of memory free and a degree of
intrepidity I wasn't joking before when
we're talking about bricking this is a
procedure which if done improperly could
very well render your veer completely
unusable so proceed at your own risk
okay so the first thing we want to do is
make sure a piece of software called
Nova comm is installed on your computer
this is a software driver package that
allows your machine to communicate with
a webOS device via USB the easiest way
to install nova comm on your machine is
to download it directly from the source
there's a post in one of the threads
linked below that features direct links
to the nova comm drivers so do that
first
if you've used webOS quickinstall there
will already be a folder in your
filesystem called Palm Inc if there's
not go ahead and create one under
Program Files then download the Acme
installer and unzip it to that same palm
folder there's a link to that one in the
same post I just mentioned once that's
taken care of
let's navigate to the Android on veer
site and at this point it's just a
simple matter of following directions
the developers behind this port are
primarily located in China I believe so
some of the sentences might take one or
two reads but it's still understandable
for the most part we're going to
download the Android route FS and boot
tarballs
and dump them into a folder I'm going to
call tiny droid I'm going to download
you image dot install as well but
file I'm putting into the palm folder we
created before that's important then
we're going to power on the veer plug in
the USB cable and mount it as a USB
Drive after that we'll drag and drop the
Android root FS and boot tarballs to the
veer make sure they don't go into a
specific folder on the veer just the
root level now we're going to reboot the
veer while it's starting up though we're
going to hold down the up volume key to
force it into recovery mode when the
veer is safely in recovery mode we'll go
back to the computer and open the
command prompt by typing CMD at the
Start menu will navigate to the palm
folder where the nova comm executable
and you image install files live and run
this command install logs should start
scrolling on the veer and that's the
last step we should need to take for the
installation and once installation is
complete we should be taken right into
the boot menu here now in order to
navigate in this menu we're going to use
the volume keys to scroll and the power
key to select you'll just select boot
into Android and hit power and there you
go after a short while we're running
Android on the veer as you can imagine
this must be this is rather profound as
a webOS user to be running Android as
you can see we're if I can get to the
settings here and show you we are
running Android version 2.3 7
Gingerbread and this is an alpha so
there's a lot that's not quite working
yet namely there's no phone
functionality so this is not yet ready
to be anybody's daily driver also Wi-Fi
connectivity for me was spotty at best
it works for some people I've read but
it couldn't quite latch on to my home
network so with limited connectivity I
couldn't really test out anything that
relied on the Internet to function in
addition there's no Google Play
or Android Market functionality yet
though there is what looks to be some
sort of Chinese variant of some kind in
addition the battery life indicator
didn't work and so on there's a lot of
work yet to be done to make this usable
that said it was nice to take a tour
around Android on such a tiny device as
the vir and the guys who did this port
have made some really really nice
touches webOS gestures like the up swipe
and the back swipe have been implemented
and they've been translated to their
respective functions which is home and
back on Android making it much more
usable than your standard Gingerbread
also the physical keyboard does in fact
function and it still feels just as good
as it ever does but if you don't want to
use that for the first time ever a webOS
device can boast of an on-screen
keyboard that's at least usable too bad
it took loading another OS to make it
happen
so that's android on the HP veer now is
there a lot of work left to be done yes
this alpha build is barely functional
but if you look at the history and some
of these threads it hasn't taken these
devs a very long time to get to this
point and if I were to put any money on
it I would bet on at least a functional
veer coming before the end of the summer
now
whether anyone would want to install
Android on such a tiny device and use it
as their daily driver well that's
anybody's guess but dual booting is a
pretty cool thing and it's really really
nice to have options for when webOS
can't fill an application need or when
Android isn't usable enough for a
particular situation anyway this has
been Michael with Pocket now give us a
thumbs up if you liked the video leave
us a comment let us know whether or not
you attempted this and what your success
rate was like and thanks for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
