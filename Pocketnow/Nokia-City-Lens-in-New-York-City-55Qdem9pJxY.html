city lens loaded and we're going to try
it out let's see what I should choose
first hello food and you can see this
so a bunch of different locations
as I turn we see a change and you see
the ones at the bottom are closer to me
and the ones at the top are further away
you see a little plus sign will do a
kind of a grouping of more locations for
the focus
and you can see changing as I turn now
we can also do it this way I just think
your orientation it'll show me the
direction of each of these places
let me go back one
also do transportation
so I know there is a okay there's their
walk around a little bit
there's Penn Station that way yep I just
came from there
looking at me funny okay I finally found
a place that works you can see Jack
Dempsey's is listed on the bottom there
and I see that restaurant right in front
of me and I turn and it kind of falls
the restaurant says point zero two miles
away really that's just across the
street
but there you go see what's down that
way nothing much
and there's Jack Dempsey's
there we go pretty good
and now I can tap on that
and get directions despite its loads
there we go
and there's a 3d building
all right so there's city lens a little
test in New York City</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
