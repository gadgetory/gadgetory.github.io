bringing us a rival for true def camera
technology on the next galaxies Apple
invites us all to a field trip on March
27th and we're thinking budget offerings
and ZT is implementing the camera
technology of the pixel for the new
budget phone I'm Jaime Rivera and it
seems that if that pixel camera
technology extends blurring the toilet
on those bathroom selfies will be easier
this is marking out daily the official
news today begin with deals yet again
those of you in the market for a Google
pixel - you might want to consider some
offerings available on eBay currently
new other devices yet again mainly
because well they're 580 bucks and
you'll say yeah that's expensive but no
it's not if you consider the fact that
this is the 128 gigabyte variant that's
actually overkill in my opinion for the
pixel given it's great storage
management but you can learn more in the
description now it seems that ZTE is
apparently willing to surprises in the
mid to low range I mean their Blade
series hasn't really been a
top-of-the-line smartphone and yet the
Blade 9 that we saw at MWC is a gorgeous
smartphone now bear in mind the company
apparently has just invested at a new
code that will bring them competition or
photography pretty much like what we get
in the pixel not necessarily what we get
in the pixel but it seems that that is
coming to the mid to low range for ZTE I
can't wait to see what that phone brings
mainly because just on its own the
phone's gorgeous now set your calendars
as Apple has sent out press invitations
for an event to happen on March 27th and
the company is teasing that it's gonna
take us on a field trip now there are a
ton of rumors one of these being even a
video on Weibo that shows us an iPhone
se in theory it looks everything like an
iPhone it doesn't look like an Android
phone running some sort of fake version
of iOS no this looks like a smaller
iPhone 10 with a notch that runs iOS
well and it's just got some sharper
corners so we wonder if this is going to
be Apple's event for the budget lineup
that we've been hearing in rumors we'll
keep you posted now let's talk about HTC
know the company's not dead
worried we've got some very interesting
tips from Evan blast teasing a you 11 no
you 12 that would be pretty much but
this is the plus variant and well we've
got great specifications starting with
no not CH Snapdragon 8045 processor from
Qualcomm six gigs of ram options for 64
128 gigs of storage that's all fine
apparently the cool thing about this
phone is that in addition to that
possible matte glass design we're also
getting four cameras two in the front
two in the back what exactly is the
company planning to bring I can't wait
and finally the most interesting
nuisance they have to do with Samsung
and the Galaxy S 10 yes early but
believe it or not the rumors are there
apparently the company has already
invested in an Israeli company to bring
itself some better true def image
sensing technology for the front-facing
camera because for those of you that
have already tried a our moji you know
how terrible that thing is it does need
better hardware
so apparently Samsung is working on that
and apparently it's also going to bring
a revision to the Infinity display
that's great
apparently the other rumor is that we're
not getting the fingerprint scanner on
the display which is terrible but in
today's question let us know if you had
to pick on display fingerprint scanner
or true depth sensing technology for
unlocking your phone in my case why not
both Samsung or if anything just keep
the fingerprint scanner at the bag bring
me that thing in the front and we'll be
fine but that's just me leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
