here with Tony behind the camera here at
the Nokia booth at MWC checking out the
Nokia Lumia 720 vs Nokia Lumia 920 for a
very quick comparison let's check it out
so these two devices are obviously
coming from the same design family you
can tell they're made by the same
manufacturer and that's a big focus in
what nokia was saying today they want
every device coming from them to be able
to be identified instantly as a Nokia
device and that's very clear here you
can tell that the 920 is bigger and in
the hand it is also quite a bit heavier
at 185 grams is still waiting for the
official official spec on this as far as
weight goes but the 720 is a much
lighter device overall obviously they
each come in multiple colors we haven't
have a white in a yellow here the camera
is a per view module on the 920 at 8.7
megapixels whereas on the 720 we have
that 6 plus megapixel shooter there same
Carl Zeiss optics though is the Nokia
branding around back headphones SIM card
slot removable memory in the 720 as is
becoming common for mid-range Windows
Phone devices of course no removable
memory on the 928 coming back up to the
front you can see a difference in
display size not only that but you can
see a difference in display side at
visibility the 920 really really you
lose a whole lot as you come off the
side on the 920 whereas on the 720 you
can see you can read it from from a very
extreme angle we come in and obviously
we're looking at the same version of
Windows Phone 8 on each device we're not
going to talk too much about hardware we
just wanted to give you a quick glimpse
of excuse me I think I can talk about
software I just want to give you a quick
thumbs to the hardware and you can see
Nokia is really amped up the subtlety on
this on the Nokia smile here not quite
so pronounced as on the 920 once again
just a quick look Nokia 720 and Nokia
921 a lot more coming from pocket now
stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
