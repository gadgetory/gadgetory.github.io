announcement meaning we woke up to a
package on our office doorstep this is a
Nexus 5 not the one we're giving away
even though we are giving away a Nexus 5
this is our review unit I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow let's unbox it
you heard right folks we are giving away
a Nexus 5 not this particular unit but
one just like it a 16 gig white edition
if you want to win a Nexus 5 if you want
a chance to win you should enter the
giveaway we announced the winners
Wednesday on the pocket now weekly
follow us on social media so you don't
miss a future content from pocket now
and make sure to enter that giveaway
let's pop open the shipping packaging
here to discover the retail box which is
in brilliant brilliant blue we saw
leaked images of the of the retail
packaging along with the other the rest
of the avalanche of leaks surrounding
the Nexus 5 now with the tape cut I
should mention this packaging is very
very minimal as you can tell the
barcodes on the bottom we will keep
obscured and let's just lift it up here
and see a device greeting us front and
center in the traditional orientation
here a slightly tighter shot with a
Nexus branded screen protector on there
take the phone out of the packaging and
put it aside just for a moment the right
colour we did indeed that's that's nice
okay let's put it aside for a second to
see what's in the box what Google gives
us when we invest in the $349 unit if
you buy in the States divide elsewhere
it and of course get more expensive flap
here here we have a suggested procedure
for sim installation and a sim removal
tool right in the center there
instructions on how to power on the unit
in different languages of course our
safety and warranty guide a microUSB
cable like any other it would seem and
an LG power adapter for the wall socket
nothing else going on no headphones no
chamois nothing fancy
probably to keep costs down
and here we have the device itself all
protectors still installed a pretty
tricky device to film because this
particular model the the backside is all
wide the front side Oh black but the
protectors are still in place we're
going to move our microphone and we're
gonna pop up that screen protector for
the first time as we pull off the other
sort of protective elements here keeping
the plastic on the sides pristine I will
mention that this device is somewhat
cold to the touch having sat on the
porch for a bit but we like that because
it's not cold and clammy in that glossy
kind of way that some cheaper feeling
plastic can be this white polycarb this
public comment on the white version here
let's take off that camera lens
protector is smooth reminds us of the
HTC One X to a degree the previous
several generations old
HTC flagship but really really good
feeling they're really kind of it's not
quite tacky it's not quite soft touch
I imagine the black version might feel a
little bit different as it did on the
Galaxy Note 3 I'm not really sure about
that but really really does feel nice in
the hand the power button that's right
where it belongs we're gonna take it
over here but just before we power it on
we'll show you that the earpiece hole in
our black unit is white so you have a
nice little visual guide point for where
to put your ear when you do want to talk
on this phone we run a slightly
different lighting condition here we're
gonna power on the unit just showing you
what it looks like off the green grid a
little bit there's our predicted at
Google splash screen what the back cover
looks like is this device boots up once
again the 16 gig model that camera is 8
megapixels with optical image
stabilization Snapdragon 800 powering
everything under the hood 2 gigs of ram
this display a 5-inch 1080p panel
this device does in fact resemble the g2
the LG g2 it's spiritual sibling on the
spec sheet not so much in real life this
hardware is considerably different and
as usual we are prompted to enter our
information in order to start making the
Nexus 5 our own which we will start
doing very very shortly keep in mind
folks we do have one of these up for
giveaway as I keep reminding everyone
stay tuned to the pocket now a weekly
podcast on Wednesday for the winter
announcement and enter if you are not
already entered and please folks we like
to keep the venue open for
communications so if there's something
specific you would like to see and drop
us a comment down below we will be
spending a lot of time with the Nexus 5
from Google and those giveaway details
which have already been posted will
appear in the same spot as the
comparisons and the eventual review of
the Nexus 5 pocketnow.com visit us there
