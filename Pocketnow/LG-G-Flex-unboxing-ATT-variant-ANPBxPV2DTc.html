on how to pair the Samsung Galaxy gear
with the LG Nexus 5 but I can't tell you
how to do it because apparently after
five hours I can't do it so I'm gonna
send that to the more competent Joel Eva
and hopefully he will be able to take
you through that thankfully we do have a
back-up plan brought to us by our good
friends at FedEx this is PocketNow
I am Michael Fisher and this is the AT&amp;amp;T
version of the LG G flex
why don't we unbox it so once again
everybody my apologies for the mix-up in
the schedule we will try and get the
delayed video out as soon as we can but
for now we thought we would take a look
at this device now we have seen the G
flex before in fact we gave it a full
review treatment several weeks back we
had the international version we had so
much time with it we had several units
actually and we were able to generate
review rebuttals review content
comparisons other features so the G flex
is very well covered at PocketNow but
this one is the AT&amp;amp;T version this is
built specifically for the American
market Michael Fisher that's me we can
get rid of that there's the AT&amp;amp;T Death
Star logo an indication that it's not
for sale as well and this is the what we
presume to be the final retail packaging
80 staying very very consistent with
it's extremely minimalistic retail
design let's flip it around to the back
and there's the G flex there no specs no
words no nothing just a picture of the
phone so I just want to make clear as
we're popping the Box open here we will
not be doing a full review for this one
we checked out at CES you know this is
just the this is just an Americanized G
flex is what we're looking at so with
the exception of that those special
bands for LTE and the removal of the TV
antenna this is almost identical plus
you know the carrier bloatware we've
come to expect let's pop it out of the
box here devices on top as usual ah it's
been a little while you may recall I
like the G flex a lot feels really great
to have it back in the studio here let's
put the phone aside for a second to see
what's inside so no review forthcoming
on this one folks but we will give you a
like a
up in a few days we'll let you know
we'll take it around town see how it
worked on 4G and tell you what that was
like here's your Quick Start Guide some
safety information and so on this is a
microUSB cable the wall charger not not
gonna win any awards for looks but not
trying to it's just a wall charger pop
out the cardboard insert there and SIM
card removal tool and no headphones the
headphones that ship with the G flex the
international version are some of my
favorite ever I think they're really
well made they're called quad beats by
LG but they're just really really nice
headphones and it appears 18 te there
didn't ask for those or something so
that's a real shame we were anticipating
another another set of those so about
the device out of its sleeve here I wish
I was wrong on that but it looks like I
mean this is genuine unboxing we haven't
been inside this thing and it looks like
nobody else has either so I don't think
that's a mistake I think that's a
carrier modification one of those one of
those carrier decisions were not
entirely fans of so that's a shame
here's call-outs for the various
controls here if you're not familiar
with a lot of people won't be you know
they pop open this phone ability grow
what's this on the back oh it's the
volume controls volume up volume down
power standby key there's the 13
megapixel camera with flash the IR
blaster there and a little call out for
the SIM card on the side that's good pop
it back around to the front and let's
see if we can get a better angle for
removing that screen protector and we
will reveal this 6 inch 720p display for
the first time press and hold on the
power standby button we get the LG logo
on the display and we'll just take a
quick look around the hardware here
actually as we come back around to the
back why don't we go ahead and pull this
off of there and we'll go ahead and pull
off the serial numbers as well
and there's that that dust attractant
back that we we remember so well there's
a couple more protectors on the lens and
the buttons there but we won't touch
those right now you'll remember this is
the self-healing back that we subjected
to such abuse in a previous video this
one thankfully in much much better shape
than that one that was supplied by a
retailer for us we come back around to
the front and we're agreed not by an LG
greeting screen or a or an android
screen but by AT&amp;amp;T is ready to go
service so just so that you can see what
you're looking at there you know maybe
if you're a new smartphone user this
would be useful we're not going to touch
this at all just hit back let's get out
of this please I don't want to be
reminded later I just want to leave no I
want to go let me out of here exit and
there's our Android set up showing Wow
maximum five out of five bars of service
on AT&amp;amp;T LTE NFC is enabled and we're
gonna set up the device I said it
already folks but our coverage on the G
flex is extensive at pocketnow.com and
here on our channel page please go check
it out but before you go anywhere please

leave a comment down below and stay
tuned for our brief coverage on the AT&amp;amp;T
G flex once again it won't be a full
review we've already done that but we
will give you an impression of what it's
like to use this device on AT&amp;amp;T s 4g

States this has been michael fisher with
