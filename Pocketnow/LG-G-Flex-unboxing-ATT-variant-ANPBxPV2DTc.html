on how to pair the Samsung Galaxy gear
with the LG Nexus 5 but I can't tell you
how to do it because apparently after
five hours I can't do it so I'm going to
send that to the more competent Joel Eva
and hopefully he will be able to take
you through that thankfully we do have a
back-up plan brought to us by our good
friends at fedex this is pocket now I am
Michael Fisher and this is the AT&amp;amp;T
version of the LG G flex why don't we
unbox it so once again everybody my
apologies for the mix-up in the schedule
we will try and get the delayed video
out as soon as we can but for now we
thought we would take a look at this
device now we have seen the g flex
before in fact we gave it a full review
treatment several weeks back we had the
international version we had so much
time with it we had several units
actually and we were able to generate
review rebuttals review content
comparisons other features so the g flex
is very well covered at pocket now but
this one is the AT&amp;amp;T version this is
built specifically for the American
market Michael Fisher that's may we can
get rid of that there's the AT&amp;amp;T Death
Star logo an indication that it's not
for sale as well and this is the what we
presume to be the final retail packaging
80 staying very very consistent with its
extremely minimalistic retail design
let's flip around to the back and
there's the g flex their no specs no
words no nothing just a picture the
phone so i just want to make clear as
we're popping the box open here we will
not be doing a full review for this one
we checked out at CES you know this is
just the this is just an americanized g
flex is what we're looking at so with
the exception of that those special
bands for LTE and the removal of the TV
antenna this is almost identical plus
you know the carrier bloatware we've
come to expect let's pop it out of the
box here devices on top as usual ah it's
been a little while you may recall i
like the g flex a lot feels really great
to have it back in the studio here let's
put the phone aside for a second to see
what's inside so no review forthcoming
on this one folks but we will give you a
like a
up in a few days we'll let you know
we'll take it around town see how it
worked on 4G and tell you what that was
like here's your Quick Start Guide some
safety information and so on this is a
micro USB cable the wall charger not not
going to win any awards for looks but
not trying to it's just a wall charger
pop out the cardboard insert there and
sim card removal tool and no headphones
the headphones that ship with the g flex
the international version are some of my
favorite ever i think they're really
well made they're called quad beats by
LG but they're just really really nice
headphones and it appears 18t there
didn't ask for those or something so
that's a real shame we were anticipating
another another set of those so about
the device out of its sleeve here i wish
i was wrong on that but it looks like I
mean this is genuine unboxing we haven't
been inside this thing and it looks like
nobody else has either so I don't think
that's a mistake I think that's a
carrier modification one of those one of
those carrier decisions were not
entirely fans of so that's a shame
here's call outs for the various
controls here if you're not familiar
with a lot of people won't be you know
they pop open this phone ability to go
what's this on the back oh it's the
volume controls volume up volume down
power standby key there's the 13
megapixel camera with flash the IR
blaster there and a little call out for
the sim card on the side it's good pop
it back around to the front and let's
see if we can get a better angle for
removing that screen protector and we
will reveal this 6 inch 720p display for
the first time press and hold on the
power standby button we get the LG logo
on the display and we'll just take a
quick look around the hardware here
actually as we come back around to the
back why don't we go ahead and pull this
off of there and we'll go ahead and pull
off the serial numbers as well
and there's that the dust attractant
back that we remember so well there's a
couple more protectors on the lens and
the buttons there but we won't touch
those right now right you'll remember
this is the self-healing back that we
subjected to such abuse in a previous
video this one thankfully in much much
better shape than that one that was
supplied by a retailer for us we come
back round to the front and we're
greeted not by an LG greeting screen or
a word android screen but by AT&amp;amp;T is
ready to go service so just so that you
can see what you're looking at there you
know maybe if you're a new smartphone
user this would be useful we're not
going to touch this at all just hit back
let's get out of this please I don't
want to be reminded later I just want to
leave no I want to go let me out of here
exit and there's our Android set up
showing Wow maximum five out of five
bars of service on AT&amp;amp;T LTE NFC is
enabled and we're going to set up the
device I said it already folks but our
