t-mobile and it's coming out next month
i believe later this spring later this
spring and this is the obviously the the
optimus 2x that's been ported over here
to the US so to tell us a little bit
more about the this dual core device is
Chad the device actually features the
new Tegra 2 processor by Nvidia such a
dual core processor is going to give me
two point times faster gaming experience
as well as multi medium the great thing
about that is this is pretty much geared
toward a lot of the gamers I'm as well
as other super phone customers so what
we want to do on this device is we're
going to be taking full advantage of a
Jeep or trust it's in here it's very
very similar on the first version to the
ps3 so what you're able to do is get
council level gaming very low latency if
you notice over here I'm going to flip
over and you'll see something called
Tigers are down tiger zone is an action
application is free on the global
marketplace the great thing about that
is actually company some then make their
develop games
I a gaming I'm can do HD gaming with
high-end graphics we access net full
council level game right thing about the
Tigers own app is it can only be
utilized on devices that are using the
tiger two processes okay makes sense I'm
cheating and give us a quick 360 a
hardware tour on it absolutely what this
is actually going to be doing this is
going to be using a standard Android and
the reason that we use is a standard
runnin or what we would like to call us
in la android naked android yeah
absolutely that's a great way to put
that is this fact going to be fully
upgradeable or 2.3 so we wanted to make
that as smooth as simple as possible
okay so the less side the less carrier
stuff and and you I overlays the easier
it is for you to roll out version
upgrades absolutely and that's the whole
goal about this would be able to do is
simple and quick update okay that's good
to know and so can we take a quick look
around the device the sides the back
absolutely if you notice on the sides
we've got your volume keys over here
okay okay on this side over here there's
actually on the bottom it's going to be
a charging port there's two speakers on
the bottom and now are those definitely
two speakers or as a speaker you're
actually definitely two speakers there's
another one dead center right here about
the t-mobile logo okay you're looking at
here is a front-facing 1.3 megapixel
camera okay on the back is a mighty 8
megapixel camera that is mighty with an
LED flash okay and on your top right
here is a micro HDMI
cable for gotcha now that I'm sorry the
the silver on the back that is that just
aesthetic or is that a kickstand the
silver banding under the it's actually
just the standard back and they keep in
mind this is a prototype so this is not
final version okay that could possibly
change all right
okay thank you Erica
it would be possible for us to take a
look at the browser absolutely let's see
if we got this one's up here thank you
brother ki there
okay and i know some of our readers
enjoy looking at pocketnow.com it would
be possible to bring that up absolutely
and that's a swype keyboard you're using
absolutely
was
I think there was someone had typed it
in with like and it and in there and
there soon finds it
try again
there we go
oh here's another site it's not actually
talking now but it has talking out in a
headline which we're pretty happy with
that's great let's see the site would be
right there there we go so I think I'm
first of all don't load up the mobile
version then you can scroll to the
bottom of the page desktop versions
although
and so pocket nails are pretty pretty
resource intensive site got a lot of
pictures flash to load etc so it's
pretty snappy
God pinch-to-zoom
so everything pretty zippy here and now
that this is not running final final
firmware as you said correct okay yeah
this is still a prototype device and
again stock Android opening screen and
also what you can do is you can actually
see on how fast the costs are is by how
fast is hoping since close to the
applications another cool way to do this
I'm going to go into my media player
here alright imma we've got a little
demo look here so I'm going to go ahead
and launch this okay one cool thing that
you'll notice on here it actually is
going to be in DTS sound so digital
theater sound okay now and I'm sorry DTS
is is one of the two competing surround
sound standards along with Dolby Digital
that's a clarified so we decided to go
with DTS the great thing about that is
going to give you a simulated surround
sound on the device the great thing is
if you hook that hdmi up to another
source such as a TV what you're going to
get is that sound of that drowns on
washing transfer over do you have D is
this a DLNA capable device this is a dl
no cape no device is what we call smart
share technology so not only being able
to send and receive but it can also
delicious a controller too so the great
thing about that is i can actually go to
a NOS
media player or an Oakland computer and
I could actually tell that to send a
file or a media file to another device
such as a TV exactly which is great one
thing on here and this is what I like to
demonstrate as far as capabilities of
the processor its buffer speed we all
know that sometimes a little bit of
latency a little bit of delay in this
right and if I tap the screen here and
then I scroll back a little bit you're
going to notice the zero latency on here
it's immediately going to go to that
next image and I'll do it again here you
can see how fast that's going to render
through wow that's a great capability
alright excellent
thank you so much Chad we really
appreciate you walking us through this
and again this is the tmobile g2x from
LG coming out this spring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
