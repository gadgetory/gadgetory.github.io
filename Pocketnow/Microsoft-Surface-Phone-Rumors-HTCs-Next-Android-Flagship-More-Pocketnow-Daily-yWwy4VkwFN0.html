emerged Windows Phone aids desktop
companion app leaks and HTC's next
flagship Android smartphone meets mr.
blurry cam I'm hi Mary vera and this is
parking out daily
we've said this before all microsoft
needs for the windows phone operating
system to succeed is their own phone
something they'll be solely responsible
for making succeed and recent WP bench
leaks have a Microsoft Surface phone
being tested though sadly that's all we
have we've got no leak renders no images
nothing but hopefully the Windows Phone
8 launch event will have something at
least mr. Ballmer speaking of Windows
Phone 8 the desktop companion
application was recently leaked and it
seems to be the perfect way for you to
sink your device once you get it all
you'll have to do is connect your device
for the first time to Windows 8 computer
and everything will automatically
install now even though it's kind of
graphics intensive everybody that's a
fan of the Metro I'm sorry new windows 8
you I will definitely be pleased
speaking of Nokia Lumia 920 and 820
leaks recent photos not show that the
devices are even getting wireless
charging aside from a great list of
specs but sadly that's the only good
news is apparently the devices won't be
getting your view camera technology
you'll get the typical smartphone
cameras and hopefully they'll be better
than the Lumia 900 camera which was
anything but a call sighs optics camera
but well you know what I'm not really
gonna blame Nokia here because the
devices are definitely sexy and cool and
the PureView 808 was definitely a thick
brick moving over to android a
mysterious HTC device recently visited
mr. blurry camera shot and while the x
seems very thin it seems to retain the
Beats Audio branding and it also has red
all over it so don't doubt it for a
minute it's going to verizon HTC was
recently leaked as working on a 5-inch
display device that had 1080p resolution
but sadly I don't think this is going to
be that device this seems more to be
like the verizon variant of the HTC One
X but we'll see and finally speaking of
a smartphone underdogs recent images
leaked the marketplace that's coming for
Firefox OS in 2013 and well it looks
different but i'm not sure looks any
better different than any smartphone
operating system in the market so we're
not really sure of any OEM is actually
going to adopt it and that leads us to
the question of the day which oam do you
think will adopt the Firefox OS Samsung
that does everything hcc the
is a comment down below now if you want
