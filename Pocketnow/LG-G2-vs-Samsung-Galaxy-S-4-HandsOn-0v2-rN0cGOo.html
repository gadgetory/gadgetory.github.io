pack quite a wallop the Samsung Galaxy
s4 and the brand-new LG g2 and we'll
take a quick look at how they compare on
the show floor here in New York City I'm
Michael Fisher with Adam Lane behind the
camera this is PocketNow
let's get to it if you own a galaxy s4
from Samsung admit it you're at least a
little curious about how it stacks up
against the LG g2 announced just this
morning in New York City we'll have an
actual comparison video when we get a
hold of a review unit but in the
meantime we have a few quick impressions
from the show floor first and foremost
these devices are quite similar
physically speaking the g2 edges out the
s4 in terms of screen size the 5.2
inches to 5 inches and the g2 packs an
IPS in place of the s4 s AMOLED but
they're both 1080p and the color on the
g2 s display is pretty incredible
in person the tenth of an inch then
bezels on LG's phone also make it quite
pleasant to handle both devices are
exceptionally light and glossy with the
exception of the rear mounted volume
rocker and power button on the g2
aesthetically they're so similar that
non geeks might even get them confused
internally there's quite a different
story the Snapdragon 800 inside the g2
is a global first outpacing the
Snapdragon 600 inside the s4 the 2 gigs
of ram are the same but the storage and
battery aren't LG's is bigger at 3000
milliamp hours but it's also non
removable unlike the s4 s 2600 milliamp
hour unit there's also no expansion slot
on the g2 with available models only
reaching up to 32 gigs of on-board
storage finally the cameras are both 13
megapixels but here the g2 has an edge
only LG's found pax the optical image
stabilization the new must-have for
smartphone cameras and a big help for
low-light performance again folks we're
gonna have a whole lot more on the
relationship between these devices in
the weeks ahead but for now we hope the
spec comparison from the new york launch
event has helped this has been Michael
