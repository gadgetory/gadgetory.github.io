front pocket knife down we're going to
continue our look at the samsung omnia 7
and we'll be comparing it to the LG
optimus 7 which is one of its main
competitors we had the LG optimus 7 on
review some time ago and we'll be doing
some basic application loads and
comparisons game load side comparisons
and browser speed tests to hopefully
find out which one of these two is the
fastest so let's take a look ok so first
one up will be the browser speed
comparison and to make it a fair game
we're going to be deleting the history
on both of these devices just to make it
a fair game ok history deleted and let's
jump into internet explorer and the
launch pocketnow.com ok so before we
proceed I have to tell you that both of
these devices are connected to the
wireless router in my apartment I've
disabled BB &amp;amp; G standards under outer so
both of these devices are connected to
the N standard and hopefully I'll manage
to hit the Go button at the same time on
those so three two one go ok so the LG
optimus 7 loaded up the mobile website
faster let's try and launch the desktop
version of pocketnow.com three two one
go the Optima seven seems to have an
advantage here let's see the omnia 7
catches up
they they both load webpages extremely
fast but the question is which one of
the two will be the first to finish
looks like the optimum seven has a two
or three second advantage and they're
almost finished and there we go the
Optima seven finished first the online
service to the loading and now it's
finished so there are approximately five
or six seconds between the two let's try
to zoom in on the link here and three
two one go
again the optimist Odin seems a little
bit faster still loading both of them
the optimist 7 has its advantage of 34
seconds and the finished one two three
four five six seven eight some eight and
a half nine seconds on average loading
times let's take a look at another page
let's go to engadget com okay we're
piping the addresses and three two one
go this time it's the omnia 7 which
finished first by a very small margin
but this is the mobile website let's try
the desktop version if I can find it
it's right here so three two one you're
both loading again the Optima seven is
first to load the first chunk
still loading
and there you go one two three four five
six approximate approximately five or
six seconds in advantage to the LG
optimus seven against the samsung omnia
7 okay so this concludes our browser
speed test the LG optimus Evan was
quicker let's say on a five to six seven
maybe even eight seconds on average
let's see how these to load up games
okay here we are in the games hub and I
have a couple of applications installed
on both devices will try to launch them
at the same time and see which one gets
to the start praying first let's try be
jeweled life three two one go the
optimist evan has an advantage here
again now between the two devices the
optimist seventh has a 16 gigabyte
internal memory and the omnia 7 has an
eight gigabyte internal memory now i'm
sure this is not the reason for the five
six or seven second advantage to the
optimist 7 in terms of browser speed but
let's see how quickly they can load our
games
still in advantage the optima 7 and it
looks like it will finish first and then
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten okay let's be here let's say
with one by approximately nine seconds
let's try another game let's try flight
control so three two one go
looks like they will be right
head-to-head yeah so they may not like
control in the exact same amount of time
while being at the screen you might see
the difference between the AMOLED
display on the omnia 7 and the LG
optimus seven colors are more vibrant on
the omnia 7 contrast is of course
fantastic as you would expect from any
Super AMOLED screen blacks are black and
not backlit blacks which show up as gray
on the optimal setting so in terms of in
terms of the display the omnia 7 is the
winner here let's try to load up fruit
ninja 3 2 1
there's a slight advantage but it's
negligible to the optimal seven I say
hello young was with half a second and
the last game I want to try to load on
both is logic games three two one go
slight advantage here to the omnia 7
this time but the optimist cellphone
catches up you can see the deep blacks
and the optimist 71 again let's see now
and so it's approximately one second in
last two games and it was eight seconds
on which you would like let's run did
you alive again because it might have
been an anomaly three two one go
looks like the optimal seven is ahead
again one two three yeah this time it
loaded up the application only three
seconds faster but still faster than the
omnia 7 so this concludes our test of
the omnia 7 compared to the optimist 7
in terms of game launch speeds and
internet browsing the LG optimus 7 was
overall quicker it depends on the
application loaded and on the websites
loaded but it was winning definitely on
an average of three to four seconds
let's say five seconds in internet
browsing and depending on the game
loaded we've seen a difference of three
seconds in go a schedule test and the
one maybe one and a half or sometimes
even half a second faster on other games
