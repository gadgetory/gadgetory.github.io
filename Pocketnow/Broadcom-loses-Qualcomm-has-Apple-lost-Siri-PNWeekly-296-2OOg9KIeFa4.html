is kind of a big deal though we've got a
lot to talk about make sure you're
charged and ready for episode two nine
six of the pocket now weekly recorded
march 16th at noon pacific this weekly
podcast is where we discussed and de
sect those gadgets that make our lives
mobile smartphones tablets and wearables
it's all the stuff you wished existed
when you were a kid and talking to your
computer was a science-fiction dream
hello computer hello so i'm juan carlos
bag now contributing editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. jules wong are you
finally back from your adventures in
travel yes I am I am I don't have any
jet lag at all so oh he's a machine
ladies and gentlemen yeah
only had like a little nap at the
beginning of the flight my snoring
disrupted my I was in the middle seat of
the middle aisle so I was surprised to
find that my side partners had moved
away from me so I got the whole little
section to myself so I could like
stretch out my legs and and watch
science without being disrupted by or
having to like be uncomfortable at all
well I'm glad that worked out for you I
can I can definitely attest to the manly
power and aggression of your support
well I'm glad that you have realized
that although Jaime Rivera has taught me
some pretty cool tips so he is a manly
and powerful no purple indeed indeed
well if you wanna not sleep through this
podcast as we are broadcasting this live
at 3:00 p.m. on Friday March 16th happy
st. Patty's Day in advance to
but uh do participate in our chats we
have this going on on Twitter with the
hashtag P and weekly whatever your
comments you make will be able to track
that hashtag and respond to them in real
time and if you can't do though do that
you can email us with your questions and
any thoughts that you happen to have at
podcast at pocketnow.com i had to
remember that for a second I was like
it's not the hashtag it's the it's the
email address email is hard it's like
trying to remember someone's phone
number and it's not it's not a Twitter
handle so you can't use the Hat you have
to be the outside they asked me that the
not the pound the at so I'm right it's
yeah and and that you're old enough to
still call the hashtag a pound sign
which is hilarious so you know I mean
and people my age are still kind on that
threshold in most of the many ways would
just call them a hashtag it's it's it's
the Twitter or the social worlds that
are combining and controlling us and
taking over our feet and we made the
joke on on Newegg now last week about
algorithms taking over our lives and I
just saw that did have you seen the I
mean you've been traveling so I know
this is probably a no but you should
check out there's a documentary on what
an algorithm even is and how it impacts
your daily life and it's actually a
pretty well produced piece of media I
really enjoyed it yeah I love all these
formulas and things that are set by
people in order to achieve a certain
results between the ranges and the
things and you have to stop me right
here because otherwise I'm going to go
into different you know I you know so
yes please join the conversation we
already have a couple tweets coming in
using that PN weekly hashtag of course I
see mr. Andrew Wallace mr. fat produce
on Twitter a guest of the podcast and a
longtime viewer I'm all we I always get
his name wrong
the meme wrangle on the mean guy also
tweeted some some people I don't know
yeah we're get to that question a little
bit mr. Peter hatin also joining the
show thank you so much
we always appreciate that conversation
that live chatter definitely hit that P
and weekly but I think we need to jump
straight into some news because we've
got some big news that we're gonna be
covering after the middle of our show in
the ad break but we also have some
really interesting stories the top
stories from pocket now this week just
all the smartphone and mobile news
that's fit to consume indeed for the
week of March 12 2018 this is all the
mobile tech news that is fit to podcasts
the information spoke to former Apple
employees working on Siri who have said
that the company never had a cohesive
vision never had consistent and strong
leadership and has been left behind by
the likes of Amazon and Google speaking
of Apple the company has plans for a
March 27 event to address the needs of
educators it's expected that new iPad
pro models in 11 inch in 13-inch sizes
as well as an entry-level 13-inch
MacBook will be announced Amazon is
voluntary making a recall six variants
of its Amazon basics portable power
banks are deemed at risk to catch excuse
me to catch fire and cause damage to
skin and property users should check on
pocketnow.com
if their item is affected and if it is
contact Amazon for disposal and a full
refund Android wear is becoming layer OS
Google announced the branding change
just ahead of Baselworld the world's
lost largest trade show for jewelry and
watches the move acknowledges that
Android OMS have less to do with the
platform than legacy watch brands and
the fact that a third of device
activations in 2017 were paired with
iPhones HTC is working on a project
called imagine what we've been calling
the Yi 12 what we believe at least Evan
blast reporting for VentureBeat has been
told that this would
come out this could come out at the ye
12-plus instead not clear if we'll be
getting two devices at once or if
there's just one device that we're
talking about it has four cameras edge
sense 2.0 a bigger display with less of
a bezels and much much more
well there have been a few delays it
should be out late this spring and
finally today's the day sales begin for
the Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus deals are
all about and again you can check pocket
now for those and or at your local
carrier if you want to if you
pre-ordered your unit in the US and are
on one of the CDN carry CDM a carriers
of the nation you may have gotten a
Verizon SIM instead of the Sprint one
that you wanted Samsung and Sprint have
apologized and customers are getting new
Sims shipped overnight so with all that
going through let's start at the top
talk about Siri and talk about the
claims here me by again former employees
as well as one of the heads of the Siri
team at the time when I knew that
between 2010 and 2011 they were working
on Siri which they had acquired from as
a startup that was spun off of a
paramilitary kind of a private business
and between 2010 and 2011 it sounded
like they had a bunch of trouble between
both Apple maps which was in development
at the time and we ended up knowing how
much of a disaster that was at launch
and Siri which would like it was a
novelty but I couldn't say that it was
popular or like it was a days like Siri
was acquired and it was a product of its
time we've been trying to crack this nut
better voice actions better voice
controls since the early days of cell
phones not even if smartphone
and I recently took a spin back using an
HTC touch pro and Microsoft voice
Actions from that time you if people
remember blackberry there were different
apps and services you could use for
enhanced voice actions like Vlingo that
everyone was trying to get us to that
science fiction masterpiece communicate
with your gadget with your data and with
your services by uttering voice commands
so Siri for when Siri was acquired by
Apple I think was sort of that step
towards trying to catch Apple the iOS
ecosystem up to the functionality that
these other platforms had Microsoft's
voice actions were I mean you had to
memorize what the syntax of your command
was but it was pretty capable and it was
still one of the best voice calling you
know like you know call my wife and it
would call my wife and in like it seems
to work even more consistently back then
than our current super smart machine
learning assistants work today every
time I say you know I use my wife's name
it'll pull every contact that has my
wife's middle name which is almost all
of the female members of my family so my
wife's name is Marie and I was I call
Marie back now and they'll be like well
do you mean Christina Marie Bridget
Marie Ann Marie you're like no no I
don't Google I've been using you for
years you should know who my wife is by
now and I have to set up like a nickname
so I am some way I have to remember that
when I want to call my wife I have to
say call wife I can't use my wife's name
so you know I think most people would be
of the I don't think there'd be a lot of
disagreement that Siri has not kept pace
even some of the more recent updates to
Bixby while I don't think Bixby's in any
danger of reaching that critical tipping
point of being the voice assistant that
wins its delivering some really
formidable macro functionality you know
your ability to control multiple actions
with a single command is pretty awesome
and you would think that Apple with its
ecosystem really trying to get home kit
and and home automation up off the
ground that they'd be leading the way on
that
Apple makes agreement for ecosystem all
the time but they don't seem to have
found the push for what gets Siri not
only up to the rest of voiced assistance
on the market but what actually
surpasses them and I think that's it
sounds like within the company itself
there was not much coordination in
bringing Siri to be more advanced in to
be more like an Alexa or a Google
assistant because these tasks you know
voice calls and and messaging you know
they seem pretty simple at first and
then you get more complex and you have
to and you want to be able to pay for
something or you want to link to some
other document in space and that I mean
the team it sounds like just hasn't been
coordinated enough they didn't even know
that home pod the home pod the smart
speaker that they were working on since
2015 was it was a thing until just
shortly before it was announced so and
that's definitely I think one of the
biggest challenges it faces a company
like Apple where you no longer have a
design guy at the top of the company and
you have a relatively small team I the
the we say the team at Apple and it
really does feel sometimes like there
are very limited resources for such a
humongous such a such a wealthy
organization not just blew it yeah it's
not just like B team it's multiple teams
that work on their own thing in Apple's
leadership trusts each team to be good
enough well enough to handle these
things on their own and at some point
when the convergence comes it's always
how much kind of traffic they run
they're they're you know sort of they
run their organization almost like
skunkworks
you know where they're keeping projects
highly secretive even from other members
throughout the organization and then
because of that these individual members
on each team become very fluid so when
iOS has a problem they're probably
drawing resources from their machine
learning or from their
OS X departments to fill in the gaps to
get projects finished so they can meet
their their shipping dates like Apple is
notoriously good at not missing a
shipping date iPhone 10 notwithstanding
but lately that I think that's men
products which are less finished then
they used to be in sort of the history
of this company and more aggressive
changes coming that this company is
gonna have a much more difficult time
keeping pace with if they can't find
ways to better coordinate and better
distribute their resources across the
entire organization so one of the former
leaders of Syria let me just try and see
if because it's not Scott Forstall Scott
Forstall was the overhead overall head
of iOS and he was tasked with Siri but
then he passed it on to the Williamson
excuse me this person named Williamson
in order to work on it and this and he
said this decisions concerning technical
leadership of the software and server
infrastructure were made by employees
below his at level and while he was
responsible for getting the team on the
chair on track
he said that Siri was a disaster after
launch it was slow software was riddled
with serious bugs and it seems and he
says those problems lie entirely with
the original Siri team certainly not me
and also I kind of feel like there's a
branding problem for the most virtual
assistants we've we've I think there are
people currently using modern iPhones
who their perception of what Siri can
and can't do is still informed by the
first generation of Siri that they used
and they're not they're like well Siri
couldn't do this and it was terrible for
that and they don't they won't go back
and re-educate themselves as to what the
platform can do now and I think that
harms Apple because they get less good
information on how consumers are using
those services I think that's also one
of the reasons why we've seen so many
false start
rebranding a 10
from Google Google assistant Google now
now on tap all of these different
initiatives which have all danced around
the same kind of let's our cards you
know like what will proactively serve
you information will try and respond to
your needs in real time well try and
anticipate your needs in real time and
every every like year or so they change
something enough that they call it a
different product even though it's all
the same general idea it's Google Voice
Search and you know we'll put a new name
on it and then it's gonna feel like a
new product and that's gonna be exciting
and consumers are gonna want to try it
again I think Apple could actually
benefit from some kind of shift say you
know hey Siri is Siri is evolving into
this and we can call it something new
and we can move on and this is a radical
new paradigm for your ability to
communicate with your phone even if it's
just what would have normally been a
very you know minor iteration or
iterative improvement
it might get people trying their voice
assistance on iPhones again or trying to
push the boundaries again and that could
give Apple much better information as to
what they need to do next to keep pace
regardless of the big steps that they
would want to take in order to
revitalize interest in Siri they're
gonna have to still do some of the back
lots the background basically to get
these interactions more I mean when you
think about in Siri was meant to be an
airport guide of sorts where to be a lot
of things
I mean ear but you know when s RI or
what it was spun off of us RI that was
their first kind of thing and then it
was supposed to grow out of it just a
you know it was supposed to grow and
rose the database at high I don't know
that there's you I don't know that Apple
has the patience or the fortitude to
actually in-house iterate Siri and
improve Siri to where she needs to be I
think we're looking at some strategic
purchases some you know such strategic
acquisitions bringing a couple other
teams on board
I would really like to see a major
manufacturer take a hound seriously
because what a very small team of people
were able to do with natural language
processing and the speed of which hound
can process queries is pretty incredible
it definitely doesn't stand stack up
against Amazon or Google now in terms of
what those platforms are capable of but
just the starting point where hound was
that incorporated into Apple's ecosystem
what series backbone could be really
formidable and I would catch Apple up a
long way towards what consumers expect
if Apple were to acquire hound that
would be a very interesting move but I
don't think the hound is in that certain
market since they're already they
already have Shazam which is supposed to
really help them out I think that and
even then you know they're running into
roadblocks in terms of the actual
acquisition process so they can't really
work anything you know that yet and with
the move that they've done financially
in terms of the repatriation of their
profits and whatnot with repatriating
profits you could actually say oh well
now you can legally spend money in the
United States acquiring companies again
yeah but they have a whole bunch of
share buyback programs that they still
want to do so that's why invest in your
company and invest in talent and you
know you know invest in R&amp;amp;D when you can
just buy back stock this is a this is
from das otter on twitter using the pn
weekly hashtag is having multiple
offerings for assistance a good thing
for customers in the end infusion can
cripple the user in choosing which one
for them and is also complaining about
my audio apparently there's some delay
on my audio which I'm not surprised
because Google Hangouts is awesome what
do you think Jules I'm fairly negative
on having multiple voice assistants on
one phone I don't think that really
helps anything
in terms of that like stuffing and Alexa
and Google assistant and oh here's our
own OEM maid thing which I believe yet
HTC has done this with the you 11 the
yeah that was that was interesting well
the you 11 actually had three you you
could have it was the HTC Sense
companion it was Alexis Alexis Alexis
Alexis and Google assistant so I mean
but if you didn't really need all them
at once and you you to it they'd be like
unit text or at least you know if you
could use them you they'd have to be
very specifically tasked so and I don't
they the consumer to memorize which
service what they don't have the
regiment to do that really I really
think that the company that had the best
take on this was instead of trying to
reinvent the wheel all they did was add
a front-end and some additional
functionality and that was Motorola back
when Google was making their big push
for voice Actions and controls moto
added just a little layer on top but it
was the same general backbone and it
afforded Motorola users just a bit more
flexibility like even just retraining
the phone to respond to a different hot
word you know that wasn't revolutionary
change but that meant that the phone was
was personalized for you and any like
that's the same thing if you're
listening to this podcast over speakers
and you have an echo in your home and I
say Alexa your echo is gonna respond to
it whereas we should be able to say at
this point retrain the local hardware in
a secure fashion so we still maintain
security of the platform but so that you
can call your assistant of choice by
whatever name so that it responds only
to you that kind of that kind of stuff
still drives me crazy that we haven't
seemed to trigger that kind of
customization or personality and moto
had that I what on the the Moto X to you
know like the droids the droid turbo
and I remember them slowing down over
time where you put in a query and it
would just take for it like it would log
them notes down and it would take
forever to send it to Google and whatnot
and yeah it's just
but hopefully that would be more I don't
think you would be able to integrate it
directly but it would be more seamless
these days hopefully if you don't make
your own voice assistant then you don't
have control over the platform and I
think one of the things that did that
did harm
Motorola's approach was making a
front-end for google service meant when
google changed things on their service
they would have to adapt to those
changes and sometimes those changes
wouldn't necessarily jive with what
Motorola was trying to accomplish and I
think that was one of the things that
slowed them down
but instead now what we have is this
arms race of reinventing the wheel there
are so many things that I think Bixby
does really well but unload to use Bixby
especially when there's a dedicated bit
of hardware that's their primary method
of interaction with Bixby that stupid
little button on the side of the phone
that I really can't stand so instead if
there was some way that Samsung and
Google could coordinate those efforts
just a little bit better that Samsung
phones still have this increased
enhanced capability and Google's
probably running to try and incorporate
it into a future build of Android but I
would prefer having one way i I named my
phone Franklin and I can say hey
Franklin I need to do this can you pull
up this app and then if it's Bixby or if
it's Google now or a Google assistant it
doesn't matter I don't care who actually
opens the app and does the thing for me
I just want to be able to talk to my
phone and have my phone figure it out
and I still think that was a huge missed
opportunity for outlets like IBM I think
IBM could have made a humongous argument
for killing the app I have a digital
Butler that does everything for you and
you don't have to push square get app to
do this thing you say hey you know hey
IBM Watson what's a good sushi
restaurant
within two miles of me and book me a
table and it'll go and take care of all
of that stuff for me and I don't have to
worry about you know futzing with
different user interfaces or specific
commands I really think that could have
been a huge consumer win if any company
at the business sector of this had
focused their resources on the
commercial market well speaking of those
markets I want to turn our attention
this markets actually and go into a
little bit more specialized into the
education market where Apple is trying
to do a little something here with
possibly we've been hearing about a new
MacBook Air but even cheaper than the
current $9.99 price point that they have
right now and there's also a word of a
refresh of the regular iPad the nine
point seven inch size for like 300 bucks
kind of deal that we have going on which
is I mean I don't see any other people
it's easy to assume that education you
know everyone has a MacBook when you're
going off to call it and you're in the
creative field and whatnot and there are
iPads too because the apps are all
optimized and it's on a big screen it's
you know it's it takes people into a
very specific kind of experience when
they're being educated about something
but I feel like we're going into the
same kind of discussion here with smart
assistants whereas you know series being
left behind by Google assistant in
Amazon Alexa Microsoft and Google has
been optimizing their platforms with the
Chromebooks and windows 10s which is
gonna be a new kind of laptop thing
going on they're going to be they're
changing their ways and that they're
hoping at least Google already has a
good bit of growth to show for it
Microsoft's hoping for that too
especially with the surface laptop they
it seems that that has been performing
pretty decently so now it's apples
turned I'm wondering how both of these
play into the strategy here
I I have a lot more faith in Apple
iterating on a new iPad for education
rather than a MacBook I just don't see a
lot of excitement from Apple about their
current offerings of desktop and laptop
computers well I mean not to get not to
boil us down too much but wouldn't a 799
macbook me oh my god it's Apple I can
get this for a very very affordable
price no no there's and there's also a
part of me that wants to say as soon as
you try and youth market like that like
this is the MacBook for kids going to
school immediately that's gonna be the
least desirable product that Apple has
ever released and it's kind of like when
you make like a Kia for the youth market
and you advertise it with break dancing
hamsters the majority of people I see
driving that car are like senior
citizens who are very cost-conscious and
don't really care about image as much as
they wanted you know an inexpensive go
go to the grocery store vehicle you're
used to fight yeah oh you script a girl
in your iPad pro ad to say what's the
theater that's that's exactly the point
that I'm getting at is apples excitement
over their product lines we know
majority of their money comes from iOS
and if they're gonna continue to make
inroads into education and fight back
against some of the negative stim
negative stories that have come out
after recent initiatives like LA Unified
using iPads that program crashing and
burning in a very expensive and very
embarrassing debacle for Los Angeles I
if they're going to make that play I
think Apple probably has more momentum
more talent more energy playing put
behind the iOS side of this and I think
it's gonna be the better argument
against all those products that you were
mentioning Chromebooks and Windows 10
modular and mobile tablet configuration
devices right now I think those offer
the better bang for buck and if Apple
seeds that market then it's really
difficult to climb back and so that
means that
a kid's formidable years where they're
educating themselves on technology and
consumerism they're gonna have Google
products in their hands they're gonna
have Microsoft products in their hands
if Apple doesn't have a to ninety-nine
offering that can compete with a good
Chromebook or a good streamlined Windows
10 multimode PC then they're dead in the
water so I think that ad as cynical as
it is and as dumb as it is that you know
you get what's the computer ah it's it's
so terrible and it's so like anti
millennial that it makes me want to like
I don't know it makes me want to break
Apple products I I'm so frustrated by
that terrible ad but it's not wrong from
the corporate perspective that that
absolutely is I think where they should
be focusing their energy a couple things
I'm worried about with the timing of
this release is that one we're headed
into this is all intended for the next
school year for the next late summer
fall season and we're only going to be
learning about the Sun next new software
features that might be coming for you
know educators are for it it's the
general audience during WWC in June and
there has been the recent kind of
worries about Apple messing about with
iOS to engage it for services rather
than being a more of a QA smash the bugs
kind of thing going on so there's a
whole there's a worry about software now
if they can address that during this
event which is happening in Chicago at a
local technical prep high school they I
mean I would assume I would hope that
they would address some of these little
things and not just you know say code
them teach people how to code for Swift
and look like that now that's um I think
that would be a good idea well no I
think there's there's definitely options
definitely potential there too I I don't
know I just kind of feel like Apple's
grip on the education market I don't
really feel that there I mean you
talking about coding in Swift I don't
really feel they're taking advantage of
their fashion branding for the education
market like they could be and I think a
lot of their momentum is really adults
who have a fond relationship with Apple
because it just works making purchasing
decisions for students and I don't think
that always gels with what would
actually be the best opportunity or the
best tech to outfit kids with and I also
think that we're gonna be seeing a
generation of school kids coming up that
are gonna be significantly savvy er
about how they're going to interact with
data and services coming forward and
eventually they're gonna be getting to
points where they are they're making
decisions for how they're going to
interact with educational materials and
it doesn't seem like apples really
joining that conversation like they
could be or like they should be so one
of the platforms that hasn't been joined
the conversation in wearables at least
you can make an argument for the art
traditional kind of mindset for Android
wear is Android wear because it started
out as oh hey let's get all the Android
OEMs to make smartwatches it's going to
be a big thing and they realized oh
people this isn't as much of a growth
market as it is for us to sustain this
kind of thing whereas other you know the
more legacy watch manufacturers is
they're all interested this is a great
way to rejuvenate watch sales for them
and it's oh hey look at this there's a
screw this is a screen on our watch
that's pretty interesting that's new I'm
gonna get that as what a 60 70 80 year
old or someone who want you know want to
be fashionable or who has always had a
watch that is still kind of a growth
radical for them so we're less pretty
good idea in terms of a name I'm not
sure how bad let's do it with the iPhone
bit but yeah that's a well it's a good
idea well I look at what we're talking
about we're talking about Google not
finding exactly the traction that they
wanted
cooling off on that market for a short
period of time where we haven't heard a
lot of really hot Android wear news and
now they're coming back and rebranding
and they're taking away Android because
of the you know sort of the relationship
where people are using wear watches with
iOS and they're calling it something new
do we really think we're going to be
getting some new boundary-pushing
platform of services and performance no
it's gonna be a big improvement over
what Android wear was the same kinds of
little bug fixes and security patches
that we're always getting but they want
to have people talking about Smart Watch
software again and the an easy way to do
that is just to change the name of what
that platform is so I like that this
does make it feel a bit more inclusive
any consumer confusion that you could
use an Android wear watch with iOS this
should hopefully help abate those
concerns or help re-educate those
consumers but more than anything else
we're oh s I want to see excitement from
Google again and by calling it we're oh
s to me this means it should be an
operating system you can wear
not necessarily wear on your wrist maybe
we could see some return to Google
trying to iterate on a heads-up display
something that you know we could maybe
look at Intel's vaunt technology so you
don't have the same sort of Borg look
with a weird offshoot on your glasses
anything that would move the needle on
more organic interactions with brief
pieces of information the watch is a
great piece of technology from its
earliest inception on the wrist that
with a one brief little look you can get
an important piece of information the
time and now we can also expand that for
notifications and health and fitness and
whole range of other things but tiny
little snippets of information up at eye
level would be even better and we we we
all sort of get this if you're a techie
and you're into into these this kind of
content the SmartWatch is not
to undo itself the Smart Watch is an
evolutionary stepping stone towards some
other way of training consumers to
interact with products and services just
like the Bluetooth headset isn't really
worn anymore we went through that we
went through that phase and we learned a
lot from how people used audio for phone
calls for voice actions and then we used
that to improve the core functionality
of the services behind that hardware the
Smart Watch is cool I wear a SmartWatch
I like wearing a SmartWatch I hate
having my phone make any noise but as
soon as I have something better than the
SmartWatch I'm gonna go back to a dumb
watch or just like a basic fitness
tracker or something and I want my
information served up even better than
what the SmartWatch can deliver and and
that's where I think we need to build
towards I don't hear that conversation
coming from Google my husband's coming
from anyone it's not coming from it's
not coming from the companies that want
it being involved with it and it's not
coming from the visionaries that would
be in Google but but it completely is
it's coming from companies like Garmin
who they're trying to rework how you how
you receive information and how you can
control information in your car it's
coming from Intel again working on a
laser projection system for your eyeball
it's coming from Microsoft as they're
working into mixed reality services and
there they are iterating in the back end
startups that have that at this point we
need to be utilizing it if not Google
Google will not be paying attention to
that since they're trying to at least
grow subscriber base or grow a user base
out of this and those things which are
great you know it's gray in the
background but we need to be able to
build that up know about growing a user
in a subscriber base do you put out
Android wear 2.0 and then completely
disappear from the conversation for a
year is out you do that but it's also
you have to be able to listen to someone
and you they have to be able to grab
attention from Google in the first place
they're like really grand so what what
what did they do that we also criticized
Microsoft with Windows Phone
you came out with Android wear 2.0 you
disappeared
you didn't iterate you didn't provide
new functionality I get these my new
little updates that they can change you
know the font and they can change some
of the layout of my alerts and then the
first big piece of news we get from
Google is that Oh we're gonna change the
name and these are all the waters that
will have the name change is there a new
word on functionality is there any new
word on mic is is there any conversation
that they've learned from consumer
behavior with a SmartWatch that they can
use that Android wear 2.0 was strangled
by its by the then-current ecosystem of
om that said yeah now we're just gonna
drop this because the the sales were not
helping them and whatever helped that
these legacy watchmakers I think we were
doing their own track but it was like
they sort of relied on Google to do its
own thing that's not entirely true
though Jules because Android wear 2.0
had Casio fossil diesel huawei the
Huawei watch 2 was a wisdom Android wear
2.0 launch but also my love dropped out
for a while Rowland did you got Tommy
Hilfiger I mean like Android wear 2.0
wasn't strangled there was more wealth
of choice and more wealth of opportunity
than Google had ever faced but for those
who do work Google is responsible for
the software so where was Google for all
of those manufacturers those those
companies don't leave the software and
hardware in conversation interactively
advancing the form factor the we're just
doing what they know manufacturers those
manufacturers are responsible for the
software in the features that Google is
supposed to provide them no it's not but
they're not but that feedback loop
wasn't prone wasn't making available the
innovation that the platform needed you
get what I'm saying well no no no this
is you're putting you're putting the
chicken way before the egg here Google
is the one who's responsible for
dictating what Android wear is and is
not capable of and so if they
can't just go it rewind hardware that
doesn't fully embrace all of the
features of Android where it's still on
Google to say well we've got LTE
capability we've got this capability we
can do this we can do all day heart rate
tracking and even Google's more direct
initiatives like their partnership with
LG produced very poor experiences for
consumers so that's not on fossil it's
not fossils responsibility do not
Android where's spec sheet to consumers
it's fossils responsibility to sell an
attractive timepiece and if I look for
that and if it were can't generate and
if Google can't actually move the needle
on that then it's not gonna be tag heuer
it's not gonna be Mont Blanc it's not
gonna be Hugo Boss always look up the
techie and geeky side of the discussion
to try and make that play this is all
this is all on glued I don't think so
because they went they're not a hardware
company I keep going through this time
and time again and it's the users
they're the first four speakers and
except for a smartphone I was a mission
that was created after the initiation of
Android wear when they had pretty much
no idea does the buck stop with or is
that is does the buck stop with the
people that Google partners with I think
the buck stops with Google oh I'm not
saying that the buck stops doesn't stop
with Google oh but there was no room for
growth there was no room for technology
that is not true because the Apple watch
decimated Android and Tizen and
absolutely room for growth consumer it
was at this it was it was its own
hardware and its own ideas about what
feedback they had had from current users
where as the Google ecosystem diverse as
it is open-source as it is was not
really fit
we found the fundamental flaw of Google
strategy if they can't iterate and if
they can't support their manufacturing
partners then they need to do it
themselves and if the pixels of
commentary on smartphones where was
their commentary on wearables
mmm-hmm again that's on Google Google
wants where to be a success they need to
make it a success even Microsoft had to
dictate what the future of Windows 8 and
then Windows 10 was going to beat with
their own hardware I don't know where
Android wear 2.0 left Android OMS with
the the smartwatches initiatives that
they didn't follow through with and but
that had let but that took away any data
that Google would have used to perhaps
retune something as it's running Android
wear then you're a part of the Google
ecosystem in Google yet no that's not
right no Frank customer uses those and
again we're talking about different
audiences between an LG SmartWatch and a
Nixon sock SmartWatch so yeah and even
from that fitted base I think we could
have Android wear evolved into a more
DeMars platform than already Oz if it
were just based on that and that's why
we haven't seen the framing the the
innovation the the software features
that I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna put a
cap on this because we do need to move
on but I'm gonna put this out to our
audience the success or failure of
Android wear is that on the company that
makes the services and the software or
is that on the manufacturing partners
somehow not living up to the feature set
and the software that was provided to
them drop us a comment drop us a tweet
hit us up on the youtubes on Twitter's
or shoot us an email podcast at
pocketnow.com I'll be curious to hear
your thoughts on that real quick I do
want to cover this HTC u12 because
basically it looks like HTC is making an
LG v 30 and that makes me sad how so
well LG 30 it's it's a V 30 combined
with what was the freaking like phone
that Huawei was pushing around with
friends
not not to me 10 no it was the mid-range
it was the mime on six and right
yes that was the one that had working I
was I was gonna I was gonna say it's
basically a V V 30 from the back with
the dual selfie camera from the V 20 and
III if you were just gonna stay with LG
no that's what I was gonna say is is
that that's that to me that's what it
sort of resembles and and that to me
just sort of kind of further lends
credence to my hypothesis that whatever
was in the pipeline at HTC all of the
top talent is now over at Google because
this is not particularly inspired
smartphone manufacturing and I left the
company before you know 2016 or has
freaking like this this phone apparently
was in design or something and for the
past what six twelve months so every day
that that would you know but even sadder
like HTC looking here at the market and
saying hey you know we could rip off the
LG G six I don't know if I could give LG
that much credence I are you kidding me
this looks exactly like I'm not sure
about that man sure that this doesn't
look exactly the same it's like it's
like it's like are yours and listeners
out there using the P n we clears up on
the email whether or not you feel that
the concepts and the mock-ups for the
u12
look exactly like LG's last year
smartphone manufacturing or is joules
right and that this is just such an
organically easy to adjust with the
little bandit oval mask around a
dual-camera sensor with a circular
fingerprint sensor mounted right below
it what are your say influence of design
over the rear of these three people who
are more familiar
you then I would I would take away from
that conversation that we have a very
strong fan base on pocketnow.com I I
think you have every opportunity to play
your case to the same the same viewers
oh we both reach out to you every week
it's tough for the podcast man this is
this is this is imagination Network yeah
speaking of imagination htc let's talk
about that six inches 1440p snapdragon a
45 blah blah blah we've heard these
specs before cameras 16 + 12 megapixels
at the back which we haven't heard
anything about the purpose of those
cameras what results those are designed
to achieve and then there's also edge
sense that little thing that was on the
pixel - when you eleven that way you'd
squeeze the sides um
now there's gonna be a 2.0 we're not
sure if there's gonna be new hardware or
a change in hardware and what that means
for its purposing I'm not sure if this
whole experiment with the squeeza
interface it has been a success what do
you think I I think it's emboldened HTC
to continue with that as a gesture just
because it was still on the pixel like I
think that's enough for them to keep it
and because of the way that those teams
were we rearranged between HTC and
Google I would imagine that they would
keep some sort of synergy or consistency
in that side of the platform so so
whether or not we see crazy
functionality it's basically just
another way of putting a button on a
phone right I mean that's all it is it's
it's a shortcut it's a hardware shortcut
and they didn't want to have a big speed
button and now having gone back to like
the note 8 for a little while I I did
some some stuff at pocket at Newegg we
have the note 8 that looks exactly like
the LG G six know the the note anything
at all like the D 6 joules I feel like
you you might make a wrong phone camera
fingerprint sensor flash oh you mean the
fingerprint sensor that's offset in a
rectangular window to the side of the
camera
as opposed to the raised camera module
30 and the circular fingerprint sensor
which sits just below you mean that what
you're talking about
school cameras on the back of the phone
or other layouts for remember camera
flash that's always cooperating the
Samsung of 2015 man you know that I'm
song of 2015 Jules I really don't trust
your eye for design so we should
probably hit up our sponsor right quick

I'm agree I'm afraid I can't even save
I'm afraid I agree with Kwon this time
you're just wrong as wrong and in my
last name which is a lovely hashtag P
and weekly continue the conversation
over there I know you their opinions
already but hey I'm just I'm just here
I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up to the
democracy of our viewers as to whether
or not smartphone design has become so
Jules I'm leaving in my mind why sure
sure but you're not gonna change my mind
about it just because it
all generic hey you have to do to place
earned about changing your mind if our
viewers say you know it was a unique
design and a unique concept the l16 from
whatever company that you like in the
whole night you know nothing Lytro the
l16 which had 16 cameras on its back I
mean it was made by right row then yeah
sure
light right the company you're talking
about is light row all right that's no
that's not that's not a debate Jules I
know you want to fight me up this week
it's like but it's it's light light row
made the light field camera but light
made the l16 light made the l16 okay I
mean that's a fact not fake news but
what does that have anything to do with
HTC obviously ripping off the v30 like
obviously I was well I was trying to
make a transition over to Broadcom and
qualcomm because the news this week is
that President Donald Trump you're not
you're not yeah I know you've given up
all in like assumption or of yes and
here I was trying to this you made the
ad break and then and then we got went
onto the side side I can't yes and when
I have no idea where you're going with
that Jules but you're right we probably
should talk about Broadcom because that
is a really big deal in the world of
business again it's a continuing story
that we've been watching unfold and I
think with a lot of trepidation there
are people been concerned about these
mega corporate mergers and this is
looked like a fairly hostile acquisition
so at the same time that we started
getting stories out that Intel could be
getting into this race and looking at
Qualcomm politics on this have gettin
have gotten viscerally aggressive with
the Trump administration reaching out to
say they would not be in favor of this
or they would be outright banning the
potential of an acquisition and I two
days ago
Broadcom complying with the Trump order
and walking away as seemingly completely
walking away from their plans to try and
acquire walk-ons
what what do you think will be the
ramifications
because it looks like it leaves Qualcomm
in an actionable position like it looks
like now Qualcomm could be up for grabs
from any other major corporations that
wanted to throw their hat hat into the
ring - well I was just about to say
that's was this was a pretty interesting
week in terms of the troughs and peaks
of the drama around this deal because
Intel doesn't necessarily have an
interest in you know Qualcomm in itself
it is worried about Broadcom I think
Intel has its hedges against Qualcomm in
terms of Apple because it's doing its
own modems and it's also working towards
5g and with but with the biggest client
that you could have with Apple they have
the interests there they're gonna stick
with it meantime if if Broadcom were to
put into put itself into the picture of
Qualcomm I'm not sure exactly how that
would actually work out since the
assumed position that Broadcom would
take was that oh they're not really
going to invest in 5g and that would
leave Intel fighting off against other
companies like Olaf Chinese firms Kwame
tsmc perhaps more and that would really
shake up things in the sector and would
leave 5g more towards manipulated more
towards China which the US would have an
interest in keeping the definitions and
standards of Internet protocols away
from that since they consider them a big
security threat seriously not only just
from the corporate perspective but also
our government and law enforcement
perspective - oh yeah this is this is
intertwined here so like let's start
back with the Broadcom here because they
announced this week that they were going
to read domicile from Singapore to the
u.s. in April and that was one month
early that was they previously announced
that they were gonna read domicile in
May and now there's going to be April
and you know what dates
that they were going to redownload Sal
on April 3rd that is just two days after
before the qual comes rescheduled
shareholder vote on the the the Board of
Directors which broad count has a big
interest in and a ballot of nominees
ready to go and that scheduling was due
to Qualcomm the the deal being
investigated by its the committee on
foreign investments in the US and they
were going to look into this and rod
Khan has been very hostile against
Qualcomm in this respect because they
said that since they're read AMA signing
in the US the CFIUS doesn't have
jurisdiction over them and wouldn't have
jurisdiction over them after the read
ama something happens and with that move
of making the Radames out date earlier
than expected
well that kind of triggered the CFIUS
to advise Trump at least in my view to
advise Trump that this deal may be
happening in Trump said all right yeah
sure let's put the kibosh on this so
there was a lot of gesturing from broad
coms part and it just didn't work out so
I think one of the interesting parts of
the commentary coming out on this and
thanks for that recap I I've noticed a
lot of people talking about Qualcomm
being able to breathe easy
or this Broadcom merger this Broadcom
acquisitions not going through and so
now Qualcomm shareholders don't have to
worry about pressure from other venues
with Intel aggressively getting into the
radio space working with Apple for
modems I really think this makes
Qualcomm look like it's still not
completely strong enough to fend not
strong enough to fend off an outside
influence trying to acquire their base
and I think Intel would be a company
that our current administration our
current government wouldn't necessarily
be as afraid of them acquiring qualcomm
and that that would lead to this
you know again this mega team-up this
mega force that could exert a lot of
pressure over the future of 5g standards
and protocols i think there's still a
much quieter possibility of qualcomm
getting optioned by a player like intel
I think with the baggage that they have
already with antitrust lawsuits from
Apple and all the other regulatory
agencies for their prior practices of
just you know holding over CDMA chips
above clients heads without you know if
they didn't agree to the certain
contract that's being debated right now
it's not it it's what's not sure to take
a big hit on Qualcomm it's definitely a
specter over their heads
yeah and that is going to be a big
factor in whether a company like broad
Kahn was that could be aggressive in its
investments and is willing to you know
cut down on you know make big big
upfront purchases big upfront expenses
to deal with all these kinds of things
in order I'm not saying it's very likely
and again we would we would see a lot of
noise on this front and I'm sure other
other regulatory agencies would get
involved I'm just saying I think there
is the outside chance that if Broadcom
got this close I don't think Apple would
be too upset if Intel pushed the button
on acquiring Qualcomm and they already
had a working relationship with Intel
the psychology on that I think would be
a lot different than Broadcom making the
play again total speculation there is no
evidence to support that Intel's trying
to move into that space with that kind
of play I just think because Broadcom
showed how close they could get to
forcing an acquisition forcing Qualcomm
to the table on this that I don't think
it's outside the realm of possibility
that another player I mean I'm bringing
up Intel is a specific company but
anyone with deep enough pockets could
also make this Intel is is that it's the
specific country it's the number one in
the
and I think because of their failures in
the cellular cellular sector you know
they not being able to get 3G or 4G
properly to a clients and it's just this
makes sense they would be able to argue
that this is a different sector that
they could work in and hopefully appease
regulators and regulators in their view
um
it's plausible it's very plausible and
yeah but otherwise I don't see TSMC I
don't see if you keep going down the
list yeah the company that just popped
into my head that it would be hilarious
like I would support this acquisition
just for the comedy potential of like
Apple walking in and just paying cash
like apples had so many problems with
Qualcomm they just say f it we're just
gonna buy you they just walk in with
briefcases and briefcases and briefcases
full of money they just go here well
what we'll do we'll fix this problem
right now and we're done I mean yeah
that would be hilarious and great and
you know I it would it would be a circus
act the problem now what I would see
with problem with that is just again
Apple would probably only use it as a
parts farm and we totally know it
doesn't even make sense for portfolio
under their purview it really doesn't is
just to me it's it's that like it would
be hilarious you know like oh you
wouldn't you wouldn't help me buy
clothes while I went to a competitor big
mistake
like it would be the the sort of you
know apples final kiss off to their
relationship with Qualcomm they're just
quiet for the sake of selling it again
chopping him up like Richard Gere I have
no idea why a pretty woman on the brand
I need to watch hilarious
I have not seen that all right well I
should watch more with Richard Gere than
I am you know I I very much enjoy
Richard Gere's performances I think he's
an accomplished and capable actor and
surprisingly good
answer as someone who studied some tap
he's not bad you should check out
Chicago good times I don't know what I'm
saying here in terms of this this
formula on the hashtag P and weekly you
12 plus of course from vinny effing
madrix equals LG g v1 6 minus 2 divided
by 30 and that's what the you 12 plus is
I think it's pretty clear that Vinny is
saying that the basically the unholy
love child of the LG G and V series - a
couple of their numbers I mean totally
it's just you know I really want to take
the formula seriously for a second and
4/30
know 230 that's fit that's a 15th and
then 6 - the 15th is 5 and 14 15 so I
don't know where that's going
but yeah good good job but wait a minute
what's Roman numeral four or five G well
it's not really know what G is
interchangeable with the Roman numeral P
which was I believe was 400 so what is
that 400 - 500 g guy I mean like I want
to make sure I have that right I'm gonna
look it up right now
it's like CD because that would be 400
in any case I want to ask you one more
question or the or this this question at
least from who is it the the meme ranked
Lots who asked which phone from MWC 2018
would you be most happy to molest I mean
like that was that that was that joke he
was making they usually go Malaya no I
can't say that something else have a
hands on I guess what would be yours um
actually I'm so I mean the galaxy s 9 is
being really well covered with right now
I am really apprehensive
I don't want to use a word like
apprehensive I'm I'm very concerned and
very interested in seeing what Sony can
pull off this year I I keep coming back
to how much I enjoyed spending time with
the Xperia XE one compact and watching
them shift up their design and go to a
two by one aspect ratio display I want
to see like does this really solve some
of the problems that consumers say they
have with the brand or is this really
like is this kind of a lost cause at
this point people have figured out the
team that they're on and you can't
really change minds or increase market
share just by adopting the same specs as
other companies so they're they're
actually the company I'm most interested
in spending a little time with right now
I I really still want a Nokia phone the
new age you know fast Android updates
and yeah all that stuff so and I feel
like for me you know as a toughing you
know going guy probably the Nokia 7 or 7
plus it's a mid-range err but it's you
know it's not it's it has that kind of
some somewhat unique design again I like
I really don't have the I for for taste
or whatever but in terms of I mean when
you hear we describe the HTC hue 12 is
being oh it's it's a fingerprint sensor
with two cameras on it like that and and
all other phones are like that too like
that that's that's I know we're not
really following his formula exactly
because you should be doing PEMDAS but
Roman numeral G minus V minus six minus
two divided by 30 equals twelve point
nine so that would be 12 plus well I
mean I would I would have used the G for
a thousand because that's like the usual
kind of assignment it gets grant isn't
that M yeah well no that's Roman
numerals but but G isn't really a
traditional Roman numeral for anything
CD would be fat it's the Roman numerals
for
hundred DeeDee is 400 well that is one
yeah but you could also just write gee
that's I mean I'm I'm looking at it
right here on the internet so I
obviously no one's lying on the internet
obviously that one is lying on the
internet man
no one ever lies other than Internet why
would they and Roman numerals ivx LCD em
that's the policy here alternative forms
my goodness all right so that's that's
the most important takeaway from our
little deep dive it's one point nine and
so that would be almost there
yeah for us it's all well twelve plus
that's actually that's a great idea
I mean but it's it's just so common it's
like it's like freaking countdown and
you have to get twelve point nine from a
whole bunch of meaningless like oddly
meaning symbols mmm yeah good times so
we do have a couple other comments here
who's wanting an axe on eight I am
definitely on board I really hope we
have fun by nine right just any follow
up to the axon as a proper
straightforward flagship especially if
especially if they can keep up with some
of that audio be 97.1 acts on G minus
four five Jim Brimble using the PN
weekly hash tag I've been thinking for
the last ten minutes why doesn't Apple
just by Qualcomm and then you went and
said it that would be hilarious I had
one other comment here that I wanted to
get to okay get to it please come on you
can do it get back come back oh it was a
we got this really great little
conversation going on Twitter just about
IBM Watson and how IBM kind of fell
apart in that regard unfortunately it's
a couple people moving back and forth so
I I can't read all of those tweets but I
you know I think it's just more evidence
that this space has
and then decided yet on how you interact
with a smart assistant digital machine
learning AI whatever you want to call it
but we watch companies build up a whole
bunch of mindshare in that arena and
then never seem to capitalize on it
I look at Microsoft with hololens I look
at IBM with Watson some really high
concept stuff and then when consumers
finally get their hands on stuff they're
using competing products which are
probably not as good but you know no
one's actually making stuff for those
consumers so it's just a shame that they
tend to fall apart just as they get to
the finish line so I'm I know when
criminate myself one more time but back
to design for one second and back to HTC
I I think you're wrong like one of the
under-covered things that we couldn't or
no one paid attention to basically back
at MWC 2018 was her keynote and Sharon
the chairman chairwoman of the company
said that maybe 5ge because of the
manator ization of all the parts and you
know eventually we'll have all the parts
so that the phone doesn't have to be
this slab or something it could be any
any other shape like a and we've seen
experiments with runcible with a circle
I I just want something to be another
shape I just want a triangle I want like
a hexagonal moldable you know like
that's what I want to see that's what is
in the end that's my main message here
so just do something with the x and y
planes and go and like bring them Z into
it you know I don't disagree I just
think by the time we start getting to
well and and this is actually we talked
about this either last week or the week
before the the notion of Android P
actually giving manufacturers and
developers better tools and better
capabilities for Android to
intelligently recognize the the the
display the form factor and resolution
that it has on tap could help usher in
III think circles could be really
interesting
to play with two in the meantime though
with we changed the shape of the phone I
still don't think that completely
addresses I think it would be exciting
and I think it would be fun but I don't
think it still completely addresses the
sort of paradigm and the metaphor that
we use to interact with services I think
the only way we really move the needle
on improving the ergonomic and the
social etiquette surrounding data in our
constant face is to get away from
holding slab o glowing ranked angle up
to face and blocking out the rest of the
world around us and that's why I'm way
more excited by AR and heads-up display
initiatives getting that information
organically into the places where our
eyes are supposed to be looking and
seeing if we can keep those interactions
as efficient and as brief as possible so
I'll be really curious to see where that
comes from I think there's a huge
opportunity for a true disrupter in this
space now that smartphones have all kind
of agreed were rectangular slabs of
glass on glass and that's how the phone
works I think a company has a chance to
come in and say wow but we could do
something different and every time we've
gotten comfortable that's where we've
gotten the original iPhone or you know
Android has walked into the space or the
pcs been revolutionized or game consoles
have become livingroom computers every
time we've gotten complacent that's when
something really shakes up the market in
a way that we weren't expecting before
what we need is the adiga pill from the
YouTube chat which I've just been able
to pull up and read the tiny print out
of it perhaps a modern retake on the
Sony Clio with modern specs and Android
or sailfish running on it but you know
it's shaped like that well I mean there
were a couple different cliches weren't
they I mean I think he's talking about
the one that had the flip around screen
that had like a little a vertically
mounted QWERTY keyboard with the clay
not I don't think Sony made that I know
it was the PDA thing yeah that's what
I'm saying it wasn't that it was that
the clay was the PDA yeah that's right
but I'm not sure what
I think I think there I think there were
oh I don't know what a Clio I didn't
hear you say Clio I don't know what a
Clio is but I do believe there were two
different cliches one was sort of a Star
Trek communicator form factor and one
was like a teeny tiny micro laptop
factor but I think they both the the CLE
a was built all about having the flip
around screen
so before Lenovo did the twist you had
you know you opened it flip the screen
around closed it back down and it was
just a regular Palm Pilot then you could
open it flip it and you'd have a
keyboard that you could hide under the
under the display yeah
that's just we need more of that
honestly I mean not I would have liked
the Gemini if it but I only got like the
first freaking prototype or like the
pre-production you that I've had so I
could test not the keys properly and I
found it to be kind of sad in terms of
the type of experience so and it's just
unwieldy for me in general so nothing
that large please anyone well in and I
think there's another I I spent a couple
days trying to make an HTC touch Pro
Windows Mobile a slider keyboard phone
my daily driver but there was something
that I loved going back Windows Mobile
it's basically a pocketable form of
Windows XP I in in a form factor that
was just a teeny bit bigger than a Nokia
candy bar I would really like to go back
to that having a smaller but thicker
phone that could expand shape in some
way and offer up you know sort of a
streamlined experience when I need it a
more robust experience and then augment
that with a smart assistant AI or
heads-up display in my glasses something
else where I could move more pieces of
information around and I could use that
more modularly with all of the other
accessories that I already am going to
be investing in there was something
really charming about going back to that
firm factor and I wish it was something
we could still experiment with today I'm
I am getting a little tired of like well
we've got another six inch screen phone
and it's a tube line one aspect ratio
and it's glass with a glass back
and that's how you make a phone I I
think that's gonna feel like the death
of the smartphone as a platform if our
design stays that stale this so we let's
hopefully something will make us excited
in a smart phones again in terms of
industrial design but until then but I
guess they get to keep boring us in the
way that they want to well I mean that's
it that's before if the the
revolutionary and disruptive change
doesn't come from a Samsung or doesn't
come from an apple it's gonna come from
someone else so this year I think will
be interesting to see where they put
resources towards to hopefully
capitalize on doing something that
really does shake up the market and I
have every every belief that a Samsung
could do that it's just whether I have a
concern over Apple because of how safe
they need to keep iOS for their revenue
but I think any company could
conceivably do something that would that
would take consumers by storm it's just
how much risk are they willing to engage
with and one more question here from fat
produce hey Jules what phone would you
use for the old phone challenge oh boy
this is gonna be a tough one for me and
I haven't fought this one completely
through the the parameters would have to
be set really weird but maybe perhaps
Nexus one I'd love to see you know proto
Android stage kind of dilemma pre its I
mean when I'd be curious about Windows
Mobile or even Palm OS as well but you
know at least you know there's good the
background to those things would be less
familiar to me and would be and it would
be more limited to what I'm already used
to yeah and well like I know you know
the old phone challenges you know it's
supposed to you know restrict yourself
and and and enjoy the experience as is
as presented but I don't know it's still
you know you want you to go back there
it's kind of a foreign land
to be a way to foreign land they've had
that's not so I think what's sort of
charming about checking some of that
stuff out is hey know we've we've come a
long way so yeah it's a IIIi think you
know going back that far it is it's it's
like we had a completely different
metaphor and a completely different user
experience in mind than what we arrived
at today and the assumptions and the
predictions that we were making back
then really have nothing to do with the
current consumer commodity device that
we all have to carry around with
ourselves today hmm indeed I think I
enjoyed this show we had a red wine and
we have our spicier shows yeah one
trivial argument and then one kind of as
you know some substantive volley going
on there it was very nice well and and
we would definitely hope that folks join
