for the iphone 5c new details emerge on
the Amazon an HTC smartphone if you've
got a galaxy no to you might be in luck
for getting some Galaxy Note 3 features
I'm hi Mary vetta and I really cannot
understand what the purpose of an Amazon
store that can also make phone calls
would be but this is pocket now daily
let's search day off with some
interesting and kind of odd new since
you know I was happy with 1080p displays
it's great pixel density great display
quality and I didn't really see any
pixels at all but it seems that people
in China do not feel that way as China's
VEVO has just showed us their new 2560 x
1440 smartphone display and I haven't
even done the math on pixel density
please leave us a comment and tell us
what you think about this do you really
feel that you need more than a 1080p
display and this is not me saying that I
don't want technology to go forward it's
just that tiny p is already great but
leave us a comment now let's continue
with some Amazon plus HTC smartphone
rumors is apparently there are three
prototypes in the works that the
companies have to decide on but
according to some sources to Bloomberg
it seems that Amazon is not really
obligated to get these phones from HTC
apparently they're just shopping around
and obviously HCC is trying to show them
what they've got but still again this is
apparently not a 2014 project and it
seems that Amazon is actually planning
to do something unique with this phone
except to just give you a storefront on
a smartphone but let's see how that goes
now a company that is not doing it all
well with the iphone 5c is Apple
according to The Wall Street Journal
there are some credible sources in Asia
claiming that the company is pulling
down on their orders for the iphone 5c
print the holiday season which is
supposed to be the time when people
actually buy more phones apparently
Apple is already over stock with phones
and they don't need a lot of them for
the holiday season so how many of you
actually have the iphone 5c what do you
think about it obviously we've discussed
the reasons why we believe that this
phone is not necessarily flop but hasn't
really reached the goals that Apple was
expecting but it seems that the drama
just continue now let's talk about some
good and bad news when it comes to
Samsung on the negative side some
customers are complaining that their
batteries of the galaxy s4 are getting
swollen
and yeah this is a big dealer battery
can explode so make sure you call your
warranty services because you can get
your battery swap for free samsung
apparently is doing that very eagerly
but on the positive side those of you
that are carrying a galaxy note 2 you'll
be happy to know that there are already
some kook roms that bring all the
services or at least almost all the
services from the Galaxy Note 3 on to
the Galaxy Note 2 so instead of waiting
for your Android for pointing update to
that phone why don't you just get a
custom rom and finally for the
interesting news of the day LG's new
marketing tactics for their g2 seem to
be making some news as it turns out the
company is actually detecting what phone
you're using when you're hovering
through their ads and so they'll come up
to you and be like are you having
problems ring display with that iPhone
because obviously the g2 has a much
bigger display so you know it's kind of
interesting to see what they're doing
obviously these companies are entitled
to do whatever they want to market their
products but that makes you say the
question of the day do you like LG's new
marketing tactics do you think they're
smarter do you think that they're
intrusive in my particular case you know
that g2 is a great phone I admitted it
is a great phone up to the point where
I'm willing to forgive their marketing
tactics because it's great for them to
figure out a way to create more
consciousness on the product that they
have but I know that a lot of people
will be annoyed by this so leave us a
comment down below what do you think

smartphone and tell world make sure you
