frankly earned much tension this year
the attention it has gotten aside from
the less than positive buzz surrounding
the lg optimus View has been entirely
focused on its flagship smartphone
offering the Optimus G kind of like this
one right here I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is our full review
of the lg optimus G for AT&amp;amp;T let's get
to it right out the gate let's note a
couple variations between this unit and
the global version of the Optimus G
aside from the usual Radio changes to
accommodate a TTS American GSM HSPA and
LTE bands there's been a significant
reduction in the cameras resolution from
13 megapixels in the global and sprint
versions to 8 megapixels on our AT&amp;amp;T
unit here more on that later there's
also the usual carrier level
customization to the software and the
AT&amp;amp;T branding on the back which is stay
with me here the most beautiful carrier
branding I have ever seen I know that
sounds a little like saying the most
beautiful dead rodent stuck to my new
cars bumper I've ever seen but it's true
it's not silk screened or painted on but
rather an embossed metal logo and it
exists entirely beneath the Gorilla
Glass 2 backplate the lens for that 8
megapixel camera and it's LED flash also
reside beneath the back panel up here in
the corner and the counterpoint is the
speaker down here on the lower right
which by the way puts out sound that is
wimpy wimpy wimpy of course you can't
expect much from any speakerphone
shoehorned into an eight point four five
millimeter device which we can see on
the side here volume keys are here on
the left as well as the tray for the
microSD and sim card slots the power
standbys and the thumb position on the
right if you're right-handed and there's
a bonus there's an LED notification
light ringing the button and it
illuminates on alerts it only lights up
for a little while it only lights up red
and you can't see it from all angles so
it's not perfect but all the same
we are very glad it's here up top and at
the bottom the side construction changes
from glossy pewter finish to stippled
plastic end caps furnished with all the
usual accoutrement EDD phone jack
microphones and down here some screws
that don't hurt the look at all finally
up front here this display is a 4.7 inch
768 by 1280 true HD IPS plus display
with a pixel density of 320 PPI it uses
LG's new zero gap touch technology which
in the words of LG has its sensor film
printed directly on the cover glass
beneath that display are three
capacitive keys in this instance home
back and menu arranged in the inverse of
Samsung's latest favored implementation
underneath all that is quite a
significant powerplant the lg optimus G
features the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro
which offers quad core processing power
in addition to LTE compatibility first
480 that's running at 1.5 gigahertz and
backed up by 2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs
of storage expandable to an additional
64 gigs of storage via microsd that's
all powered by an embedded 2100 milliamp
hour battery before we move into
software though we need to talk about
how this device feels in the hand in
short like an expensive piece of jewelry
now the Optimus G isn't the first phone
to be made from all glass and it's
certainly not the first one to have this
kind of handling challenge it's just
something to be aware of and if you
value aesthetics the trade-off is well
worth it LG is recalling its roots in
beautiful hardware design with this
smart phone it's a little wide for my
taste but it's 145 grams feel incredible
absolutely premium in the hand of course
it's a fingerprint magnet but that's an
alright sacrifice to make when your
phone feels like a finely crafted Swiss
watch or something seriously it feels
like a luxury item it definitely
surpassed my expectations that's all
well and good but what about the softer
side of the equation of course I'm
talking about the software load that LG
is
to the Optimus G what are we looking at
here like many manufacturers LG hasn't
had the best record when it comes to
updating its smartphone OS so users will
want to be sure they're happy with what
LG is shipping out of the box
specifically that is Android 4.0.4 with
the LG UI or if you prefer the Optimus
UI running on top now this isn't one of
the more subtle Android skins on the
market we're talking something much more
in line with what Samsung offers a
complete re skinning and rethinking of
Android it takes a lot of cues from
Samsung's nature UX offering actually
with the out of the box settings giving
you a lock screen with ripple effects
and floating leaves on water and drippy
water sounds that sound like they've
been ripped right from a Galaxy s3
our favorite mode here dewdrop expands a
bubble across the lock screen when
swiped exposing more and more of the
underlying home screen until the phone
just unlocks once you get into the UI
itself the visual enhancements just keep
on coming there are seven different home
screen animations to choose from when
swiping between panes and the software
supports landscape homescreen right out
of the box it's not all cosmetic
enhancements LG has built some enhanced
functionality here too like the shortcut
toggles in the notification drawer some
of it is lifted straight from Samsung
like the Y's screen smart stay analog
the picture-in-picture video player was
pioneered by Samsung's Galaxy s3 but
here LG uses a different implementation
now whether it's better or worse than
confining the video to a floating window
is up to you but LG's version has a
critical distinction it works with
YouTube that's a win in anybody's book
overall the software that LG is shipping
with the Optimus G does almost as much
as the hardware to surprise us in a good
way it's stable it's fast and it's
useful and that's a triumvirate that's
surprisingly difficult to achieve so now
that we know what the Optimus G is
bringing to the table let's see how all
those specs
perform on the test bench and out in the
fresh air from a fluidity and
responsiveness standpoint the Optimus G
is a speed demon the you I almost never
bogs down or trips and most of the time
it's hard to believe this thing isn't
running jelly bean with its project
butter enhancement even after a solid
day of use with a lot of apps running
that fluidity remains intact in a word
it's awesome that speed translates to
the network connection as well we tested
the optimus G on AT&amp;amp;T LTE network here
in Boston and data speeds were
consistently excellent averaging between
15 and 20 megabits per second down and
about half that speed up though as you
can see it peaks in off-peak hours
thankfully that 2,100 milliamp hour
battery inside handles the load with a
plum even with moderate to heavy use the
device usually lasted me the whole day
with more than 20% to spare the 8
megapixel camera does well especially
considering its downgrade from the 13
megapixel version on the Sprint version
and the global version there's still
some noise in darker shots but HDR mode
is there to compensate for that
my favorite mode is the moment before
capture mode which starts shooting
several seconds before you hit the
shutter button allowing you to capture
moments that you might have missed
otherwise and that's called time catch
shot finally from an audio perspective
voice calls still being in fashion on
these devices we call smartphones the
Optimus G shoots par voice calls sound
fine from both ends and cellular
reception keeps up with what we've come
to expect from modern communication
devices the speakerphone is definitely
on the weak side though delivering audio
that's tinnier and quieter than we've
come to expect and whatever you do don't
leave the phone on its back if you've
set an alarm or you're expecting a call
the speakers so muffled in this position
that you'll never hear a Tring to be
frank we weren't expecting to like the
lg optimus G as much as we do sure it's
packing an impressive first in its LTE
meets quad-core powerhouse
but LG has been a company all about
doing something first for a while that's
nothing new thing is usually they
haven't been doing first - well we're
happy to see that the optimus g doesn't
fall into that rut it's a well-made spec
packed feature heavy smartphone that
looks beautiful feels great in the hand
and puts its First's to good use it
feels a little on the fragile side and
it's mediocre audio performance leaves
something to be desired but we'd be
proud to carry one and we give it an 8
out of 10 folks that's gonna do it for
