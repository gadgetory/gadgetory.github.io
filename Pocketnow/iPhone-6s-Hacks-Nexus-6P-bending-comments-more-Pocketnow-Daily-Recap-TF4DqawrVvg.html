an iphone I don't give it to Hina for
that great beginning joke by the way
purple was also for royalty Kings
Loretta I like that title stop hating on
Monday that's just racist you know I
hadn't really thought about it that way
that's right it's that time of the week
and I am high memory that this is pocket
now and this is the parking I'll daily
recap for last week I'm Monday the topic
was the new Apple TV and the fact that
mobile games are actually what sells
most on it and I asked you if you would
ever compare a ps4 or an xbox one to the
apple TV we had 678 comments there's a
difference between console gaming and
playing mobile games on TV and I love
the point that you make particularly
because yes these are mobile games not
console games at all what would you use
an Apple TV for gaming it's only
compatible for mobile games and yes that
is the biggest limitation Apple's trying
to sell it as such and mobile games have
actually gotten really good but that's
not necessarily a selling point for the
Apple TV either consoles are way more
better to play games and while Apple TV
has still potential to go after it in
the future may currently for me consoles
win and I get what you mean yes console
wins for me too there is a major price
of friends end I just think about the
fact that for my younger kids I would
rather buy an Apple TV than a major
Horner dollar console so I do believe
that there is a market an apple is
accurate let's just see if it work
because he currently can never gain from
your phone anyways until they ask you if
product placement is important to you
whenever you see this particular phone
on a movie because a James Bond is a
back then was apparently having issues
with either experienced or galaxies and
that news was rather vague by the way
but hey we had eleven hundred and
twenty-seven comments thanks a lot guys
we start with the only reason I went to
see the dark knight 2008 was because of
the nokia 5800 xpressmusic phone that
was featured in it and then i went and
bought one are you serious product
placement doesn't affect my purchase
decisions but for someone who has never
seen a certain product before it could
enlighten them of the fact that it
exists and that is the whole reason why
marketing uses product placement good
point up that being said I do believe
there is a market of people that see a
phone on TV and buy but obviously you
and me the ones that watch these videos
the ones that are really into technology
don't I take a James Bond has stopped
doing any water scenes and will run out
of battery doing this mission oh well
your loss James and yeah for James ever
consider galaxy phones to be superior to
experience is rather weird once they ask
you how sensitive is the information you
carry on your phones as a iOS hackers
had just spend a million bucks for being
able to hack into iOS 9.1 in a very
interesting way we had 600 comments we
start with don't hack me brother I have
sexy supermodel girlfriend Nunez on
there and the call the hackers the only
sensitive data I have on my phone is
porn backers want to see my porn
collection go ahead I don't care and I
don't care either because that's also a
public topic your question should be why
our government entities paying for
companies to have people's phones kak
and I'm surprised you asked that
question and I think I shouldn't answer
it either then on Thursday the topic was
videos showing how easy it is to bend
the Nexus 6p I asked you if this would
be enough for you to return the phone or
not buy it we had 818 comments we start
with any phone will break if you try to
intentionally break it true but it
requires very little intention to smash
or break or bend that Nexus 6p which is
sad well the hell actually bends their
phones and you know that is a very
interesting question I don't and yet I
was able to bend the iphone 6 out of the
blue I just put it in my pocket and for
some reason it bent I'm talking about
the small iphone 6 not the larger one by
the way honestly it really annoys me
that so many people are dismissing it
and or just not wanting to believe it
when the iphone 6 pentest blew up when
enormous amount and it seemed that
everyone even outside the tech community
knew about it and you have to remember I
phones are a lot more popular than nexus
devices so this is just at the defense
of people but then again yeah it's not
convenient for either Google or why way
for this phone to be so easily bendable
either I do understand the certain
companies do certain things to avoid
this going to mass media and Apple is
one of those companies just doesn't care
finally Friday the topic was the $99
Chronos the small little disc that you
attach to any dumb watch and turn it
into a SmartWatch
I asked you if you would rather use this
or buy a SmartWatch we had 163 comments
my g shock and Chronos why not at least
I can know what time it is when the
battery of the Chronos runs out true
that is the major problem with major
smart watches out there after the second
day I mean if you're traveling on a
transatlantic flight you're screwed you
lose the watch after a certain amount of
time and the chargers for these watches
are just so clunky or big or ugly that
you'd rather not carry them either I
only saw the new Moto 360 in persons day
and damn it's a beautiful and elegant
wouldn't mind getting a SmartWatch to
replace my casio you have to remember
the price difference between that moto
360 in the costumes going to be huge but
true the Moto 360 scourges rather by
Chronos chart of ugly flat tires vessels
wit clocks and annoying notifications
that I check on my phone without the
SmartWatch not to mention useless
battery the hate is real and your hate
is the hate of pretty much everyone that
doesn't buy a SmartWatch I mean how many
smartphones are in the marketing people
have barely started buying a few smart
watches out there it's clear that there
is a major caveat and for me it has to
do with battery life but I love your
points I don't mind the flat tires in
the bezels I actually foreign
smartwatches to be rather useful but
again it all depends on your taste
that's it for the bargain house daily
