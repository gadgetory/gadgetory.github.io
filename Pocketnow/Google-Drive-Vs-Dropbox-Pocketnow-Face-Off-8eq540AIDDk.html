now when you know it's weird to see
Google be late to compete against the
world and just about every service
that's ever been launched and has
nothing to do with search so far Google
Drive took five years ever since rumors
began to roll out of the garage and
you'd wonder what took them so long so
let's compare it against Dropbox which
is pretty much the only service that
compares and ease-of-use and popularity
and let's see if it was worth it to wait
for Google Drive Google Drive is like
the next version of Google Docs so call
it a revamp of what you already knew but
the enhancements don't end there see
this service is what I'd like to call a
better way to Dropbox when compared
side-by-side drive offers three more
gigabytes of storage for free it allows
you to expand that storage at a cheaper
price for just thirty dollars a year for
twenty five gigabytes has a maximum file
upload size of up to ten gigabytes where
Dropbox has a three hundred megabyte
file limit for mobile devices and is
integrated with gmail picasa google docs
to allow collaboration there are also
developer api is available to allow any
application to be fit with access to
google drive whereas dropbox pretty much
pioneer that service the only place
where Dropbox excels when compared to
Google Drive is that its support with
the decaying blackberry operating system
where drive only supports Android and
iOS is coming soon probably the biggest
reason why Drive can only be compared
with Dropbox as opposed to other
competing services like box.net Raven
iCloud is that it's easy to use desktop
client after you download it from dr
google com the installation process is
very similar to what you already do in
dropbox and it's almost identical
between the mac and the pc will use a
Mac for the purpose of this video simply
download the client install on your
computer log on with your credentials
and drive will create an easy to access
folder in your finder or file explorer
one thing I commonly do is create a
shortcut in my desktop for easy sinking
but that depends on you where dr stands
out is that if you already had google
docs in the past you'll notice that all
the documents you created will appear in
your finder or file explorer like in
dropbox you
also get an indicator that states of the
document is either sinking or already
st. if we compare the sink speeds
between Dropbox and drive I'd say both
services are extremely hard to tell
apart since both of them are really good
the only downside to the service from
google docs is that these are just wept
shortcuts available on your finder and
won't work offline with any desktop
client like Word or Excel you'll have to
be online and view them on your browser
to be able to edit them on android drive
is being distributed as an update to the
Google Docs application it has the
advantage of being more than just the
browser clients so the files that are
shared with you are always available
even if you don't decide to drag them to
your Google Drive the service also
allows for you to upload photos directly
from the gallery but it's kind of
pointless if this recent update also
provides one gigabyte of free storage in
Picasa and Google Plus also upload your
photos automatically even though people
rarely use Google+ gmail also got above
to 10 gigabytes of free storage so
collaboration just couldn't be better
another reason why Drive excels is with
its OCR and image search capabilities
though this implementation on the
desktop client is yet to be seen overall
Google Drive is proven to be a very good
cloud storage contender offering more
Drive spaces not enough if there's not
enough ease-of-use involved and drive is
as easy as it gets if your current
Dropbox use your the owns an android
phone and probably an iPad it's best for
you to stick to it for now but I'd
recommend that you switch to Google
Drive once they roll out the support for
other platforms that's it for today's
comparison thank you very much for
watching I'm hime every letter from
Parker now calm and don't forget to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
it's kind of weird to see you already
said it's kind of weird to see come on
so let's compete it against a little bit
of Val da all right ironically Google
Drive earth all right I don't forget to
give us a thumbs up if you like what you
smug but this is like the king's speech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
