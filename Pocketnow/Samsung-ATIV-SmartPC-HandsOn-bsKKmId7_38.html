Aoife in Berlin checking out the Samsung
ativ octave however you want to
pronounce it
it's Vita spelled backwards this is
Samsung's new Windows 8 tablet it is as
you can see running on an Intel Atom
processor at 1.8 gigahertz backed up by
2 gigs of RAM
this is as you can see the full version
of Windows 8 we can out back into the
alternative desktop view here and you
can see that responsiveness on the
software side is really really really
amazing as far as the hardware goes this
is obviously a very wide device no
blushes about this horizontally
landscape focused aspect ratio front
facing camera up top we hop on over to
the side here it is nine point nine
millimeters thick
ten finger multi-touch support on the
display here on the back this kind of
faux brushed metal finish reminiscent of
the galaxy note 2 and the galaxy s3
primary camera right on up here Samsung
branding there's an LED flash up top
volume controls powers standby USB port
headphone jack sim and micro SD slots
almost everything you need right up top
up and back to that 11.6 inch panel here
on the front it is HD at 1366 by 768
Samsung is claiming exceptional battery
life nine point four hours of video play
if we hop on into the browser here we're
having a little bit of data connectivity
issues here at the venue that's not the
devices fault so I'll just tell you that
it feels it's very very light in the
hand build quality is sort of in line
with the galaxy s3 galaxy note 2 it's a
little bit creaky you can definitely
feel that it's hollow back here
certainly not the most premium feeling
device on the planet but the stereo
speakers left and right are nice the
light feel in the hand is quite nice and
overall we're having a pretty good time
taking a first look at the a2 and just
so you get an idea from a hardware
perspective of the size of this device
and its aspect ratio relative to
something pretty popular pretty common
we'll bring in the latest generation
iPad for you obviously quite a
significant difference as far as aspect
ratio goes and size in general and you
can't feel this on the camera from a
weight perspective they're actually kind
of in the same neighborhood I don't have
the exact specs on me but they feel the
same to my hands individually at the
moment but whereas the iPad has the cool
metal casing Samsung once again
very clearly a hollow less finished feel
more in line with their latest products
that emphasize low weight over
manufacturing toughness
and as a nice final bonus we can using
the samsung reddit redesign samsung port
on the bottom here we can plug at the
ativ into a keyboard dock calling it
making it a smart pc as samsung calls a
full-size keyboard here variable angle
hinge you're not just committed to one
angle on your tablet configuration and
then you've turned this into a
completely different device so when it's
plugged in here it has a very very
complete laptop feel down to the heft it
is a little bit top-heavy because all
the serious hardware is in the tablet
obviously but we've got both left and
right is the same full-size USB port
here with a protective door over it and
you can obviously a trackpad there you
can close the device as I mentioned
before it's just the back of the tablet
the bottom of the keyboard here has a
really solid feel to it feels just like
a regular old notebook computer and the
S Pen holster for the S Pen doesn't go
all the way here because that's a demo
unit but
and pop it back open the device
obviously featuring full support for the
stylists much more useful in rearranging
icons now much more useful in the full
desktop version of Windows but other
enhancements no doubt coming for the S
Pen in Windows 8 even on the non desktop
like side that's just a quick look at
the samsung octave ativ smart pc uncie
asian issues aside this has been michael
fisher with pocketnow.com with samsung
here at Aoife in berlin
tony behind the camera stay tuned for
more videos as we make more of them and
publish more of them as the day goes on
