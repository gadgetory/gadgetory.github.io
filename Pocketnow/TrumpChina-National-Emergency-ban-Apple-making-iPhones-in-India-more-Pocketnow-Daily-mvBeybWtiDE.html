bands for Chinese companies in the next
couple of weeks
Apple is reportedly moving their iPhone
operation to India and the issues from
China could be to blame and the Google
pixel three light and three Excel
lighter apparently heading for the US
market at some point I'm Jaime Rivera
and yes I actually did watch bumblebee I
actually do recommend that it's a decent
reboot that I wouldn't watch again it
was good this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with the honor
view 10 which just became available in
China and sure I know that it's not
gonna make anybody go crazy because of
the fact that it's there four hundred
and thirty five dollars and it's
actually confirmed that it's got that
forty eight megapixel sensor from Sony
in addition to great specification six
gigs of ram 120 gigs of storage I can't
wait for that thing to leave China and
come to other countries now let's talk
about the Xiaomi poco phone f1 as well
the company continues launching variants
this phone is taking the world by storm
and it's mainly because of the specs and
the price tag right now we've got the
armored Edition which is the Kevlar
backed variant and I love Kevlar we're
talking about a boost of storage to 128
gigs and the price tag remains low 325
you can learn more about it in the
description now let's talk about Google
we've been covering the leaks of the
Google pixel 3 accel light and the 3
light we were expecting these to launch
only in emerging countries but some
trusted sources claim that no it is
coming to the United States
it could happen as early as spring and
apparently it's going to be or they are
going to be Verizon exclusives whether
this happens or now we'll keep you
posted but apparently they will bring
the same quality of photography as the
standard pixels so that's gonna be crazy
that was move the spotlight over to
Apple the other opposite the company
that charges so much money and well we
know of all the drama that's happening
between China and the United States and
so we've got Foxconn which is the
company's main manufacturer considering
moving its full operation to India and
we're talking about not just making the
current iPhone 6s and iPhone
I think the iPhone se is not being made
anymore but that was one of the
countries where was made at and
apparently now they're planning
bringing the whole operation or at least
some of the flagships to be manufactured
in India this could begin as early as
next year and we wonder exactly how this
will affect or help out Apple and this
whole problem is happening with the
trade wars and finally the most
interesting news today have to do with
obviously the trump presidency and
everything that they've been doing for
trade in the United States and China up
to the point where in recent claims it
seems that the government is considering
starting a national emergency band that
will happen as early as a pretty much
January 2019 and they will pretty much
ban companies from buying supplies from
companies like Huawei and ZTE and this
is a major deal we're not just talking
about infrastructure it could affect
devices it could affect so many things
and obviously it also affects the fact
that you know companies like Apple and
other US companies could be affected by
this whole connection and I don't know
I'm not good at politics I actually
avoid covering political news in the
daily if you've noticed but let us know
in the comments I mean what do you think
about everything that's going on do you
think that it's founded do you think
that it's a good idea a bad idea because
in my case I don't know what to tell you
guys I mean how many US companies are
left right now and and that's really the
case I mean it's not like if it's
getting going to help Commerce in any
way if you consider the fact that there
aren't really any US companies left I
mean Motorola's owned by a Chinese
company in Apple which is pretty much
the only US company left or at least one
of them all of its supplies are handled
in China so let us know what you think
