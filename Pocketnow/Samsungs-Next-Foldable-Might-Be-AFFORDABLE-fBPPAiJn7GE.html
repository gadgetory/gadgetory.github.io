foldable from Samsung and it might be
affordable as well Apple seems to be
working on a way to snap cameras onto
your Apple watch for reasons we don't
understand and real me is trying to
bring us the first 64 mega pixel camera
and that apparently is also affordable
I'm Jaime Metta ravenna and day two of
Tokyo is gonna be fantastic
keep it locked to our Instagram to see
exactly what we're doing today this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals because again I mean I
love the fact that Amazon has become an
Apple retailer right now I've had pros
$150 off if you're looking for a macbook
pro that was $200 off you get up to $30
off air pods of 20 depending on which
variant you're getting you can learn
more in the description definitely deals
that I would consider and since we're
talking about Apple products and deals
let's begin with the news that I have
been waiting for for a bit
iOS 13 public beta is out iPad OS 13
public beta as well Mac OS Catalina
these are all available for the public
beta obviously you have to understand
these are flagged with bugs like right
now I'm trying it out my iPad pro it
already froze with two apps side by side
but we could work on a full video over
what you're getting here and what to
beware of the cool thing is it's public
you can turn back to your old iOS 12 if
you want but in the case of the iPad pro
it makes it so much more worth it for
you to consider staying with this so
yeah I'll keep you posted I'll let you
know on social media as what my
experience has been so far and now let's
talk about the Samsung Galaxy S 10 5g
have you saw our video of our full
experience in Verizon in Chicago it was
fabulous then it launched on Sprint now
it's official for t-mobile pretty much
the same price $12.99 there are some
installment plans and obviously it'll
work in whatever markets are supporting
5g which I'm trying to scratch my head
over which are the ones for t-mobile but
at least you've got a future-proof phone
here you'll learn more about everything
in the description as to what the
installment plans are I recommend that
phone regardless of the installment
plans of instead of getting an iPhone
Tenace max I would get the s tat 5g and
let's start talking about some weird
things particularly in the case of the
Apple watch as a we see some new pens
over the fact that apparently Apple is
considering installing cameras on your
Apple watch and buy cameras I actually
meant that plural penally there are two
cameras these would work in the
wristband which I assume is going to
cost an arm and a leg because currently
the links bracelet for Apple is $4.99
think about it is apparently you get
360-degree video as according to the
patent and also there's a way for you to
extend the Brist band in order to be
able to use the watch and not look like
a moron trying to look at your you know
your camera it's kind of weird I don't
think that there's a market for that I
mean I currently use a SmartWatch with a
camera and in the case of that Nubia
Alpha and no comment you guys have been
asking for that review there's a reason
why I haven't done it but I'll keep you
posted as to why and how about if we
move the spotlight over to real me as
well the company is famous for its
affordable smartphones in India but now
the company has teased that they're
working on a quad camera smartphone that
should be announced very soon and the
biggest highlight is the fact that it's
got a 64 megapixel camera and we've been
scratching our heads for a couple of
hours as to 64 megapixel camera what
company has launched that sensor and
that turns out to be a Samsung ISOs lgw
one that was announced actually not too
long ago think about it as obviously
this is an affordable phone we have no
idea what's up with the quad camera so
the whole concept is Wow 64 megapixels
you'll most likely get a lot of pixel
binning trying to do the math as to what
I think that would be a 16 megapixel
shot if you do binning but whatever the
case may be stay tuned as it's coming
soon and we can't wait distantly how
much it will cost and finally the
hottest news today I have to do with a
very interesting report that just
emerged that apparently Samsung is
working on a foldable smartphone and
this is a foldable film like the razor
we've been waiting for Motorola to do
something we've participated at an event
and I I was completely underwhelmed with
the Moto z4 you saw my video all of us
thought that we were there to see the
news rate razor but the thing about it
is apparently Samsung is working on this
they're famous for their clamshell
smartphones already but this is going to
have a six point seven inch diagonal
display inside that'll fold and on the
ads outside you have a one inch display
and the thing about it is this is the
reason why the report claims that this
is actually going to be an affordable
phone which is odd because Samsung
clamshells have never been affordable if
you didn't know this in Korea they're
actually quite expensive so yeah it
seems that Samsung is working on this
design but there's no in the comments
down below what do you think do you
think that you would be interested in a
clamshell phone like that because in my
case we've been waiting for this from
Motorola for awhile man I really want
one I think it would be a great hit but
this is my opinion we would love to know
what you think in the comments down
below
