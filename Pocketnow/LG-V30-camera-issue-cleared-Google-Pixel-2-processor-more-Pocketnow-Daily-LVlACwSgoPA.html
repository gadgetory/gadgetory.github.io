just got put to rest by the company that
was expecting a new processor on the
future Google pixels might be in for a
disappointment we finally get the
rendered images of the Huawei may 10 and
it looks hot I'm high memory that I and
I apologize for being a little late our
Galaxy Note 8 coverage kind of Warren
said this is out daily the
official news today start with deals
those of you in the market for a very
well priced SmartWatch the ZTE quartz
continues to be one of the ones that I
recommend most because you're getting
the bare essentials at a very good price
tag right now t-mobile is offering with
pretty much for just two dollars a month
like 48 bucks after two years obviously
there are some hoops that you have to
follow you can learn more in the
description
and speaking of t-mobile today we got to
hear what the uncarrier next update was
all about the company's CEO John Leger
just came on record those of you in
family plans for t-mobile one you get
the opportunity to get netflix for free
and yeah it might not sound like
something great for many but still I
mean you get something extra for the
plan that you're already paying for it's
already at a much more competitive price
that certain other things that are being
offered by other companies so yeah you
can learn more in the description as
well and for those of you wondering
exactly what the Huawei may 10 will look
like we've been waiting for these leaks
for a while today we finally get renders
on video that show us what to expect I'm
a little concerned over a couple of
things number one the back looks great
that camera design looks great as well
but my biggest concern is that the
fingerprint scanner is moving to the
front so we were waiting for this no
bezel type display here and it seems
that that's not what we're getting
hopefully that's not the case for let's
see what Huawei figures out and there's
been a ton of speculation over the
processors on the future generation
Google pixels we heard snapdragon 836
which made sense given the ade 21 that
came on the current generation Google
pixel but as it turns out we've got some
trusted sources claiming that no
snapdragon 835 is what we're getting and
you know what I don't think there's
anything wrong with that obviously we
wanted that boost the number we wanted
that pixel to be a vanguard phone just
like it was last year but know we'll see
what we get in the
and finally the very hot news they come
from the LGV 30 and the company's
executives remember that whole debate
over if the primary camera has F 1.6
aperture F 1.7 the company has just come
on record just say pretty much what we
said yesterday well you have been seeing
in the market right now or prototypes
some of these were not using final
software and yeah because they were not
using final software LG was some masking
the camera aperture just to keep the
leaks in check so as it turns out they
are confirming this device Springs F one
point six is going to be the first one
but you know it leads me to the question
today that f one point six aperture does
it make you want to buy the LG v 30 any
more than you currently already want to
buy a particular phone because in my
case I've been testing it and it's been
performing great but I just can't say
that it's like wow amazing when compared
to any other thing that LG has already
previously done when it comes to the
primary camera again the wide-angle
camera is dramatically better but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get the news
earlier before the videos film to follow
