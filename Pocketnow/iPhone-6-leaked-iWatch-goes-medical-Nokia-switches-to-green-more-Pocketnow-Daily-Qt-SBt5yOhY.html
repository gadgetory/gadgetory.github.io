possible iPhone 6 LG announces the g pro
2 as its new phablet and no Kip paints
itself in grain for reasons that we can
understand I'm hi Mary that and the only
reason why I don't wear green is because
because of the green screen I'd become
transparent but this is out
daily let's go to lay off put some
official news as LG has just announced
their g pro 2 and as expected in
according to the leaks this device is
pretty much a bigger g2 this is their
new phablet just in case you thought the
g2 was not a phablet and that sports a
5.9 inch display with great
specification Zand a lot of really good
things we're expecting to have some
hands-on time with it at mwc though it's
not planned to be launched the united
states yet right now it's exclusive to
korea and apparently we won't be getting
it in the u.s. until like April May so
we'll see about that and for those of
you wondering whatever happened to
Dennis Woodside which was voter Allah
CEO you know the way it goes with
mergers and acquisitions usually the CEO
is the first one to lose his job and
which side is now going to be working in
dropbox so it's great that he now has a
gig but even more interesting motorola
news lenovo CEO set and quote that he
couldn't make the company profitable in
less than a couple of months which is
really interesting because we've seen
motorola lose money for years now so
let's see if the results are just as
good as he claims now note has been
making some odd changes first of all
because the company's branding is
usually blue with white or white with
blue and we also know that Windows Phone
8.1 is being dubbed Windows Phone blue
but the company has just changed the
coloring of their whole facebook page to
green so you're wondering why are they
using green a lot of us are assuming
that it's because of the nokia X the
Normandy project taking on Android so it
could be that they're just being nice to
Android on the whole green color behind
the robot but who knows probably that's
the case probably not will be at mwc
covering nokia extensively and we'll
keep you posted now let's move the
spotlight over to Apple as the company
has just hired another medical
technology specialist named Marcelo
lamego which would specialize on
building products that will allow people
to know different attributes of their
blood without
the need of a blood test so obviously
this would be a really cool feature for
any gadget to have especially when it's
sort of a fitness gadget and as it turns
out it seems that Apple is trying to do
more than just build another fit that or
another SmartWatch as if you think about
it anything that would save you the need
to have a blood test would be awesome so
let's see how that goes and finally for
the very hot news of the day we get the
first leaked photographs of the iphone 6
supposedly the reason why i say
supposedly is because this is a bigger
iphone it looks almost identical to the
current generation ipod touch although
it does have more speaker grills and
it's obviously bigger and it doesn't
have that hump for the camera and it
doesn't have any bezels and it has touch
ID so yes this could be the iphone 6 but
the reason why we're all skeptical is
because first of all no i phone has been
able to be made completely out of
aluminum mainly because of the fact that
cellular reception does not work on that
so we're wondering how exactly could
this be real if there are no plastic or
glass areas on this phone except for
probably the Apple but I don't think
it'll fit within that small area but
that leads me to the question of the day
do you like this design for the next
generation iphone would it be compelling
to you because in my particular case hey
if that will can pull this off i'm
definitely buying the next iphone it
looks really handsome but leave us a
