pocketnow.com and this is the video
unboxing of the samsung SGH I 620 also
known as the Black Jack slider and
you'll see why it's the blackjack slider
in a few minutes big thanks to negri
electronics for sending along the unit
so so let's get started all right here
it is here it is okay looks like there's
a flap here very elegant so we have some
some getting started material standard
wow it's a very thin battery let's see
how big this is looks to be doesn't say
the capacity on here oh I hope it's a
bigger battery than that comes with a
black jack so here we have looks like a
headset European wall charger I'm not in
Europe so hopefully there's a an adapter
an extra battery okay a USB cable that
uses the same proprietary plug that the
Black Jack does looks like a panel for
the back of the of the device and a
battery charger for that second battery
and here's the device here
Wow very very small the reason it's
called the Black Jack slider is that it
does this and if you look at the
original Black Jack it's the same
keyboard very interesting very
interesting wonder if these if these
keys are heat-sensitive if they're touch
sensitive I'll be determining that soon
with the extended battery the I 620 in
the black checker about the same
thickness which is very good news as
well so it's basically like a three
quarter the size black jack spring
assisted it's got a rotary wheel here in
the center instead of a scroll wheel Wow
well lots more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
