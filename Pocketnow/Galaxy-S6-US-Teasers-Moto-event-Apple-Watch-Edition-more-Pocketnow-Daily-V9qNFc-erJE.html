galaxy s6 Motorola has begun to see
something very hot as well to come very
soon and we get word on some Apple watch
pricing that's extremely ridiculous I'm
hi nothing that I've back in the day
that I always complain about so let me
just spare you the details this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
what's officials starting with Microsoft
and it's Microsoft band it's not really
one of our favorite wearables not
necessarily because of its services its
services are fine but the fit and finish
of that thing is extremely archaic and
still the company is pushing new updates
for the service first of all that would
support cycling so it's got this new UI
for whenever it detects that you're
cycling they'll give you larger
notifications and everything just to
make things better whenever you're on
your bike not have to lose your eyes
from the road but in addition to that
there is also an SDK now being pushed
and some other tweaks and services that
are being supported links in description
for full details on what you're getting
if you did buy one and speaking of
wearables let's talk about the pebble
the company has been teasing that we
should expect something very soon and
there is this leak in its servers that
shows us the pebble colour and wait
right there it's not necessarily what
you see with Android wear actually it is
color but it seems to be more like a
matte color just the full black or white
or yellow or red colors Spartan like
more like what you see with Windows
Phone that's apparently coming to this
new user interface we are not sure if
that's going to be announced well then
whatever updates pebble is bringing very
soon but yeah it is colored just not
what we thought it would be hopefully it
will perform just as well as the current
black and white pebble does but trust me
nothing is worse right now than for us
to speculate on the Apple watch pricing
we get to hear some other credible
sources talking about what this thing
will cost and yeah we've heard that the
apple watch edition will cost you
somewhere around four thousand dollars
but that really depends on what you buy
apparently depending on the bands that
you request it could cost you anything
from 10,000
to even twenty thousand dollars for a
wearable that again will eventually be
obsolete at some point but then again it
does make sense free to spend a lot of
money on a band than not necessarily on
the apple watch edition itself and then
eventually just to upgrade your watch to
a newer one but I know exactly how I was
gonna handle that it's just twenty
thousand dollars i mean come on that's
for rolex not for a gadget like this one
but let's begin talking about
smartphones or at least we hope that we
are going to start talking about
smartphones because the motorola ass
just sends out a new teaser over
something very hot to be announced on
februari 25th and obviously motorola
makes two very hot products right now
the Moto X and the Moto 360 so it could
either be that we get an update for
either I don't think it's going to be
the Moto X and the moto 360 was rumored
to be updated in some way at mwc this is
before mwc those so let's see what we
get it could be something hot and
probably for the very hot news of the
day US carriers have already begun to
tease the galaxy s6 they've already
begun to say that it says six appeal as
to say sex appeal for this new
smartphone to come and we've got
different colorings from t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T being teased here because obviously
AT&amp;amp;T is blue and orange and t-mobile is
magenta or magenta or whatever you where
you want to pronounce it but the
interesting thing here is that the
teasers only show edges they don't show
us the regular galaxy s6 so we wonder
exactly what we're getting from samsang
at mwc and it leads me to the question
of the day if Samsung were to only
launch the galaxy s6 or the galaxy s
edge meaning only one variant with edges
would you still buy it or would the
edges deter you from wanting to buy this
product because in my case I don't know
I'd have to test it out but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you wanna
get the nose earlier before this video
