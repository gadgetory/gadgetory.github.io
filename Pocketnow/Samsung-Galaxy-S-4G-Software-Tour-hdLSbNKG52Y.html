calm we're going to look at a software
tour of the t-mobile samsung galaxy s 4g
let's take a look so first thing we got
our swipe screen to unlock and this
changed a little bit from the vibrant
with the old vibrant you could just
flick it like that and it would it would
unlock but with this one you have to do
a very long swipe optionally you can
also go to the side but see it doesn't
work if you start from the middle you
got to do all the way so that's a change
and it's kind of annoying but you got to
get used to that here's the default home
screen we have seven home screens and
you see some new nice little t-mobile
icons we got team old TV and we get some
sound effects every time we press
something so let's see if this load's
pretty quickly 27 days left just take a
look at this loading loading loading
anyway some live streaming TV shows
should show up here I'm getting bored so
we'll go back and go what else we got on
the home screen you got inception so
let's tap that but that brings you to
rotate please the media hub and you can
see there's other movies here and
there's inception but you have to create
an account of some sort and log in
before you can watch it media hub does
the same thing goes to the media hub
okay optionally if you actually want to
see inception you can open the media I
mean the video player rather and start
playing the inception and it looks
really really good on the screen super
amoled see we can force that's forward
so there you go zoom back out got your
HD camcorder camera quick shortcuts to
those marketplace now let's go to this
side that slacker that air sync which is
something new this is from double twist
so if you set this up with your desktop
Mac or PC you'll be able to do some
wireless syncing over Wi-Fi so we can do
that you also got kindle app is
pre-installed that's pretty nice we have
amazon mp3 if you want to buy some mp3s
and it's you know just for normal grid
design nothing special youtube is here
this first one is and we're loading
loading loading there we go I turn it
get full screen and to get high quality
you got to press that little button at
the corner and it's going to have to
read buffer but that's taken too long so
let's go back and over here we have
nothing to nothing over here we have
facebook is already installed email is
there over here we've got nothing to
nothing and you've got video chat tilt
okay and from here we can do video chat
and we can choose somebody to video chat
or you can use the dial pad here under
applications let's see we've got four
screens of pre-installed apps it's kind
of a lot you got add to home and sync
we're to saw all share this is you've
seen this before this is a DLNA app mean
once Wi-Fi I don't care let's get out
come on we got amazonmp3 you already saw
that call logs now here's something new
car home this is kind of like a in car
dashboard type thing so you can have
this running for absolute you would use
in the car and same for desk home
similar type of thing that's big clock
so if you had some kind of stand you can
put this up kind of nice doubletwist you
got there and you guys set it up drive
smart settings for you know kind of
limiting what you can do while you're in
motion driving a car
we've seen those before file manager
gallery the usual Go Go this for free
well in flight Wi-Fi and oh it says this
offers has ended Chandra 31st which is
long before this device came out so I
don't why they even put that icon in
here so we got other Google stuff lad to
layer
so that's given us some local stuff memo
just a little note taking app mini diary
similar type of thing now the weather
just to kind of silly little thing music
player you got my account that's good
for checking your t-mobile stuff can see
our activity keep track of how much
downloads you're doing
mine device personalization navigation
we've got slacker we already saw that
the sign stall speed test we had a lot
of stuff here at Google Talk swipe it
does come with swiped L&amp;amp;F GPS video chat
we've seen visual voicemail that's the t
mobile app and set it up take in too
long and we also have a nice Wi-Fi
calling so this is voice over IP when we
have a Wi-Fi network connected you don't
have to use the network the t-mobile
network if you have no bad reception so
that's about it for the installed apps
now one more thing in this settings
you're probably wondering if this has
mobile hotspot and yes it does there it
is you got to turn it on here so that
I'll set up the 4G connection as a Wi-Fi
access point that's good to have there's
some other settings drive smart ok let's
look at what do we have for wallpapers
this one is a new one that's pretty cool
so that motion back there and it has
little star effects kind of cool galaxy
DNA now another thing up here we have
some different options it's kind of
weird to have you know settings in the
notifications bar but we have a Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS silent mode and auto
rotation so we're going to have auto
rotation on if I shut it off stuff
doesn't rotate but guess what if I turn
it on stuff also doesn't rotate but
actually it does if you're in an app
that does rotate because some of them
don't some of them do so auto rotation
off and now it's not going to rotate so
that's pretty much it for what is
pre-installed on the tmobile samsung
galaxy s 4g so that's it for the
software tour hope you enjoyed this
video give us a thumbs up if you liked
it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
