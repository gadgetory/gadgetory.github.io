split-screen multitasking support to in
a way apple shares how to avoid getting
attacked by the SMS bug and you can say
goodbye to the 2k displays on Sony's
experience going forward I'm hematuria
vetta and if you have a problem with my
Friday jokes no problem I could drink to
that this is parking out daily and yes
as Google i/o is on its way apple felt
that it was time to make its official
statement as to when WWDC will have its
keynote we already knew the dates but
the keynote is always ambiguous so the
company has just confirmed that it's
happening on june eighth at ten a.m.
pacific time so you can bet that we will
be covering everything live as it
happens and that is a very early event
by the way and speaking of Apple the
company has already come clear as to how
you can avoid the hole SMS bug issues
and it does involve Siri it's a full
procedure that you have to follow in a
way for Siri to playback messages and
free not to read them so that's a
problem because not everybody likes to
use this feature but if you're
interested or you want to avoid this
problem listen scription will show you
exactly what you need to do now sony has
been doing the oddest product launches
lately up to the point we're real still
waiting for the Xperia z4 everywhere
else and in that case the company has
come clear as to the fact that specs
aren't really going to change much for
experience going forward apparently 2k
displays are not happening because the
company has a hard time proving to
customers that there's a benefit on a 2k
display that doesn't make sense 1080p
displays are good enough in pixel
density but that being said at least we
have a good news that experience will
continue to exist as that was another
concern that was happening now news that
didn't necessarily why was yesterday was
Android pay mainly because Google Wallet
never took off and well this is just the
revamp or so we thought seems the
Android pay is actually going to be a
completely separate thing as a Google
Wallet team has just teased that there
will be an update to the google wallet
application going forward that will work
on iOS and Android iOS and Android yes I
said that so yeah it seems that there is
a more to come from Google Wallet we
just wonder exactly why we're gonna have
to the funk products being launched out
there and finally for the very hot
news of the day if you were waiting for
split-screen multitasking on Android M
it turns out that it does exist in a way
there is a way to actually activate it
in the bug tools obviously you need code
and you need so many things and this is
only available in the developer preview
and it could be for a reason it could be
that it's just being tested or whatever
but as it turns out it is just so buggy
that we kind of understand why Google
didn't build it into this launch of
Android ever at least in the teasers and
in the announcements and it does lead me
to the question of the day would you
want split-screen multitasking on your
current device is in my case it's one of
the main reasons why I stick to galaxy
tablets but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to hear what you think
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filming sure you follow us on
Pagano comments kept trying to channel
as well you follow me on Twitter
