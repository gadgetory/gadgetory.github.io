icon II a phablet we saw at CES is a
foot and we have one here in our
Charlotte offices I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and this is the boost max
unboxing ZTE wants to break into the US
market it did so first with the Nubia 5
but now we're getting the boost mobile
version of the icon II a phablet we saw
at CES it is called the boost max
basically it's the same exact phone
inside and now they look pretty much
identical and this one is simply
specific to Boost Mobile anybody who's
familiar with that service it starts at
$55 per month and what that gets you is
unlimited talk text and data and the
longer you use the service the lower the
service price gets so it shrinks your
payment over time without too much delay
let's get inside the box and talk a
little more about the phone not the
service so it has a little pull tab here
on the back for ease of use for breaking
into it let's get a nice ripping sound
there pull up some tabs and flaps you
get to this so I thought I was gonna
need a knife to get into this packaging
but I actually don't
once you pull it out of the box you
actually have this recycling bag which
is pretty standard for sprint and it's
you know prepaid services or the other
networks that are the image VOS that are
on its network and you have this
paperwork box which is your getting
started guide in your important
information nothing terribly spectacular
there but it does say be heard be heard
so actually this thing is actually very
easy to get into it's got an open tab I
remember these boost devices from when I
worked in retail and they were always a
pain you had to cut them open with
scissors or with a knife so I'm glad
they updated that that's very nice here
is that the actual phone so it's
actually big nice we'll move that to the
side really quickly this is your
standard microUSB cable your power block
of course and this this is a removal
tool which many of you might be familiar
with but this one is actually not for
the SIM card if you move this closer you
can see that it's actually for the micro
SD card because this thing is actually
it does have LTE capabilities but the
SIM card is embedded so
you can't remove it this is for the SD
card which is nice you actually get up
to 64 gigabytes of additional storage
and if we move that to the side we'll
get to the device so once you get the
device in your hands it's easy to see
that this zone is actually very
substantial and nice it's nine
millimeters thick which is pretty
average it's not super thin or super
bulky um it feels substantial and it
feels very nice it's weighty but I don't
know the exact exact weight on it we
didn't get that in the specifications or
anything so I don't know the exact
weight we'll get to that later in the
review and stuff but it is a very
substantial feeling device the 5.7 inch
display is nice it's big but it's only
720p so that is kind of an upsetting
part of such a big device we've seen it
so many times before when you have a
device with a display that's this large
720p is kind of substandard we'd like to
see 1080p but you're only paying $299 so
you can only you know you can't pick
straws with something like this the
internals are for the most part on par
with a lot of the low end devices we've
seen lately it has a Snapdragon 400
chipset inside with a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core CPU it has a 3200 milliamp
hour battery which were very happy for
only one gigabyte of RAM and eight
gigabytes of storage so it doesn't have
top-tier specifications but you are
getting good value for the price 299
dollars would not normally net you such
a substantial build quality this thing
feels fantastic in the hands you got the
metal backing which I think that's
actually it may be plastic but it feels
not like metal which I'm okay with that
and it's offset with the soft touch of
the pot in the top here but on the
bottom it's also offset with some soft
touch but it has a nice big perforation
for the speaker down here which is for
the Dolby Digital Plus audio there are
some surround sound audio capabilities
in the software then you have this nice
big speaker on the back of course it's
on the back so we're not sure how well
it's gonna sound but there is that
branding there so well we'll hold out to
see what it actually sounds like once we
get some time with the device one of our
favorite things here is the camera key
we have a shutter button also on that
side is the power key that's on the
right side the left side you have the
volume rocker and the micro SD card slot
which is you have to access with the
tool
just kind of a hit-or-miss I think
having one is nice but having to use a
tool just to get to your SD card kind of
defeats the purpose I think you also
have your micro s or your micro USB port
here on the side which is interesting
because we don't normally see that
anymore
because it gets in the way when you're
using the phone you'll have to use the
phone with your right hand and it could
be awkward for someone around back you
have an 8 megapixel camera which is
capable of 1080p recording and then your
LED flash and of course finally your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack so before you
jump off here and start playing with the
device let's do a quick power on and see
what the display looks like and how
quickly it boots up the first time and
while it does that we also have of
course the standard capacitive buttons
here at the bottom but you actually have
a Menu key it looks like instead of an a
task switcher I don't know I can't
remember that might be a task switcher
but it looks like a menu button like an
old antiquated mini button so here we
are if we take this it's actually you
get into it like the like with the Nubia
let's test that out really quickly it is
it's a mini button it's not a task
switcher which tells us that we're
probably going yeah you have to hold the
home button to get to the task switcher
at adverse Glantz the display doesn't
look terrible
it looks pretty nice at least for a 720p
display on a 5.7 inch phone or 720p
resolution on a 5.7 inch display so this
has been the unboxing of the boost max 4
