laptop that many consider as it clones
Apple's MacBook Pro but for reasons I
don't understand I mean I'm not saying
that they don't have some resemblance
but this computer is so much more than a
clone so much so that it's one of my
favorite products of the year and I know
it's early I'm hanging out even I will
pocket now and if you want to learn why
join us for our full review brought to
you by tsums I oh okay so those of you
who follow the channel know that one of
the only reasons left for me to use a
Mac is Final Cut Pro I'm not saying that
it's a better tool and compared to
Premiere Pro or other video editing
applications but it's just the tool that
I personally find most practical for our
workflow thing is Windows 10 has brought
such a new breath to the PC market that
I've been truly compelled to make a
switch but never have I been more
convinced than in the last couple of
months the mate book X Pro is a gorgeous
piece of machinery we have an aluminum
build with machine finishes and beveled
edges that just scream high quality
regardless of where you look we have a
spacious and backlit keyboard that
seriously enjoyed a type on given its
bouncy design and it's also splash proof
for clumsy people like me at a large
trackpad that's really convenient for
multi-touch gestures with options for
added gestures if you want to add volume
controls and music controls as well and
there's even a crazy-fast fingerprint
scanner and better than the power button
but as the infomercial would say but
wait there's more
sucked inside we have these
specifications our unit sports and eight
generation intel core i7 discreet
graphics from nvidia sixteen gigabytes
of ram a 512 gigabyte solid state drive
and a 57.4 one hour battery which Huawei
claims to go up to twelve hours of video
playback
and I've tested it it is really good yes
this is the maxed out version but if you
think of all the punch this machine has
for under three pounds I don't think
you'll find the more powerful and
compact combination out there supports
include USB a on one side a headphone
jack along with a Thunderbolt 3 port
taking up one of the two USB C ports on
the other and the USB C charger is
seriously compact but wait there's more
turn on the screen and this is what I'm
talking about we have a gorgeous 3k
display that nearly kills the bezel at a
91% screen to body ratio it's three by
two aspect ratio with viewing angles
covering 178 degrees it goes as bright
as 450 nits and it is also touch
sensitive if that's your thing but wait
there's more the speakers on this thing
are phenomenal we have a quat speaker
array that's extremely loud so much so
that I find myself lowering the volume
at times not it's stronghold but they do
support Dolby Atmos so the combination
of the speakers and the screen are
definitely great for content consumption
there are even four microphones to help
you conference in even a faraway but
wait there's more this computer runs
Windows 10 Signature Edition meaning
there's very little bloat there's pretty
much just one Huawei application
controlling the drivers and that's it
everything else is just as Microsoft
intends meaning a very fast and fluid
experience all around it's really
convenient for productivity and that
boots in just under 8 seconds and yes
there's also Huawei share support for
those of you that also have a wall way
phone so right about now I know you're
asking yourself if this is just the
fanboy piece designed to prease this
computer but you guys know me better the
answer is no there's no such thing as a
perfect product and there are four
things about this computer that I don't
really like the first is the auto
brightness which is extremely aggressive
I deactivate it all together if I were
you this is kind of sad as I do rely on
this on competing products but it's
really just a software update away
hopefully the second is that it took me
days to figure out why the fans went
crazy every now and then it turns out
that when those was having a hard time
living in the small 102 gigabyte
partition that Huawei gave it out of the
box deleting the partition was actually
not as hard as before with Windows just
go into settings delete and reassign a
big thanks to my buddy David Cogan from
the unlocker comm for the tip and voila
Windows now works great and the fans
rarely turn on now third this trackpad
is sensitive in things I don't need it
to be it's so large that it detects a
ton of gestures I didn't intend
something you won't really struggle with
the Olympic sized pool of a trackpad on
the MacBook Pro and then there's the
complete irony that even with the size
of the trackpad the left button has a
very small area of sensitivity which
again you don't deal with in other
computers last but not least the no scam
yes this is not a webcam it's a no scam
I mean I do praise the ingenuity of the
placement I do love that I can hide it
when I want privacy but the angle just
completely kills it those of you that
have other computers and are looking for
privacy I recommend that you have a look
at the web cam covers provided by zooms
i/o they're easy to attach and easy to
slide when you need to cover the camera
and you won't have to worry about the
camera being in the wrong angle all in
all even with its minor list of
downsides I can't lie this is one of my
favorite products of the year so far
like to carry elegant powerful and let's
delight to use for the most part again
not the perfect product but definitely
one I have no problem in recommending we
still don't know when it'll launch in
the United States if it does or at what
price but I do hear that the company
wants to be aggressive about it whatever
the case may be

said at the beginning a gorgeous piece
