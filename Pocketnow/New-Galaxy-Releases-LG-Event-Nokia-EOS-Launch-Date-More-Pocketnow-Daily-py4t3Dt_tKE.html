products get rumoured LG schedules an
event for May thirtieth and it's got a G
written all over it and no keys
41-megapixel yo smartphone is rumored
for May fourteenth I'm hi meri behna and
just think about it if my cheeks look
this big on 18 megapixels how big are
they going to look on 41 megapixels this
is out daily let's start the day
off with some interesting news Apple is
never the company to allow third-party
applications to become default services
meaning of your an email you click on
any link you'll be taken to Safari
whether you like it or not but gold is
now putting some new services to
developers which allows them to select
chrome as a default browser for whenever
they want to navigate on Chrome and not
on Safari we just wish the chrome was
actually better than Safari on iOS which
is sadly not the case but hey it's a
step going forward now let's continue
talking about LG the company has been
reluctant to bring us any tablets for
the longest time they've been rumored
for months in pretty much years but now
we've got some new more credible reports
that apparently the company is building
tablets to be launched in the third
quarter of this year the question is
what's going to be great about these
tablets but on the second note we've
also got a new present bite for May
thirtieth to an LG event where they have
a G written all over it so this could
probably be the optimus g2 event to
happen and let's just stay tuned i mean
the recent leaks for the phone are
actually quite cool now let's continue
talking about HTC facebook at AT&amp;amp;T as
their first collaboration is now
dropping in price and used to cost a
hundred dollars after a two-year
contract and now it's just going to cost
you a buck after a two-year contract and
it just begs to wonder has the phone
actually sold or not leave us a comment
down below have you bought the phone
have you seen it on the streets it seems
that the phone hasn't really sold much
and well when you think about it a
hundred dollars is kind of steep for a
mid-tier phone and let's continue
talking about some galaxy phones for all
three of you out there they want the
galaxy mega super jumbo monstrous ugly
mid-tier and crappy phones well they're
going to be available in Europe
apparently by the end of this week
probably by early next week so don't
stay tuned but other than that we've
heard about the samsung galaxy s
zoom yesterday you know that apparent
camera phone you know meaning a camera
that's actually a phone and apparently
it will be launched in the first week of
june and on other notes we've also got
the samsung galaxy s4 active which is
that waterproof version of the galaxy s4
along with the s4 mini apparently
launching in mid-july so if you are
waiting for any of these except for the
galaxy s you know the mega thing that
I'm not even going to recommend well
stay tuned and finally for the
interesting news of the day we all know
that nokia has a May fourteenth event to
be held in London to launch their
apparent aluminum catwalk smartphone but
according to digitize this phone is
actually the EOS 41 megapixel camera
smartphone that we've been waiting for
and we did see some leaked photos of a
huge lens on an aluminum chassis but
we've also reviewed the 808 PureView
smartphone camera and for those of you
that are wondering if 41 megapixels are
actually worth it well for lossless
digital zoom they actually are zooming
on camera phones is terrible except on
the 808 PureView so that leads you to
the question of the day are you waiting
for Nokia's May fourteenth event to
decide on what you're going to buy the
spring or have you already got your HTC
One or galaxy s4 in full honesty I'm
actually waiting for the event to see
what they bring but leave us a comment
down below what's your next pick are you
waiting for the nokia vent and of course
for another scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone in South
moment she follow us on talking I'll
calm subscribe to our YouTube channel
you can also follow me on Twitter time
it underscored iveta please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Marilyn thank you very much
for watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
