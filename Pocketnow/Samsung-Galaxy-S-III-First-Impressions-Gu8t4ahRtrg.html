pocket now calm the samsung galaxy s3
was just announced i wanted to fire up
the camera real quick and talk about
three things that I'm really excited
about and three things that really
disappoint me let's get to it okay so
number one something that really makes
me excited is the quad-core Exynos
processor the samsung galaxy s2 had a
blazing-fast dual core Exynos processor
that even to this day is one of the
fastest cpus out there even compared to
the Tegra 2 in some cases the Tegra 3 at
least in terms of day-to-day feel the
the XO nose is a winner and a quad-core
exynos sounds really good to me so
really excited about that number two is
the bezel of the galaxy galaxy s3 if you
look really closely the bezel is
extremely thin and we're getting to the
point where we're almost ready to have a
phone that has an edge-to-edge display
whether that even makes sense as another
discussion but an edge-to-edge display
is beautiful it is gorgeous having the
screen take up as much of the facade of
the device as possible is a really
interesting prospect and the galaxy s3
interestingly goes to the edge on the
top and the bottom and the left and the
right even more so than the galaxy s2
did so it's really going to provide a
tremendously big screen experience
number 3 thing I'm excited about is
smart stay a feature called smart stay
that actually tracks the movement of
your eyes to determine when the screen
should be on and when it should be off
I'm not exactly sure how this is going
to work and whether it's going to
destroy battery life it might but it's a
really cool idea how many times are you
there looking at a webpage or perhaps
some sort of video and the screen dims
after a certain period of time and
you've got to keep tapping on the screen
and tapping on the screen because it is
dimming down thinking that you're not
using your phone with smart stay
hopefully that annoying tap tap will be
a thing of the past and we won't have to
worry about it
now let's talk about three things that
are tremendously disappointing with the
samsung galaxy s3 number one it's got a
pentile display ah yes a pentile display
like the droid razr like the HTC One S
the pen tile display means that pixels
the sub pixels are actually shared
between each pixel so that means you
will probably see pixels on the galaxy
s3 if you look closely the HTC One X has
it right it's got an RGB sub-pixel
configuration which is a fancy term to
say that each pixel has its own sub
pixels that are not shared between other
pixels so that's really unfortunate of
the the plus here is that the galaxy s3
has an AMOLED display so it'll have
fantastic contrast way above and beyond
what you get on an LCD but again pentile
pentile pentile we don't want to see
pentile anymore number two
disappointment which is really the
number two and three is the design and
the materials used in the galaxy s3 the
galaxy s3 looks like something that my
mother could have come up with an
iteration of the galaxy s2 it's bigger
in every dimension it's taller it's
wider it's a little bit thicker it's got
a rounded shape which is kind of
predictable I mean galaxy s2 was very
squared off so you know what makes sense
of the galaxy s3 would have a little bit
of rounded shape to it Samsung really
didn't push the bar here and they didn't
push the bar in terms of materials
either it doesn't use any ceramic
materials is not using metal it's using
glass and plastic just like every other
phone out there that said it looks
pretty nice it's got a an interesting
finish whether you go with the blue or
the white but again this is Samsung's
flagship phone for 2012 and into 2013 we
would have hoped that they would have
pushed the limit a little bit
terms of what's possible with smartphone
design because you know the iPhone 5 is
going to do some really cool stuff
whenever that's released so that was top
three and bottom three features as I see
it with the galaxy s3 I haven't gotten a
chance to play with the device we've got
a guy an editor tony is going to be
bringing you some hands-on coverage
shortly so he'll be able to comment more
so on these on these things and we'll
get the galaxy s3 interview as soon as
possible because I'm really excited
about it and I hope to make it my daily
driver for a while hopefully it's a
worthy successor to the galaxy s2 so
what three things interest you the most
and what three things are you the most
disappointed about what the galaxy s3
let us know in the comments and if you
like this video give us a thumbs up
thanks for watching and that's it for
now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
