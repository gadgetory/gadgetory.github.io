pocketnow.com and this is the pocket now
fast fingers contest a silly name indeed
but the stakes are high because if you
win we will send you any phone that you
want for free wherever you are in the
world so if you want the new Nexus S or
you want the Droid X or the Palm Pre -
we'll send it to you if you win this
competition this competition is all
about speed entering text into your
smartphone we want to see who out there
can enter text faster than anyone and
here's what you have to do film yourself
recording the phrase and the phrase will
be listed in the description and I'm
gonna demonstrate exactly the phrase in
a second film yourself typing this
phrase onto your smartphone with a
stopwatch in the frame and we're gonna
use the stop much to make sure that no
one's cheating to make sure that
everything is on a level playing field
no one's fast forwarding the video the
person that types the phrase in the
fastest amount of time wins you're going
to want to put the amount of time it
took you to type the phrase within the
description of your video response now
you can't use an external Bluetooth
keyboard or something like that you must
use a keyboard method or a method of
input that you can preload onto your
phone so you can use swipe you can use
the hardware keyboard if you want the
on-screen keyboard the landscape
keyboard or any other text entry method
that is out there that is not external
so right now I'm going to demonstrate
exactly how an entry might look I'm
going to try typing the phrase as fast
as I possibly can on the Dell Venue Pro
be right back okay so here's the phrase
it says this is my entry for the pocket
now fast fingers contest the quick brown
fox jumped over the lazy dog
I can type faster than you exclamation
point again we're going to put all of
these rules right in the description so
it's clear as day I should also mention
that if you misspell a word one second
will be added to your score that is so
that we can also go for accuracy it
really doesn't make sense if you're
going to type this phrase and it's
completely incorrect so I'm going to
demonstrate how this should go I've got
a stopwatch here off off to the left and
you can use a kitchen timer or a watch
or something that is visible on the
frame we just want to make sure we can
see the stopwatch go and the progression
of seconds so I'm going to start the
stopwatch and I'm going to open a new
email and for this contest you must do
it in a new email so that there's plenty
of screens
to see and here we go a little bit
nervous here but let's see how fast I
can do I'm gonna hit start and when it
gets to ten seconds I'm going to begin
stop 32 seconds okay so that was about
or exactly 22 seconds let's see how many
errors I got this is my entry for the
pocket now one err fingers contest two
errors so far adding two seconds to put
brown fox jumped away dog I can type
faster than you okay so that is two
errors and we had 22 seconds so that
makes for a score of 24 seconds see if
you can beat me again
all of the rules to this contest are
going to be right in the description and
if you win we're gonna send you any
phone that you want who is the fastest
fingers out there let's find out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
