pocketnow.com here at CES 2013 we're
taking a look at probably one of the
coolest Windows 8 tablets I can't
believe I'm saying that but you're gonna
see why now let's take a look so this is
the Asus 400 m II and what's amazing
about it is that it's been it's light it
has no fans and it's running Windows 8
Pro the full version of Windows 8 pro
Cee'd run Photoshop and all of your
awesome apps on this when we're kind of
comparing this to the other windows 8
pro tablets out there that are kind of
thick heavy and very expensive this is
going to be about 500 bucks which is a
great value it's running an Intel Atom
processor that's why it doesn't have the
fans the core i5s and ninety seven to
nine threes they all need to have fans
but the Atom processor it's a little bit
slower but what you get is the potential
to be much thinner it's got a nice feel
in hand very soft touch and look at this
desktop whoa look at all these apps it's
Windows 8 with all of the trimmings all
of the stuff that you like because all
the cool stuff from Windows 8 let's see
see how how how fast this is that wasn't
that bad
let's go to another app here check out
games
the atom processors are the fastest
thing ever but this is a great
compromise if you want something super
portable that can also run all of your
your apps again it's the Asus 400 ma
it's on sale and quarter one about 500
bucks a really good option if you want a
full Windows 8 to have the really nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
