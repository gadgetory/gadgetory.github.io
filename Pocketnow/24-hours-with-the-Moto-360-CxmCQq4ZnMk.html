nuts when Motorola had its launch event
for the Moto 360 in Chicago so we asked
Adam Dowd to pick up the 360 for us and
then Joe Levi unboxed it and set it up
now that we've had it in the Boston
office for a day or two we've finally
got some initial thoughts here some of
which we discussed on today's podcast
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and
I'm here to share the rest of them with
you in a short first look when I first
saw the Moto 360 my reaction was pretty
typical I thought it was the
best-looking SmartWatch I'd ever seen
and despite everything we've seen since
I still feel that way the fit and finish
of the casing is just exemplary the
heavy feel on the wrist is reassuring
the gray leather watch band looks and
feels great and despite the so-called
flat tire effect of the equipment Bay at
the bottom the round display is quite
not sure even the wireless charging
cradle is fun in its own way with a
desktop clock mode that I really like
unfortunately I've been using that
charger more often than I'd like
yesterday with ambience mode on to keep
the watch face visible at all times the
Moto 360 only made it to 11 hours of use
before expiring it's doing better today
with ambience mode off down by only 20%
or so after four hours but it's
certainly no marathon runner when it
comes to endurance also Android wear
still has its hiccups and rough spots
see our full Android wear review for
details on that and I get the early
sense that the 360 is a little more
hesitant than some of its contemporaries
as far as responsiveness goes as of yet
none of these complaints are enough to
overcome the novelty of this beautiful
and very distinctive hardware but we'll
see how I feel next week when the time
comes for my full review you can help
shape it drop a comment below letting us
know what you want to see covered and
check out PocketNow weekly 113 for
reader submitted questions answered on
the air finally see our moto x vs Moto X
comparison as well live right now and
right here and at pocket now until next
time this has been michael fisher
captain two phones on twitter reminding
you to
pure ambience to a minimum and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
