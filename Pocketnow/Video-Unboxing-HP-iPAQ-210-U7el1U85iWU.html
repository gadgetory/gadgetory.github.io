pocketnow.com and this is the video
unboxing of the HP ipaq 200 series I
have the HP ipaq 210 enterprise handheld
here really nice arch from HP pretty
much the typical with specs and pretty
much it the bottom it's only there's
much to appreciate about the
sophisticated design blah blah blah
let's see what we get inside which is
the most important see open it up we get
a well quick set-up guide or trying to
show it here then we get a pretty much
the arts of the device and how it looks
let's see we get a little bit a piece of
phone battery information important
notice about Wi-Fi okay and then we
gotta get getting started guide with the
different things that are included in
the box and then we get a microsoft
outlook 2007 i believe i'll check that
in later on and confirm we got the
device here have a look at it a bit
later we have a wow this it's a 2200
milliamp battery and it's a really big
battery too so I bet we'll get really
need performance from this device
battery power wise we got a charger
adapter pretty much what i've seen in
the ipaq 100 series and the some other
devices that are coming out in the
market right now you got a wall charger
here and the pretty much the wall
charger the way it works is yep the same
as the other ones you just open it up
put this in the flap here snap it real
neat then we have a USB cable
interesting though trying to get this
out of attacking but if i'm not mistaken
got a USB cable for a proprietary jack
oh this is bad news then we got a home
it's pretty much those old property
three jacks that we're used to seeing
from old HP devices oh this is sad news
and then we get a an adapter for this
proprietary Jack here too bad then after
this we only get foul and then all we
get a case see what we have here it
certainly looks leather it's pretty much
the slip device in play with it around
it looks like good quality looks like it
just to fit in your pocket it doesn't
have anything to clip it onto your belt
or anything but it could definitely go
do a good job and then here we have the
device smooth this to the side pretty
much we have a 4 inch screen here i'll
look into hardware in our next video
that's i must say this is probably one
of the largest devices I've ever used
I've never seen something so big in the
past I I didn't have the ipad 4700 or
the other predecessors i did have the
3630 and it wasn't this it was this big
but it wasn't this thick so i'll be
putting this device to a test in the
next couple of weeks pretty much seen
what it can do this is supposed to be
the most powerful device sporting
windows mobile 6 classic so in case you
want us to test anything specific just
keep us posted on the forum and hope you
enjoy the review from here on this is
pretty much it for pocket now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
