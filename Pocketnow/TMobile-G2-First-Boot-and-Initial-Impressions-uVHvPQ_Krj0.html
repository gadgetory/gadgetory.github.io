t-mobile g2 I've got ahead and unboxed
it and I had to pop the battery door out
you do that with this little slider
there the aluminum cover pops off very
very easily and then I had to pull out a
little battery protector sleeve or film
i guess i'd call it so i've got ahead
and done that and i'll just snap that
back in place power buttons up on the
top so let's push that and see what we
get completely unscripted so i don't
even know if we're charged up or not
first thing we got was a vibration on
the phone which felt very good in solid
HTC logo and we'll just let this run
through here so you can see kind of the
timing of the first boot one thing I
should mention is that first boots
usually take longer than subsequent
boots so keep that in mind I've got a
tmobile g2 with google logo on the
screen and then right there we've got
the t-mobile with g2 screen so that that
was a very fast one I'm going to go
ahead and proceed through this let's be
customized my phone and it since I can
return to this screen by selecting the
setup icon in the app drawer which is
nice so I can go right back into the
setup wizard so that's kind of cool I'm
going to go ahead and set these up later
so I'll just continue through them for
now I'm going to enable geolocation and
then I have a home button and that
immediately takes me straight home now I
don't have a sim in the phone right now
so it's not going out that's what these
icons tell me no sim no service and it
tells me that the time is 1201 a.m.
which obviously is incorrect but that's
what we have without a sim in there
without any data looking at the screen
very fluid motion and they pre load it
with a whole bunch of stuff in fact
we've got 1 2 3 4 5 07 screens come
default on this device which is a bit
more than average
very responsive this is using the stock
launcher nothing fancy or special here
very fluid I like that quite a bit and
if you notice right there the the
capacitive button on the bottom to go
back it is very smooth and very
responsive menu is responsive as well
everything on this device is just super
fast I'm really really impressed with it
so far so let's see how this thing does
I'm going to go ahead and pop my sim in
there and I'll be right back ok so I've
gone ahead and pop the battery out and
I've shown you how to do that I slid the
sim in now this is a very tight fit but
just go ahead and put it in according to
the diagram there and you're good to go
in a previous video I showed you the
little SD card down here and I couldn't
figure out how to get it open and didn't
want to spend too much time on it
because I was covering other stuff on
the phone but you've got a diagram here
that shows you you just push down and
that releases this very similar to the
way that sim slots worked in the past it
comes with an eight gig class 2 micro
sdhc I'm going to go ahead and replace
it with the one that I have all of my
stuff on which is also eight gig but
it's a class for which is a little bit
faster so we'll see about that now the
contacts go down in this slot so we're
just going to push that in there close
the slot and then we have to slide the
little metal mechanism up to lock it in
place once that's in we simply drop the
battery in place and we put our metal
back panel on and it snaps down securely
and of course now i'm going to boot it
back up again but i'm going to do that
off camera for you downloading a whole
bunch of apps when I say downloading I
mean updating its pulling down
everything that was pre-installed that
had the allow automatic updating on just
that's a future of froyo that I really
really like Google Maps needs a manual
update
because it requires more permissions and
I'm amazed at just how fast this is I've
had the sim in there for all of about
three minutes and I've already gotten
all of these updates ironically as it
may be while I was setting this up I got
a text message from t-mobile telling me
that my g2 had shipped and giving me the
tracking number and that text message
got here about an hour after the phone
it so kind of funny there I thought it
was rather interesting but what I want
to do to finish up this video is to just
show you all around on the keyboard down
here now this is really impressive I'm
going to go back home and again those
buttons those capacitive buttons are
just so responsive it's amazing but
we've got some special buttons first of
all these buttons are huge if you want
to compare them over here to the epic 4g
they look about the same size but they
just feel so much bigger they're very
responsive underhand and just very very
nice you've got three states to the
buttons just standard lowercase hold
down the shift button to get uppercase
and hold down alt to get to the other
options like the numbers here across the
top then they are ordered straight
across the top instead of clustered here
in the middle like you have on some
other devices you've also got an all
button on the other side and frequently
used buttons for email and web stuff
over here you've got an @ symbol a dub
dub dub dot and a dot-com button over
here you also have these kind of
interesting and navigate buttons now the
navigate buttons let you just move there
they're shortcut keys so kind of neat it
goes through a wizard here says next
you'll choose what shortcut you'd like
to assign two quick key one so kind of
neat let's go ahead and do I don't know
let's pick out what do you want to do
directions and navigation that sounds
good to me and we just won't set that up
right now we put in a an address if we
wanted to but the same thing down here
for the other quick key and then on the
bottom so you've got three total quick
keys that you can assign which
is very very nice again the speed on
this device is just phenomenal I love it
a lot and I'm very very impressed with
the overall feel the overall experience
of the device so next up in our video
series we're going to show you just how
fast it is I know a lot of you have
complained about the 800 megahertz
processor that's inside this device well
let's go and see if it's really a
problem or not and to do that we're
going to compare it running quadrant
which is a benchmarking program and
we're going to compare it against the
epic 4g which is one of the fastest
phones on the market so make sure you
subscribe to our video channel and watch
that video as soon as we get it released</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
