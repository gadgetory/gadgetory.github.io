some additional app updates xcode
reveals that we should expect some
display resizing capabilities on future
iOS products and after a ton of leaks
the HTC one EA is now official I'm hi
meri beta and beta tester dilemma number
45 eight states that iOS 8 beta one is
probably the buggiest test we've ever
done this is pocket out daily when it
comes to official news today Google has
just launched Android for dot for dot 3
as an over-the-air update but
interesting there is a catch which is
odd from google this time only the nexus
7 can access the update for reasons we
don't know we don't see it available on
the Nexus 5 just yet and aside from this
over the year update there are some
application updates that bring a
different sort of you I to certain apps
from Google so mix in scripture for full
details and hopefully the Nexus 5 will
get it soon now if you thought the hot
selling smartphone right now let's start
with galaxy or with iPhone that's
actually not true we've got some
interesting leads from from trusted
sources that confirm that LG has been
selling a ton of g3's we're talking
about 30,000 units a day which even
breaks Samsung's own records now
obviously we won't have to confirm these
numbers it's hard to predict if this
will actually continue for long but yeah
the g3 is hot we can't wait to test it
and with the launch of iOS 8 a lot of
things were great a lot of people were
impressed with the updates but then we
were kind of disappointed with the lack
of display multitasking on the iPad
aside from other details but interesting
Xcode 6 was launched and we get some
interesting resizing capabilities for
the display on iphone and ipad so it
could be that these are the features for
multi-display multitasking or it could
be that this is what Apple is using to
test the iphone 6 and a future of
variants of the ipad with a different
display resolution stay tuned that's how
about HTC as the company has made their
1e8 official we thought it was official
a couple of days ago but no now we get
the press release this phone is pretty
much a One m8 with a plastic chassis and
no dual cameras at the back actually has
a 13-megapixel camera but
everything else is pretty much the same
specification so for those of you that
were complaining that you don't like the
camera on the one m80 you can get the 18
and you know you still get a great build
quality it's just plastic not aluminum
now that being said the phone is only
being launched in China right now but
one thing that is being launched and
Verizon is the red and golden variants
of the HTC One m8 tell us what you think
about these colors and finally for the
very sadness appointing news of the day
you would think that the HTC One m8 was
the company's big break I mean the phone
is gorgeous the reviews praised it but
sadly reports are coming in on the
results of sales of the HTC One m8 and
as it turns out even HTC is predicting
that there will be a sales slump in the
next month just like there was on the
previous month we're just kind of
interesting we thought that this phone
would be hot we thought that this film
would sell like crazy and surely we
don't have a camera that we want but
that leaves you the question of the day
how do you feel about HTC lately was
there a reason why you didn't buy the
HTC One m8 cuz obviously you are the
customer you're the one that chose not
to buy the one I made compared to
something else in my particular case the
only reason why I haven't bought the one
I made is because it's not available in
my country yet but leave us a comment
down below tell us what you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is spilling she follow us on
parking i'll comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well you also follow
me on twitter Jaime underscore be better
