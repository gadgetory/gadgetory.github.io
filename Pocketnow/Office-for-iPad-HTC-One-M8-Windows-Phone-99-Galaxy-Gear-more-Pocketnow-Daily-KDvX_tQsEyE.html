launch tomorrow the all new HTC One is
being rumored with a Windows Phone
variant maybe you want a galaxy gear
this is the time to buy I'm hi Mary that
and I believe I do have a reason for
celebrating on a Wednesday don't I this
is out daily let's actually
offer some official news is I know that
a lot of you are waiting for the new
gear lineup from Samsung the gear to the
gear fit figure Neil but this is very
interesting the galaxy gear has actually
gotten really good after a certain
software updates and right now best buy
is offering it for a hundred dollars but
there is a catch this is a limited time
deal these are refurbished Galaxy gear
smartwatches and they're not available
on the line they're sold out online so
they have to go to the store but again
if you're up for a SmartWatch one
hundred dollars is extremely hard to
beat even for a refurb now let's talk
about htcs we've heard lots of rumors
for the past couple of months of the
company working on windows phones
because they were the original partner
and apparently the idea was to bring the
HTC One Design to the smartphone and now
we get more credible rumors that this is
happening apparently HTC is planning to
launch this phone very soon we don't
have any specific dates or details as to
what to expect we're not even sure if
it'll be exactly like the one m8 but
stay tuned it would be a cool phone and
speaking of HTC this is rather
interesting i mean the company boasts a
lot about their blinkfeed features and
their Zoe features on their one as
unique features and they've just made
them available on the google play store
for almost every android phone out there
we don't really understand as HTC is not
really a software company and then again
a they charge me fifty dollars four
cents for my current smartphone i would
pay for it in a heartbeat so it's great
to see how they're doing this i just
don't really understand the move so link
to the comments that tell us what you
think about that now talk about
microsoft as we get reports that are
kind of final that the company has
already done with Windows Phone 8.1 at
least for the core team it is pretty
much finalized everything is ready and
we should expect the release the
manufacturers to be ready in the next
couple of weeks obviously there are some
bug fixes that have to be checked for
this final build of windows phone 8.1
and
are expecting a build for developers to
be available probably in the next week
which is really interesting obviously
the company's built conference is set up
for the next couple of weeks and we are
expecting for the future nokia lumia
smartphones to be announced then so we
should finally get the operating system
now and finally for the very interesting
news of the day you all remember the
rumors of Microsoft launching Office for
iPad soon that they were ready but they
were waiting for something as it turns
out satya nadella will be in san
francisco tomorrow and he'll be holding
a live stream and we are expecting for
the company to launch Office for iPad
during this event now obviously it's
really hard to tell exactly what we're
getting as we don't really know details
on this and we were expecting for it to
reach you know other variants of Windows
first but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day again Office for
iPad is this something that you're
looking forward to because in my
particular case honestly I still have
not found the way to make tablets
productive and i don't think i will with
office because just doesn't feel natural
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
