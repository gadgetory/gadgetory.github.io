now calm and then okay just released a
new version of the weather channel app
for windows files this is version 2.0 so
exclusive to nokia devices for a little
while and it's got a lot of great new
features so let's check them out so
here's the new weather channel app
available for nokia devices its version
to point out and you see it launches a
little bit more quickly and we see it is
totally redesigned completely different
here's your today right now forecast
along with a couple extra days and we
have panoramic so there's the radar map
usually it's a smaller thumbnail but we
also have augmented reality and there's
your amazing weather which is photos
submitted by users now here you have my
amazing day and if I cap that goes up
coming and configured so these are what
this is if i do the plus symbol i'm
going to create an alert so i can choose
some preset areas here let's do running
there's running i'm going to name it and
now we can choose all sorts of
conditions that would be good for
running or whatever i want and let's do
that one so we can say low wind you can
choose which direction the wind is
blowing no rain will choose that pollen
don't like pollen so let's make sure
that's low and UV level low is good
temperature less than 80 that sounds
good and there's wind again so let's say
that and we'll choose location and will
choose the scheduling am
sure and I one save and now my save icon
is available and it will tell me when an
upcoming day that meets those weather
criteria happens I down here my friends
alerts and none of my friends have
alerts right now but this is another
cool feature my friends weather so from
here I can choose different friends and
it will monitor the weather in the city
that they live in and you see there's no
alerts over there so if there's a
special weather advisory for some of
your friends it will show up over there
and let's see what whether it's like
we're Anton lives and so you can see all
those details it's pretty cool and you
can see that I pinned him to the Start
menu so if I go all the way down here
there we have a friend and it's going to
flip over and show what the weather is
like in his City heavy rain so lots of
cool secondary live tiles in this new
app you see I have a couple other pinned
and this is another cool feature we have
if you're an eyewitness subscriber well
remember you can post pictures take
weather-related pictures and post them
right here from the App have to sign in
so that's very cool now augmented
reality is right there this is going to
load pictures taken by other users so we
can't really see any at this angle now
the radar map has a couple extra
features
you can now see the GPS location of
yourself you can show that and we can
play the radar map and see the clouds
moving and the zooming seems a little
bit more responsive here in case you
forgot here's what the current weather
channel looks like version 1.1 six so we
see quite a difference
so that's a quick look at the weather
channel 2 point 0 for windows phone lots
of very innovative new features that's
available now for nokia devices and will
probably come soon to other windows
phones so be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
