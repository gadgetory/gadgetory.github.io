episode 337 of the weekly brought to you
by a pocket now and technically based
upon our guests mostly xda-developers
recorded on friday
that's funny first of December 2018
happy Festivus for the rest of us isn't
it that's for the rest of us right yes
and if you don't celebrate anything ever
well maybe you're doing life a little
wrong I'm Joshua Gaara what's going on
everybody
I'm a and Brandon are off this week but
we have a couple of backstop yes and I
see that my video may have frozen a
little it'll come back right at the
right side your dairy just stop right
there the logo right there we're good
exactly it's hilarious hopefully you
know hopefully it'll come right back if
anything already said a couple of things
but in any case our guests are already
chiming in we have the man with the best
name for a rap lyrics TK hey how's it
going man are you doing guys I'm happy
to be back on the show you know I have a
buddy of mine here too both will
actually both my buddies here Josh and
Adam so yeah good company yeah and then
of course Jules in the in the in the
control room of course can't forget
Jules yeah definitely definitely
alright so the last time we saw you TK
you were like outdoors like this time
you're in like your studio setup visit
yeah yeah Brendan's like are you gonna
have a good connection to sound like yes
yes I'm back oh is that every other
Friday or so I
have work so I didn't want to you know
miss out on the opportunity so I just
did it outside on my laptop today I'm
off so you know yeah
a little bit better perfect all right
and then we have a new guest joining us
for the first time from XDA who may have
objected to my use of the word backstop
is Adam Conway how's it going Adam yeah
I've have time to do work and things
that aren't staring at a book good oh
that's right winter break starts with
you guys now right you know yeah I just
finished my exams in two weeks that's
awesome oh we might one of these days
when we have you on the show we're gonna
ask you like your experience as a
student that because like I'm always
interested in that because I started in
the well and and that yeah so we'll
we'll have that and he he's back hey
this funny everything was working just
fine until we hit well I mean those are
problems that we always contend with
that Jules and I was it Jules of course
as in the booth today so I make sure he
gives him some love in the chats he'll
be monitoring the chat but also remember
that you can get in on the conversation
by tweeting us with the hashtag Pete and
weekly so why don't we go ahead and get
started with our stories all right Ben
gate again
I can't I you can see me just just
incredulous over this apparently some of
the slightly beloved let's say Jaime
loves his the 2003 I 28 head froze
apparently there's not just the
propensity for these tablets to bend but
they might actually come bent pretty
bent if you will
alright so Apple has confirmed to the
verge who broke the story originally
that some 2018 iPad pros might shift
slightly bent right out of the box now
they don't
yeah exactly it's a streamlining of the
device
apparently they don't consider this a
defect but a side-effect of the
manufacturing process and as it says
here on the article at pocket now the
iPhone maker that it wants out the
iPhone maker said it will not get worse
all the time
and it doesn't affect the performance of
the tablet in any way I'm not too sure
exactly how to feel about this that
picture that Jules is already on yeah
look that looks pretty horrible because
it's not just a bend like if we think
about whenever I think about bending or
just like you know usually when it just
been straight it just can't you know
it's just ever so slight kind of
curvature that just looks like a
furniture right if it's a if it's a
uniform curve like the LG G flex I'm
usually pretty happy about that but this
is like right in the middle it
definitely looks like a defect any
thoughts on the new hashtag bendgate
from you guys
competitor 2 I think that's what I was
gonna write it's exactly where I was
gonna go I think it's a new feature we
just haven't embraced yet you're using
the phone you're using the the iPad in
the wrong way if you don't exactly occur
the curve in towards you it's like it's
surrounding you you know you curvature
so it kind of does yeah it does a little
bit curved its way and no no and then I
think realistically even from a hardware
point of view they mean if they're
obviously they're acknowledging it
they're not going against it I think the
realistic thing is to just obviously
obviously offer people the ability of
exchanging it not just say that it won't
get worse as time goes on meaning you
should just accept it and move on
because you can imagine you know down
the road people looking at these
especially when you try to use it in the
case right so I can imagine the casing
wouldn't even close the right way and
I'm sure Josh I gotta talk to Doug yeah
so Jules is flipping down up and down in
the image yeah you could see it right
there it's not a yeah just in man yeah
that is just a picture
but uh yeah it's it's gonna be one of
those things and Oh Josh is here twice
now I like it
wow that was a very nice thing I'm
having hi get up yeah I am having Jaime
levels of connectivity right now all
right there we go
I think I think the last thing that I
said I heard before on that on that note
I think overall it's gonna be one of
those things I think a lot of people are
going to be obviously exchanging I think
it's it's sad you know obviously we
didn't have unbox therapy discovered
this one but it's I think they mentioned
though they said that they haven't seen
an increase in like people returning
them well I'm assuming so this is my
theory is because because it's around
the holidays so I have a feeling and
some of these things are still sitting
in boxes yeah you know so they haven't
been gifted yeah so I'd say by next week
with um bakit mood you know Boxing Day
or you know Christmas Day I think a lot
of people gonna start realizing these
things so it may see that number go a
little bit higher depending on it may
have been just an isolated case I mean
yeah very small sample could also just
be like lying but it could be that
they're just like Oh everything's cold
you know nothing's going on here no no
no no we and Jules your mic is off your
mic is still off all right yeah a lot of
technical problems all right can't get
your can't get Jules up so Adam how's
how's your day uh busy enough dang you
got a haircut while earlier oh I get it
every week every week it works great I
like the stuff yeah
here's Josh's back
here we go hey I'm pulling I'm pulling a
page out of your book Adam right now I'm
actually on my LTE at the moment hey I
have no idea what happened - I apologize
fellas ah okay game back in - did you
guys move on to the next story or are we
still love me no no we we held on okay
the last thing that I think I heard TK
say was that hopefully apples going to
be forthcoming at the very least about
in providing the replacements but this
is the thing they're saying that this is
this is not a defect like this is I feel
like that's their to get out of jail
free card that they don't have to
replace all of these devices so it's uh
I don't know III have a feeling they're
gonna be a lot of angry users out there
and I mean exactly so is this something
that you can look past if you were told
like you can you can't replace it is
this something that you think you could
look pass on on the device if you were
good you know you have the screen right
like it's unless there was like an
aberration inside of the screen itself
that made it clear that is bending a
certain way like it's something that I
feel like you can only see when you kind
of have it out of horizon like this well
I would just think of the reflection
right I mean even if you're holding it
the light hits it at one angle on one
side of the screen the other side kind
of glares off the good thing about it is
it's within a certain period of purchase
you're obviously able to return there
they're not gonna be able to basically
go so far as say sorry you can't
exchange it but my and especially with
the holidays I'm hoping extended return
policies generally it's in the u.s. they
allow you to return things I'll think
all the way to January or so so I and
that's where Adam and I were talking
when you're when we were you know
getting back in there the reason why the
numbers are maybe not as high is there's
potential a lot possibility a lot of
people have these things in boxes
sitting waiting to be unboxed so you
have that delay so I would say yeah look
at it maybe more next week or the first
week of January and see if there's maybe
more reports of more people returning
but yeah if I got it in the box no no
that goes back right away I go down to
the Apple Store and put in for an
exchange yeah maybe if you're giving if
you're about to gift somebody it just go
ahead and like rip rip rip it open and
just take a look at it and this may
sure it's okay in Ireland actually
there's a six year warranty period
travel problems so there definitely
won't be any issues returning those
people buying them in Ireland not in
Europe it's two years so yeah shouldn't
be any issues yeah Oh neither of you
guys have this iPad do no no mostly a
Samsung in huawei pad tap tablets uh
okay yeah okay I'm using from class but
that's different
oh there we go yeah I'm using I'm using
a maple gecko right now you know during
this podcast maybe given my technical
difficulties I'm gonna perhaps change
that for exit we also have a little bit
of uh we have a little bit more Apple
muse and in this particular case like so
I mentioned while wait for a hot second
but I just want to mention real quick of
the May 20 Perot using the in display
fingerprint reader clearly we have some
trends going on in Android where we
still have things like fingerprint
readers they might be underneath the
display they might be on the back like
with the pixel three which I'm tethering
off of right now but as of course when
it comes to Apple they had done away
with the fingerprint reader they've done
away with touch ID as they had called it
but apparently the European patent off
with up yeah excuse me the European
Patent Office
publish some pen applications from Apple
that included an iPhone that had both
face ID and touch ID now this is
honestly a really interesting prospect
because a lot of Apple users a lot of
iPhone users in general we're really
upset to find out that touch ID was no
longer going to be a part of their
beloved smartphone mm-hmm so any
thoughts from you guys here about a
potential touch ID return animal I'll
let you start on that one first I think
um I I think I think the way that they
would probably do that if they were
going to do them some way would either
be scratch the bezel this thing and go
right okay return to forum people didn't
like it or whatever are an in display
fingerprint sensor which i think is the
more unlikely thing that they will do
the only thing I will say is the
technology isn't there yes in my opinion
I have the one plus 60 I'm not a farm
problems are you having with it I just
like I think well I think in one plus
this case I think they've actually kind
of gone and said you know this is the
cool new hip thing to do we're going to
implement it and I just don't feel like
it's fast enough at least one day of
used I know that make twenty pro friend
of mine has that and he says but even
still like one plus six finger but that
was extremely fast was ridiculously fast
yeah like probably the best I've ever
used and I ever raised a phone to the
one plus sixty I've mixed to us is the
fastest out of all of those the 1 plus
sixes I think one plus we're trying to
force it out the door just to say we
have it and I feel like Apple isn't
going to do that I feel like this will
be something we'll see next generation
or even the generation after but I do
think they would probably want to
implement both especially for like
payments and such well I think that the
the finger parameters on the rear of
pretty much any smartphone that we've
used has always been they've yeah
they've always been very reliable so I
keep thinking myself like why why why
try to break what's already fixed or why
you know like if it ain't broke don't
fix as well trying to say
I'm Richard importing it there yeah I
would see them in introducing it as the
new feature of it you have the fact that
the fingerprint reader should be in the
back yeah I mean I'm looking at the
photo right now of I believe this is the
10r and the why not make an in display
okay okay in display a fingerprint
reader technically means that underneath
the glass so what if you put it
underneath the glass on the back of an
iPhone underneath the Apple logo oh that
would be nice actually that we a smart
use of the logo yeah yeah yeah I think
that would be perfect and just think
that's exactly where like it would be
needed for economics yeah I think they
should just do that so Apple you know if
you're watching no yep yeah I'll wait
for my check in the mail yeah how about
in terms of like doing away with touch
biometrics and moving the face
biometrics do you use face unlock a lot
so speaking of one plus sixty and where
Adam kind of led us into that when I so
the oneplus has one of the fastest for
locked you know devices on the market
and now it's not the same as what we see
on the May 20 Pro with the 3d unlock it
says as far as securing biometrics there
it's hard it's hard I had I had the the
the iPhone 10s Max and even the 10
switching over to something where I have
to look at my phone every time I wanted
to unlock it or do something and pay
with it it became kind of a company just
it wasn't it's functional I ended up
relying more on the pin but it's the way
we're going every phone now has it I
mean everyone except for the pixel
devices but that's beside the point
it's one of those things that I think we
need to just accept the fingerprint
sensors need to get better of course for
them to be under the display or
underneath the glass the way we have
them but having both of them on the same
device and having it being an Apple
device I don't know so I'm hopeful but
I'm also kind of seeing that Apple never
really goes back in things right when
they didn't do something they've never
bought me the headphone jack went away
we never saw it coming back so I'm
thinking this may also be just in case
they wanted to cover themselves or MIDI
me or maybe this is like a lower end
model of some sort I'm not sure it's
hard at Apple just generally never goes
backward so if they've taken it away
they're done and as you saw with this
lineup with this year it's gone yeah
Apple take us away never give us is
gonna be the silhouettes and they're in
their commercials and at the end of it
it goes Apple taketh away
paycheck number two on its way to you
all right so shifting gears we're gonna
go from Apple and go over to a company
that hopefully we're gonna be see a
little bit more of at CES which is
obviously around the corner Adam I know
it's a little bit difficult for you to
make it out to Consumer Electronics Show
TK are you gonna be there in couple
weeks
oh yeah yeah no I got there on the fifth
and hit the ground running yeah I mean
we are stuff start ahead of you can see
yes right I mean we're we're days in
advance so yeah I'm hoping to be there I
know I think Jaime's gonna be there and
I'm assuming you're going as well oh yes
I mean I'm right I'm registered under
pocket now well I'm next da so yeah but
yes yeah I think we have we have some
more people
from xdh portal side all right say chief
editor Michelle is gonna be there as
well with us so awesome okay so this
might be a phone that we would be happy
to see there now whether or not this is
going to be on the floor F CES remains
to be seen but Lenovo has just announced
or rather made light of their z5 pro GT
855 edition it's a long name give it to
Lenovo for that one but not only is this
going to be the one of if not the first
commercial devices out there with the
Snapdragon 855 it also is going to have
and here's a trend that we're we're
really we're getting the guys we're
getting close to the high double-digit
numbers in smartphone ram 12 gigabytes
in this yeah okay yeah so I mean there's
a lot to like about the spec sheet on
this I mean obviously you have 12
gigabytes of RAM you have a generally
bezel list like like minimal bezel
display it is a Super AMOLED display in
this case it's a full HD Plus display
and also the battery is at 3350 milliamp
hours so you may or may not be happy
about that
but yeah it's a it's also priced fairly
well the max on Varian is at the
equivalent of about 638 US dollars which
variable it's breathable for a brand new
first of its kind with 855 yeah yeah
we're just off the heels of the
Snapdragon 855 announcement a couple of
weeks ago the Qualcomm text on it so any
thoughts on the 855 in one and one oh
wait
Jules just corrected me a real quick but
it looks like that this phone is also I
might have missed this detail it's a
slider phone apparently everything okay
that makes this render make a whole lot
more sense but yes it is a slider phone
it's so funny I didn't see the word
slider at all the in the right up here
but that's even better I adore slider
that the fact that sliders are returning
so yeah let's add that to the mix it's
not dragging 850 512 gigabytes of RAM
and of course the lighter that is little
by little
I think I think it's so Mike so after we
went through the entire list of them I
only gripe with this entire specialist
other than the fact that obviously it
looks awesome is what operated yeah but
it's still Oreo I mean it it's only 29
being come on gotta give us some pie
holidays with while being the first with
an 855 so typically we've seen mean
we've seen things like that at CES right
we've always seen like the first version
I think QVC is we've always seen like at
least one manufacturer that releases
some cool tech like the in display
fingerprint sensor the pompe are from
last year remember and 20 CCS of 2018 so
I think it's really exciting to see
something this cool from Lenovo is it is
it going to be the be-all best device
that we're gonna look at well obviously
we need to try it out but from what you
guys covered Josh you and I may from
from the summit I'm really excited to
see the performance benefit and actually
in a device because you guys got to see
like pre-release stuff so as a consumer
or even a prosumer or even with XDA I
would love to be able to just try it out
and see the comparison is it really that
noticeable and specifically again we're
running an Oreo it can you really get
the benefit of the 855 running there or
do you need the optimizations of Pi to
be able to get some of the main benefits
there so I would love to play with it
I'll hopefully get some hands on if they
do have a sample with on the floor but
I'm excited 8:55 I can't wait for the
for the new Onslow of a t25 to come in
so the 855 one of its biggest biggest
additions was the fact that it has I
think it's three times faster AI because
they saw the qualifier way was doing
with the mpu and stuff for like AI so
they were like okay let's make our own
AI chip and they fit up in there and
Android Pi has a lot more AI based
features like you have the adaptive
battery they have the app actions slices
all that kind of stuff so I'd say that
the real benefits will come from PI even
just in terms of efficiency so Oreo see
that's why I find it weird
that yeah when you went like ended and
then it says or I'm like come on really
really say you you got you got upset at
Oreo I I was right before you there
where it says euy 10 and I was like okay
yeah so it's the base right because at
the end of the day really some of the
main benefits out of the new chips that
needs to be with the software right I
mean you can oh shit
Lambo but you know if it has an engine
of a Pinto it's not gonna work the I
think it's still a good move
I'm pretty sure they can push out you
know pie pretty quickly alright this may
just be a typo maybe by the time it
actually hits the market it will be
running PI yeah
Jules actually had the exact same mind
as me and you were talking TK about how
CES generally has historically there are
a couple of manufacturers that come out
and say well the first ones check it out
and I still always remember the year
that the ill-fated Li Eko brought out
that yeah and they remember that one
yeah Jules was pointing it out in the
chat I was like I will always remember
that because I remember everyone
scrambled for it everyone was trying to
get that phone trying to get it on
camera
and sure enough like not only was it the
worst-performing 820 fun it was also
from a company that eventually would not
even will not even be around anymore
yeah we're getting dangerously close to
all of these manufacturers just straight
up saying you know what you wanted this
we're putting it in we're getting you
the the the Sony 48 megapixel camera
you're gonna get 16 gigabytes of RAM
you're gonna get a 4k display like I
feel like we're gonna eventually get
time yep it's a little bit it's a little
bit uh terrifying if you ask me like
what one smartphone is going to cause a
singularity forget with a I yeah yeah
you get you getting really you get
really scared if we go to CES one day
and you start hearing rumors of the
singularity phone it just turns out to
be the most powerful device ever made
it's gonna be hilarious but I wonder if
any one of these manufacturers is just
gonna go balls to the wall with it and
and just go go all in and I mean Vegas
would be the perfect time to go all-in
right
no but I think it'd be hilarious all
right so TK you you flashed out a pixel
yeah go
are you 'yes 'cimmanon no no so that's
that's like my biggest beef about the
fact is because they're supposed to be a
dual SIM device but one of them would be
an ECM right and you supposed to be able
to use the East him in there but I tried
contacting a posh I used t-mobile mostly
but I tried contacting them and I
couldn't run it it wouldn't work on my
account really okay so what was the
story that we're talking about right now
is that t-mobile launched and their
Eason for iPhones for ifox so there are
a couple of plans made specifically for
the iPhones that of course support ECM
so the t-mobile used to map the app yeah
that you have to use to set it up
it supports two regular use plans you
have a $40 prepaid one and you also have
this 21 day tourist plan which i think
is pretty awesome like if you if you
have an iPhone 10s or a tennis max or
ten or visitin or do you soon or just
the 10s I think it's the the 10s I don't
remember they attend are having that
Jill how can we correct us well it's
definitely in the 10s so if you have the
10s and you come and you go to and
you're from abroad and you come to the
u.s. you can go on t-mobile and try out
the isom have that it's kind of an
interesting touristy travel type of hack
I owe the XR that the 10r does so I I
usually East them on the pixel all the
time so she went traveling and TK you
and I we've been to China a bunch of
times
oh yeah project fly has been saving
sorts god-sent
oh my god it's when I talked to you that
one time before my trip I was like
totally different experience than my
first trip to China like as if I was
back home so yes no definitely thank you
yeah so yeah so you Sims this is the
thing like why I'm over here I think
Jill's already answered the question in
the chat in his own way but the answer
to the question why would t-mobile only
really
for iPhones well of course as Jill says
everyone's going iPhone like that's
that's always going to be the position
right so I guess I would ask you got why
do you think but why wouldn't t-mobile
like support this on say the pixel which
was the first phone to do something like
a nice and popularize it I'm I'm
flattered yes so we just carry your
branding I think at this point right
because for the most part they don't
really carry the pixel and they haven't
really aimed like their association with
the pixels kind of a few years ago they
used to give you a discount to bring
your pixel over to the to their service
and I remember like was the original
pixel they gave you like $300 credit on
your account and I think there was much
better integration there I'm not sure if
it has something to do with the fact
that they don't officially kit you know
support the pixel even though it's just
a GSM connection but they've typically
done that in the past like even when
they release their digit service they
released it on the iPhone first before
they supported Android and I think it's
more of a compatibility thing it's
easier I mean not that nothing against
Android but because of the fragmentation
of the system that were the ecosystem
that we have it's simpler to develop for
iPhone and support a you know a certain
series of devices and release that first
and then work at adapting it over to
Android not to say that every Android
device has isom its limited amount of
devices that support it you know but I
just feel like that may be just a gut
feeling less support what we have on
them on the shelves right now and then
we work on whatever we can ask people to
bring over it is also very and leading
on from your fragmentation point the
GSMA so basically at the head of like
connectivity and all that like your man
was saying before that the big thing
they want to avoid when bringing in the
ECM standard is fragmentation so they're
doing it very carefully and very slowly
and that's why partnerships are so slow
to roll out because it says it's a lot
more complex so I'm wondering if that
ties into it at all because of the
ubiquity of iPhones in the US and the
sense that they're all very very similar
so I can also plan I would I would have
sooner expected
I would've sooner expected to put
something out like this because they're
so like in there in the iPhone pocket in
a way
think even more so than them t-mobile
honestly but Jules is also pointing out
that the only plans that you can use
with the ESM right now and team over
with iPhones the prepaid plans so you
know as exciting as it might be you know
I prepaid plan if you're not really into
that they're not even putting an effort
to support postpaid plan people like
yourself to get know it's exactly enough
and I've been with them for quite some
time it I it's it's right now it's not a
big issue for me because for the most
part a lot of our devices still support
duals you know to low standards you have
the ECM and the standards them and but I
know at some point that I pretty sure
manufacturers will find some reason to
say they needed to slot that space that
the sim card takes that they need to
basically remove that to add some type
of feature and then we're you know all
ECM and I think it's better for us
because it helps us saves us from having
to worry about some card degradation
over time and it just makes it simpler
for us and then maybe you can you know
make space for SD cards again first if
that ever becomes a standard again I
think but I think that the number one
thing I take away from this is that the
isom standard is not a standard like
it's definitely not and I would love to
see the evolution I'm looking farther
ahead in time now but like I would love
to see the evolution of the Eason become
that you could have like I know it's not
really a thing in the US but you can you
can have like three different carriers
on the same phone you just hot-swap
among all of them you may not be getting
full dual sim or Trice and capabilities
obviously but yeah at least you can
switch between yeah like let's say if I
had Google Phi and I wanted to use my
verizon to use them and all of that
that's kind of like the it's kind of the
holy grail in my opinion because you
didn't really even yeah exactly
even right now I'm using Verizon's LTE
so I'm using that in order to do this
podcast I would not do that if I was on
fire on here because then I would be
paying $90 next month yeah okay great so
hopefully the Isom will become a bit
more of a standardized thing in the
future but for now it is an iPhone
tennis tennis macsam yes it does say
here 10 R so yeah I mean if you are on
t-mobile or if you're looking to try it
see mobile and you have a 10 s you can
try out with the with the prepaid SIM
plans
now on the other hand if you have let's
say something other than an iPhone
maybe something from you you see you
might have different time in this
upcoming year because apparently there's
going to be well maybe or maybe not a
new version of HTC su flagship phones we
have talked about this once or twice
already on this show that we may not be
getting necessarily the next version of
the U but we might just get an evolution
of the existing new products that are
available right now so
HTC Taiwan President Darren Chen said
that the company will evolve this year's
you 12 plus into a 2019 version for the
premium market nothing said about au 13
which I guess you know that would only
make so much sense but refuting the
claims of the company is getting out
from that focus area so we do have other
devices around the U 12 line you have
things like the U 12 life which is the
mid-range device which I have to say I
actually quite enjoyed personally I
thought that for the price that it was
and for what I was trying to do it was a
very reliable everyday phone but of
course HTC of course has a lot of other
properties in its portfolio including
things I provide pro and the wireless 5
focus so it's not as if HD we talked
about all the time but it's not as if
HTC is just going to go and disappear
anytime soon they definitely have their
their hands and enough cookie jars that
they can stick around the blockchain
phone yeah as Jules is pointing out the
blockchain powered Exodus one that
actually sold out yet they think that
your mother's very Darnton is very proud
saying that it's so light very yeah so
there's definitely they may not be at
the forefront of our consciousness but
they're definitely Skrudland they're
like they're like they're like they're
like scrapping in the back so it's it's
great to see the HTC is not gonna be
going anymore time soon but any like any
thoughts on we should be seeing a
flagship from them maybe they should
just like move into these other
properties these other markets and just
focus on them is it more of a
survivalist tactic at this point like
how do you feel about HTC
against 2019 HCC's yeah so for me HTC
will always hold a special place I've
started off with HTC back in the old
days and I've always appreciated what
they offered and they do I mean they
have they have good hardware it's not a
question of hardware anymore the cameras
have been fixed and things have been
getting better but this may not be a bad
idea this this may not be a bad move for
them just to see basically how the
market doesn't 28:19 right in the early
2019 so maybe update the UU 12 and give
us something a little bit like that and
then maybe the you 13 you know surprise
surprise comes in the second half of
2019 but something to the effect of you
know staying in the forefront stayin in
them in the mind of people at least keep
talking about them is not a bad idea I
don't think they should move out of
hardware for smartphones I think this is
a market that they should always stay in
but they need to just be consistent and
you know figure out what they want to do
quickly don't don't try to do for the
lack of a better word the you know what
LG was trying to do a few years ago with
you know the whole what to the release
went to release it I think they just
need to stay consistent and you know
make sure they work and they provide
what they're providing you know at a
reasonable price that's the other thing
that I hope they consider if they're
going to focus more on releasing like a
2019 version of the Utah plus or
whatever it is that they also mentioned
that they want to focus on their mid
ranges you pick it hopefully shave off
some R&amp;amp;D costs if they're just basically
redoing the you 12 plus they're not
saying back to a drawing board we need a
new phone they're saying we need to
improve in our previous phone exactly
which I think could help a lot and then
as well the mid-range devices yeah they
said they want to focus a lot on those
which I think were a bit more reasonably
priced than they're flagships not hugely
more reasonably priced but they were
better so I mean I'm worst-case scenario
hitch is he always has their V or market
that they can fall back on like valve
has been pushing them hugely for PC
gaming and that's been very successful
so I mean they'll always be around
whether it be smartphones virtual
reality or our blockchain yeah Jules has
a bit of a worry in our cha here that
this might be another reboot for the
company but you can only reboot so many
times I mean
but I do agree with you guys in the
sense that like figuring out what does
how best to evolve an existing product
might be better than wasting all of the
money to make a new one only for it to
flop later in the year and I completely
agree with that it's and I also think
it's a little bit better than let's say
the Sony approach which is like what are
we about these xperia x 50 premium max
whatever everything compact like Sony
every single year just puts out yet
another phone and just keeps it going
it's almost as if it's almost as if Sony
is the reference design of Android I
mean even years ago like even with the
original iPhones are one of the iPhones
couple years back I remember Steve Jobs
talking about Sony phones being an
inspiration and then like I think Sony
just in general has always been an
inspiration to om sure at the ears and I
don't know why eautiful design and day
you know it's something about when you
hold a Sony phone I've had just you
always feel it's a different experience
they have they have an app for basically
the detail level the design the
aesthetics
I remember my z2 when it first came out
in the US on t-mobile that was just I
loved that phone
it was water-resistant great camera
great hardware it just looked unique it
just that premium feel something about
Sony no other manufacturer doesn't it
tries to copy that personally you know
what I will give Sony some credit I did
this every single year around
Aoife I give Sony this much credit
they're the first manufacturer to look
at the Snapdragon processor of the time
and say enable it all turn it all off
turn on the super-slow-mo turn on the
the a I turn on the face-tracking turn
on all of the things that Qualcomm
announces but put it into an actual
usable device first like just oh yeah is
they do come out with certain features
that may not necessarily land but you're
right as far as I get all they
definitely give you what is intended to
come out because you don't always get
that
yeah exactly all right great so you know
best of luck to HTC in the upcoming year
if it's a you 12 plus maybe you'll see a
review of it here on pocket now and over
on XDA as well okay so we do have one
more story before we get into our break
I got a question
the no this is not this is not the best
story okay but I'm just curious over an
ex-dea land how do you guys all feel
about the Cydia app store wasn't you was
it used at all like is this because okay
what we're looking at here is the Cydia
app store apparently had a security
vulnerability that caused the developers
of that particular application to just
shut it down completely like it's we
always talk about like I guess I can
reap it or rather pivot my question to
you guys as XDA fellas third-party app
stores how how much do you recommend to
users who come to XDA to use stuff like
that because here we have a third-party
one less pay for iOS and all of a sudden
it's got this huge vulnerability that
caused them to just shut everything down
the media well one thing I was just like
stairs well quickly did yeah I'm the
Sorek who runs as he said that the
payments are being shut down they're
gonna leave it up but it means like paid
up repositories and stuff that we're
hosted through Cydia will basically die
but Cydia as a whole will still exist
just true whatever means they leave it
off he said he's earning enough to pay
out of pocket to go for server costs so
it's not a big deal but as for like
third-party uh repositories as a whole
obviously you get pirate piracy ones
what named them Adam is only the dark
tipper on this podcast them try to take
Google to court but anyway asteroid for
example the open source market I think
is a brilliant idea
because if you're going with Google
you're going with this whole proprietary
like service base that runs on every
Android phone out there more or less and
you're bending to Google's will where
you then have to pay like the twenty
five dollar fee or whatever and then
you're giving them part of your
earnings which is something that epic
games took issue with Y with F droid
they're an open source like a provider
to run on any Android phone all the apps
on there have to be open source of like
everything released no changes between
the compiled version and the source is
given so I think there's two sides to it
that on iOS is a bit you wouldn't get
that so much I was like cuz it's already
not an open platform as such like
Android is but I think it's good just to
have that little bit of fragmentation
just to say like to say it is an
alternative well it's good that soraka's
able to figure out exactly where the
vulnerability lied because it is in the
payment system and obviously you don't
want to have your user's account
information as part of the vulnerability
and not only that about it's also about
making sure that people aren't
purchasing things that they didn't
purchase so there's obviously that so
they have to be but but you're talking
about like third-party app stores in the
sense of Android but in when it comes to
iOS you know you have the of course you
have the the App Store which is in which
is itself a walled garden and shouldn't
there be more room for other places to
you know because we used to have
jailbreaking
but now we now when it comes to iOS like
it's kind of hard to actually get a
little bit more open I mean obviously
iOS is that necessarily an open source
software but you know any a it should
there be other app stores to not really
contend but to just open up the
capabilities of iOS to its users I I
think so competition will always bring
the best out of I know any environment
that you put it in as long as it is
there's a way to be able to trust the
competition and make sure that you're
getting the right type of software so
for us even I mean we talk about Android
I mean even XDA right we have XDA labs
that's one of our biggest things we
provide you opportunities for developers
to get direct access to consumers and we
don't you know modify it it's something
that we provided as a service but what
you know on iOS is just I think most
people most the average user on iOS
would probably not know what Cydia is in
the first place and I think that
the main concern so it's the enthusiasts
on that ecosystem that will probably
start looking for secondary and tertiary
basically app stores sorry for the sound
in the background there oh yeah or you
could just be like TK and mitigate all
this by having a landline I do have a
black box but ya know I think honestly
competition will always be a little bit
better and I'm gonna hang it over to
Adam real quick to shut this phone off I
think I think you have a great point
though that there should be a little bit
of that I mean in Android we we
certainly enjoy that freedom and the
fact that there are other resources
because there are some cases where
obviously some applications come out
that are not fully pushed out let's say
they're not they're not ot8 all the way
to my actual device so I can find that
there is the the app somewhere else that
I can download side load and be able to
get it so it's that kind of freedom that
I think is great no youyou were like dr.
dabba Dabba dude I could be wrong could
be 90% I'm pretty sure it's a hundred
and I think that's brilliant thing to
have just to give like developers kind
of this incentive even just a stray away
from the Play Store a bitch
just because if you're if you're humming
over all that control to a company you
get similar to apples like ecosystem
where it's just like it's all in one
place if they ban you or remove your app
that's it you're gone like you have no
recourse yeah that's fine all right okay
well that will do it for our mean
stories or rather our new segment for
today we're gonna go ahead and take a
small break here we go
oh my gos my camera again geez I've been
I've been reset this thing so many times
I gotta figure out what's going on with
that anyway okay so let's go ahead and
pop into this
the PocketNow weekly comes to you with
support of caseta by Lutron today I want
to talk to you about casita by Lutron
smart lighting control
brought to you by Lutron pioneers in
smart home technology with casita
you can schedule your lights to come on
at dusk so your family always comes back
to well at home and you can make it
happen with the power of your own voice
casita is in touch with the most smart
assistance from Google assistant to Siri
to Alexa and it connects to the most
devices including thermostats from nest
smart bars from Sonos and much more you
can control exactly how bright you want
your lights to be with caseta smart
dimmers in fact our producer Jules
recently bought some LED strips and
connected them to casita so he can
control their illuminance for all out
raves in his tiny apartment or Moody
Blues for those jazz sessions cuz you
know if you ain't got that swing and
don't mean a thing and casitas got that
swing you can have your smart lighting
just as simple by getting it the smart
way with caseta by Lutron search for a/c
ase ta or hit up Lutron calm that's
casita by Lutron welcome home it's a
peace of mind all right okay barring any
more technical difficulties we do have
our main segment but i want to check in
with you guys like Adam this is the
first time that I've ever met you I want
to ask of you to just give a quick like
we're gonna do we're gonna get deeper
into this in a second but I want to get
to know you a little bit more Adam so
you're you're actually based out in iron
I'm using 4G because my home in CH that
can sustain a video call
oh and also I do computer science at
college and I really like technology so
that's a terrible basement well it's
good to have you on and of course we
have TK as well I just want to make sure
we give our shots to our our guests
again today cuz yeah like every single
week we have like we have an email chain
where we talk about like who's gonna be
on this week and what topics we're going
to talk about and will that fail there's
always hi may saying well
if I'm here as in home under this more
than likely he's like I'm not sure if my
Internet's gonna be good or he might be
traveling because Jaime travels even
more than I do
it's crazy and then you have Brandon who
you know yes he's got a family and every
now and then you might need to go off so
I'm glad that we have such a short list
of people that we have a short list of
great people and thank you guys so much
for being on
so TK I haven't talked to you in a
little while like how have things been
on your end I've been busy busy I've
been keeping busy at the end of the year
just focusing on my channel trying to
rework some stuff with also on the XDA
side on the YouTube side we're trying to
bump up our production there and yeah
just keeping it busy I I love staying
busy that's my main thing in life I I
find that if I just sit there around the
house and not doing something even if
it's not productive I just feel like I'm
wasting time so trying to end 2018 with
a bang and start 2019 with an even
bigger one so yeah I'm right there with
you 2019 hopefully is gonna be like one
hell of a year are you excited for CES
coming up like is it are you jazzed
about it
so we experience here yes and a little
bit differently right so we get to see
different parts of it there's the floor
there's the behind-the-scenes and so on
and it is exciting as as the best way of
your day starts so early in the morning
and the end so late but you're doing so
much stuff you're looking at so many new
things you're talking to people you're
working with people and you get to meet
up with your friends that's the other
really cool thing about CES for me is I
get to see you know we get to hang out
we say hi I'm a with you all the other
guys so for that part alone definitely
that's the best way to start a year and
you know just work it and see what's
coming up so I'm really excited and it's
great it's also them it's pretty close
to us that's really the nicest thing
right it goes so far like it's not like
Aoife with it like a 13-hour flight so
we could just you know I could for me
I'm driving so I'm gonna be driving over
there and so it'll be nice it'll be nice
and I'm getting in there right after a
little break so it'll be good no awesome
yeah right and there's something like
CES crept so much closer to New Year's
so it's like yeah you're hungover and
now you're recovered go to CES and don't
get any sleep yeah yeah exactly
I'm just for it as well like I'm glad
that you know obviously there's this
there's this new home that I have with
with you guys
and with the weekly that allows me to
still be able to come out to all of
these things and and to have those
resources I my thanks for that so only a
couple of weeks away from CES so I'm
really looking forward to that you can
of course look forward to a lot of to a
lot of coverage but I was mainly going
to say we're going to have some awesome
weekly content so we're gonna do a
podcast out there we can actually get
you like face to face TK for perhaps
yeah yeah and in Adams case you know
maybe I mean obviously the better one
for you will probably be what Barcelona
or like MWC or you feel like if you were
yeah maybe yeah maybe we'll see you out
there at some point but you know we're
getting a little we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves
CES a couple of weeks away but just days
from now literally for if you're
watching this live right now
four days Merry Christmas everybody and
we're so close christmas time is here
happiness is here I'm just singing the
song at this point but we do have a bit
of a segment today because we already
talked about gifts that we would give
people in our lives that we may not have
already gifted or we are having a little
bit of trouble figuring out what to give
we gave a lot of we gave a lot of
suggestions last week about that we've
already gone through a bit of a year and
look at 2018 giving a bit of a thought
about I remember that was the episode to
a michael fisher where we talked about
what our favorite devices of the year
work but now for today.we there was a
bit of an idea to do something of a
secret santa
which when this idea first came out i
was like how are we gonna do okay
so we're not necessarily going to be
gifting each other in this episode I
don't know I can't even imagine what the
shipping costs would be to get to you
out of the mail it's in the mail it's in
the mail trying to get in on the control
man yeah so what we thought of is uh
there's gonna be like a Secret Santa
type of debate thing so what we're kind
of doing here here is we're matching a
smartphone to somebody because if you
were to get a Secret Santa if you
to be a part of one of these traditions
or one of these one of these Pursy one
of these scenarios you would get the
name of somebody that you have to get to
know them a little bit in order to
figure out what gift to get them of
course they don't know that you're going
to do that so you have to be kind of
stealthy and sleuthy and figure out who
they are and figure out what gift will
be great for them unfortunately for us
we don't really have the luxury of all
that so what we have here is we're gonna
do a bit of an intro of ourselves
talking about ourselves for a little
while
non-phone related and then the other two
people in this three-person chat are
going to debate as to what phone would
be best for that user we're going to
figure out what secrets had a gift smart
phone would be best for that so 30
seconds I'm gonna go ahead and figure
out everybody just get like a timer up
here so do do so we're gonna do 30
seconds we can put that on the clock
opens a lot of gaps you're talking about
yourself what not relating to phones
though dude right that card man okay
isn't it that that's that's one of my
biggest existential fears that I cannot
describe myself without saying phone I
[Laughter]
okay I'm not even gonna get into this I
was gonna make us I was gonna make a
self-deprecating joke but I think I've
done that on this show
alright we're going to just make sure my
camera is working okay
Adam you're gonna go first I have 30
seconds on the clock and I'm gonna go
ahead and just I'm not gonna be like
stop but like I'm gonna let you know
yeah that's it I'm not gonna say 30s
this is not a debate we're not gonna
treat it like that but Adam it's perfect
like I said earlier this is a perfect
time for us to get to know you and this
is a great place to do it so 30 seconds
on the clock and I'm gonna go ahead and
hit go right now I'm 19 I'm a computer
science student I spend about 4 hours of
public transport daily I go out quite a
lot like the friends and stuff
I play a lot of games made me
counter-strike but so not much of a
mobile gamer I like tinkering with my
devices so like watches and stuff I like
music
I like like watching movies the bed or
TV shows whatever so that was about all
right that was about 30 seconds you went
22 seconds before you said the word
device so that sounds pretty good this
is an awesome like social experiment all
right
TK you're first - yeah yeah you actually
got 30 seconds to think of a phone or a
gift or something that would match the
19 year old at 19 I I was already blown
away the moment you said that at the
beginning of those 30 seconds all right
just make sure I was working again one
sec no no yet the cameras yep there we
go
so oh I did it again sorry when any
cancer go for it
okay I'm gonna hit go right now okay
so what I would probably recommend it
just from based what I know about Adam
so I Anna and I we've talked before
we've hung out before so I kind of have
a we've met before so for me I would
probably say if I have to make a
recommendation would be the me mix three
and specifically the me mix three in
green not in blue in green and I think
that would be a great device that he
could not only use it for great pictures
you know good battery quick charging
wireless charging but all the
specification that I think it would
definitely fit into his lifestyle of
what he likes to do on his devices and
you know he can also tinker with it
later when he's done you know enjoying
the original operating system all right
cool so that would be 30 I have 30
seconds on the clock so given what I
think would be a great phone and I'm
gonna go start that right yeah oh it
didn't even I missed a button guys sorry
I'm gonna start right now I am going to
do the thing that I think most gifts do
which is a complete like it's not the
thing you're supposed to do I'm gonna
I'm going to inject some of my
experience into your gift so it is
mostly about you but it's also a little
bit about me you said that you're not
much of a mobile gamer so I would
actually try to introduce you to the
world of mobile gaming while still
fulfilling the rest of what you
set so something like the razor phone to
actually will probably be one of my one
of my main gifts to give that way you
have all the media that you want and you
also have the ability to try out mobile
gaming and on my end of being something
you're really into okay so there we go
so we have about a minute now to be able
to talk about to be able to talk about
these choices and what what they would
like we think and I can basically debate
at this point yeah that's essentially I
was gonna say this is the point where
yeah but start talking especially okay
so so I like the approach I like the the
razor phone that's a good touch you're
right it's a great gaming phone
I love the aesthetics of it but I the
way I looked at it from the sense of
what we what we're looking for sex I'm
all round or right the the me makes a
great phone from the sense of design you
had an opportunity to play with that one
and I got a chance that that's one of
the only experiences I've seen and
hopefully I'll get mine next week but
the overall experience I think that
mimics would provide is just a tinkerer
experience and I think the razor phone
although a great gaming phone you could
still get a great experience out of the
Munich's especially because of the
hardware and software combination that
you get out of it and what I found so
interesting though is that you said the
me makes three which is a phone that's
not widely available and I was like that
something that that is neat specific so
the reason why I said that one is the
other reason is that one's actually
coming out next month from what I
understand in in the EU and it just
started actually release it was released
in Hong Kong and yeah that's true the
into the EU market and the tinkering
stuff I can definitely support you there
because yeah me you I or yeah you I
anything like that
mmm-hmm so a lot of tinkering there I
guess I was thinking of tinkering more
on the surface level and thinking gank
Nova and everything like that but of
course gaming is what I wanted to like
inject into it so alright so that would
really winner yeah I think you would
definitely with the gaming but it
depends on what I Adam likes really yeah
yeah you can now this is I hate to break
it to both of you but I actually have a
mix and I will admit I much prefer the
two
over the razor foam - because the razor
phone twos battery were great I I'm the
camera is not that good
however the razor phone - is a really
good choice because I have been enjoying
that specifically for watching Netflix
so I have the mix 2's which I use my
daily driver and I'm gonna get home
because if I only have one as a daily
driver because I'm spending so long
commuting I do need the longer battery I
can't I can't fault you once so so that
makes three yeah yeah it being basically
yes I can't fault you I can't fault you
for that at all because I was actually
thrown I already had my my my answer in
mind and then one TK said Munich's three
hours I crap a full screen also I mean I
can't deny that slider phone that's just
it's just a joy to just snap that thing
back and forth alright cool
all right so juice is going to take care
of the timing for us so he'll just he'll
just let us know when the time is up so
I'm not about hitting it or any more so
what we're gonna do then is ahead to a
we have 30 seconds on the chat clock
let's call it 30 seconds tell us about
yourself TK okay I'm a dad and I I love
running I love sports activities
outdoors I love spending time with my
family I love catching nature in any way
either be it in person or through other
mediums I love things that are
functional in life I love things that
have dual purpose I don't I don't like
things just to be good for one thing if
it's gonna be good for me it has to do
multiple things and it could be
something I can carry with me all the
time so I try to have I try to enjoy
life as much as I can
behind the screen and in front of in
front of a screen and behind the screen
that's the best way to describe it mmm
okay so that's time so I'm I'm up for
the first response okay I think that I
would actually think of the eye
had Pro 2018 because it's sort of the
now you said you love to capture life
and it may not be the most it may not be
the most the best way of capturing life
with a tablet on the camera on the back
of the iPad bro but it would be one of
the best ways of experiencing the
pictures that you have already gotten of
nature of your kids of your family on
the iPad pro which is one of its main
functions but it's also just a it's a
sleek device that I think you would be
able to throw into any bag that you can
bring with you it may not be as portable
as a phone but it's also invaluable
compared to a phone because it gives you
that big canvas and the performance that
you might need in order to connect all
the parts of your life together I think
that would be my 30 so I mean I know you
TK and I know that you just like having
things work while also you know you like
Android so I would probably actually got
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus simply
because if you have a family it's got a
great camera batteries decent it has
multi different features it's a it's
kind of ridiculous and I think just in
general for your use case it's good
enough and open enough that you can
modify it and decently do what you want
with it while also just having it work
having it there for like taking nature
pictures whatever being with your family
take pictures of them going on the
internet doing research looking up
anything you need at any given time so
I'd say yes I'm close alright so we have
our crosstalk time right now you meant
you mentioned about getting into Android
and customizing and all that stuff but
on on the iPad pro you have things like
Cydia oh wait but yeah the I think that
I think that the iPad pro personally is
more about like the consumers that the
just consuming the content that he might
already have all of the tools that it
needs in order to capture nature in
order to capture I was sort of working
under that I don't really like assuming
but I would I would think that he
already has a camera to be able to take
pictures of his kids and of nature and
whatnot and then a place to be able to
consume all of that media to enjoy it
but also to be able to edit it on the
fly without having to rely on a very
small screen now this the reason I
always think about the iPad pro okay
that's actually pretty fair but I'm
mention something about one like being a
dyke the port of
of having the s9 + as a phone because
it's got a big enough screen for
consuming content and stuff and you can
do basic video editing on like on ds9
plus I don't imagine TK would really
want to be doing like massive video
editing of this phone so I figured
whatever there is probably good enough I
I do agree with your points though I do
you see where you're coming from but I
think the s9 + would probably be better
or the s10 plus whatever Lightroom iOS
that's all I'm saying
that's true that's true they are getting
at first but yeah so is it my time to
come back - to answer both of you now go
for so my first answer my second answer
ah there we go
this is we're picking things you have
already I'm not trying to copy Adam I'm
not trying to guy I don't know when you
is hype at Pro 2018 so that one I
definitely would love to be able to play
with if I have to choose between the two
I will always favor portability for from
the sense of it so - to your point Josh
you're right I would for me to take
pictures like the really best pictures I
can take with me would be from the a7 3
that's just an amazing camera and it's
great camera but there's the lack of
portability right whenever I'm around
with my family we're out in nature I'd
love to take my big camera but at nine
times out of 10 I end up taking the
smartphone so for the sake of not
looking you know how you doing and we've
all seen that I probably would give it
to Adam on on the on the s9 plus it's
definitely one of my top top phones of
2018 if I had to put like at the top
three this would be the number three
spot for me it's a very nice solid
performer and runs 1ui beta so
definitely a winner in my book which is
surprising me is what I'm doing right
now I'm updating on you I know okay cool
all right cool so I'm officially over -
and but perfectly fine like I said I go
a little bit outside of the room a
little bit I inject myself in it a
little bit we got it we got it
textbook narcissist right it's totally
alright so 30 seconds on the clock for
myself when this is great I have 30
seconds to talk about myself after I
just called myself a textbook narcissist
okay so okay so I am a tea drinker first
and foremost it's probably it's probably
the thing I do the most throughout the
day I always have a bottle of money like
the one I'm going to show right now I'm
always drinking tea I'm always trying to
stay healthy health is very important to
me as a type 2 diabetic I'm always
trying to make sure that I stay as
healthy as possible but it's also a
mental thing for me as well one thing
that I want to do in 2019 is try and get
back to things like meditation and to
get back in some mindfulness I sound
like a typical California hippie right
now but that's really where my mind is
so health and wellness or big things for
me have a go okay and this is great
because I'm saying those things and
normally for somebody to hear that they
would look at health and wellness
products but I'm saying and knowing you
have to look at devices and tech Adam
you want to take first or you want so it
goes after now I'm mainly going this is
also kind of influenced pace of me
talking to you for the last hour being
the factor that's the first time I have
I would kind of say the Razr like for in
terms of like being able for
recreational activities like because
obviously and kind of like just
recreation and being happy I feel like
for media consumption than gaming that
the Razr phone is a perfect phone it
doesn't sound like you're much of a
photographer from your phone ID I could
be entirely wrong but yeah I just think
for media consumption and such I think
the Rays are so I'm just yeah cool I
can't respond you know this would be my
part so so from fought from from talking
to Josh from seeing Josh a few times I
realized one of the main things that I
think you would definitely appreciate
and the reason behind that is because I
think this will fit your your life
independent regardless which way you go
I would say is the Garmin Phoenix five
who as smart weights basically yeah yeah
not yet so my thing would be a
SmartWatch were basically an accessory
to your your lifestyle something that
can be augmenting your wanting to go out
do exercise being mindful of where you
are tracking your activities being able
to help you just get all your
information and the beauty about it is
it's independent so it means it doesn't
really do rely on a smartphone so you
could be an Android and iOS iPad even I
think this would work great for you and
I think it would be a nice little
accessory to keep you know something to
switch around from the other
smartwatches that you use throughout the
year all right
crosstalk time might be a thing would
really just beat a SmartWatch I think is
good but I mean like it's good for like
fitness that was what I was trying to go
for yeah yeah but the one thing I would
say is it doesn't have many uses its
side of that like it's not like a
universal product like when I was going
with you I was thinking well yeah the
iPad would be great but I'm also
thinking from the sensors but you also
need a phone are like it needs more kind
of functionalities yes no exactly it so
I went with the so it's hard to get
recommend the phone for Josh because
Josh gets to play with a lot of phones
right it's kind of like the guy that has
all the all the toys you can't really
put a phone there so I felt the the
health angle that I was trying to go
with was something that would work just
something to help him augment now Garmin
makes great watches there's a lot of
other accessories that are on the market
also that would help did and so on so I
think the approach to augment any
existing phone he may choose to be with
so in a way both of our gifts would kind
of make a perfect example for him that's
that's the other reason why I kind of
went with the watch you know if he
decides to go with both he'll be happy
now watch him pull out a Garmin and uh
if your turns out you know what I have
to say like I wish I could but I've
actually never tried a Garmin
I really have not you gotta talk to
Jaime talk to Jaime he could not talk
enough about that stuff
are you kidding okay what's gonna happen
is if ever there's a garment in the in
them he's going to just grab it and say
mine yeah so yes but I okay for the
sheer fact that it's it's absolutely new
to me then I would pick the garment I
don't know what capabilities it has in
terms of mindfulness and wellness but I
do agree with you Adam that even in
there's this first now we did just meet
and you are not entirely wrong that
clearly gaming is something I enjoy and
it's something that I do to decompress
you're absolutely right with that so the
razor phone to is a phone that I what's
funny is it took me a long time to
review it because I kept playing with it
I think I could never actually use it as
an actual phone because I kept there was
just this absolute bliss and just
playing games on it so you're absolutely
right there um you also also tapped into
a new thing with me that I am a vlogger
so I try to have devices in order to
take pictures into then to shoot video
and whatnot but if my phone is not
amazing at it like the razor front to is
that then of course you're right I do
plenty of other devices that will help
me all of that including the camping
right now I'm using the g5 for as a
webcam for crying out loud so there you
go it's just the camp link that I'm that
that's keeps bugging out right now it's
bugging out even more right now i but in
it yeah i think that the garment is
definitely like between the two it makes
the most sense for what I said in the 30
seconds but also for the fact that I've
actually never tried one before so I'd
be really exciting to do all right cool
so this was this was a nice experiment
yeah yeah yeah we know a little bit more
about your you know your co-host that's
good
yeah we got you know this was this oh I
did pick one of yours it was the garment
yeah especially for the associate for
the fact that it's absolutely new to me
I think the garment would be amazing um
especially for the the health stuff
finding it work great with GPS tracking
and Matt are you offline and it just
they've been knocking it out they make
really great hardware yeah I'm always
looking for other I'm always looking for
new like health products and whatnot
yeah there you go Jill said yeah just
because it did sound like you know what
you know what actually makes the perfect
sense I'm just gonna shout this out real
quick cuz I don't know if I'll ever get
a chance to talk about this on the show
this ring right here the aura ring I
don't know if you've ever heard of it
but it's a sleep tracking smart ring so
like if you wanted the people on it if
you wanted a product that actually
encapsulates Josh Arikara and then that
show it's this right I feel like I'm
even I mean yeah it's a great product
I'm gonna do a video on it at some point
but I don't know when I'll be able to do
that cuz the tracking takes weeks to
establish a baseline and then you can
figure out how it works after that but
in any case I hope everybody is staying
as healthy as possible in this holiday
season thank you so much for doing this
little secret santa thing with us it's
interesting because we had every form of
Secret Santa it'll be oh that's my best
