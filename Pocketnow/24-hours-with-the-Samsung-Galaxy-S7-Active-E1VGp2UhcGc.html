phase with a beast
I mean hey first impressions are
everything but if there's one thing that
rugged phones are never apologetic about
is looks I'm high net event with pocket
now and we just spent 24 hours with the
galaxy s7 active
to be fair rugged phones were never
meant to be pretty if anything the idea
is to serve a purpose and that's to
become a handy tool as the driller the
wrench that you need to get a specific
job done at nine point nine millimeters
in thickness the galaxy s7 activism
beast of a phone it's padded borders
into a product design to take a beating
but even as commanding as it is you'd be
surprised that good looks actually made
the package the border has a sharp
finish that exudes high-quality
craftsmanship so much so that you might
think twice about beating this phone up
the Camelbak texture feels very grippy
and softer the touch as well
to describe it through an analogy this
is like strapping a very expensive than
permanent case around the galaxy s7
though as the average TV infomercial
would say but wait there's more Samsung
has added an extra layer of protection
to the sheet of Gorilla Glass 4 at the
top in addition to side rails protruding
ever so slightly that layer doesn't
really seem to affect the visibility of
the gorgeous 5.1 inch AMOLED panel at
all even though I do notice that it
holds on to lint more than the average
smartphone no worries though it doesn't
affect the famous always-on mode that
comes standard with every galaxy and
looks just as gorgeous on this display
as well the setup process comes standard
as with previous galaxy s7 units we've
reviewed there are some subtle changes
like the new blue blocks that AT&amp;amp;T
included you also get a new chime on
startup oddly though this phone didn't
give me the option for marshmallow
restorers from backups so you pretty
much have to use tap and go whether you
like it or not this is the first act of
galaxy to include a fingerprint scanner
and fingerprint recognition is rather
snappy as you would expect the startup
then greets you with a lot of bloat from
DirecTV that you can easily disable and
options to define what you can do with
the action button that's at the top left
from a simple press to long press to
even a double tap once everything's done
you're pretty much greeted with a
standard galaxy s7 TouchWiz as here the
theme stores here a lot of AT&amp;amp;T
also here we'll have a full comparison
with a galaxy s7 coming soon but so far
in the software Department everything
just seems intact the general theme
after a first few hours of usage is that
this is pretty much a galaxy s7 which
says a lot since previous active
variants always included some sort of
compromise and paper you'd even consider
that the active is a better smartphone
than the galaxy s7 but usage is what
really will determine what's better I do
prefer the clicky navigation buttons as
opposed to capacitive but these don't
line up at all which is rather sad
you'll be happy to know that game
launcher does the activate them
something that's rather convenient since
they do protrude the casing expectations
are high as from the whole industry on
that 4000 milliamp hour battery go in a
standard galaxy s7 is no slouch my first
experiment using it for 24 hours
non-stop after everything was installed
hasn't proven to be great though so far
I've managed to scratch some 4 hours of
screen on time which is what the regular
galaxy s7 reaches though more testing is
required and yes fast and wireless
charging do come standard as well I must
clarify I do believe that the problems
with the battery have a lot to do with
me being a lot on the phone during this
first 24 hours and I will admit that
call quality is rather great and even
though I've heard complaints about the
speaker I haven't found any actually
Internet addiction sounds scary right
but we live in a 24/7 information age
where we use technology for both work
and what beta speeds are also
surprisingly well so don't worry the
casing won't make anything any worse now
one of the things that I'm really
looking forward to is taking this phone
on a hike for its camera the other day I
actually took the standard galaxy s7
because I love that peace of mind of
having a water-resistant phone with me
but I will admit that I was worried the
whole time about dropping the phone and
just destroying the back the galaxy s7
active should be the perfect solution to
that especially because it used the same
camera technology of the standard galaxy
s7 and overall I have to admit our
tests have been amazing so far for the
first 24 hours our first impressions are
rather positive I'm the first to
complain that instead of thinning lights
I want a thick and powerful smartphone
and this could probably be my next daily
driver so far in paper the galaxy s7
active is nailing that dream that I've
been looking forward to but more shall
be revealed as we compare it and then
fully review it over the next few days
