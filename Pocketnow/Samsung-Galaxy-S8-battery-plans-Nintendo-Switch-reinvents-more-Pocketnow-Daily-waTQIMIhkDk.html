game console with its new nintendo
switch samsung looking into even using
major competitors to fix its battery
problems and even the pixels will suffer
from software updates at a certain point
in time I'm hi Mary betta and you think
that Google a software company would
know how to make its customers happy oh
well this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with much
expected rumors set your calendars for
October 27 Apple has already sent
presentations for an event to happen and
even though most people are assuming
that all this has to do with the mac
sense the macbook pros are due for a
refresh for the longest time and we
should expect a new macbook we're also
waiting for a refresh to the iPad pro 12
inch so stay tuned there could be even
more other official news have to do with
let echo the company has a made a big
splash in San Francisco but it's a bent
and it's an ounce of you products but
the one we care about more is the LT pro
3 mainly because this is the flagship
Snapdragon 820 one processor device that
a lot of people have been waiting for
obviously that is not the only product
and not everything about this device is
perfect you can learn more in the link
in the description and we cannot wait to
tell you more in our review house will
the spotlight over to Samsung for those
of you that are wondering exactly how
desperate the company is to change
whatever problems its head with
batteries well there are some trusted
sources that are claiming the samsung is
looking into even competitors like LG
and this is a big milestone mainly
because if there is one company that
does know how to do batteries right as
LG LG gained a lot of Fame for its
battery technology with g2 for example
with that tiered design that it brought
which we even assume that Apple has been
taken advantage of with its recent
macbooks so yeah let's see what Samsung
and LG can collaborate on and for those
of you to think that buying a Google
pixel will make things better when
compared to how Google has handled Nexus
devices that's actually not going to be
the case Google is only guaranteeing two
years of software updates for the Google
pixel two years is usually the life span
that people keep devices but think about
it that's not the case of iPhones
known people that are still using iphone
4s iPhone 4 s's and Apple supports
devices much longer so yeah two years
that's what you get sad and finally the
very hot news that they have to do with
a company that just became part of our
scope Nintendo not because of Super
Mario runners-up romario jump I think it
was but because of the new Nintendo
switch the company wants to reinvent the
concept of the game console and they're
actually wanting to make this game
console which is a desktop console into
a typical gaming portable console where
you can unsnap the controller snap them
back again you can use them separately
this is probably the most versatile game
console that we've ever seen it is great
it is extremely cool and probably the
only thing that I don't like about it is
to have to wait for it until March to
any 17 but anyways it leads me to the
question of the day do you think that
this Nintendo switches what the company
needs to finally regain the popularity
that it had years ago in my case I do
believe so especially if the company
brings the old titles along for five
bucks apiece leave us a comment down
