design that lacks a home button
Samsung's Galaxy s7 might be much
thinner than its predecessor and Google
Maps just got smarter about navigation
I'm high metairie that I'm wondering
exactly when are we going to start with
the iphone 8 rumors this pace this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with google the company has
just pushed the one of the probably best
updates that we've ever heard for Google
Maps emerson street view because now if
you are currently navigating from one
point to the other you can actually
search for things within your route
meaning if you need to go to the
bathroom you need to go get some to eat
you need some feel even get gas prices
for options for you to deviate from your
route and that not affecting the fact
that it knows that you are in route
somewhere else so this is a really cool
update that should be pushed to android
very soon and then hopefully will reach
iOS at some point as well and given the
fact that the state of wearables doesn't
really take fitness seriously I'm
looking at you pebble and Android wear
well polar thought that they take a stab
at it polar polar they did some really
great heart rate monitors and while they
just launched the a 360 which is the
most horrible wearable that I've ever
seen but it does include a heart rate
monitor in addition to everything else
you get from other wearables obviously
without the great operating system that
we get with others the price tag is a
rather good and the links of this trip
you'll get more details on
specifications but then again yeah
hopefully other wearables will catch on
to this this is very interesting Samsung
has just launched a new 20 megapixel
camera sensor that is supposed to be a
million times better than the current
one and that is a tall order so hear me
out here first of all it's manufactured
by the 28 nanometer process not the 65
of the current sensor meaning this thing
will actually be significantly smaller
and thinner allowing for phones without
a camera hump which is great it's also a
20 megapixel sensor that will apparently
do a much better job at capturing color
than the current one which again is an
extremely tall order galaxy phones take
great photos so far and yet you get 20
megapixels instead of 16 that we
currently get with galaxy phones so when
those Samsung Vince
this was for the galaxy s7 yeah we can
bet that this is for the Galaxy S sub
let's move the spotlight over to apple
and talk about two different things
number one Apple music those of you that
are wondering exactly how successful
it's been after the trial not so much
apparently there's only a third of Apple
music paid subscribers compared to
Spotify subscription services and yeah
Spotify has been in the market for a
while but then again you had a choice
right now and people decided to stick
with Spotify which is a tall order a lot
to say but even more interesting for
those of you that are waiting for the
next generation Apple TV me included
apparently it will be available by the
end of this month meaning there are 10
days left so it should be available soon
and finally the very hot news of the day
or should I say analysts predictions
have the iphone 7 including new things
number one sapphire carolee Apple has
figured that out number two apparently
apples 810 processor will be all about
battery life and this is kind of
interesting as Apple has done a great
job at improving battery life and its
max but it's at a terrible job on its
iOS products there's still the same over
the last few years which is not
necessarily great but to finalize that
when it seems that apple will take the
cues of removing the home button from
the iphone 7 to you know take advantage
of force touch technology and that does
leave a challenge for such ID in
particular which has people speculating
already if it's going to be on the side
like Sony Xperia or at the back but hey
it leads me to the question of the day
if you had to choose which is your
optimum position for a fingerprint
scanner do you consider it best on the
side on the front or at the back in my
case I haven't really tried it on the
side but I would say that I feel that
that is the optimum position it would be
in the power button but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
what you think friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get videos
earlier before this video was filmed
machine follow us on pocketnow.com
structure youtube channel as well and
follow me on twitter hang on just go to
be better on instagram at hind every
better please give this video thumbs up
