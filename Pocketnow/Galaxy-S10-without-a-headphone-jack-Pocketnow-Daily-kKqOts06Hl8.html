Galaxy S 10 that might make you lose
some interest Qualcomm is hard at work
to bring as an even faster wire and
wireless charging next year and if you
are on Verizon and one of the razor
phone to it seems that this just got
fixed I'm Jaime meta Rivera and how
about if we just skip all the bad jokes
and just celebrate the fact that it's
Friday
this is parking out daily the official
news today beginning with the iPhone 10
R which launched today our review unit
just arrived to our own Taylor Martin so
expect some content very soon but the
interesting part was that well it didn't
make anybody go crazy Tim Cook was in
Milan he was there for the launch of the
store and there were no lines even
though I'm in cheek will predict that
this was gonna be the phone that would
sell the best for Apple and it could
just be the pre-orders went great we
don't know exactly what that was but
we'll get some numbers soon funnier is
that there are no cases for this phone
like Apple cases for the iPhone 10 are
there aren't you have to buy third
parties so that's weird
now let's talk about the oneplus 60 as
we're just days away from the event do
not forget to register for the
livestream as it's gonna be awesome it's
happening on Monday and well there are
some rumors on the pricetags
it seems that at least in the UK it's
gonna start at $4.99 which a lot of
people were speculating that it was
gonna get more expensive but apparently
it's gonna be $4.99 for the entry-level
529 and then 579 so if this is true I
assume that the prices are gonna be all
or the same or nearly the same whatever
the case may be we do expect a minor
bump at least 50 books so don't go crazy
over that rumour and for those of you
that are looking forward to the razor
phone to an hour on Verizon yes the
phone launched without certification for
it but it is now confirmed that the
phone is fully compatible with Verizon
this is awesome I mean I've been using
the razor phone on and off ever since I
was waiting for the final software
update to actually be able to give you
the full review and I see my impression
is extremely positive stay tuned for
that content yeah Verizon is now
available now let's talk about Qualcomm
as a company definitely innovates in a
lot of the stuff that we care about like
charging and wireless charging
apparently the company is working really
hard on bringing as a faster version
of this for next year so we're hearing
that it's gonna make a jump it's from 18
once the 32 watts when it comes to the
wiring and for those of you that want
wireless charging it's gonna make a jump
from fast wireless charging at 12 to 15
watts even though I think that there are
certain cases where 15 watts is already
available I could be mistaken correct me
in the comments if you do but yeah it
seems that there will be something
faster but I wonder exactly how adoption
is gonna be cuz quick charge for Plus
has existed for a while and only the
razor phone has it which is weird and
finally the interesting and kind of
underwhelming news do they have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy S 10 at least
when it comes to rumors we've heard that
there are three phones that two of them
will have curved displays and triple
cameras and everything and then we've
heard that there's gonna be another one
that's not gonna be curved that's only
gonna have a single camera and that's
gonna be pretty much the entry-level
variant of the s10 for those of you that
don't want to pay a lot of money but the
interesting part is that we hear that
the headphone jack is not coming on
these phones or at least to one of them
and this is interesting I mean I love
the approach from Huawei where you've
got the may 20 and the may 20 Pro and
you've got the may 20 X and you can
choose what features you want and the
headphone jack I wish you have the
ability to have all three phones with it
I mean I don't know why not let us know
in the comments I mean what do you think
this this disappoint you I mean Samsung
has pretty much thrown so many
criticisms at Apple for killing the
headphone jack and now they're doing it
like really leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know what you think
