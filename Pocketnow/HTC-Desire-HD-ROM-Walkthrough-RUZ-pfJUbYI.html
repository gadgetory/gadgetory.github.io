pocket now calm recently HTC unveiled a
new version of its Sense interface for
Android to debut on the HTC Desire HD
which comes out this fall there's a lot
of new changes a lot of changes that
they didn't even talk about in this new
run we've got a copy here of the ROM and
we're going to go through all the new
features right now let's get to it
so right now this is running actually on
an HTC hd2 it's very easy to use and it
also works very well the phone works
Wi-Fi works pretty much everything works
I'll put a link up in the description if
you want to try it for yourself I'm sure
this will be on the Nexus One the Droid
Incredible you name it any Android
device in just a few weeks once the
developers get their hands on so let's
talk about this new version of sense
it's very different starting off to
customize the interface you press this
button in the bottom right corner and
then you get this new screen which very
well organizes all the different things
you can do to customize the interface
before you just got kind of a dump of
widgets and folders and things like that
but now you've got pretty much action so
here show your favorite content on the
home screen with widgets app open any
app with one tap so they really make it
easy for people especially new users to
understand what to do here's something
they did not talk about you now get
skins in the HTC Desire HD so we've got
the blackboard skin the woods skin so
this is for people that don't like this
curved design on the bottom let's choose
the slate theme this one's actually
quite cool so you click that by you wait
a minute and then you get the new skin
and also there's a button to add more
skins from HTC Sense comm but that site
is not up right now so you can't really
do much with that so quite simply what
we're going to get is a few redesigned
elements this clock has a slate look to
it as does down here and some other
screens also take on this slate like
look which you'll see through the rest
of the walkthrough let's go back to the
personalize screen we can now change the
scene which is a set of pre-configured
widgets but now it's kind of 3d it's
really cool so you can flip through and
say okay well I want to have my social
scene so maybe you turn this on on the
weekend I don't have my work scene
perhaps this is good if you're traveling
on business and the play let's go to
play and also you see the get more buff
it's another way to go to htcsense.com
and get more scenes presumably ones that
people can upload so here we are going
to get the standard the standard play
theme which adds a variety of widgets
and albums we're going to revert back to
the first one just so I can walk through
some particular widgets that are new
okay so there's a new change to the
notification area which is awesome
fast app switching so before an Android
if you're in settings and then you you
go into say messages in order to switch
between applications you tap and hold
the home button and you use the recent
apps switcher to go to another program
well in the new version of HTC Sense if
you pull down the notification area you
get an iPhone for like task switcher so
this is just another way to sort of
switch between two different
applications or three different
applications it's kind of reminiscent of
the old Windows Mobile recently used
list that was up in the Start menu which
is really nice to have okay so let's
talk about some of these new widgets so
over here on favorites favorites now
integrates with social networking so
I've got my Facebook and Twitter plugged
in and down here we can see John Rhett
enger' is going fast and if you scroll
down further you can see if you have an
email from somebody there's a little
indicator there that implies that I have
an email from John and you get the point
from there so a new favorites widget in
the new version of HTC Sense of course
you can still do the pinch to zoom to
bring up this leap feature that lets you
go from screen to screen here this is
the friend stream so it's going to tap
into my Facebook and Twitter both at the
same time you get a little icon to let
you know which service you're entering
and so we've got this HTC Sense like
interface down at the bottom we can
slide to the right and slide to the left
and we get the continuation of that skin
the slate skin here if you remember the
stock HTC Sense skin has kind of bubbles
but here we've got kind of squares
okay so here's something new for the
email widget you actually get little
previews within the HTC Sense widget
which is quite nice you can read emails
preview them right from your home screen
without having to dig into the actual
mount application and to go to the mail
application you tap on the message it
will bring up the message
that the person has sent you and will go
back okay so here is the weather widget
really unchanged you can slick within
the widget to get weather for various
locations or you can tap on one
particular area and it will bring up the
weather in that area for the full-screen
update let's go back going the other way
let's see what we have so this is
actually footprints so this ties into
the location and I'll show you the pre
cached Maps application in a minute that
is really awesome and over here is a new
feature called HTC like this is for
application discovery Android has went
like a hundred thousand apps in the App
Store right now but how do you know
which ones to download HTC is making
that slightly easier with the new HTC
like application this is something else
they didn't talk about at their press
event but we're showing it to you here
so what you can do is flick through
featured apps or you could go down here
and go to most popular apps so you can
see Google Goggles is very popular Angry
Birds go over here to friends comments
kind of a social networking feature for
applications very nice we have downloads
over here and on the right is marked
items so HTC like is an HTC's new way of
showing you which apps are interesting
and so on and so forth and there is a
corresponding widget to that so you can
always see new applications on your
homescreen we're gonna remove that let's
add a new widget so should go through
the ones that are loaded here so we have
the widget application there and most of
these are standard a lot of these are
unchanged so we have the calendar app
which has a variety of different styles
but you've seen this before so we can
select that and here's the calendar kind
of has a squarish look because the theme
are using right now is square again tap
and hold we can dive into here and
change the widgets Facebook widget
Google widget HTC likes is the one that
we talked about a lot of these are
standard things that you've already seen
there are minor variations on a lot of
them they're improved a little bit
spruced up and in some cases you get new
layouts for certain widgets so let's go
back another thing that is new is a new
live wallpaper so if we go
- here again the personalise screen
we've got a wallpaper we can change the
live wallpaper - and by the way you get
this new 3d interface like you get for
scenes and for skins and this is a new
one it's called slideshow and it's not
going to work on this device because I
don't have any photos but presumably
pictures will sort of fly in onto your
home screen really cool feature here's
something else that's new once you plug
in your Facebook or Twitter when you go
in the notification area you'll see
something says matched contact
suggestions so from here it will suggest
who you should be linking to your
Facebook so it sees that I have a
twitter contact Adams Elaine and a
Facebook contact Adam Lang so wants me
to link those together very smart so
that throughout the operating system
when Adam calls I will be able to see
his updates in the now calling screen
really cool way to just tie everything
together and that was a look at some of
the changes in the new version of HTC
Sense for the desire hd they've really
taken the homescreen interface to the
next level here it's really great to be
able to switch between applications
through the notification area a great
use of space and all of the new widgets
and the skins and the 3d way to look at
scenes is really fantastic coming up
soon we'll talk about the locations
feature which preloads map data so you
don't get the waiting checkerboard so
that is a characteristic of Google Maps
mobile please if you like this video
give it a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
