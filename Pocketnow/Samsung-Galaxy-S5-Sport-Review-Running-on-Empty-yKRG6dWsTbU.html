which we reviewed back in April then
there was the galaxy s5 lte-a aka the
prime which we also reviewed and then
the beefed up Galaxy s5 active for AT&amp;amp;T
not to be left behind Sprint has landed
its own variant of Samsung's flagship
the galaxy s5 sport a very slight twist
on its predecessors marketed toward a
you guessed it sporty people so just how
fit is this Fitness phone for your
physical fancies let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now's
video review of the galaxy s5 sport the
most important thing to understand about
the galaxy s5 sport is that at its heart
it's a Galaxy s5
we'll explore what that means these days
in a coming episode of after the buzz
but for now just know that if you like
or hate the Galaxy s5 you'll feel the
same way about the sport it's only
slightly larger and heavier than the
stock s5 but its industrial design makes
it look much bigger and while it's
rubberized battery door gives it more
grip on the back it's totally smooth
sides actually make it more slippery
more difficult to pick up and there's no
shock proofing here to protect it when
you do drop it though we're happy to see
the usual ip67 water and dust resistance
carried over just so long as all the
battery cover snaps are secured around
front are the same hardware keys we saw
on the s5 active all of which offer
pretty good tactility and the 5.1 inch
AMOLED panel is capable of the same
extremes of brightness and not so
brightness making it probably the most
versatile smartphone screen we've used
and powering it all is the same
Snapdragon 801 processor backed up by
the same very capable internals powered
by the same battery pack that charges
from zero to full in about two hours
what's not the same is the software oh
it's still Android 4.4 shellacked over
with samsung touchwiz so you get all the
usual benefits of multi window Knox and
so on but sprint has loaded the sport
with more carrier bloatware than we've
seen in the States in a long time it
maybe ever
there are the usual folders full of
add-ons that carriers consider perks and
visual voicemail that's only free for a
month pre-installed shortcuts to
download eBay and I Heart Radio and a
bunch of other stuff a carrier portal
that bothers you with notifications and
a featured apps widget that does a
pretty good job of crashing for no
reason Oh in TouchWiz itself also
crashes on occasion this isn't a pic on
Sprint all carriers do this to varying
degrees there's just a lot in this case
much of it natch
is Fitness focused now the last time we
tried doing an in-depth fitness piece on
pocket now I spent the day in a very
cold kayak and nobody watched the thing
so we contented ourselves with a more
superficial pass this time and we still
found some pretty good stuff not the
Fitness wallpapers with cliched
motivational phrases those are pretty
weak but the pre-installed MapMyFitness
suite is pretty cool we especially like
the visual trail on the map for walking
running or biking and the audio coaching
feature seems pretty awesome too sprint
is also offering a year's free
subscription to the MapMyFitness MVP
program $30 value you can open the app
through their persistent pull tab on the
home screen which also gives you s
health
some health news and Spotify and by the
way Spotify also comes with a few free
months of premium membership but that
pull tab tends to pop up even when it's
not needed and we also get random system
update notifications even though no
update is available it's possible that
our demo unit is defective if it turns
out we're the only ones reporting this
experience we'll revisit the sport in a
follow-up Sprint's HD voice technology
is available across most of its network
now but we didn't have another HD voice
enabled sprint device available to test
with plain old cellular calls were fine
if a little muffled over our six day
test period and the speakerphone was
usually nice and loud as well in terms
of coverage Sprint suffered
significantly indoors often dropping LTE
in favor of 3G but it's never as bad as
the signal meter thinks it is we were
usually able to maintain calls and data
sessions with just one bar of service
and when we had a 4G connection speeds
were good that's important for sharing
photos among other things and photos
were exactly as we've come to expect
from the galaxy s5 great in daylight ok
in dim conditions not so hot in low
light battery life was also on par with
what we've seen before from Samsung's
2014 flagship if all that seems mighty
familiar it should one more time this
phone basically is a stock galaxy s5
with a few altered hardware specs no
additional durability and a very heavy
software suite that's a textbook case of
trying too hard the fitness and Spotify
promotional savings amount to just shy
of a hundred dollars in the best case
which is possibly why Sprint is charging
an extra Benjamin for this device online
compared to its non sporty sibling but
frankly this just seems like a case of
same but different if your life is all
about fitness and not much else this
might be the phone for you otherwise if
you want a galaxy s5 on Sprint you
should probably just get the real one
for a refresher on why check out our
full review of the standard and prime
Galaxy s5s and see how their bulky
camouflage compatriot over at AT&amp;amp;T fared
