pocketnow.com and this is a quick video
of the Pandora application on the new LG
Insight this is the first time we've
gotten Pandora on Windows Mobile and a
lot of people are excited Pandora
creates a customized music channel based
on the sound and the tone tonality of
songs that you input into the station
I'll show you it in a second alright so
let's go off into the Start menu and
programs and pendo is kind of buried
here in AT&amp;amp;T music and here it is
Pandora now when you use this over a 3G
connection that says this product will
use a lot of data and I'm gonna click OK
now here's something that's kind of
annoying the Pandora application is free
but for only one day if you want to use
the Pandora application it's eight
dollars a month on AT&amp;amp;T we just really
silly they should give this to you for
free I mean it's free on the desktop
computer or on a regular web browser so
I'm going to press ok here I've got this
is the first day that I've used it so I
have a full day left of using the
program
okay now I should mention that up here
it says tool radio tools a rock fan like
a heavy rock band when I first started
the application it asked me for a band
or an artist that I like and the idea is
that it creates a station based off of
that kind of sound so it's playing
Metallica right now and what I can do is
I can do a thumbs up or a thumbs down
depending on whether I like the sound
and if I don't like it then it will kind
of take the way that the song sounds and
not show me those songs in the future so
I'm gonna do thumbs down and you can
hear it right now in the background and
every time you do anything in this
application it takes a few seconds for
it to register and it's going to a
perfect circle next let's say I like it
but I don't want to rate it up or down I
just want to go to the next track and so
it says connecting and by the way the
sound quality is pretty good I plugged
in a headset it sounded like FM radio
which can be expected from internet
streaming radio on a mobile device
here's a song by tool called opiate I'm
gonna vote it up thumbs up it gets a
thumbs up I'm gonna move to the next
song
and here's Rage Against the Machine
which has a similar sounds at all it's
kind of a harder harder rock band and of
course you don't have to rate it up or
down you can just let it play and be
like a real radio station where it just
goes through and it plays songs while
you work out at the gym or you're in the
car or something like that so that is
the Pandora application and it's still
running in the background right now so
you can continue to do work on your
device while the music plays so that's
pretty much it for pandora radio on the
LG insight it's a good application it
works well it's just a shame that AT&amp;amp;T
is charging $8 a month to be able to use
it and that is it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
