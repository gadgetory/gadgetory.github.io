more powerful Samsung Galaxy s8 in the
works Microsoft is reportedly working on
competing against Chromebooks as well
and next bitch just took a sharp turn
into another companies Dominion
I'm hi meri behna and this t-shirt
doesn't actually do justice to the
amount of caffeine I need right now
this is parking out daily the official
loose today have to do with deals the
Huawei honor 8 continues to be one of
our favorite we can't even call that
thing a budget phone it is a really good
device and if you're in the market it's
currently at B&amp;amp;H for $290 if you go for
the 32 gig variant 340 if you go for the
64 gig variants and there are actually
gifts there that is a crazy amount of
deal that I would highly consider as
well the spotlight over the Windows 10
as well the company you know Microsoft
has made an amazing job with this
operating system but it seems that the
company wants to revive Windows RT to a
certain degree
instead of doing a terrible version of
Windows like you did with RT it seems
that it wants to do Windows 10 cloud and
if you're asking yourself why think
about the possibility of a competition
for Chromebooks you know Microsoft wants
to cover everything and that is actually
not a bad idea now let's talk about
Fitbit if you were unhappy with the
company acquiring pebble and acquiring
all other companies this holiday season
well it seems that its employees are
unhappy as well because as of today the
company has let go of 110 employees
because of its bad results during the
holiday season apparently the company
did not meet its goals and I hate the
fact that what companies like this do is
alecko of employees instead of letting
go of the managers that did not achieve
the goals you know the high level people
but anyways that's the way it goes
now let's talk about next bit since
we're covering bad news I don't even
know if I should call this bad news but
next bit has just been acquired by Razer
meaning that we should expect the
smartphone division from Razer which is
great but for me it's really sad because
I really do come in next bit for
bringing us one of the most compelling
smartphones of last year sure the
hardware wasn't great when it came to
specs I loved the design I love the
approach to soft
we're but it seemed it's what just
wasn't enough so anyways really sad for
this at least me hopefully we will see
something great coming from both
companies soon and finally the very hot
news that they have to do with Sampson
and the Galaxy s8 a couple of days ago
we cover the fact that I was extremely
disappointed with four gigs of RAM on a
Galaxy s8 mainly because the galaxy s7
currently performs terribly after so
many software updates nothing compared
to when the smartphone launched until
the point where actually don't use it
anymore because of that but it seems
that apparently there is a six gigabyte
variant apparently there will be a six
gig 128 gig variant available in the
market you know the problem is that
reportedly it's only going to be
launching in China and Korea and I
really hate that why is it that the dual
SIM variants don't launch in the United
States as other companies are currently
doing like our way it leads me to the
question of the day would you be willing
to buy the six gig 128 gig variant of
the galaxy s 8 in the United States for
Europe or in your region and how much
would you be willing to pay in my case I
would be willing to pay the current cost
of the galaxy s7 after the whole debacle
I think that it's the least that Samsung
can do but anyways leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
