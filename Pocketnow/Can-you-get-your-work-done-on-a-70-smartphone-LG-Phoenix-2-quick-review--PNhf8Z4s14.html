devices it's refreshing looking at a
super cheap smartphone we've seen
powerful technology slide into the
mid-range tier
so if similar improvements made their
way to entry-level prices the LG Phoenix
2 retails for around 70 bucks as an 18 t
go phone and for those curious you can
pause here to get a rundown on the specs
the Phoenix returns LG to a simpler time
recalling phones like the g2 though even
with a smaller screen and battery it's
still larger than the Eldar LG flagship
it's a nice feel in the hand grippy back
in those fake chrome edges which were
popular years ago and will likely
scratch up a couple of weeks after you
take it out of the box still we're
looking at a phone with a Qualcomm 210
chipset and 1.5 gigabytes of RAM
powering a 720p display on paper this is
a nice step up from where we were in the
days of Lumia 500-series phones that
said I don't know that I've ever been so
happy to see 16 gigabytes of built-in
storage and the ability to add a memory
card this tira phone used to be
notorious for very meager storage
options running Android 6.0 however this
Hardware struggles to maintain a fluid
framerate it's easy to see framedrops
sliding through the UI or pulling the
notification shade using a pattern
unlock occasionally you can swipe the
pattern faster than the path can be
displayed on your screen using the phone
it handles single tasks rather well
punching out an email replying to a text
message sending out some tweets tackling
the basics the phone is nicely
responsive when you give it one thing at
a time to focus on when the phone has
multiple services running however you
will encounter those situations where
the keyboard can't keep up with your
typing the 8 megapixel camera is
surprisingly competent in good light and
even indoor lighting situations we can
achieve functional images the video is
capped at 720p but again in a pinch this
is better than expected and certainly
better than nothing
the display resolution is more than
adequate for getting work done though
obviously this won't be an outdoor
sunlight busting champ and ditto the
headphone jack functional if far from
satisfying and the speaker is about the
minimum we would want for ringtones
alerts and playing some videos I mean
this thing can't even play Marvel future
fight now I'm just messing around the
Phoenix is absolutely fine for casual
gaming the weakest link here is the 21
hundred million power battery low
resolution and low-power hardware helps
but this isn't a run time champ 30
minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 190
Lux which is almost the phone's maximum
brightness drained 11% of the battery if
you're using this phone in more than
short bursts you will struggle to make
it to dinnertime so let's wrap this up
how does Android perform on a $70 phone
the Phoenix is a cute little device for
someone who understands the performance
limitations it's a cheap way to cover
the basics and - will serve as a decent
backup phone for those times you don't
want to mess up a nicer phone well rate
this is a poor solution for grandparents
though is there are enough little
performance stutters that you probably
won't want to explain to a frustrated
family member
we're very happy to see better screen
and camera specs start filtering into
the sub $100 tier but we're still hoping
to someday see an ultra cheap Android
slide through home screens as fluidly as
old cheap windows phones used to still
it's pretty tough to complain about what
you get here for a $70 smart phone as
