pocketnow.com I just loaded Ice Cream
Sandwich onto the samsung galaxy note
it's an unofficial beta but it works
pretty well and in this video I'm going
to show it to you so let's get to it so
again this is cyanogenmod 9 beta running
on ice cream sandwich fluoro 3 and
cyanogenmod will be coming out with a
final version of their software for the
galaxy note but it's not ready yet some
things on this do not work like the
camera for example and of course Samsung
is coming out with an Ice Cream Sandwich
upgrade for the galaxy note but that's
going to have touch was on it and you
don't want that do you you want to clean
and light most likely and of course
cyanogenmod 9 for the Galaxy Note will
bring that to you now things work pretty
darn well in this in this build things
are actually pretty fast according to
quadrant standard this benchmarks 3041
I'm skeptical of whether that's accurate
because with running a stable version of
ginger bear the Galaxy Note benchmarks
lower than that but if we go into the
web for example things feel pretty fast
and let's go into the app tray real
quick and just flip around we can see
that animations are smooth everything is
very very functional here we can click
and drag as you can see Wi-Fi is working
hspa+ is working and of course we have
some cm9 touches up here like we can
toggle on bluetooth and Wi-Fi we've got
some extra items added if you tap and
hold the power button and of course we
have cm9 s launcher trebuchet which is
not yet finished Joe leave I did a great
video covering all of this will put a
link up on the video now so you can jump
back and see what trebuchet brings to
the table it allows you to customize the
default launcher of ice cream sandwich
and really make it your own but still
keep that ice cream sandwich look and
feel so let's jump into the browser here
and we're going to go to pocket now calm
and see how things load so we've got the
Ice Cream Sandwich keyboard here of
course and we're over Wi-Fi so let's see
how fast this works really good
performance let's go down to the desktop
site
and the accelerometer works calls work
it's good enough to use and of course it
takes away TouchWiz TouchWiz on a lot of
Samsung phones is clunky it's very
graphic intense and it touches every
program email calendar some people like
it but some people like the clean look
of just Ice Cream Sandwich so we'll put
links and instructions on how to get cm9
beta which of course is an Ice Cream
Sandwich build onto your Galaxy Note so
all five point three inches of your
display can experience the android 4.0
point three goodness if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now
