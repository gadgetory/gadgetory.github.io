for in a smartphone for me it's usually
that I want an elegant phone that's also
easy to handle that's reliable to use
and that provides a great camera and
audio experience all these factors
surely sold me on the HTC 10 this was
hands-down my phone of choice in early
2016
and the perfect segue for my excitement
with what HTC has to offer in 2017 I was
very impressed of what the company
showed me back in January and now it's
time for our full review I'm Jaime
better with pocket now and this is the
HTC u ultra the sake of being objective
and since this isn't really a comparison
I decided to spend the past two weeks
with the U ultra as if it lived in a
bubble for a die-hard fan of HTC's
legacy the idea wasn't really difficult
but if I have to judge my time as if it
were a facebook relationship status
let's just say that it's complicated
like the f-150 that I owned at the turn
of the century the HTC u ultra is large
and in charge this is a beautiful phone
that turns heads no matter where you
take it there's just no way to ignore
how beautiful this reflective back glass
is and how elegant it seems from a
distance now part of the analogy but as
much as I love the visual aspect of the
f-150 that I owned I also feel the same
way about the U ultra the problem was
every time I tried to park that huge car
and let's just say that I have the same
problem with the U ultra this thing is
more than three inches wide and pretty
much more than six inches tall meaning
that you can forget about using this
thing with one hand and obviously the
footprint is not easy to handle on your
pocket anywhere either I don't find the
finish to be slippery which is a plus
but all that at the expense of this
phone being an odd lint magnet near the
camera hump and then a fingerprint
magnet everywhere else I highly suggest
you use the case that's bundled in the
box because falls won't really
thrown well and for those bezel Nazis
the 69% screen to body ratio might be a
source for complaints but it all goes
away once you fire up this display this
5.7 inch quad HD Super LCD 5 is
hands-down the best
LCD I've ever seen those fans of AMOLED
will be happy to see inky's blacks and
then insane punch in reds and blues
match this with a boom sound hi-fi
tweeter at the top and the woofer at the
bottom and this is seriously an awesome
phone for consuming content looking at
the raw file of a yellow flower we lose
almost all of the strengths I would even
go as far as to claim that this is a
great phone for gaming since the added
heft actually helps with that the
internals are also more than
well-equipped to the task we have a
Snapdragon 801 processor 4 gigs of RAM
and our unit has 64 gigs of expandable
storage our features missing from a
standard flagship er ip68 water and dust
resistance and why was charging but
charged 3.0 is here and great that it is
because the fact that this phone is
still running on Android 7.0 nougats
along with the meagre battery pack
that's included will barely last you
through a day and everything else HTC
Sense continues to be one of my favorite
Android skins
I love the elegant theming option and
how fluid the phone is the company has
managed to match stock Android elements
with its famous skin just perfectly and
it continues to avoid duplicating
efforts with Google which I commend if
you notice that I haven't yet mentioned
the secondary this way well it's because
I'm still trying to figure out its
purpose first I thought that it had
everything to do with the HTC Sense
companion but now that it's here I
almost feel compelled to turn it off
sure it needs to learn from me over time
and it seems that it needs more time so
far and I do know that it will make your
phone more efficient over time the
problem is when it starts suggesting
things that are focused solely on
consuming products like the sponsored
ads that I find on blinkfeed all the
time and that are really irritating in
my opinion smart phones are meant to
help you be more productive and the last
thing that I want is more distractions
from unsolicited advertise
it's cool if you get discounts like in
the case of whenever you buy a Kindle
for example but you're not getting any
discounts for this phone at all a major
high point for this phone it's HP C's
choice for cameras it seems that the
company has finally figured out how to
deliver a great camera because there is
no other way to describe it
we have a 12 ultra pixel shooter with
1.5 5 microns on the sensor oh I F and F
1.8 aperture I am just in love with how
this phone handles bouquet and macro
shots and the insane color saturation in
detail I also love that it's a solid
performer in low-light and with the
whole approach to the selfie I also
really like this whole concept of having
for ultra pixels when you want them and
16 megapixels when you don't and the
video is your thing then you'll also
love the spell stabilization and I do
love this 3d effect in audio it's just
awesome
so far this is one of the things that
I'm delighted about the most with the
HTC u ultra definitely the camera
experiences top notch overall we have
tried to be as objective as we can with
this review on its own the HTC u ultra
is a gorgeous device with one of the
best screens I've used and an awesome
camera combo
sadly the problem is that it doesn't
live on its own for a whopping 750
dollars you don't really get water
resistance its design is actually larger
than all of its newest competitors and
all the while dropping essentials like a
headphone jack and then the whole
argument of AI being essential to the
phone seems to be more of a concept than
anything after two weeks for diehard HTC
fans this will be the most beautiful HTC
10 youth ever own and that's really not
me mistaking the name this is pretty
much an HTC 10 with another chassis and
with lesser features and that's sad
because I really want to love this phone
but it's sadly too late for 2017
