and companies are increasingly looking
for ways to differentiate themselves
from competition maybe that's an
investment in cool new technology maybe
a renewed focus on design and aesthetics
for Huawei this year both tech and
design feel somewhat iterative but does
the collection of smaller improvements
in total raise this phone up above to
some of its parts let's take a look at
the Huawei p10 if it feels like we've
been discussing this Hardware for a
while now it's because we have the v10
inherits a lot of what we liked from
last year's mate 9 screen resolution
chipset Ram storage all shrunk down and
crammed into a smaller form factor for
those of us with Hobbit hands it's a
much easier size to use one-handed while
on the go just to touch taller and
skinnier than a galaxy s7 where the mate
has a phablet is something of a big old
truck always focus for the p10 is on
aesthetics and design this phone draws
some obvious inspirations from other
popular handsets rounding corners and
softening edges from last year's more
angular p9 bolder color options though
are appreciated as we'll be spending our
review time with the dazzling blue model
featuring this hyper cut back panel that
shimmers and sunlight but remains fairly
well resistant to fingerprint smudges
one of the larger departures from
previous Huawei phones the fingerprint
sensor moves to the front bezel it
requires more of a reach to unlock than
rear mounted sensors but it also doubles
as a one-stop-shop for navigation a
single tap is a back button long press
will take you home but the gesture
swipes to use multitasking is the
hardest piece of muscle memory to
reprogram going on week 2 with this
phone I still miss this gesture about
half the time I try it at any time
though you can just swap back to normal
on-screen controls sacrificing a few
pixels at the bottom of your display
happily we get another improvement tool
always custom software emui now in
version 5.1 you get options to swap your
home screen from apps to an app drawer
and the general layout for notifications
and settings is closer to stock Android
there's still a lot of customization
especially to things like confirmation
dialog bubbles but all the pieces are
generally where you would expect them to
be new for the p10 Huawei is promoting a
partnership with GoPro and the new photo
gallery app delivers improved tools for
editing and sharing
similar to some of the filters and
templates you might find in Google
photos or Instagram it's a fun add-on
for folks who like to share short clips
we get the benefits of Android 7 split
screening apps and alt tab style
swapping alongside Huawei's aggressive
resource management and garbage
collection our mate 9 is aging well so
we're optimistic that the p10 will also
perform well over time
speaking of performance we're still
impressed with this chipset Huawei's
Kirin 960 processor is a screamer just
nipping at the heels of the Qualcomm 835
benchmarks we've seen leaked and easily
vesting pixels and one plus three T's
with the Qualcomm 821 this kind of
horsepower is gross overkill for
covering the communication basics but
cranking up some graphics intensive
games the p10 drives titles like Marvel
future fight probably the smoothest
we've seen from any Android we've
reviewed at high quality radio
performance is very competitive for a
metal phone with antenna bands routinely
saw LTE performance falling just
slightly behind the galaxy s7 while the
Wi-Fi regularly reached farther than the
Samsung at the edges of my home network
now we'd be hard-pressed to see any
significant differences in camera
performance between this phone and the
may 9 know the module is Sun flush with
the rear housing we still have the same
dual camera system color and black and
white sensors with hardware image
stabilization on the color sensor we
won't be using this phone to dig deep
into a real camera review but for folks
interested in a deep dive our main 9
camera review will cover those bases for
you just fine we'll try to get our hands
on a p10 plus to see how it might differ
from this camera now on the whole these
sensors deliver some of the best still
photos we've ever seen from a phone and
improvements to video like h.265 UHD
files and image stabilization are
greatly appreciated
moving to audio headphone performance is
adequate - good again similar to the
mate 9 though with a wider frequency
response on 24-bit files and very subtle
improvements to noise floor and dynamic
range though disabling the headphone DTS
mode we see more EQ tweaking which the
user is unable to completely disable the
speaker performance is one of the weaker
links on this gadget performing well for
notifications but it's not going to
break any records for music and movie
playback
it's unlikely the p10 will make our list
of audiophile phones at the end of the
year but it gets the job done well
enough for most daily used situations
bluetooth users might also be annoyed at
how poorly this phone will hand off the
connection between audio accessories a
common gripe on huawei Hardware if I
have headphones connected and I get in
my car the phone doesn't automatically
prioritize the car for hands-free
calling battery life is very good for
this capacity during our streaming test
the p10 was well competitive against
current flagship phones this translated
to good daily run time making it to
dinner with moderate use and room to
spare for power users recharging during
the day is made a lot easier with Huawei
super charger a quick top off will
easily deliver hours of runtime after a
short stint plugged in so let's wrap
this up where does that leave us with
the Huawei p10 in a way this phone isn't
really getting a fair shake as the most
immediate comparison people make is
against the bigger brother mate which
only just made it to the United States
about a month ago remembering that this
is an update to the p9 nearly every
aspect of this phone is noticeably
better than last year's fashioned
flagship streaming performance better
battery life significantly faster
charging an involved camera system it's
admirable that Huawei was able to
package these improvements while also
playing with some new design elements
and focusing on fresh color options
there are precious few compromises to
make now we're expecting more phones to
arrive this year with rated enhanced
water resistance for example and it's
about time Huawei disclosed IP ratings
for their phones but while we wait for
Samsung to eat up the first batch of new
smartphone processors you can get that
power now in the p10 the toughest
competition this phone might face is
likely to come from Huawei sister brand
as we all wait to see what the next
honor might bring using these parts and
pieces until then the p10 offers a
compelling solution for folks looking to
shop something a little different
personally it's just nice getting these
features in a phone I can use with one
hand as always thanks so much for
