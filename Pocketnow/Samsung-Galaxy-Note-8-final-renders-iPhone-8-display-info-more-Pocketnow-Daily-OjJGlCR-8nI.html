8 are real this is one gorgeous phone
iPhone 8 additional rumors since a
screen resolution to have to waken no
touch ID that seems that LG wants to
kill it once again with the camera on
the LGB 30 I'm high memory Vetta and yes
once again we continue to try to get you
this video every day at 9 p.m. Eastern
this is parking out daily let's begin
today with official news and no these
are not just rumors that are not going
to happen once again yes Samsung has
finally sent out a software update for
the Samsung Galaxy s8 to support
daydream so instead of just using the
gear VR you'd also get to Google's
daydream VR as well as an option and
obviously it brings a little more
convenience than my experience the gear
VR you can learn more about it on the
link in description now about the
spotlight over the BlackBerry
particularly because the company has
just launched a new limited edition
BlackBerry t1 and well number one it's
not built by PCL even though it looks
exactly like the key one only it's got
darker accents it's got an extra
gigabyte of RAM and extra double the
storage pretty much and yeah everything
else is the same we just don't really
understand what the purpose of using
another om could be that could probably
also be the fact that we had those
screen issues with a key one but anyways
you can learn one description this is
Savi and India exclusive and how about
if we talk about the future LG be 30 for
those of you that didn't know we
actually use the V 20 a lot whenever we
need an extra microphone or whenever we
need an extra camera as that phone does
an amazing job but we hear that the B 30
is going to be even greater we hear F
1.6 aperture which is just insane
currently stuck at of 1.7 for two years
already so this is great innovation we
can't wait to confirm this is true we
will keep you posted Editha
now let's talk about the iPhone 8 we've
got some rumors from trusted sources
that claim this phone is actually not
going to be as large as we thought
apparently the display is only going to
be a five point one five inches diagonal
520 PPI the reason why is because you're
getting a boost in resolutions at 24 36
by 1125 which is great but then of these
rumors also claim to things like for
exam
no touch ID apparently that's there's
going to be this state-of-the-art facial
recognition service and there seems to
be also a tap to wait to help out with
that so whether this is going to be real
or not at the time hotel will keep you
posted and finally the hottest news did
they have to do with the leaked renders
of the Galaxy Note 8 provided by famous
tipster evan blasts we could probably
set these in stone if these renders are
real this bone is gorgeous a squared off
version of the Galaxy S Plus but with a
black accent on the camera that I feel
looks gorgeous in that gold variant that
we see in the league renders if this
design is going to be real this phone is
definitely going to be sleek but anyways
let's jump directly to the question what
do you guys think do you like this
design of the Galaxy Note 8 or not in my
case I just I have to admit it the phone
looks gorgeous let's hope it's real
infinity display everything is there
