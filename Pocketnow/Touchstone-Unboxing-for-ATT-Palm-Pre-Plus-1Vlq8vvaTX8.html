pocketnow.com and this is a look at the
touchstone charging duck for the ett
palm pre plus let's take a look so I
never had the opportunity to see or use
a touchstone it used to be an added
accessory that cost forty or fifty
dollars right now it's thirty dollars
but on AT&amp;amp;T when you buy a palm pre plus
you get the touchstone for free so let's
take a look I haven't opened this yet
and over here and of course this will
work with the pixi as well as long as
you have the back battery cover although
the plus the pixi plus and the palm pre
plus have the special back cover that
will work with a touchstone so let's see
what we get in here touchstone though I
don't know why you would need a lot of
instructions to use this pretty simple
piece of technology uses inductive
charging to not require you to actually
plug in the palm pre plus two charge it
so it's got a lot of weight to it's very
heavy which is good because it has a
solid base it's got kind of a sticky
sticky coating here that is easily
removable but it does stick and the idea
here is that the special battery cover
has some components in there that you
don't usually get in the back battery
cover so we have some components in here
that I'm not going to pretend that I
know how this works but it charges
through the battery cover through the
contacts and the context touch over here
and charges the battery so we have to do
is plug it in and yeah there we go looks
like we just have a plug in there so
I've got a plug over here sneak that in
there fits quite nicely and let's take a
look it's magnetized and there it goes
charging battery very simple just makes
for a more elegant way to charge your
device instead of having to bend over
and plug in the phone although I guess
that's that not too big of a deal but
pretty unique that you can just do this
and charge the battery without touch
from the court so those look at the
touchstone charging dock for the palm
pre plus you get one for free when you
buy
the device on AT&amp;amp;T that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
