things sold well and others didn't
Google's new material design has just
begun to make it to some google apps and
AT&amp;amp;T is teasing that Windows Phone 8.1
is just a few days away from your phone
I'm hi Mary meta and this is such an
irony that just one company is making so
much money while other companies aren't
this is parking out daily let's begin
today with the oddest official news that
we have covered in a while the HTC One
remix has just been announced and
Verizon this is pretty much the HTC one
mini to link to the scripture to watch
our full video review and everything you
need to know about this phone and yeah
it's great to see that the HTC One mini
2 is making it to verizon but the
question is why is it that it costs a
hundred dollars after a two-year
contract well you get the HTC One m8 for
the same hundred dollars after a
two-year contract verizon will most
likely discount something here but hey
just get the One m8 now one of the
things we praise the most from google
i/o was google's material design that's
their new design language and something
we should expect on their whole bevy of
applications coming soon and if you want
to go teaser what you're getting a
cycling google+ on android devices you
can also see on the Google Play Store as
it apparently is already pushing to some
devices as of now and yes takes a little
bit for Google applications to get
updated but stay tuned this is actually
cool and for those of you that were
wondering why carriers were doing such a
terrible job would suffer updates this
year that's sexually about to change at
least for Windows Phone as the company
has just teased in a forum on a question
that was asked in April that the Windows
Phone 8.1 update should reach the vices
in the next coming days between this
weekend the next so yeah you should be
waiting for this update soon and tell us
what you think in the comments down
below once it reaches your phone now one
very interesting bit for those of you
that are waiting for the Microsoft
Surface many to be announced you
probably should stop waiting microsoft
recently talked about it in its
conference call for quarter results and
according to them because of the whole
switch between old and new generation
surface tablets
apparently they ditched the new form
factor which is definitely the surface
mini and it could also be because of the
amount of overstock that they have right
now with the surface RT which is still a
problem though yeah we do understand why
Microsoft is so making so many changes
hopefully they will launch the surface
mini at some point no Glalie do so long
time and finally for the interesting
news of the day apple's quarter results
are in and those of you that are waiting
for Cupertino to sink in bankruptcy
that's not going to happen this is still
one of the most powerful companies in
the world the company made 37 billion
dollars in revenue which is a lot of
money and aside from that they made it
mostly from selling iphones 35.2 million
units compared to last quarters 31.2
which is great but the most interesting
disappointment was the iPad as they only
sell the 13.2 million iPads compared to
14.5 the same quarter last year and 16
points something for last quarter ipad
sales are down iphone sales are up it's
so interesting is we have so much
competition for iPhones right now and
they're selling a lot but then I pads
are down and they've been down for the
last couple of quarters and that really
leads you into the question of the day
why do you think that iPads are selling
less we have more iPads there are a lot
more tablets in the market what do you
think is the problem because in my
particular case I do believe it's the
fact that people have noticed that
content consumption is in everything and
they do need a tablet that can do more
which the iPad can't solve so why buy so
many ipads every now and then if the
previous one can do the same thing as
the new one you really need something
that is better leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends yes
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video was
filmed she follow us on Parker no
comments repetative channel as well
you'd also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscore iveta please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am paying that'll be better thank you
very much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
