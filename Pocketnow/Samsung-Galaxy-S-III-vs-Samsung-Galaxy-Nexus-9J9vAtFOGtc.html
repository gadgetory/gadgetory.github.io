mobile market still the newest google
device to bear the Nexus name the other
is the newest in the most successful
line of Android phones the world has
ever seen they already share shelf space
and stores around the world so let's see
what's different in the same what's good
and bad about the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
and the samsung galaxy s3 I'm Michael
Fisher this is a pocket now let's check
it out just a disclaimer here our
longtime viewers might realize this but
our newcomers might not I reside in the
United States and I use verizon wireless
as my daily carrier so the Galaxy Nexus
I'm using for comparison is the verizon
wireless LTE version not the gsm version
of the galaxy nexus where it differs
from the gsm version i will call out but
for our purposes it's going to serve as
our galaxy nexus equivalent the galaxy
s3 is a white 16 gigabyte version
international unlocked and i'm using it
on AT&amp;amp;T so in terms of hardware these
devices are separated by about seven or
eight months with the original Galaxy
Nexus launching in november of last year
and the galaxy s3 launching just a few
weeks ago in late May visually that's
not immediately apparent coming from the
same manufacturer Samsung these devices
obviously share a common design language
but there are some important
distinctions right off the bat the first
thing you'll notice in handling both
devices is thickness the galaxy s3 at
eight point six millimeters is only
marginally slimmer than the Galaxy Nexus
8.9 four millimeters but it's a
significant drop from the nine point
four seven millimeters of the LTE
version even more with the extended
battery in place the galaxy s3 also
incorporates a larger display at 4.8
inches diagonal versus four point six
five inches on the Galaxy Nexus and puts
more of that display to use by including
a home key and capacitive buttons at the
bottom rather than using screen real
estate for android soft keys moving
around to the back a few items have been
rearranged by
they're all here the speakerphone
speakerphone removable battery cover and
camera with flash 5 megapixels and the
older Galaxy Nexus and 8 megapixels on
the galaxy s3 as for weight these videos
always teach me more about the Galaxy
Nexus LTE version than anything else
while the standard Galaxy Nexus is only
two grams heavier 135 grams vs. 133 on
the samsung galaxy s3 the LTE variant
weighs in at a much heavier 150 grams
making the sgs3 feel positively toy-like
by comparison maybe it's just that I've
become used to the heft of the LTE Nexus
but the galaxy s3 feels somewhat chintzy
to me it doesn't get any help from the
cheap feeling plastic on the back which
displays fingerprints and skin oil
pretty clearly even on my white version
here compared to the textured back on
the Galaxy Nexus the fake brushed metal
on the sides wouldn't be so bad if
Samsung had managed to hide the seam
joining the two halves together overall
about the only thing i like better about
the sgs3 sk singh is the glass covering
the display which curves down into the
phone casing in a manner similar to that
of the HTC One X in every other respect
the Galaxy Nexus feels better in the
hand to me considering I'm already
pretty lukewarm on the design of the
Nexus that doesn't say much for the
build on the sgs3 Samsung still needs to
step it up in this department let's not
judge a book by it's cover though let's
dive in and see what kind of software is
running on each of these devices ok now
both of these phones are running Android
for dode for ice cream sandwich but my
daily driver being a nexus branded
device is running stock ICS whereas the
sgs3 is running Samsung's TouchWiz skin
on top that makes for a decidedly
different user experience where stock
androids holo theme is somewhat stark
with just a hint of electro techno blue
highlights and a minimalistic overall
feel TouchWiz is more bombastic it's
more of showy TouchWiz phones are kind
of like the guy
in the club wearing all the gold
bracelets or something whatever you kids
are into these days like with any skin
there are a lot of specialized widgets
and customizations some more useful than
others my favorite so far is the utility
shortcut Samsung is built into the
notification drawer allowing you to
toggle Wi-Fi and GPS ringer and screen
rotation and so on now I have a similar
widget on my Nexus home screen but
having it constantly there in the
notification drawer is very consistent
and I like it and Samsung hasn't taken a
step back everywhere as I covered in my
editorial following the galaxy s3
announcement the galaxy s3 is packed
with new features like s voice pop up
play smart stay and so forth you'll have
to wait for our full review and in-depth
pieces coming soon for coverage on all
those but whether you find them useful
or not you're not going to find them out
of the box on the Galaxy Nexus it's
something to consider as for general
feature comparisons I'm not seeing
terribly striking differences in
everyday usage responsiveness is almost
a tie which is saying quite a lot for
samsung considering how heavy the touch
which layer has felt before of course
the quad-core exynos in the sgs3 is in
another class entirely than the
dual-core TI OMAP in the galaxy nexus
for those of you looking for some
benchmarks here's what I got
some of you might not want to take my
word on the subjective feel of how these
devices handle and things of that sort
you want cold hard numbers I get that
that's cool for me I don't care if a
calendar opens up a half second faster
on one phone as opposed to another but
I'm not everybody and a lot of people do
care about that kind of stuff we're all
different it's beautiful thing let's do
some speed racing okay so we like to
start fresh with speed tests so it makes
sense to do the boot comparison first
let's fire these up one two three Sam
some very quick to load that boot
animation there and there's the stock
ICS dancing rainbow debris field
whatever you want to call it samsung
keeps are pretty low key and it's
already fired up that is a very very
quick boot time we unlock the screen we
already have the widgets loaded the live
wallpaper comes on up and we are ready
to use the device well before the Galaxy
Nexus is even out of the gate internet
connectivity is there we have HSPA see
if we can fire up Wi-Fi here
and there's our Wi-Fi connectivity so
now finally the Galaxy Nexus has caught
up really seeing the speed there of the
guts of the samsung galaxy s3 compared
to its older sibling we were up and
ready to use the galaxy s3 well before
the Nexus had even woken up and we still
don't have internet connectivity here on
the Galaxy Nexus as widgets load very
clear winner on the galaxy s3 here now
wichita r part of the power of android
so i don't find myself hopping into as
many apps as I once did but let's go
ahead and jump into the calendar app on
each phone and get a good sense of how
each one will load the stuff here we go
three two one alright pretty comparable
obviously the winner on the galaxy s3
there but neither one displayed enough
flag for me to be bothered by it there's
the calendar come on back to the home
screen here now it is possible to get
the galaxy s3 to jump back to the home
screen a lot faster we're going to
discuss that a little bit more when we
discuss s voice or maybe in the main
review but you can disable s voice and
the HOME key will jump you back to home
a lot faster on the gs3 how about the
camera we always want to be able to jump
right into the viewfinder as quickly as
possible so let's see how quickly we can
load the camera on each three two one
BAM once again very very very comparable
load times I didn't even see a sizeable
difference one of the problems with
reviewing phones when they're on the
desk here is you can't even kind of like
the tone the viewfinders loaded so let's
see if we can do that real quickly
better then give it one more shot for
science one two three all right
galaxy s3 be the ghost and exits just by
a bit but once again no appreciable lag
on each you're going to be able to take
your shots pretty quickly on each one
how about a third party app now normally
I'd say Facebook but he'll take a whole
minute for that laggy mess to load so
why don't we try Flipboard Flipboard is
available on the sgs3 and in beta form
on other Android devices right now we'll
try and load it one two three yea once
again so close that it's not really
going to matter all that much to most
people let's try a little web browsing
i'm going to use google chrome on both
of these devices to load nasa.gov which
is a fairly typical US government
website with a good balance of text and
images and we're ready to go in three
two one there's a mobile site once again
we'll hop on down go to the full site
link one two three Wow and by an even
larger margin this time the galaxy s3
beating the Galaxy Nexus soundly loading
that page let's go for a little bit of
gaming I'm not into stealing cars or
slaying dragons really so we're going to
go with the flight simulator f-18
carrier landing in three two one
very very comparable load times on these
two games audio on each fired up alright
you have a clearer picture obviously on
the galaxy s3 bring down the volume a
little bit and kill the volume on the
Galaxy Nexus and we'll just do a little
bit of flying around see what the
responsiveness is like yeah the plan
will work fine for me let's go landing
landing on the carrier I tried this out
a little bit before shooting this video
this is obviously not the most demanding
game graphically speaking but it's not
exactly a text adventure either great
frame rates nothing to complain about
their very very similar to the
experience on the Galaxy Nexus the
notice the load time is much longer on
the Galaxy Nexus to get into the mission
here probably once again owing to that
stronger processing power on the gs3
somewhat dimmer display on the Galaxy
Nexus as well but performance is
comparable between these two devices
enough of that stuff the cameras between
these devices have been roughly on par
in my experience despite the megapixel
difference and the video resolution I
took a few stills inside in the fair
lighting conditions and here they are
some shots are better than others with
the sgs3 shooter coming out on top and
sharpness of focus sometimes but
otherwise the still shot performance
indoors is comparable I also shot a
quick video comparison check it out
we'll be doing more in-depth evaluations
of the galaxy s3's cameras soon but in
the interim I feel like calling out the
fact that testing the camera has brought
my attention more toward the display
then the camera itself the display has
been one of the low points of ownership
of the galaxy nexus for me everything's
washed out whites are dingy and grey and
no amount of backlight seems to be able
to overcome the general pallor that
surrounds the screen about the best
thing I can say about it is that the
blacks are deep by contrast the panel on
the sgs3 while it's still super amoled
and it's still pentile offers much
cleaner whites of far less greenish
yellow tone overall and much much better
saturation everything about it is
crisper and cleaner Samsung has provided
multiple available settings in a menu
section called screen mode which appears
to let you select varying levels of
saturation now I know most people say
that AMOLED delivers too much saturation
in any case call me tacky but I can
never get enough color so I keep it
amped up to dynamic in this setting and
I love the results so which one's better
well it depends on your use case as
always obviously if you're looking for
the hottest of the newest the galaxy s3
is the way to go if you're looking for a
proven design with stock ICS and timely
Android updates at less you have an LTE
version it's the Nexus we're going to
have lots more on the sgs3 in the coming
days and weeks so stay tuned to

you've got something to say give us a
thumbs up here on youtube if you like
