won't see the light of day until
December 2014 microsoft announces its
first update to Windows Phone 8.1 an HTC
teases a new launch as it schedules in a
mint very soon I'm hi Mary vera and be
warned there are no iphone 6 rumors
today finally this is PocketNow daily
yes we do have a lot of official news
today starting with HTC the company has
just sent out press invitations for an
event to happen in New York City on
August nineteenth and even though we
don't have any specifics there are a
couple of things that we are waiting to
see from HTC number one is aware of all
the one where which the company has
denied but could be the case or it could
also be that we are getting the HTC One
m8 for Windows which is apparently a
verizon exclusive that we are waiting
for I'm just crossing my fingers for
that option to dual-boot the one I made
to already have but let's see how that
goes and speaking of Windows Phone the
first official update to Windows Phone
8.1 has just rolled out to the masses at
least the ones eligible it'll take a
couple of weeks for y'all to get it and
obviously if you have carrier support
and that'll be even more complicated but
the update brings what was expected
folders and live tiles which is great
finally get that option and it's
actually in a very intuitive matter and
actually cool you should see how it
works let's description for full details
on everything that we get updated there
are some other enhancements live tile
etc now one of the most anticipated
devices for this year is the Sony Xperia
z3 which might happen at Aoife 2014 in
September but even more important as the
z3 compact that's already being rumoured
we've got some leaked photos of the
phone and we're kind of skeptical about
these photos of apparently do point to
the z3 compact then the coolest thing
about this phone is that it will again
be according to the tipster a smaller
version of the z3 you're getting the
same specifications but you're not
forced to deal with a phablet or a big
phone it's not really a phablet but yeah
you get that option which is really cool
a lot of people love the z1 compact and
hopefully that will be the case here now
let's talk about Apple and specifically
that I watch those of you that are
wondering exactly when we are getting
this device we've got some interesting
tips that point to a launch
in December if you remember yesterday we
were talking about the 5.5 inch iphone 6
launching until December and apparently
the events used to announce this device
will also be used to announce the iWatch
apparently Apple might have to wait
because of some supply restraints
manufacturing issues we've got the whole
details there in the links but even more
important it could be that Apple might
use either of its iPhone events in
September or ipad event in October to
make the announcement and then launch
everything in December to create an
cetacean which makes sense they did it
with the first generation iphone so
let's see what we get and finally for
the interesting news of the day it seems
that Sam saying is a little worried with
the performance and sales of its current
SmartWatch lineup we do know that the
company has not sold even a million
smartwatches this market is really
stagnant at the moment as people are
kind of skeptical or probably just
waiting for the iWatch but other people
are waiting for the Moto 360 we love
that circular design and therefore same
thing has decided to patent a circular
display or its eat your SmartWatch model
which is interesting it seems that yes
they want to go for more iconic design
the current one we have that looks a lot
like a calculator watch if you ask me
but that leads me to the question of the
day if you have to pick round or square
which is your preference in my
particular case i actually prefer square
displays more the only reason why the
Moto 360 is school is because it looks
more elegant and if other companies
would build another pebble steel you
know a very elegant squared watch it
would probably have better acceptance
then currently the LG G watch in the
Samsung gear live so leave us a comment
down below what do you prefer I would
buy both runs yes you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
