expensive android smartphone of the year
and it's Samsung's first handset with a
dual sensor camera system there's going
to be a lot of tough photography
competition this year will this phone
leave the pack here's our Galaxy Note 8
real camera review brought to you by
deep brand we're trying something a
little different with this review there
are two sensors on this phone a standard
view and a zoom the primary shooter on
the note performs similarly to the
Galaxy S II we reviewed earlier in the
year so instead of retreading those
tests will be focusing on what makes
this phone different from its
predecessor and that means we can
deliver part of the conclusion right up
front on this video the pros this
shooter is fast
not just the dual pixel focusing speed
but also shot recycle time from photo to
photo this is also one of the better
low-light performers of the year easily
delivering exposures that take a bit
more work from competing phones Mekons
samsung exposures still veer towards
over saturating and over sharpening it's
a vibrant look for sharing on the web
but might not suit all tastes for
Samsung's expertise and lens
manufacturing we'd like to see higher
quality glass on a future Galaxy
especially for the quality of lens
flaring at night lastly we still see
issues with Samsung's hybrid
stabilization activating software
stabilization in conjunction with the
phone's Hardware stabilization often
produced twitchy output the OU is
working on its own regularly delivered
the cleaner video our verdict from the
galaxy s 8 a pixel will probably win for
people who only want to push a shutter
button with no additional input or
control and a V 20 will crush it for
those folks mounting their phones on
tripods to dial in exactly the
composition that they want but few
phones will cover as broad a range of
consumers with very good to excellent
performance in a majority of shooting
scenarios as the Galaxy S a well that's
all well and good and if you want that
deep dive into the main camera
performance our galaxy sa real camera
review is linked in the description of
this video
but we have a whole second camera to
talk about now and zoom is the name of
the game the second sensor is smaller
and including Hardware image
stabilization provides a significant
benefit to image quality processing is
similar to that main camera pushing
saturation sharpening and fairly
heavy-handed noise reduction but the
result is output that plays really well
with compressed web services like
Instagram no one's really looking to
pixel peep on a lower quality camera
sensor capturing and utilizing light is
always the key to a good photo and in
bright light the note 8 becomes one of
the best macro shooters available this
is not a portrait mode photo this is the
natural bouquet shot at the minimum
focusing distance of the camera and its
stonking gorgeous even an on-the-fly
shot like this low-flying airplane at
maximum zoom the note is able to
preserve a surprising amount of detail
unfortunately image integrity does begin
to degrade in dimmer conditions in shade
were already seeing a duller and noisier
exposure indoor shots will often switch
to the main camera as our night photos a
clueless to the image quality advantage
from the larger main camera sensor but
now it's a shame we can't actually
compare the two cameras at night
shifting gears zoomed video looks
significantly better than other zoom
camera competitors when working with a
longer focal length your hand shake is
magnified and the OAS does an excellent
job of taking some of the shake out of
your shots again you need some good
light to prevent dull output and the
phone fights you to focus as close as it
can for a still photograph but this is
far more functional where the novelty of
a zoom wears off fairly quickly on other
phones we've reviewed but this is a
feature I'm more likely to revisit the
second sensor also means we get a live
focus portrait mode and it's good if not
quite our favorite background blur mode
it's a step above the iPhone but falls
just shy of Huawei and like his solution
like the iPhone you're fairly limited by
distance and light to close too far
or too dark the phone just won't shoot a
live focus photo indoors we see
noticeable image degradation Samsung's
flexibility makes this more fun to use
not just for adjusting the blur after
the fact but also for saving photos from
both cameras that's a great safety
feature especially as software still has
a ways to go for managing the border
around your subject lastly we need to
talk about the additions to samsung's
camera app where we felt the s8 was
getting fiddly the no date has to push
even more control onto your viewfinder
which creates moving targets for
specific settings words replace the more
discreet symbols on the s8 which
contributes to a more cluttered feel I
still hate the shutter button doubling
as a zoom rocker I continue to miss a
lot of shots because I don't perfectly
nail the press on this button in the
moment and when combined with the 2x
button we now have three methods of zoom
that button disappears when you focus
replaced by an exposure slider this all
feels more complicated than it needs to
be hiding gestures under other gestures
lastly Samsung made a mistake
implementing one of my favorite new
features I'm really happy to see a new
full screen mode to compose content that
better fits Samsung's new aspect ratio
but to add this button meant removing
the HDR toggle and shifting it to the
main camera settings this is wrong I'm
far more likely to want to toggle HDR
than I am to want to switch aspect
ratios the app is incredibly functional
includes a great set of manual controls
for photos but it's getting really busy
expect more of a learning curve than on
Samsung's of years past and we're not
sure we agree with Samsung's use of
space to highlight lesser used options
against more commonly used photography
controls so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us with the cameras on
the Galaxy Note 8 the great thing here
is how we can legitimately piggyback on
our conclusion from the galaxy s 8 and
as we mentioned before if you want that
in-depth look at the main camera sensor
our
real camera review is linked in this
video's description samsung's philosophy
still handily represents one of the
better Venn diagram overlaps between
easy auto modes and more camera complete
manual options though the note 8 slides
slightly farther away from the easy side
of the spectrum because of complications
to your viewfinder the core push button
get photo experience feels again like
another small step back from the galaxy
s7 still the no date ticks all the right
boxes it's fast it produces
crowd-pleasing shots and now Samsung
includes the fun options we've enjoyed
from competitors they relate to the dual
camera party but they brought a solid
option to play nothing makes me more
nervous than holding a slippery phone
over a freeway overpass if only we had a
way to add more grip to that back glass
