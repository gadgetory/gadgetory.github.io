after five months on the market in that
same time how is it fared against the
keys in your pocket the concrete
outdoors or all the other harsh elements
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is the moto x durability report
this video was originally supposed to be
made on Tuesday then on Wednesday and
then Thursday it's now Friday and I'm
just getting around to it thanks to a
lovely little winter storm called Janus
wait why was a video of my motox stalled
because of little winter weather because
at the beginning of the month I sent my
custom motox to Brandon so he could try
it out before buying one of his own and
last Friday he shipped it back to me
here we are with the Moto X back in my
possession after a brutal two weeks with
butterfingers minimun and that's where
this story begins because sending the
Moto X to Brandon in any other instance
might have been a mistake you see I'd
been carrying the customer to Ikes
almost non-stop since August 21st I
didn't drop it I didn't beat and bang it
around and when I shipped it to Brandon
it was in near-mint condition there may
have been one or two blemishes but they
were only visible under close inspection
Brandon when I told him I needed the
Moto X back for a durability report
admitted he dropped it a few times and
he quote gave it some life experience
the chassis took some hits we'll get to
that in a second yesterday Michael
published his Moto X after the buzz
video and detailed the ins and outs of
the phone five months after its release
explaining how well that's held up
against the test of time and likewise
the competition for Michael's full take
on the Moto X five months later be sure
to check out his after the buzz episode
but how does the Moto X casing fare
against life itself the insides of your
pockets a hardwood floor or a concrete
sidewalk let's take a gander at both the
Moto X's in my possession one of which
is five months old used by Brandon and
yours truly and another which is a month
and a half old and has entered my
typical use patterns plus the hard
nature of a trade show like CES let's
start with my use patterns and how I
typically handle the device to say I
baby a phone is an exaggeration I'm as
gentle as I can be on equipment as I
like to preserve the newness as long as
possible and drag out any possibility of
resale value in the event something like
an ebony wrapped Moto X were to launch
just weeks after I ordered my own custom
Moto X but I don't take the time to
gently place the Moto X on a tabletop I
don't put that much thought or care into
it but I do make an effort not to drop
it on hard surfaces
as we saw in the inaugural durability
report with the iPhone 5 brandon is less
careful with his phones he lives by the
philosophy that they're just pieces of
equipment and they're meant to be used
not babied and after just two weeks in
his possession he said he dropped it
twice on hardwood at a glance you
wouldn't even notice there's no
separation on the front and back panels
the buttons don't rattle and the phone
is in perfect working condition if you
take a close up tour around the device
however you will notice a few bruises
along the bottom edge there's a tiny
crater in the matte finished plastic
flanked by another gash on the front
side each corner in the bezel has either
a scrape or a ding and there are a few
hairline scratches and Nick's on the
glass I don't recall from before the
worst part of the damage is along the
bright edge of the glass where it
appears to have cracked and one tiny
piece has chipped though it's still in
place for two drops I'd say it fared
pretty well Michael also admitted
accidentally dropping his motox on
concrete from about chest high and it
suffered similar damage some Nicks and
gashes in the plastic around the front
and back but the motox seems rather
resilient even against concrete the new
Moto X I received just before the middle
of December looks practically brand-new
there's one tiny nick along the top edge
and I chose the model with woven bag
which has a soft touch feeling to its
backside in contrast to the hard matte
finish on the non woven models on day
two I noticed a long faint scratch had
appeared in the coating on the back side
and although it's still there and
visible at certain angles it seems to
have faded significantly in the five
weeks since overall the Moto X is a
resilient little piece of kit it can
withstand tiny bumps and dings or even
chest-high drops on the concrete without
suffering too much visual damage of
course no matter the size of the bumps
and scratches they're all equally
heartbreaking so we wouldn't recommend
slamming yours into anything hard or
abrasive intentionally if it does rest
easy knowing your Moto X will likely
come away with minimal damage and
Motorola's nano coating even protects it
from the occasional splashes to boot it
isn't the most ruggedized phone to date
or even currently but we definitely
rated above average for sturdiness and
durability which shouldn't come as much
