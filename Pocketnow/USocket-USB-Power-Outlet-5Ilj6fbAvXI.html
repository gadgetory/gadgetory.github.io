today we're gonna do something a little
bit more serious you see we've been
talking all about technology and about
gadgets and about phones and it's been
really cool but there's something
inherently bad about all those things
and we really have to take a closer look
I know it's not something we normally do
but today we're gonna talk about wall
warts and why they really really are a
big problem let's go take a look okay so
wall warts what are they and why are
they a problem well this is a phone and
that phone doesn't do much unless it's
been charged up and it's charged through
this little power socket if you've got
Bluetooth devices they usually have some
kind of a power input as well that might
be an inductive charging if you're
really lucky or it might be a direct
charge either with a microUSB connector
or some proprietary connector but all of
them plug into one of these now that is
what's called a wall wart well why is it
called a wall wart because when you plug
it into your outlet it looks like a wart
on the wall you plug in another and well
now you've got just an outbreak that you
probably should get some ointment for
but no in all seriousness what is this
and what does it do why do we have it
why do we need it and why is it a
problem well in your outlet depending on
what part of the world in you've got
different kinds of electricity coming
into it but it's almost universally AC
that's alternating current in the u.s.
were 120 volt in other places it's 240
it just depends on where you are in fact
the socket that the prongs are different
depending on where you are so this is a
u.s. prongs and this is not us prongs
see how nice and round they are and you
cannot plug one into the other
you could try but I don't recommend it
but these wall warts are universal not
that they'll plug in anywhere but
everybody has them and their problem
everywhere now why are they a problem
well this converts from alternating
current into direct current
so over here on the end is a little mini
USB in this case they do also have micro
USB and even some proprietary stuff as
well but alternating current in direct
current out there has to be a conversion
process that happens in here and of
course I could get into a lot of
technical detail of how that's done what
it's called but suffice it to say AC in
DC out the problem now is inside of this
it's always doing that conversion
whether or not anything is plugged into
it so even when your phone is unplugged
so you know if you have your phone
plugged in overnight for eight hours
then that's doing its job for eight
hours but for the rest of the day when
you're not even home your phone's not
plugged in it's still doing that
conversion it's still sucking down power
and it looks ugly to boot because it's a
big wall work that sticks out from your
wall now you add up all of these guys
these are called phantom loads they're
loads that are sucking down power even
when they're not doing anything you add
all those up in your house and you get
an awful lot now it's not just cell
phones and and other stuff like that
this camera for example has a relatively
large wall wart it doesn't connect
directly to the wall it connects to the
wall via this wire and then to the
camera via that wire I can't show you
because they're plugged in at either end
but that sucks down power my laptop has
one just like this as well my Xbox has
one my wii has one my computer has one
but it's built inside the computer
itself but they all do the same thing
they convert alternating current to
direct current and they're a problem
because they're always consuming that
electricity putting that demand on no
they don't always look the same here's
one from Samsung nice and kind of thin
but it still has a USB port in it this
is a step in the right direction here is
another one from Motorola and it plugs
in just like that and there's the USB
port now in this case they've omitted
the cable because it's just a regular
USB cable that plugs into it so now they
can give you you know one of these with
international-style
prongs
but no cord out of it and then you can
use the same USB cord to plug into your
device so it's kind of cost savings you
don't have to have two wires you just
have one and well you can plug it in
here or you can plug it in here or you
can plug it into your computer but it's
just the same cord besides you probably
already have a handful of those laying
around so step in the right direction
but it still has to convert from
alternating current to direct current
and that's a problem so let's take a
look at something that we could do okay
first of all this is a Belkin branded
powered USB hub now I say powered
because you actually have to plug it in
and yes that requires the use of a wall
wart but by doing this I can plug four
devices into this port we're into this
hub and only one wall wart so I'm saving
by not having to have four separate wall
warts for four separate devices now I
just have the one charging does take a
little bit longer when you do it this
method but since you're charging up all
night long you're probably gonna be okay
and not have a problem you'll be all
fresh and charged when you wake up in
the morning but you still have that
nasty wall wart dangling around and what
happens if you need more than four well
in this case it's stackable it's got
these neat little beat tabs
that'll can just sit on top and clip in
so then I can have another four ports
actually I can have three ports on this
one four ports on that one why this
device has kind of a unique setup I can
take this plug over here this port and
plug it into this port on the one above
it so this one will call this hub a 10
power hub be by using one of those power
2 USB ports and plugging it into that so
from one to the other just daisy chain
them up that way I don't have to have a
second wall wart to be able to do that
really kind of cool doesn't cost that
much these guys runya this one is just a
four port so it's gonna cost about 20 30
bucks for a really good one get the
highest end one that you can it's just
gonna last a lot longer and hopefully be
a lot more energy efficient as well
you can get them 7-port you can get them
quite a bit more than that up to how
many you need but this problem still
exists you've got to have that wall wart
to power it so let's take a look at
something where you don't have to have a
wall wart but you can still power your
USB powered devices so the problem
really exists between the power and the
device right because we have alternating
current here and we need to get direct
current via the cable into the device so
how do we do that well let's take away
the wall warts and come up with a
solution that includes that conversion
inside the receptacle itself so in this
case this is a u socket branded USB
powered outlet replacement really it's
got your standard two outlets and you
can see I'm using both of them right now
and in addition to that I've got two
powered USB ports now these are just
power ports they're not data ports no
you can't try and hack the power grid by
plugging in your laptop into one of
those but you know kudos for you wanting
to try that we don't recommend you hack
anything by the way that's just some
humor so what is it well I can now take
my USB plug and I can plug it right in
like that and now as long as nothing is
plugged in to the other end of the
device the other end of the cord it's
not taking any power
there's no circuit being completed here
so when the outlet is empty it's also
not using any power that's great
we've just eliminated our wall wart
problem
now a couple drawbacks to this first of
all you've got to buy them and install
them they're not standard they're not
going to come in a new house they're not
going to be in your apartment when you
get there or your dorm room or anything
like that first problem second problem
you've only got two of them I would
really love to have more than that I'd
love to have four of them over here but
two is okay if I have to I guess I can
always take one and plug it in there
and then plug the other end into my
powered USB hub there and do that this
obviously isn't the right and to do it
but you get the point there and then I
can do that now the downside is this is
a device that is then active it's got
circuitry in it so it is taking power
but not nearly as much as this plus the
wall wart okay so next what else can we
do we can plug in all kinds of stuff to
it
my camera has an adapter that I can plug
into USB my Bluetooth headset has a USB
cord my phone has a USB cord I can do
all kinds of stuff but I do have to
replace the receptacle so let's take a
look at this receptacle before we do
that I want to make sure you guys know I
am NOT an electrician I am not giving
you a advise or instruction on how to
install this that's something that if
you don't know how to do you want to
make sure that you're going to contact
an electrician or someone that is
licensed to work with electricity or
wherever you are so that you end up not
killing yourself that having been said
when I replace this I'm gonna tell you
my personal experience and it's just
that when I replace this receptacle the
first thing that I did was I plugged the
lamp into it and went down into the
breaker box I flipped the breaker that I
thought was for this outlet and I came
back up and checked and sure enough the
lamp was off so I knew that this outlet
was it was no longer hot then I took my
little electrical probes and I stuck
them in there it's a little tester
device and double-checked and in fact
the outlet had no power to it once I did
that then I went ahead and took off the
faceplate took out the receptacle and
started working on putting in the new
receptacle so let's take a look at that
this is what the receptacle looks like
and other than the two little USB ports
and these interesting little ears on the
top and the bottom it looks just like
any other receptacle okay one
disadvantage you don't have any quick
plugs in the back like you do in most
receptacles you know the kind where you
can just stick the wire straight in and
it holds on to it because it's got a
little spring-loaded mechanism in there
this doesn't have that you've got to use
the old method
of screw-down which isn't quite as fast
but depending on who you ask might be a
little bit more reliable so there's that
second you'll notice this is just a
regular receptacle that has this big no
I hate to say it but wall wart plugged
on to the back of it now this is where
all of that conversion from AC to DC
happens so it can then go through an
output now the manufacturer says as far
as I can tell that does not happen
unless there's something plugged in so
unless you have a phone or some other
device plugged in using it it's not
sucking down power in this wall wart
right here not only that but the wall
wart is hidden well inside the wall so
it's not as unsightly but let's take a
look the first thing we want to talk
about is grounding and you'll notice
it's got these little wings over here ok
these wings are grounding wings they
actually ground the front of the the
plate here so that when you're touching
this you're actually grounding yourself
I don't know exactly how they do that
but that's the theory behind it so when
you're plugging stuff in you're not
going to have that dust that zap like
you have sometimes when you have a
computer that's not grounded properly
and you're plugging in a USB device so
should take care of that second is it
has your regular old grounding scroop
grain is ground inside the wall you
might have a green wire or you might
have a bare copper wire that plugs in
right there just screw it down like you
normally would on this side is your
black wires and I have two black wires
two white wires and one ground wire in
that outlet box so I plugged my black
into both of those and then I had to
route it down and around here down
underneath this little bump out so they
came down and around that way and on the
back you'll notice I've only got one
white lug the other one is kind of
hidden back here behind that USB port so
to take care of that the manufacturer
includes an extra little wire length
here and what you do is you take your
existing white wires and connect them
that wire nut and then you can take that
and connect it right there on that lug
and then you don't have a problem with
not having enough places to to screw
stuff down and it works just fine in
fact that is how my ground wire works as
well it has a wire lug that excuse me a
wire nut that combines the two into one
so I can disconnect it right there works
great but that's why they included
that's what it's for
now back to down sides this guy cost
quite a bit more than a regular outlet
where you can get these for just a
couple bucks that's gonna cost you
around 20 if you want to know where to
get it head over to pocketnow.com when
we will give you a link or two to where
you can find these download any
specifications you want compare them
price compare and then eventually buy
and have them show up at your doorstep
so you can install them yourselves or
have a qualified licensed electrician do
that for you second thing to take into
consideration and this may save you some
money by not buying them you'll notice
that's very deep a traditional
receptacle is only about that deep and
some boxes are only about that deep now
when I say boxes you don't just take
this and you know plug it into your
drywall there's actually a box back
behind this that holds all of the wires
and it keeps it away from from any
insulation or anything like that so that
if there is a problem with fire in this
box it should be kept inside that box
and give you some time before it breaks
out of the box and starts a house fire
yes this is serious stuff so make sure
if you don't know what you're doing you
find someone who is to help you with it
but back to boxes this is about twice as
deep and when you have wires coming down
here and tucked around in the back
especially with wire nuts in the back
you've got to have a full depth box to
be able to do this that means you might
have to replace your box if it's you
know a thin box
luckily mine is the the full depth box
so I didn't have to do that but I did
have to work on getting those wires
folded up nice and neatly back behind it
and it looks a little something like
like that's when they're all folded back
I had to turn them over to the side but
with the black wires the ground wires
and the white wires all back in there
that made for a very cozy box and you'd
want to make sure that you get that nice
and tucked away so that you're not
causing any problems that could start a
fire
once that's done you just screw it down
top and bottom attach the faceplate and
you're good to go
now the faceplate like you can see is a
special faceplate it has the normal
receptacle holes and then it has the USB
holes as well so you can't take these
and put them in a double gang box which
is too wide or six wide and just keep
going going going getting more outlets
because they don't have these in
anything more than just a single
receptacle style so you would have to
come up with something on your own if
you were going to be able to do that
keep that in mind it is a little bit
wider than most receptacle covers most
receptacle covers are a little bit
skinnier so that means you're probably
okay unless you have trim or something
coming up to it but that is the what the
receptacle itself looks like it does
come with a set of instructions which
breaks it down and tells you essentially
everything that I have just told you
what to do with with wiring this guy up
and of course if you have questions
consult an electrician and have them
help you through it but really cool I
like it it solves the problem of
aesthetics
if solves the problems of being able to
get rid of those wall warts that suck
down power even when nothing is
connected to them and it looks really
cool and geeky as well I can't wait
until they start becoming standard in
every outlet but until then you can
retrofit your own again head over to

get those and get some pricing on them
