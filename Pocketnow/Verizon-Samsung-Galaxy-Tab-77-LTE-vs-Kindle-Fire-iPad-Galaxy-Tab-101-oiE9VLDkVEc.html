pocketnow.com and today we're going to
do a comparison video between the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 from Verizon and
a couple of other devices that are on
the market today so sit back relax enjoy
the show so we have here the
side-by-side text comparison between the
kindle fire over here and the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 over here and as you can
see that the little difficult here but
from my view the brightness in the
background here on the Kindle Fire this
area here where that you would expect to
be black is actually kind of a dark grey
because of the side lighting whereas
with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 the
space right above the text here is just
a really deep rich black the text color
here the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 from
Verizon the Texas noticeably more blue a
little bit brighter whereas with the
kindle fire the text is kind of a
yellowish pink tint and these are both
at full brightness between them really
as far as the readability between them I
say both are very good although the the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 does have with
that that dark dark black background
looks so much better I'm going to go
ahead and go into here to the settings
and i'ma turn the brightness down to the
lowest levels
and as you can see here although again
with the camera it's a little difficult
to tell the brightness on the kindle
fire actually goes to a lower brightness
setting then the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7
does the which is nice when you're
reading in bed the brightness I found
that the brightness on the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 is really a lot brighter
a little harsher on the eyes and doesn't
seem to go down as far in the brightness
levels versus the kindle fire we still
have the the deep rich blacks over here
and we still have kind of a dark gray
that's over here and you can see it
better in in this lighting here this
kind of grayish background birches the
black readability is still the same
between them versus you know large fonts
or small fonts I kinda set them the same
but otherwise it's pretty good as far as
speed of like changing pages they both
seem to be fairly quick as you can see
here obviously we're not in complete
sync with the pages because the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 does have additional text
down here at the bottom that we're not
seeing on the kindle fire because of the
differences in the screen size otherwise
both are very good for reading and
seemed to be very solid for the use of
ebook reading in this case moving to the
side by side comparison of the browsers
the kindle fire versus the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 these are both at full
brightness here and as you can see in
this particular view the kindle fires
actually brighter and verses the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 see here we've got the
brightness all the way up and cheer on
the Kindle Fire all the way up there as
well
that said the readability between the
two devices the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7
with the bullies all you know fully
zoomed out versus fully zoomed out the
text is actually easier to read here the
text here in all it's difficult to see
in the view the text here is a little
pixelated and difficult to see and on
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 you can
actually read the text if you've got you
know good eyesight but really the
differences are very strong now the
galaxy tab is loading up all the flash
by default and the kindle fire is not by
default so I'm just going to zoom in
here text versus text you can see a
little better there the differences
between the fonts the galaxy tab font
seems to be a little more bolt versus
the kindle fire which is a little more
light as far as font goes so our screen
size goes you can see that the Galaxy
Tab 7.7 is a little wider and a tad
taller in screen dimensions than the
kindle fire here and then compare it in
thickness obviously the the kindle fire
is going to be the loser in this serve
or the thicker of the two in this
situation although i don't know that i
would call it necessarily the loser in
the situation i'll explain that in just
a minute between the two devices of
course we've got some noticeable
advantages on the Galaxy Tab 7.7 side
namely it's got the LTE 3g capabilities
it's a little thinner and lighter than
the kindle fire it does have a front
facing and rear camera although they're
not very good but the price difference
is pretty noticeable as well whereas
you've got you know for a couple hundred
dollars for the kindle fire and then
you're looking closer to 500 with a
contract for the 7.7 tab here from
verizon as far as in hand feeling I
really still prefer this size form
factor
the kindle fire and the way that it's
weighted and balanced and it's it's it
just sits in your hand very nicely you
barely have to rest your finger on it to
keep it in one place which I really
really like whereas with the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 I feel like I have to
kind of grip the device or it's going to
fall out of my hands and when it's out
here and i'm reading from this angle i'm
feeling like i'd have to rest my thumb
some place to grab on to it versus on
the kindle fire if i'm reading out from
that far away it still feels very
balanced in my hand and it rests nicely
against the meat of my thumb pad here it
still sits very nicely in my hand in
comparison what about the differences in
the processor you say it does the one
faster than the other is does the
difference in the RAM really seem to
matter personally I think we're getting
to the point with Android devices that
the chips that are in it and the amount
of RAM the amount of processing power
doesn't matter as much as the experience
and since the kindle fire was updated to
its mer the newest firmware release it
skips right along very quickly that the
scrolling back and forth here is very
fast and then we go into the app drawer
there's you know it's very snappy now it
suffers like a lot of other android
devices in so far that if you get a
bunch of apps loaded in the background
and i know that they say that you're not
supposed to have to do this but the
reality is closing apps does make the
kindle fire better so if you find your
kindle fire acting sluggish just go in
and kill the apps or reboot the device
whereas with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7
the experience is just not the same
there's these hiccups that happen when
you rotate the screen it doesn't go as
fast and when you're scrolling through
the apps it seems to kind of pause and
and glitch along and I could be due to
Honeycomb again or it could be to touch
waves indeed but again this is the my
point here is that the experience makes
the bigger difference even between say a
iOS this the new iPad that just came out
and Android devices really weak there's
there's the same thing you're the
interface on iOS is just
small and lightweight it doesn't have
all the widgets or the capabilities that
Android can have it's probably as far as
processors goes you can see the battery
life is already dying on me too as far
as processors go you really can't
compare them because the experience on
iOS is better than Android and I
actually had somebody ask me that today
about Android and their comparison
comparing one Android device to iOS and
saying that the Android device was
better because the processor ram etc etc
and again it goes right back to
experiences the experience better or is
it just the process of really making
much of a difference and I think we're
finding that the processor doesn't make
much of a difference especially when
we're comparing going back to the kindle
fire and the Gauss Tab 7.7 let's look at
a one more device ER compared to the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 from verizon and the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 the size difference is
just immense and and really you're
talking about a much much much larger
device here it's it's really as far as
thickness goes there about the same but
really you're talking it's this device
didn't seem that large until it was up
against this particular device as well
and then if we bring in the samsung epic
touch here for a third view you can see
the three of them together the kind of
family of devices but even the epic
touch here is there's noticeably
different pales in comparison here to
the 10.1 as far as capabilities between
these two devices really you know we're
both at the bed full brightness here and
the the grey down here is not as rich
and crisp as the grey down here on the
samsung 7.7 really it is just about that
you know they're both running honeycomb
here and frankly between the two of them
I don't find a whole lot of difference
between as you can see there the
rotation speeds are really suffer from
the same issues which makes
think maybe it's more of TouchWiz than
say honeycomb but honeycomb does have
its own issues as well battery life
between them it's really about the same
i really wouldn't find bound that the
devices are too terribly different when
you're comparing that to say a i OS
device the batteries still don't hold up
nearly as well i still really really
like this this 7-inch form factor i
really like this in my hand that 7.7
inch style it makes it more like that
paperback format and i really do like
that much better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
