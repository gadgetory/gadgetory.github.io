that it can return to its roots and
basic things like an unboxing experience
its HTC even if the you ultra wasn't as
ultra as we were expecting the unboxing
experience was awesome
and now it's time to take that a step
further I'm Jaime medley that I would
pocket now and we finally get a chance
to unbox the HTC u11 the world of
android unboxings are actually more
crucial than many people think the more
unique the phone is the harder it is to
find accessories for it but lucky for us
HTC hasn't been keeping out on that
department all year you 11 comes in a
square box with rounded corners and
protect it all around by a plastic film
the top we see you 11 and at the bottom
we have all the features that make this
phone special peeling the plastic film
off and after cutting the stickers on
the two sides the box slides up the show
is the brand new new 11 protected on the
same matte plastic that we saw with its
larger sibling to the side we find its
accessories and these are actually
significant we've got a quick charge 3.0
adapter along with a USB C to USB a
cable we also have the company's new use
sonic headphones with USB C connection
to provide active noise cancellation and
those of you that don't care about that
and just want to use your standard
headphones there is also an adapter
included in the box
tucked under the phone we have the usual
literature that nobody cares about a
semi doctor tool and below we find a
protective case made of hard plastic in
addition to an HTC branded chamois
because yeah you will be cleaning this
phone a lot and now that we've dealt
with all that lips focus on the brand
new you 11 plastic protection was kind
of hard to peel off from the back but
once that was done and excuse me
we're greeted by our brand new phone and
you know as much of a nightmare as it is
to film a phone this reflective there's
a lot to like here there's a very
interesting cast that's really hard to
describe as if the phone was truly
designed to be held for an extended
period of time
even if this is not a small phone let me
make that clear but hey there is only so
much I can share an unboxing video we're
going to start setting it up and we'll
report back on our first impressions in
a video coming over the next few days
while that happens chiming in the
comments and let us know what you'd like
to test on this phone in addition to
what other comparisons you would like to
see and also follow us on social media

- quarterly that I'll run into the
Gravatt high middle meta please give
this video a thumbs up if you like what
you saw I am hi Natalie that I think so
much for watching we'll see you with the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
