pocketnow.com Google recently released
the honeycomb preview SDK which allows
us to run the emulator and actually use
honeycomb pocket now it doesn't cover
tablets but we do cover smartphones of
course so we want to talk about how
honeycomb for tablets will kind of
transcend into a new version of
honeycomb for smartphones which we know
is coming in 2011 there are some
dramatic changes to the way that you're
going to use your phone and the way that
Android thinks things should be
organized and it's pretty interesting we
want to apologize for the portrait view
here I know it's kind of difficult to
see but you may have to turn your neck a
little bit also we should know that the
performance of this emulator is horrible
but we wanted to give you the
opportunity to take a look at some of
our thoughts on how honeycomb will
translate into smartphones so first a
new unlock screen for better or for
worse so we can slide over and bring it
outside of the circle and we'll probably
see this new unlock screen come to
smartphones it's nothing too dramatic
but it's it's pretty neat so a lot of
things to talk about here first of all a
new home screen manager currently an
Android for smartphones it's a big pain
in the butt having to move icons on the
screen you can only do things one at a
time if you've got a particular home
screen full of icons you got to delete
one of them before if you want to I
should say if you want to kind of change
the order of two icons on a full
homescreen you're gonna have to delete
one icon move the other one and add the
other one back it is a mess but in
honeycomb it's a completely different
story we're going to tap and hold on the
background here and we're going to be
taken into the home screen manager and
here's what it looks like so it kind of
gives you some items and a view of your
seven home screens or actually there's
five in this case so what we can do from
here is click and drag various widgets
or app shortcuts from the tray down here
up into the home screen so let's show
you an example I'm going to swipe to the
right so I can see all of the available
widgets and this grooves you a nice
visual view of the widgets instead of
Android smartphone where you are sort of
guessing at what things look like so we
can sweat to the right or technically
swipe up if you're
looking at this video Watson landscape
let's say we want to add the the photo
frame here or the picture frame
two-by-two to the center home screen so
I'm going to tap and hold on it and what
you're gonna see is the home screens
turn green and we can slide up and again
performance really is bad on the
emulator and I'm going to release once
we get a blown-up view here of the home
screens I'm going to release in one of
these locations it shows you where you
can put the particular widget which is
nice and we can drop it right there and
it will apply now sometimes you'll get a
red border when you do something that
can't be done
kind of strange that it's doing that
because we're dropping a a reasonably
sized widget and we got a force close
here you're probably gonna see a lot of
these through the demo so we just tried
to add hey widget didn't work let's go
to app shortcuts maybe we'll have better
luck with that since they're a little
bit lighter so if we tap app shortcut so
we will get a list of all of the
applications on your device of course
you can do this now and Android for
smartphones but it's not as pretty so
we're gonna probably get this kind of
interface coming up in honeycomb for
smartphones let's say we want to put the
browser icon on the second home screen
let's see if I can actually make that
happen I'm just going to drop it here on
the Left home screen and it worked and
you can see a live preview of what it
looks like tapping on any of these blue
tiles which represent your home screens
will take you to that particular home
screen we can also go over here to
wallpapers which we can use to adjust
the wallpapers so the big story and
Android for honeycomb is there's a lot
less digging through menus you know on
your smart phone you get a lot of use
out of the Menu key you're constantly
digging into menus to do certain things
in honeycomb it's going to be so much
less of that in fact the menu button
doesn't even exist like it does in the
current version of Android for
smartphones
so here's wallpaper we can change the
wallpaper or I'm going to go down here
to where it says more and show you those
other things that you can do such as
added bookmark or contact an email
account a particular setting to the home
screens okay so let's jump into the home
screens and look at what we have here so
I'm going to actually click on it so
this is the second home screen
very simple I've got two shortcuts one
for the
browser one for the camera we'll talk
about that more in a second we can swipe
to the center home screen and we'll get
a little animation all I've got here is
a Google search so let's talk about more
of the stuff you see on the screen I
should mention that there are some
awesome widgets coming to Honeycomb
right now the built-in Android widgets
you get for your smart phone are kind of
boring if you've got an HTC device you
have a lot more choices or a Motorola
device a lot more choices Google's going
to be providing some really high quality
widgets right out of the box for
honeycomb for smartphones so we've got
these buttons along the bottom and
obviously we've got a back button here
which will take you to the previous
screen we've got a home button and we've
got this new button which is now your
application switcher so if you're an
Android on a smart phone and you want to
switch between applications you tap and
hold on the home button for about two
seconds which is kind of annoying
because there's a delay and you get your
recently used programs so if we do that
and honeycomb for smart phones we are
going to get hopefully a little pop-up
that shows us our most recently used
apps that it's not showing anything now
we'll come back to it's probably because
we haven't opened any apps now because
this these buttons take place on the
bottom of the screen Android Honeycomb
smartphones will not need to have
hardware buttons paving the way for
buttonless smartphones it's going to be
great it's gonna give the OEMs a lot of
flexibility and how they want to design
their hardware now sliding down here
we've got the time and our notification
tray and honeycomb for smartphones is
going to switch to the bottom of the
screen makes a lot of sense because to
kind of move your finger to the top of
the screen and slide down the
notification tray like you do right now
in Android it's kind of cumbersome takes
a lot of finger movement but here you
can just tap on a particular
notification I've actually got an email
notification let's see how that looks
and of course right here we get a little
preview of our email notification so
really neat way that they redesign
notifications I've got my Gmail feeding
into here right now and it's working
quite well we can tap on the clock to
get a little preview of sort of what
time it is we can also see the
notifications in one shot the battery
percentage the date the time and our
strength so that's new we can kind of
click off there and it should fade away
into the background now how do you get
to X well now the app drawers at the top
of the screen we're not so sure that the
app drawer is going to be at the top of
the screen when it comes time for
android for smartphones because again
you're reaching all the way to the top
of your screen but maybe let's see how
the app drawer looks on at least the
tablet edition very simple listing of
your programs you can toggle between all
programs or downloaded programs and
downloaded programs will probably be the
ones that don't come stock on your
device so I'm going to go back to all
and let's dive into a few applications I
have a feeling that a lot of these are
gonna force closed on us but you know
let's let's try we're gonna go into
calculator probably the easiest to run
application here and see how it looks
how it's been redesigned so not only are
we going to get a new home screen
manager for Android for smartphones and
these buttons along the bottom but a lot
of the little visual cues of Android are
going to change and you're gonna see
that as I continue to walk through so
here we are in the calculator let's dive
back home nothing really to to see there
except for some really large buttons and
go back in the app tray and let's try to
get into the browser have a feeling the
browser is going to force close because
it's already done that several times
it's very likely that we're going to see
an Android smartphone browser redesigned
for honeycomb it's not going to be as
dramatic as what you're about to see
because smartphones have smaller screens
but it's likely that we'll see a better
tabbed interface in Android Honeycomb
for smartphones we'll also see our
buttons the back and the forward the
stop button come out of the menu button
that you have to press in order to
access those functions and also over
here there will be a search button and a
favorites button kind of bringing out
these functions again making it easier
and less button intensive when you're
browsing so again here just forced
closed so it stayed open just long
enough so you can get a little view of
how things look let's jump into the
clock application and I think from there
you're gonna see really these new these
new cues that androids calling the
holographic interface a lot of sort of
flat textures blue colors here we have
the clock we've got the redesigned
honeycomb
you know Fonz there it's not much you
can do here someone get out of here
let's go back to the home screen and tap
on the multitasking button by now we
should be able to do some things with it
let's see this doesn't always function
but there we go this is what
multitasking looks like in Android and
this is probably going to come through
in the honeycomb smartphones that are
going to come out so one click tap of a
button here that is always on the screen
will allow you to dive into the recently
used applications much more efficient
than what we get right now and Android
on smartphones which is that annoying
tap and hold of the home button ok so
let's dive into settings and a lot of
these applications here like email and
settings have a split pane view we're
probably not going to see the split pane
view in Android Honeycomb for
smartphones because it doesn't really
make sense you're dealing with a smaller
screen but here you can get a sense for
some of these new visual cues i'ts was
talking about so we've got sort of blue
highlighting here that's new if we go to
some of these options you'll see the
check boxes are redesigned the
backgrounds are redesigned that the
fought seems to be different and we're
gonna see all of this come through on
the smartphone also this new feature
where when you do something that the
phone doesn't like you get a red ring
around the screen and here we are in in
sort of about phone showing the Android
versions honeycomb and we're not really
using a battery so it doesn't really
matter there let's go into applications
and you can see the new check boxes you
get a little green square inside of a
inside of a square right now in Android
for smartphones you get a green check
box in Gingerbread you get the point so
that settings kind of redesigned let's
go back to the home screen and see if
there's anything else we missed let's
say we want to search Google using this
widget well we tap in there and we write
you know let's see if it'll actually
follow what I'm typing there sort of
kind of not really we can actually we
should be able to open the keyboard by
tapping down here on the keyboard icon
I think it's detecting that it's using
an external keyboard here so it is not
showing the keyboard by default but
let's see if we can get the Android
keyboard to open that'd be great this is
the wrong keyboard
okay well we want the English keyboard
which is good it should be showing
English keyboard right so if we go back
and tap this again let's see what
happens I think oh we're gonna get the
same menu so not exactly sure how the
keyboard works here in honeycomb so
let's do Dell Venue in for a minute and
press ENTER it's going to put us right
into Google and do a google search the
browser is going to open again but it's
probably gonna force closed but you may
see what results look like on the screen
the honeycomb browser
I think improves upon the already good
rendering fidelity of the the Android
browser that you see in smartphone so
here we are we've got this little menu
in the upper right corner let's see if
we're lucky enough to see what it says
before it force closes which it's been
doing a lot today doesn't look like
we're gonna get there yeah force close
okay so that's that's pretty much it
let's see if we can get into a couple
more things before we end this video I
know it's getting along here there's a
lot to show but we're just trying to
show the the the important aspects the
things that we think are going to show
up in the smartphone so pressing the
plus button should probably go into the
home screen manager so it's an
alternative way to get into the home
screen manager instead of tapping and
holding on the background you can just
dive right into the that same screen
with the button in the upper right
corner so there it is Android Honeycomb
in a nutshell a lot of this stuff we're
gonna see on smartphones in 2011 we're
gonna see the new and improved home
screen manager we're gonna see the new
notification system at the bottom of the
screen here which makes a lot more sense
we're gonna have a faster way to
multitask a lot of new visual cues new
checkboxes and new system fonts things
like that Android Honeycomb for
smartphones is going to be awesome and
it's really going to change not only the
way we use Android but how OMS can
design hardware for us we're gonna see
some cool stuff in 2011 so if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
