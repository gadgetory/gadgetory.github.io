I'm going to be taking a first look
today at
saga from Verizon Wireless it's a global
smartphone CDMA and GSM enabled so if
you're an international traveler may be
an interesting phone for you to check
out open up our box take a look and see
without in the box here some manuals
their software packages to work with the
saga support guide very nice a global
phone comes with a few different
international charging options and
charging adapter for the US with a USB
adapter on the end and take a look at
the phone the USB cable such will have a
wide USB adapter for connecting to your
PC take a look at the phone to run
outside has a nice feel to it in your
hand nice weight on the top here is our
power button looks like a headset plugin
it's like a mini adapter there so your
standard ipod headphones little large
for that add a stylus with an extension
volume controls another control button
on the side looks like the plug-in for
the adapter for charging
camera with the mirror on the back and
it looks like the speakerphone go ahead
and power it up
hold that down for a second you'll
notice on the front got the standard
QWERTY keyboard soft keys windows key
okay and looks like some more custom
buttons down here at the bottom looks
like one for controlling vibrate is to
put it into a vibrate mode a media
player messaging and over here I believe
that's going to be buttons for voice
commands startups running windows mobile
6.1 and there's our today screen alright
there's a little pad here in the middle
looks like a unique almost like a
touchpad like you'd have on a laptop for
moving a mouse cursor around almost like
that's an expanded version of the little
ball you get on the blackberry let's see
if we try to use some of our buttons
over here so we've got volume control on
the side our next button down switches
us to navigation mode or Mouse mode
looks like the mouse cursor will
disappear when we go to navigation mode
and then this will up and down left
right movements we press on it to click
that will open up our messaging leave
that for now
it's very unique feature for navigation
nice control of the mouse button on the
side I press that
hold that okay if I hold that for a
second looks like it starts up our
camera application and this is also a
touch screen touch that we can exit so
we can also click that to open up or
messaging if we don't want to use the
pad or it can be a number of options for
controlling the device if we compare
size wise at the tmobile wing a little
bit larger than the wing though
definitely Center and I said in nice
feel nice look to it I'll have to take
some further look and we'll check out
the hardware and the software that's
loaded on here in the future review so
first look at the samsung saga from
Verizon Wireless said Neil stub them
with pocket now thanks for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
