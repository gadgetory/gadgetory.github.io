com I've been using tablets for about 10
years so when windows 8 consumer preview
came out didn't take me too long to
decide to install it on my old tablets
so this is one from before the original
iPad came out and we're going to take a
look at a few things and maybe compared
a little bit to Windows Phone let's
check it out okay so here we have
windows 8 consumer preview install on my
old HP touchsmart tm2 and right away we
see some similarities to Windows Phone 7
you got the clock it's pretty big there
this is the lock screen we have the date
we have a signal strength battery level
calendar messages and emails will show
up here as well and just like when those
phone is swipe it up but now we have a
picture lock screen so there we go and
here's your Start screen and you can
tell it looks a lot like Windows Phone
we have tiles and they're moving and
flipping around can see that there but
there's one big difference this is a
much larger screen so Windows Phone was
designed to be one handed I can flick
through and see everything like that
it's very easy all in one hand tablets
are not like that these are much larger
usually you're probably going to hold it
with the left hand or one hand like so
and maybe interactive loop interact with
it with your other hand or maybe hold it
with both hands so that's why we have
windows 8 interface is much different so
see if I'm holding it with this hand I
just swipe like that and I get some
controls or I swipe like this
and I'm flicking through different apps
and if I swipe and then swipe back this
is a very cool feature thumbnails of all
the running programs so you can very
easily switch to whatever you want this
weather app is a little slow starting up
sometimes but we have the panoramic view
again this is similar to some Windows
Phone hubs so very smooth very nice
looking
so I can share things with anything that
supports the share menu I don't have
much here yet so let's look at the
browser this is much smoother than
previous versions of Windows on tablets
windows 7 I think it's a little more
choppy than the developer preview of
windows 8 however but you can see it's
very smooth and you'll also see there's
no chrome there's no controls for
anything you have to swipe there's my
address bar I can pin this the start
menu I can check out different tabs
there's a little menu for a couple of
features
and always we can switch very easily now
let's check out the xbox stuff there's
some very nice Xbox integration there's
my avatar recent games a lot of cool
stuff from windows phone is coming into
Windows 8 is the xbox companion we'll
see if it works so now this is connected
to my xbox and it's similar to the xbox
companion on Windows Phone we can do
some browsing and we can launch games
straight to the Xbox from here you're
also supposed to be able to play music
or it doesn't seem to work right now but
this is the music app and it looks
really nice actually this is the
companion app doing the music stuff the
actual music app looks really nice too
and it looks a very much Xbox designed
not so much a zune but you'll see a
little bit of remnants of zing
so there's your music app very cool
design it also notice the people tile
here is integrated with facebook it's
also integrated with a linkedin twitter
exchange all that is supported right in
the People Hub messaging also supports
facebook and windows live messenger so
that's really nice to have very cool
of course there's SkyDrive and that will
load some SkyDrive stuff
maps is another cool feature again same
kind of name naming convention as
Windows Phone and it works really nicely
now all this full screen Metro stuff is
a fun and whatnot but if you want to get
some real work done we can always go
into the desktop and get to any kind of
real program so here's a premiere pro we
can do some video editing this
interfaces are obviously not an
optimized for touch however so I gotta
pull out the stylus and of course that's
pretty easy and if I want to design a
exhibit was some 3d graphics that's very
easy to do of course better with a
stylus because obviously these buttons
are very tiny same Photoshop is here I
can do whatever I want here so some very
powerful programs are still accessible
on this tablet even though we have a
very nice windows phone touch tablet
interface so overall I have been
extremely impressed with the new
interface for windows 8 for tablets with
windows 7 I was quite content with the
touch interface on that operating system
but with this it just brings a whole new
level of ergonomics and ease of use and
I really like that they win this
direction instead of making a you know
kind of a dumb down operating system
like you know putting windows phone on a
tablet because I still have access to
all these great programs like degree or
sweetened office 2010 you know full
programs granted they're more difficult
to use it gotta pull out a stylist but
I'm okay with that and if you don't want
to use those you can just use this great
new Metro interface for all sorts of
things you know great integration so
that's windows 8 consumer preview first
impressions I really enjoy knit that
give us a thumbs up if you liked this
video and that's it for now
