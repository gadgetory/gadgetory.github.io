long ago that phone sizes were 5 to 5.5
inches like we saw with the Nexus 5 the
iPhone plus models the oneplus 5 than
others
this year we saw phone sizes push well
over 6 inches like with these 6 inch 1
plus 5t and the 6.3 inch one plus 6 and
then the note 9 came along at 6.4 inches
with bezel as phones like the vivo necks
pushing the 6.6 inches and beyond and
don't forget about the iPhone 10s max
which has a 6.5 inch display but in a
lot of cases these screen size increases
were done with the introduction of
notches and small bezels so that we got
bigger screens in relatively small
footprints one of the largest phones to
come around this year is the honor Note
10 which has a gigantic 6.95 inch screen
that's almost as big as some 7-inch
tablets out there but it's able to
maintain a handheld form factor because
it's got a taller aspect ratio display
plus really small bezels the honor Note
10 is probably never going to be
available in the US but you can grab one
on eBay for less than $500 with the big
screen you get a huge battery and the
honor Note 10 has a five thousand
milliamp hour battery which is
significantly larger than the battery on
the note 9 which is four thousand
milliamp hours and also that's the same
capacity as the huawei mate 10 Pro which
many consider to have a huge battery and
that means even with heavy use I was
able to get to the end of the day with
more than 50% left in the phone this is
a true two day phone or more the
included Huawei super charger can get
the note 10 from 0 to 100% in less than
one hour so it charges really fast
another advantage of such a big screen
is that you can increase information
density while still being able to see
screen content the iPhone Tenace max
despite its larger screen has terrible
information density everything is just
blown up but on the note 10 you can jump
into developer options bump the smallest
width setting up to 500 and enjoy seeing
much more content on your screen without
things looking too small and then there
are the speaker's because the honor Note
10 is so large the speakers are quite
large
you get two of them on either side of
the phone here listen for yourself
huawei mate 20 photomerge and confirm
what we're expecting my way is pretty
confident that they're curing 980 will
beat the 700 meter chip of the a12 ionic
blending the speakers are loud having
such a big phone means that viewing
photos and other multimedia is very
immersive especially with that a notch
getting in the way finally not only that
but split-screen multitasking is
fantastic the downside to this phone is
that if you have small hands you're
going to have trouble using this device
reaching the notification shade is very
difficult unless you use to have not
only that but this bone is glass on
glass and so it's super slippery without
a case in pocket the note town feels big
but not significantly bigger than a
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 this phone would
be perfect for stylus input and taking
notes but unfortunately it doesn't
support stylus input unlike the Huawei
media pad line to sum things up the
honor Note 10 is a stunning large screen
phone if you're looking for a big device
it does a really good job taking
advantage of that screen real estate
with fantastic split-screen multitasking
and the ability to bump up the screen
density so you can see so much more on
your display at one time it's a great
phone for people that want a big screen
but for people that have small hands you
might want to look elsewhere and
consider other options give this video a
