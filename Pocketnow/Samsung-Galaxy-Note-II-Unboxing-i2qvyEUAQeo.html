just came from the front door where the
delivery man brought me something
awesome this is the samsung galaxy note
2 the new phablet from Samsung that we
handled briefly at Aoife in Berlin we
get to unbox it now it's gonna be a
couple days before our official review
comes out but in the interim thought
we'd like to show you what's inside the
package give you a quick tour of the
device as we see it here at the pocket
now offices once again I'm Michael this
is PocketNow this is the Galaxy Note 2
unboxing so just taking a real quick
look at the packaging here the Galaxy
Note 2 ours is the marble white edition
as you can see there the s-pen called
out right on the front little spec
rundown on the back the important things
here being that quad-core 1.6 gigahertz
processor as well as the 5.5 inch HD
Super AMOLED display the 3100 milliamp
hour battery powering it all hopping
around to the front let's just go ahead
and pop this right open here the biggest
device I have ever handled that is not a
tablet this is personally speaking this
is my first phablet here's the device
itself the VEX
the back protector is coming loose there
just put this aside here so we can see
what's inside the box real quick for you
we have a Quick Start Guide from Samsung
bundled with a tablet buddy this is an
advertisement for the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1
and 7.0 very nice Samsung good idea keep
the family together in the literature
USB cable in white to match the device
that's very nice earbud custom gels this
is the Samsung headset that we were
familiar with from many other Samsung
devices big ol Samsung battery that's
cool also the biggest Samsung battery I
have handled outside of the tablet world
wall adapter with international
connections because this is the
international version and of course
there that is so that's the end of stuff
in the box let's get that clear
go ahead and get a thumbnail under the
battery cover here that comes off
battery cover feels a lot like the one
on the galaxy s3 a bit thicker though
it's a little less flimsy it's certainly
still not rigid by any means that pops
in right there we're not gonna do a SIM
card at the moment okay got the battery
cover on there here's the device itself
a little tour along the sides here is
power standby on the side
volume rocker on the other side
headphone jack up top there's that 8
megapixel camera around the back there
speakerphone port here is the famous S
Pen with Samsung branding pretty cool
we're gonna go just press and hold on
the side there and pull that off very
nice definitely definitely feelin pretty
sizable in the hand they're waiting on
first boot the Samsung logo and we're
familiar with from the Galaxy s3 a
little haptic buzz let you know it's on
and there is the display after first
power on and just to give you a little
size comparison here this is the
Motorola Droid Razr m this the Samsung
Galaxy s3 and this year the new Galaxy
Note 2 get them all in the frame there
very clearly a much larger device even
considering the size of the already
large galaxy s3 definitely not messing
around this is a phablet not just a big
smartphone we're gonna have a lot more
coverage on this device in the days and
weeks ahead watch for our full review
coming soon but until then follow us at
