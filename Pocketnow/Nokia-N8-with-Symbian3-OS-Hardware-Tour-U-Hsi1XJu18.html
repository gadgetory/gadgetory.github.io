our new n series mobile phone that
supports the that has it comes with a
carl zeiss 12 megapixel camera with
xenon flash and we optimized the camera
we have one of the largest sensors that
we know of on a mobile phone to bring a
lot higher quality for your pictures a
larger camera sensor will allow allow
you to take a lot higher quality picture
if your camera sensor is too small the
pixels get far too little light and then
can introduce a lot of noise so we've
really optimized this for taking high
quality pictures with this then you can
connect the phone to your PC via USB the
it has a micro USB support here so that
you can cop drag and drop it from your
PC from your phone you can upload it to
YouTube Facebook or other social
networking services also with the inbox
cable this basically will allow you to
connect to a USB stick so you can also
drag and drop to a USB stick for sharing
so there's a lot of different mechanisms
or how do you get the content off of
them off of the uh thumb so can you
technically I just import a video from
your regular camera yeah and have the
device service I guess a USB host
exactly and can you edit the clip yes
from the okiya and neat as well
you can push play
and that starts playing with this then
you can use the headset jack with the
with any sort of 3.5 millimeter headset
jack to plug it into your stereo or car
it does support bluetooth stereo out so
then you can also do it over Bluetooth
we also support FM transmitter so you
can broadcast this to a car radio car
stereo home stereo and you can also do
it HDMI as well yes and we have the HDMI
port this is supporting the mini HDMI
standard which you do get a supply a
cable so then you can plug this in and
plug it into your surround sound TV or
stereo we are rating this at 50 hours
per up music playback time on a single
charge for video HDMI out with the
surround sound that is six hours per
charge seven hours without you know just
local playback I know we can't see it
here but can you talk a little bit about
your partnership with Toby and out of
the surrounds right so basically with
video we are supporting we are working
with Dolby to support Dolby surround
sound 5:1 so basically if you have a
home theater this will support up to 5
speakers so that you can have you know
left right center subwoofer etc so that
you basically will have the ability to
play movies and trailers for example at
HD quality at 720p 30 frames per second
from the device so you can use this as a
great way to watch high-def content from
the device on to your home stereo we
have 16 gigabytes of memory on board
plus
a external SD memory slot which will
support up to 32 gigabytes of microSD
video and then videos can be either site
loaded or downloaded from the Obi store
yes exactly
we're downloaded over the Internet we do
support a wide variety of video content
so that it would be able to get video
from many many different sources and as
far as hardware goes we're seeing a
front-facing camera so here we have
front-facing camera automatic light
sensor and you can't see it because it's
partially obscured proximity sensor and
also the case is made out of aluminum
the the end caps are a plastic for
getting better reception and then we
also do stereo mic recording as well and
is this the glass screen it's capacitive
touch yeah capacitive touch
active-matrix
hey I'm OLED so that the screen quality
is actually quite good let me just turn
that off if we can see a demo this is a
little bit of a dark theme but let's
open videos
so this is a trailer for the latest Tron
movie let's just skip over some part two
so that you can see some of that
contrast I've noticed that this actually
does manage to work quite well even in
bright California sunlight which is
sometimes challenging for some films and
then the little button on the front here
this is the menu button the menu button
we also support the traditional nokia
charging cable but we also do USB
charging so micro USB as well as the
traditional gesek and that's just a
small light indicator so that you know
when it's just when it's charging SIM
slot micro SD slot micro SD SD excuse me
yes great thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
