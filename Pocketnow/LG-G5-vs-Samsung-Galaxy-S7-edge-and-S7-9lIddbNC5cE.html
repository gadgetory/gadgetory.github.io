smartphone this year companies like
Samsung and LG could have not made it
more complicated I'm high memory that
are with pocket now and this is LG g5 vs
samsung galaxy s7 edge and galaxy s7
Samsung and LG are both in very
different stages with their respective
flagship offerings last year Samsung was
experimenting with metal and glass with
the galaxy s6 an LG decided to play it
safe with the g4 the day the tables have
turned
Samsung has now decided to refine what
it started while LG has decided to
boldly go where no smartphone has done
in a while as a result were left with a
very difficult comparison because one
product is naturally at a better stage
than the other
both the galaxy s7 and galaxy s7 edge
are the result of a more mature Samsung
the company has acknowledged that looks
aren't everything and as it launched a
new line of a flagships that match that
looks with expandability
by contrast the g5 is the result of a
more daring LG the company knows that
power users want a phone without
compromise and the g5 intends to solve
these needs in a very creative way the
challenge begins when you hold both
devices side by side the galaxy s7 edge
is clearly a more refined product
providing amazing feel in the hand
thanks to the Gorilla Glass 4 and 7000
series aluminium it's also a gorgeous
phone that's easily noticeable from a
distance and just begs to be picked up
at first glance even if you're going to
be cleaning it from fingerprints very
often the t5 is also a pretty sight
thanks to its futuristic design and I
stirred a lot of curiosity all around
since I started using it the only
problem is oddly the feel in the hand
the micronized aluminum is warmer to the
touch and also a little rough around the
chamfer and/or the slot meets the
chassis at least when it comes to our
review unit LG clearly needed a little
more time to polish the manufacturing
process in the measurements department
the g5 stands in between the dimensions
of both the galaxy s7 and galaxy
see s of an edge and is also thicker
than both neither phone was really
designed for one-handed use but since
curves come standard all devices provide
a similar level of meager economics the
choice in materials could make you
believe that the galaxy s7 is more
fragile than the g5 but the galaxy s7
features ip68 water in this proofing
while the g5 is sadly not waterproof at
all or the g5 swings back is in its
uniqueness it marks the return of
modular design where part of the phone
can become anything the OEM wants and LG
has to sign a few friends to take
advantage of that want a camera grip
with an extended battery there's a
friend for that one a higher quality
audio deck there's a friend for that
want to replace that battery on the fly
the slot can even do that by contrast
the galaxy s7 will continue to be the
same phone from the day you buy it until
the day you move on the battle of the
displays is where the challenge gets
tough for LG displays are equally
gorgeous and pixel density quad HD
resolution and the g5 actually does a
better job at accurate color
reproduction the problem is that even
with LG's claim of 900 nits in maximum
display brightness the g5 seems to have
a dimmer display when compared to the
galaxy s7 you actually have to boost it
almost a 70% brightness to match the
galaxy s7 at 50% and it even seems to
take a second to fully power on from
standby it's also less visible in the
direct sunlight when compared to
Samsung's AMOLED offerings always-on is
also standard on both displays but the
speed of which is better is really a
matter of taste
Samsung offers a more elegant option
with color backgrounds and calendar
settings but it's pretty much useless
and giving you a quick glance of your
notifications on the other hand the g5
may not be as elegant but does a better
job at keeping you notified through some
practical icons at the bottom software
is another example of two companies in
very different stages either samsung nor
LG offer a user interface that's ever
been famous for being loved and only
samsung has decided to do something
about it
the galaxy s7 Sui is now more mature and
focused on responsiveness and usability
GaN is the lagging as of previous
iterations and it comes with the legacy
of customizability through the steam
store that also addresses customer
complaints through features like aim
launcher the edge user interface is now
more usable than ever with self defined
shortcuts for applications contacts and
tasks by contrast LG went in a more
mixed direction it gained more negative
publicity than ever due to the lack of
an app tray and the United States
variants still lack the option to switch
it on I'm of the users that actually
prefers to not have it but the g5 lacks
the galaxy s7 features that make it
easier to organize the launcher on the
other hand this is the most cohesive UX
we've seen from LG in years and it does
offer more customized ability than
Samsung and things like navigation keys
animations and even the settings menu if
you don't like the tabbed options that
Samsung forces you to use both these our
interfaces allow you to control the
launcher grid as well but oddly LG has
decided to ditch multi window support
while Samsung continues to reign supreme
with its offering where the competition
becomes tight is in using either of
these phones as your daily driver sure
the Galaxy s7 edge may be the best in
build quality but holding it requires a
level of expertise if you want to avoid
activating the curved display by
accident the g5 s ergonomics were more
suited for comfortable hold that went
all down the drain with the roughness of
the build both devices run on a powerful
Snapdragon 820 processor with 4 gigs of
RAM and 32 gigs of storage that's
expandable via microSD both front just
as fluid in day-to-day operations and
can handle graphics intensive games with
confidence both have quick fingerprint
scanners and opposite but optimal
placements and both offer solid data
speeds great call quality through the
earpiece and loudspeakers placed in the
least of practical areas but hey you
have to live with it
slower touch ID sensor yes devices sport
fast charging but the Galaxy s7 edge can
go further with its 3600 milliamp hour
battery with cases of up to 5 hours of
screen on time in addition to also
supporting fast wireless charging the g5
hasn't really been able to go farther
than 4 hours of screen on time but it
sports the smartest way of going from
zero to a hundred in under two minutes
with a replaceable battery and the
battery cradle that saves the day with
the spare the toughest challenge left is
the camera and one where we really can't
declare a winner both devices have
enough optical power to generate some of
the best smartphone photos available
amazing color saturation and contrast
and low-light performance that's really
hard to beat the only way you can really
tell these photos apart is because the
galaxy tends to have a closer field of
view than the LG the galaxy is also more
aggressive at boquete thanks to the
brighter F 1.7 aperture even
stabilization on both phones is on par
when recording 1080p video side-by-side
now where the g5 just completely
obliterates the galaxy s7 is with the
wide-angle lens it's not our best pick
for low-light but the only way you can
fit New York City buildings in a shot is
with the g5 the level of versatility is
simply unmatched and it's great to not
have to depend on a case or a spare lens
to achieve these results you can even
switch to this wide-angle lens when
recording video while on the go which is
really practical and something the
galaxy s7 can not offer so far overall
this is one of the toughest comparisons
ever one device maybe more refined than
the other but the other has come up with
features that actually saw real world
problems as much as I personally prefer
the feel of the galaxy s7 I find it
really hard to leave the g5 behind just
because of the added flexibility these
phones both cater took pretty much the
same user so it really narrows down to
your personal needs if you're after
great feel in the hands a well rounded
experience and a waterproof phone for
peace of mind then
the galaxy s7 is your best bet that
being said if you want to give your
inner geek the phone with the most
potential and versatility it really
doesn't get any better than the LG g5
and so far it's just been the phone that
I've drifted for most mainly because of
that camera folks our review of the
galaxy s7 and galaxy s7 edge have been
