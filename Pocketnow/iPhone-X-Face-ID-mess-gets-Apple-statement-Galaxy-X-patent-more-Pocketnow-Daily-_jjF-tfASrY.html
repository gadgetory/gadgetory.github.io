regarding the accuracy of face ID after
the news break Samsung Galaxy X patent
emerges and this foldable hinge is a
sight to be seen
and speaking of foldable screens it
seems that Microsoft wants to understand
old idea from about a decade ago I'm
Jaime Rivera and yes the Google pixel to
excel is finally here and there are a
ton of things that I have to share there
will be a video coming soon this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals I believe it or
not LG has just pretty much added its US
portfolio with the exception of the b32
amazon's prime exclusive devices meaning
if you're willing to put up with a
screen saver with an ad from Amazon
which I actually find those ads to be
useful you will get a discount on that
any of the g6g 6 plus in addition to the
Q 6 and the X charge a lot of these
devices like the g6 your devices I
highly recommend you can learn more in
the description other interesting news
come from the Oppo our 11s which just
became official today and I could tell
you a lot about it I can't wait to get a
unit and tell you more about it but the
most important part is that we know that
the r11 was the base design for the 1+5
so I think this is a good way to know
what the 1 plus 5t is going to look like
now it's with the spotlight over the
Microsoft
raise your hand who remembers the
Microsoft career many years ago
Microsoft showed as a concept on video
where there was a tablet with a foldable
hinge design it wasn't really a foldable
display but the whole concept was that
it would pretty much work like a planner
you could use it like a planner and
we've got rumors that there is a project
Andromeda that's pretty much this
apparently the technology is there and
the whole concept the foldable displays
is already a thing so yeah because yes
foldable displays are definitely coming
to the Samsung Galaxy X we've been
seeing rumors we've been seeing patents
and today we see the hinge those of you
that have seen the foldable hinge from
the Microsoft Surface book this whole
centipede design is apparently going to
be the same basis for what Samsung is
going to bring and definitely this looks
like a clamshell device in every way not
exactly sure I'm gonna like the
clamshell purpose because of the
thickness
but I mean I can't wait to be surprised
Sam's like just surprise me and finally
very hot news that they have to do with
Apple actually providing a statement
over rumors I think that this is the
first time we've ever seen Apple do this
and it has everything to do with
yesterday's news from Bloomberg over the
lack of accuracy of face ID dropping to
five hundred thousand to one Apple has
just published a statement saying that
they can't wait for users to test it out
and that it is 1 million to 1 or 1 to 1
million when it comes to accuracy
regardless whatever case tonight are the
pre-orders of the iPhone 10 are you
pre-ordering or is this making you
