aid think you I have a few variants in
front of me because I am actually
sitting in the creator studio that LG
erected at their booth here at MWC 2019
a place for people like myself to have a
little bit of intimate time with these
devices and to be able to create videos
like this so kudos to LG for that anyway
you probably know about the LG G 8 by
now it has the new tof camera on the
front that allows for air motion
gestures but also hand ID as a new
biometric now that's pretty exciting for
the G line but let's not forget LG also
announced a new version of the V Series
phone this is now and I'm Josh of
regard on what's going on everybody we
are here to talk about to the LG v 50
think you now for all intents and
purposes the LG be 50 is kind of like
the LG be 40 there are some design
aspects that are a bit better here but
it is the larger device one compared to
the G line and they main enhancement
here is that it is going to be 5g
enabled once 5g becomes a thing all over
the place this phone is already capable
of working on that network but we happen
to be a 50 think Q is a large OLED panel
6.4 inches at quad HD plus resolution
that display does have the notch at the
top and there are a couple of cameras
but that is a wide angle lens on there
not a tof camera like on the g8 think
you
which means no hand ID and no air motion
gestures in this particular device
underneath the surface is the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 and of course the radios
that are required for 5g connectivity
other features that are very familiar to
LG fans include the boombox speaker
there are full range speakers on here
that allow for the device to sit on a
surface so that you have a resonance
chamber that makes the sound actually
flood of the immediate area it is a
great way of keeping your Bluetooth
speaker at home and we've seen it in a
couple of previous LG devices it is
still a crowd-pleasing feature the same
goes for the headphone jack which itself
has the quad DAC in order for you to
have a great time with your wired
headphones let's talk about the camera
setup of course we have the five cameras
total on here because this is a V series
device and with the three cameras on the
back you get not only the main camera
you get a wide-angle and you get a
telephoto all the focal lengths that you
might need for your photo
and your videos and as a vlogger one of
my favorite phones to use is always an
lg device because those manual video
controls give you a lot of granular
control along with great bit rates for
higher quality video overall I'm always
excited to take a v-series phone out for
vlogging with a smartphone especially if
the v40 was any indication this should
be a pretty solid vlogging device there
are a bunch of modes that are available
so you can have some fun with these
cameras you might remember the triple
shot from a previous G device but this
time we have something called the Penta
shot it basically takes three quick
photos using the back cameras and then
with a five second timer you can take a
couple of selfies basically reacting to
what you just took a few photos else now
the Penta shot is really funny because
you can actually make a gift out of it
and you can get some pretty awesome
results 5g is of course the evolution
that LG wants to have with the V 50
think you but then that might be taking
some focus away from another feature
that I think all of you are going to
want and it's an accessory that connects
to these three little pins here on the
bottom this is the LG dual screen it's a
big case and it is a case for the phone
so you have a little bit of protection
there but when you open it up you get
yourself a whole new display here on the
left a dual display if this is an
alternative to the foldable displays
that we have seen all over MWC and I
would argue this is probably one of the
most practical applications of this form
factor the case has a couple of hinge
positions so you can hold it pretty
comfortably in one hand and you can also
flatten it out that way you have a full
view of the two screens in front of you
however it can also fold upon itself so
you can still use the v50 thinkyou and a
more conventional sense like a singular
phone even though it has a bit of a
thick case here I can also forgive the
case for being pretty thick because of
what it provides a second screen hit
this little button and it turns on the
other screen that also allows you to
open up pretty much any application and
it has basically the same high quality
as the OLED panel that is on the p50
thinkyou itself when you activate the
dual screen you can open up an
application of your choosing so I think
Gmail is actually a pretty great example
here because you can get straight to
your emails start typing away and be
able to respond to them while
multitasking
of course there are some main use cases
that LG are trying to tout the most with
this dual screen and one of them is a
gaming since this is a dual screen you
literally have something like an Android
version of a DES even better the game
launcher provides a gamepad and if
you're going to use the V 50 think cute
with this great haptic engine then you
have the ability to have basically a
tactile experience controlling the game
on the second screen there's only one
problem with this though the LG dual
screen will not be available in the US
which is basically why I'm making this
video not only to give you a look at the
V 50 think you but also to have you get
into the comment sections to tell LG hey
we want this in the US with all the
foldable devices that are being
announced here at the show it's great to
see a practical alternative to it you
still get more screen you still get
multitasking you still get good media
the screens may not be connected but
that's the reason why practicality is
more important because you can take this
case off and still have your phone as a
singular device so you don't have to
have a large device in your pocket
taking up more space in any case I want
to make sure that you all get to the
comment sections let us know what you
think of the LG v 50 theme q let's talk
about 5g let's talk about the dual
screen let's talk about the fact that
should be in the US and let LG know your
opinions as well don't forget to watch
the rest of our MWC coverage and
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already
after that you can drop some lights on
the videos and like I said get into
those comment sections for now I'm gonna
go ahead and call it on this one thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
