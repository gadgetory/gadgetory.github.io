now it should come as no surprise that
I'm a really big fan of CyanogenMod ten
custom ROM I'm also a really big fan of
the Nexus 10 luckily CyanogenMod team
has been hard at work and we now have a
10.1 nightly build that's stable enough
for me to show you that's what I want to
do right now let's go take a look so
here's my Nexus 10 I've gone ahead and
routed and unlocked it OEM unlocked the
whole deal I have just installed
CyanogenMod 10.1 and I've set this up so
that it works with my my Google account
credentials so let's go ahead and unlock
for the first time we'll do that I've
got my make yourself at home tutorial
just okay through that and the first
thing we've got is CyanogenMod
statistics up here this is Error
reporting and whatnot so if there is
problems the CyanogenMod team is
automatically made of ware of them i
usually leave that on by default but
that shows you that we do in fact have
CyanogenMod 10.1 running you'll notice
down here some of the goodies are
missing under system we go into about
tablet we can see that yep CyanogenMod
updates is there and CyanogenMod stats
we can get into make those changes there
as well this is running version 4.2.1
but where am i cool overclocking and and
other stuff well let's go in and take a
look we got to come in here to eyes
Android version we tap and up that just
gives us our jelly bean so let's come in
and do our our CyanogenMod version that
gives us our jelly bean come in to build
number and that's what gives us our
developer stuff I knew that I just
wanted to show off this other stuff to
you because there's that CyanogenMod
jelly bean that well it's new to me and
hopefully it's new to you too but now
that gives us not only the developer
options that you're accustomed to by
doing that build number hack that we
just showed you but also performance
let's go ahead and jump in there yes the
disclaimer will okay through that go in
and check out our processor stuff it's
got an interactive governor that
is one of the better ones you can change
it to one of the others if you like it
performance userspace and whatnot I just
leave it at interactive performance
arguably gets you a little bit better
performance in benchmarks and games and
whatnot but their pros and cons to it so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
the minimum CPU frequency is 200
megahertz that's grayed out the maximum
CPU frequency is 1700 that's grayed out
and you can see how it's jumping up and
down here and of course you can restore
these settings on boot this version of
CyanogenMod 10 nightly you cannot make
those changes so keep that in mind let's
go back out of that to our i/o scheduler
if you want to get in and change IO
scheduling you can do that there's well
memory management allow purging of
assets I always like to do that there is
no z ram like we showed you in the
previous video about the nexus 4 speed
up tips if you missed that video by the
way really kind of cool it shows you
some of the advanced stuff that you can
do in here I'll have a link to that at
the end of this video you can come in
and change our transparency to 16-bit
this doesn't look as good but it can
help speed things up you do have to
reboot after that and then surface
improvement I usually like to fix color
banding and blur effect again I don't
think you have to reboot on that one but
not a bad thing to do
other CyanogenMod goodies that you have
up here at the top of course we have the
trebuchet launcher so you can change
your home screen you can change the grid
size how many rows and columns do you
want we probably want more than that but
I'm gonna leave it stuck just right now
the number of home screens I usually
like having three home screens the
default screen if there's only three and
it's the middle one for me so that's
number two if you want extra vertical or
horizontal padding you can do that
turning on and off the persistent search
bar allowing any widget to be resized I
like that one if you want to hide the
labels because you know what they are
just looking at the icon I mean that's
what icons are for right
you can do that in here you can scroll
wallpaper yeah you've seen all this
stuff before it's just very nicely
adapted over here for for the Nexus 10
for the 10-inch tablet just walk you
through a couple more of the things here
auto-rotate screen do that okay lock
screen you're going to make some changes
there that's the stock themes of course
you can do CyanogenMod ten themes you
can even apply cm9 themes to it as well
though you are usually going to get an
asset error just continue through that
and you're just fine it comes with the
stock went by a default interestingly
enough if you look at themes it shows
you that the buttons are over here on
the side and they're obviously in the
middle so a little discrepancy between
the screenshot and what you actually get
a CyanogenMod system we can change stuff
in the status bar showing our clock this
is what a lot of us like to do circle
with percentage you'll want to go in and
make that change because it's just
awesome showing the notification count
up here in the top so if you've got
multiple apps being updated if you've
got multiple emails it'll show you all
that right up there so you can just tell
really quickly how many you've got
really kind of cool there of course
users this is nothing new this is
something that CyanogenMod had before
but now of course it's built in stock
with CM ten so no worries about that or
cm 10.1 rather all kinds of fun stuff
profiles I really like profiles in
CyanogenMod I can set a different
profile for home night if I want it to
just be silent or work and then I can
switch between those profiles just by
hitting the power button and changing
the profile to something else now I can
have this turn on and off Bluetooth
Wi-Fi volume up/down just tons and tons
of stuff that I can do with it and I can
also do that through NFC as well on
devices that support NFC so we just
fired up and ran Geekbench to with just
a few of the tweaks available and you're
saying we're getting a benchmark score
of 24 23 we're gonna go ahead and do the
same thing with quadrant run that
through it really fast now if you want
to see the benchmarks that come with the
stock version of Android rather than the
CyanogenMod version make sure you head
over to the article at pocketnow.com
I will have a link to that article at
the bottom of this one so you can get
your your benchmark comparison over
there
and here's our quadrant score 52:13 so
not bad at all
let's just walk through some some
overall behavior we'll tilt this and get
it back into landscape mode for us as
far as performance it's very fast and
fluid not more so or less so than the
stock rom at least not on the face of it
same thing as far as this goes let's
fire up an app and see how quick it is
got Firefox pre-loaded let's just load
that up so you can see see how it does
when we look at a website
so overall I'm very good it launches
apps quickly you can navigate around its
a nightly so it's still got some rough
edges for example you know we told it
that we only wanted three home screens
here and you can see it's got more than
three home screens very obviously so
there's still things to be done this is
not stable this is nightly it's for you
to get in and play with and see how it
works for you so what do you think about
it we want to know what's your favorite
part of CM 10.1 that we didn't cover
here share that over in the comments
pocket now calm so we can all learn
about well the pretty bits that are
hiding inside our custom roms so there
you go CyanogenMod 10.1 nightly running
on the Google Nexus 10 if you liked what
you saw make sure you give the video a
big thumbs up if you'd like to follow us
on twitter so you don't miss out on any
breaking news new stories tips tricks or
solutions make sure you follow us on
Twitter we're at Puckett now tweets if
you want to follow me I'm at Joe Levi
