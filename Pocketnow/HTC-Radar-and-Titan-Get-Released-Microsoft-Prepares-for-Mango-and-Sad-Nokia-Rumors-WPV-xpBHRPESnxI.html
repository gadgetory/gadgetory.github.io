mango handsets get release Microsoft
begins releasing software updates that's
a prep mango and rumors have it that
Nokia will be releasing their windows
phone and some dill 2012 all this and
more coming up right now hello everyone
I'm Jaime to be better with
pocketnow.com and welcome to Windows
Phone view the show we wrap up
everything that's good and bad inside
the world of Microsoft's Windows Phone
platform let start this week off with
what's good well don't say we didn't
tell you HTC September first event was
exclusive for Windows Phone as we
predicted and mango was in the air HTC
has just launched their radar device and
they've also launched a time device
which is pretty much just bringing back
the old thing that they love so much
only this time they did spell it
correctly and well the omega is
definitely the radar device that they
just launched the omega remember is that
the vice that we were leaking recently
and the leaks of the eternity definitely
sound like this is the Titan device that
we were also talking about now both
devices are winners in specs and just
about everything so make sure you hit
our website for details on full specs
and hopefully we will get they'd soon on
when they will be released both in
Europe and the United States and well
after fujitsu toshiba and HTC have
officialized the release of their mangal
lineup the biggest question is when will
mango be released for the other handsets
HTC did not confirm release dates for
the devices on their event but rumors
have it that it won't be released 15
days from now and the leak dates come
from HTC Dell and even rumors of a new
windows phone LG line of devices coming
soon but the problem is that we don't
know if Microsoft will be releasing the
software alongside with the phones or
the phones alongside the software later
as they've done in some times in the
past so new windows phones from HTC have
reached the FCC recently and we are
hoping that these are the Eternity and
Omega which are now the time and the
radar and well it just seems that things
are coming up close for a release we're
just not sure when and we'll definitely
be bringing you hints on when we
probably estimate that it will happen
animal Microsoft continues to preparing
for their unknown mango release date and
they dis released their zune player
update for supporting mango their Mac
connector just now supports mango in a
recent update and even their Xbox Live
extras now supports a mango with a
recent update it just seems like the
software would be released next week but
sadly trust me we're digging we're
looking everywhere we haven't found
release states that are specific now
interesting enough we saw the release of
the HTC Radar end time brings
front-facing video cameras so you really
can bet that we will most probably get
some sort of skype video chat for these
devices and probably for the newer mango
devices that come out because obviously
the old ones don't have a front-facing
video camera now before we hit the bad
section which has some nokia flavor to
it images of a nokia 703 have been
leaked on a slideshow presentation in
the funny part is that the image is
identical to the nokia n9 so the
question is if that n9 was really the
mango device that was supposedly being
called Siri what was it of that Nokia
800 codename device that we found last
week could it be at the Nokia 800
prototype as some other Windows Phone
which just sounds really good and then
this n 9 and 703 code name would most
probably be some other thing hopefully
not being called see right now before
everybody gets emotional with me here
because nokia devices with Windows Phone
will be cool wait up for the bad section
because not everything is pictured right
okay so that does it for the good let's
continue on with what's bad rumors have
it the Nokia will be launching their
windows phone mango handsets until March
2012 and well before we play hangman
with Nokia because of this just remember
that whenever they launched the nokia
windows phone strategy about a year ago
they were very clear and specific about
the fact that they would be launching
devices until 2012 obviously they've
been playing around with everybody just
to create some expectation totally
understandable I mean Apple does it all
the time with their Apple handsets and
all the ideas just to keep people on the
edge of their seats for their nokia
windows phones now it's just sad to see
that everybody's really got money on the
fall and most contracts actually in the
fall for some reason but you know it
seems that nook is actually going to be
losing out on a really good season a
cell phone so sad news for that but
again these are just rumours that could
be changed eventually and well it seems
location gate has just reached Microsoft
then well you think that Microsoft would
most probably do something about it
before something happens to them by
seeing what happens to competitors but
it seems in Microsoft didn't do anything
the class-action lawsuit that Microsoft
just related just received has to do
with the fact that the camera
application apparently gets information
from you without your permission and
sends it somewhere now the question is
what do they mean by information I mean
do they really grab pictures from you
and send it somewhere without your
permission what kind of pictures first
of all just make sure you don't really
take any pictures that could probably
get you into trouble and well just
beware let's see what Microsoft does
about it most probably they'll fix it
with mango that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
Hyneman we better remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
