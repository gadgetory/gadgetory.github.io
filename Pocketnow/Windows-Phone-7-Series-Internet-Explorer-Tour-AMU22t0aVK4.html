pocketnow.com and we're really excited
to show you Internet Explorer on Windows
Phone 7 series we're looking at this
through the emulator which doesn't work
perfectly it's not fully done obviously
a lot of tiles are missing from the
start screen but hopefully in future
videos we'll be able to give you a
deeper look at Windows Phone 7 series so
let's take a look at the Internet
Explorer browsing experience so here we
are in a typical windows phone 7 series
window along the bottom we have the
application bar and we have the most
commonly used shortcuts down there so
there are three here add favorites
favorite menu and this one will show you
you're currently open tabs or you can
tap on these three dots to sort of get
an extension of the of these shortcuts
that you can have to get to settings
we're going to go through all this in a
second but first let's go to a web page
so you tap on the top and we can do
google com or I could have used the
keyboard on my computer but for the sink
it safe sake of keeping this real let's
do it through the on-screen keyboard so
here we are google com it came up very
fast let's open up a new tab this time
let's go to say amazoncom very very fast
performance of course as an emulator
this isn't necessarily what you'll
experience if you have a windows phone 7
series device let's move around the page
and see what that is like you can't do
multi-touch obviously although if you
had a touchscreen monitor with
multi-touch capability you could
actually pinch to zoom right now so
instead I'm just going to double tap to
zoom in extremely fast zooming very very
nice web browsing experience let's just
click on something here let's click on
the Kindle page and see how long that
takes to load okay so here we are on the
Kindle page we can flick down you can
kind of see the kinetic scrolling is
extremely smooth let's open up one more
tab let's go this time to say let's go
to engadget
okay great now a few things that you can
do from here and let's go back to our
tab view and let's go to Google we can
add this as a shortcut to our home
screen by tapping these three dots here
and click pin to start and now we're
taking back to the start page and there
is a shortcut to Google let's add
another ones we ran go back into
internet explorer it takes us back to
the previous state that we left internet
explorer in so a little bit of
multitasking there and let's go to
Amazon and put a quick link to Amazon
here and let's finally do it for
engadget too because I want to show you
something else that you can do through
this demonstration so let's go back to
the the multi-vue here and looks like
that's going to have to reload but I'm
gonna do pin to start so now we have
three new tiles on our start page we can
obviously rearrange this these things
and this is how you tap and hold and
when you tap and hold the one that
you're tapping and holding comes forward
and you get a little broken heart icon
if you click on that it will take away
the tile or you can slide them around to
rearrange them to your heart's content
or of course you can close them so let's
go back inside and see what else we can
do let's go to back to amazon very fast
way of switching between different
different websites so it's very nice we
can click the add to favorite button
here and then you kind of get a zoom
like interface I'm going to click OK and
add it to my favorites then I want to go
to the center button here which shows me
all of my favorites and you get the very
zoom like Metro interfaces they call it
so I can quickly jump to a website I can
pan to the right to see history pan to
the right again and I'm back in favorite
so let's go to one of these favorites go
to MSNBC and then we are brought to
MSNBC mobile and I'm going to stop that
from loading the stop button is up here
and the so is refresh now there's some
other things down here that you may have
seen some of these don't work so if I go
to settings nothing happens if i go to
share nothing happens find on page i
haven't tried yet looks like it does
work so if i type a phrase or a word
that exists on the page presumably it
will find it yep there it is i typed
images and it went right to it so so far
so good it looks like Internet Explorer
on Windows Phone 7 series is going to be
a winner it's
fast it's easy to use it looks and it
feels like the zune HD interface which
were a fan of because the zune HD is a
really nice-looking way to interact with
the device so be sure to check us out on
pocketnow.com for the latest in Windows
Phone 7 series videos and news that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
