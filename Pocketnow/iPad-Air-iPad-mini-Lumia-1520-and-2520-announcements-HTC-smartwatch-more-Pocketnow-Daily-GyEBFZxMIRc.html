lover hate of many nokia follows the
device announcements with two new
phablets and the tablet an HTC wants to
build a SmartWatch that's not a gimmick
or so they say I'm high memory data and
how about if we remove the word smart
from the word watch while they figure
that one out this is a daily you
know there's so much official news to
start off today we're gonna actually
begin with the rumors because Quokka ms
apparently already work on a new variant
of the snapdragon 800 processor and the
reason why this is hot is because it's
apparently gonna make it ten percent
faster and ten percent more efficient
and yes this is big news the snapdragon
800 processor is one of the hottest
things to happen to mobile in the last
coming years so much so that i've come
to the point where i will not buy
another smartphone if it does not
include a snapdragon 800 processor it is
that good so let's see how the rumors go
let's continue with some rumors as HTC
is apparently working on an
android-powered SmartWatch and according
to Peter Chou he really wants to make
this a non gimmicky product as pretty
much most of the smart watches are at
the moment and apparently the company
was already working a SmartWatch along
with a microsoft powered by Windows and
for some reason that did not happen at
all but anyway stay tuned for the rumors
that see exactly what we get because it
doesn't really matter how beautifully
make this watch it's about how useful
the watch will be moving over to some
official news google has just purchased
a french company called lexie core and
if this does not ring a bell does the
company behind Roy booster a service
that intends to make your java
performance a lot faster and more
optimized so we could expect for the
next version of androids be much faster
and much better apparently the team is
already integrating with the Android
team so much so that google paid 23
million dollars for the service alone so
it must be worth every penny or at least
i hope now let's talk about nokia and
the news that a lot of you have been
waiting for is the company has just
announced two new phablets the 15 20 and
the 13 20 and then a new tablet which is
the 2520 and in the case of the 15 20
this device pretty much powers
everything that we want an android on
Windows Phone so this is really a beast
of a phone
and yeah it is also a beast of a phone
when it comes to size since this is a 6
inch display which would mean this is
bigger than the HTC One max which is
probably just too big to handle it in
the same case the 1320 is just as big
only obviously not as powerful the price
tag is really compelling now the case of
the 2520 we have a Windows RT tablet
there's not really much to talk about
here all these products are going to
AT&amp;amp;T except for the 1320 which is
specified only for Europe and Asia so
stay tuned for the rumours asked to when
we're actually getting these products
launched and some interesting pricing
since the unlocked price of the 1520 is
kind of out of the ballpark and finally
for the hot news of the day yes we get
two new iPads first we get the ipad air
and i did not get that name wrong it's
not ipad 5 or not the new ipad it is the
ipad air but it is pretty much a bloated
iPad Mini in design with better
specifications like an a7 processor the
m7 coprocessor new radios etc etc great
specification and the same starting
price as the previous iPad which is
great we also get an ipad mini with a
Retina display and the reason why I'm
not smiling is because even though this
is a smaller iPad air in every single
way specification and everything it is
the same tablet only smaller but it's
starting prices at 399 it's four hundred
dollars for this tablet and yes we still
get the ipad 2 after three years as the
entry-level bigger ipad and the old ipad
mini from last year remains as the
entry-level ipad mini so these two new
tablets are the higher end models that
also do not include touch ID which we
really can't understand why but that
makes you the question of the day are
you interested in any of these ipads is
any of these ipads your next tablet in
my particular case you know i wanted
that i've had many with the retina
display but for the price tag of almost
to nexus 7's it is really not compelling
for me anymore up to the point where i'm
actually thinking of the ipad air even
with its crazy name or probably just
going for the nexus 7 altogether and
saving a ton of money so leave us a
comment down below what do you stand and
friends as always you know the drill if
