available on America's two largest
wireless carriers starting today but so
is a device that we called one of the
best Android smartphones ever just a few
months ago which one should you buy
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is LG g2 versus
HTC One with so many glaring contrasts
between these phones we hardly need a
preamble so let's just jump right into
hardware the HTC One which we covered
extensively several months back
continues to set the standard for how a
premium smartphone should look and feel
it's aluminum unibody construction with
polycarbonate accents and machined
speaker grilles continues to stand out
from the pack of plastic phones that
makes up the remainder of the Android
landscape a landscape the LG g2 seems
custom-made to blend in with the g2 is
almost exactly the same mass as the one
but LG has ditched the glass
construction of its earlier Optimus G in
favor of a glossy plastic build we're
familiar with and frankly tired of but
the g2 isn't without some tricks up its
sleeve in contrast with the ones
conventional side mounted volume rocker
and top mounted power standby key LG has
placed the g2 star go around back
directly beneath the camera that's
resulted in a smooth casing free of side
penetrations and bumps and it's also
allowed LG to slim the bezels flanking
the g2 s display it's one of the
thinnest bezels we've ever seen anywhere
at 1/10 of an inch to a side bringing
the g2 much closer to the all screen
face coveted by many so if you're
looking for a larger display the g2 will
be the way to go
the 5.2 inch versus 4.7 inch Gulf is a
pretty big one but in terms of display
quality these panels are pretty close to
equal which is to say they're both
amazing while white tones are just the
slightest bit more pure on the g2 colors
on both of these screens are incredibly
vibrant with excellent viewing angles
and comparable performance in direct
sunlight
so they're both LCD they're both 1080p
with pixel density north of 400
PPI and they're both outstanding screens
if you're more concerned with the spec
sheet the comparison gets a little
muddier while the HTC one is no slouch
with its Snapdragon 600 running at 1.7
gigahertz the Snapdragon 800 under the
hood of the g2 is one of the newest
smartphone processors available it runs
at the higher clock speed of 2.2 6
gigahertz sports a newer GPU and
incorporates support for smart power
saving and other features backing that
up on the g2 is the same 2 gigs of ram
you'll find on the HTC One and the g2
comes in 16 or 32 gig storage options
but not in the 64 gig flavor of some HTC
ones neither phone offers expandable
storage beyond this and neither includes
a removable battery but each offers
Wi-Fi 802.11 silicon activity options
and each builds in an IR transmitter if
you want to draft your smartphone into
clicker duty for your TV it's in
software that even more major
differences emerge and they start right
at the lock screen while the one
requires you to push the power standby
button in conveniently located at the
top of the device to unlock a phone the
g2 provides an alternative a double tap
on the screen will wake the device and
put it back to sleep LG calls this
feature knock-on and it really is quite
handy on a device this big even if it's
sometimes inconsistent getting under
that lock screen you can see just how
different the philosophies are in the
design of the software skins running
atop Android HTC Sense
on the one is a model of simplicity and
understated design sheathing the entire
experience in a muted gray that it
manages to look classy without seeming
dull or drab
by contrast the g2 is none of that it's
an explosion of colors options icons and
what can only be called cruft and chrome
we come down pretty hard on Samsung for
its cartoonish
TouchWiz UI but LG really takes the cake
in terms of making you feel like you're
inside a freakishly over-engineered
anime version of Android I mean just
look at that notification area it's
crazy this seems to be a side effect of
a broader philosophical disconnect while
HTC treats the one as a smartphone and a
smartphone only LG seems to want the g2
to be part phone and part phablet the
memo functionality is here again
despite the g2 s lack of a stylus and
there are no fewer than three separate
ways to multitask only one of which is
routinely useful in our experience
fortunately LG's inclusion of everything
up to the kitchen sink hasn't affected
responsiveness the g2 is at least as
responsive as the HTC One and you know
that's saying something since the latter
is one of the most reliable devices
we've encountered in this aspect
neither of these phones seems to know
what lag is and for that both HTC and LG
deserve kudos what's more LG's g2 offers
seemingly limitless options for
customizing the software experience from
glitzy lock screen and home screen
animations to changing the position and
function of buttons in the home tray and
so much more
if customization is something you value
in your Android experience it's really
hard to top the g2 for sheer flexibility
right out of the box
HTC built its so-called ultra pixel
camera technology into the one in order
to produce better low-light photos which
it does via optical image stabilization
paired to a four megapixel sensor with
larger than usual pixel size LG has
built some of the same innovations into
the g2 but here it's paired optical
image stabilization with a 13 megapixel
sensor along with many more options in
the viewfinder which is tricked out with
options just like the rest of the
software load
particularly notable here is manual
focus which we don't see much outside of
Nokia's offerings and it's great to have
here putting the still images
side-by-side the g2 superiority becomes
apparent in medium light the cameras
produce similar results with the HTC one
even gaining a slight edge in utility
thanks to its wider field of view but
get the phones into the dark and the one
just tries too hard its photos are blown
out and noisy making text unreadable in
some cases while the g20 toes aren't
without their own share of noise the
results are much sharper and the colors
much closer to life that remains true
indoors where the g2 consistently
produces the cleaner crisper shots even
in its default out of box shooting
resolution of only 10 megapixels the put
simply the g20 is much better than the
ones in still mode the video performance
in 1080p resolution is a little harder
for us to judge so we'll leave it up to
your own eyeballs here's some samples
comparing the video recording capability
of the HTC One and the LG g2 the global
unbranded version both these devices
feature optical image stabilization of
the utilization that the HTC One has a 4
megapixel ultra pixel camera
the LG g2 packs at 13 at megapixel unit
settings are out of box defaults on each
as we tested the g2 and the one on two
different networks in the Greater Boston
area we won't compare them directly in
terms of network performance you'll have
to wait for our full review for our
thoughts on the g2s quality but it's
worth noting that historically the one
has bested almost every other smartphone
in this regard that's a period us
entrace 8 - endurance however we got
over twenty seven hours of mixed use out
of the g2 on its first charge before it
gave up the ghost the HTC One has never
given us endurance anywhere close to
that again wait for our full review of
the g2 for more detailed battery info
but between these two devices the g2 is
the hands-down winner and that holds
true in most of our benchmark results as
well
if you've got room in your heart for one
more reversal though the HTC one turns
right around and spanks the g2 in terms
of external audio boom sound is called
boom sound for a reason the front firing
speakers on the one delivered louder
sound than the bottom mounted speakers
on the g2 and the sound is also richer
fuller bass here than the somewhat tinny
output on the LG phone the HTC One
remains the device to beat despite the
individual strengths each of these
devices brings to the table this
comparison yields a very straightforward
result of these two phones the g2 is the
one for the power user it's cutting-edge
internals are backed up by excellent
battery life and a solid camera along
with the software load packing nearly
every feature LG has ever cooked up if
you're looking for an alternative to
Samsung's Galaxy family the g2 brings
the heat but it does so at the expense
of simplicity its UI is colorful but
overdone one might almost call the g2 a
phablet trapped in a smartphone's body
if that doesn't sound appealing to you
if you're looking for something a little
more finely honed and a little more
cohesive the HTC One is your ticket it's
camera does not hold a candle to the g2
s and many of its specs fall short of
the LG even monsters but it's got
incredible build and call quality the
best speakers you can get on a smart
phone and software that's both
attractive and simple to use we think it
manages to deliver a better Android
experience on the whole to those outside
the power user category your mileage as
always may vary so we encourage you to
check out these phones side-by-side on
your own at your local carrier store
well we talked about it in this video
but it didn't make an appearance we will
be comparing the LG g2 to the samsung
galaxy s4 we're also going to take a
little bit deeper look at some of the
carrier variants of the LG g2 in
addition to the double unboxing we've
already done and the full review of
course will be up quite soon and pocket
down before you go anywhere please like
this video if you did enjoy it leave a
comment down below if you have something
to say follow us on social media where
we make a lot of noise and thank you
sincerely for watching well
next time which one should you choose
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is LG g2 vs. HTC
