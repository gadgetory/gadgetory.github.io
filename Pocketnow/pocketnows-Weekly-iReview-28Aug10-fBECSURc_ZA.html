music event the dev team calls it quits
with jailbreaking iOS four point oh
point2 and rumors of a new itunes social
networkers somewhere around there but
we're not sure we really like it all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter and
welcome to the pocket nail Iver be the
show we go through all the weeks cool
and not-so-cool inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices let's start off with
a cool well it's evident that many of us
were waiting for Apple to finally let us
know when they were going to make their
music event that they always do in the
month of September well it's now been
confirmed they're gonna have their event
on September first and we have a little
couple of predictions about this media
than coming up first of all we do expect
for iOS 4.1 to be released and we do
expect that this release actually brings
game center to the iOS devices we've
been waiting for versus the release of
iowa's four-point-oh another one of our
predictions is that es we do expect for
itunes to finally go to the cloud and
some sort of form factor or that I don't
know mobile B becomes free or something
you never know and yes we do expect for
the ipod touch 4th generation to finally
be released we do expect it to bring the
retina display support and also the both
dual front-facing and also backward
cameras that will bring you front-facing
facetime calls through email and also
720p video and we do expect it to bring
a smaller form factor though we're not
sure what Apple is going to make of it
if it's also going to keep the current
form factor or bring the glass on glass
design that they currently have and the
good thing is our chief news editor
chung knew it is going to be there to
actually cover everything live so let's
see what steve-o has for us coming up on
September first but those of you who
like to rent movies on the go and don't
like to carry your iPad around Netflix
has finally updated their iOS
application to work on the iphone and
the ipod touch so yes you can now keep
your current subscription actually watch
movies on the TV continue on your iPad
or continue on your iPhone for only nine
dollars a month which is a really good
bargain compared to any
the other services that are offered
around and the cool thing is it's
actually available for a 30-day trial so
you can actually just try it out see if
you like it and then beat those just
don't continue with the service so our
recommendation is it's really cool
expect their app store pick to come out
very soon now that that team has finally
confirmed that they will not be
releasing an iOS 4.2 jailbreak update
now why is this in the cool sexual
because they are confirming that they're
gonna actually focus on giving us the
iOS 4.1 jailbreak as soon as they can
and everybody knows that the betas out
there for developers already so I
considered cool the jailbreak team is
actually working on getting us the 4.1
jailbreak as soon as they can and not
focusing on something that's already on
their way out so dev team good luck we
know he can do it and keep on with the
good work guys I if I were Apple I'd
actually hire you guys that's the way
things are supposed to be now for those
people who think that the iphone is only
worth texting your grandma you'll be
happy to know that a guy from Dallas was
actually able to prevent a burglary in
his home using the iphone now how is he
able to do this well there's this little
for the five dollar app called icam that
actually is able to use your webcam at
home or Wi-Fi webcams to capture
everything that's happening in your home
and i'll send you push notification to
your device whatever it sends his
movement so he sense movement on his
iphone 4 and he was able to call the
cops and suddenly even though the
burglars were not being able to be
caught by the police at least he was
able to prevent something to happen so
what did i do i bought the app just the
next day and it's been working fine so
expect our app store pick very soon
google has finally released their chrome
to phone service to work on iOS devices
this includes the ipod touch the iphone
and the ipad now what does this consists
of well if you're on google chrome right
now and you actually want to chair I
don't know our URL a phone number or
anything else with your device you could
actually just do this through the Chrome
extension now the problem is on iOS
devices this currently just you works
with URLs but it's a start people people
that actually think that you know apple
and ghouls are actually fighting well
it can probably not be the case because
things like this are still being
released so let's see what happens now
on to the not-so-cool one of our
predictions for the September event is
that apple will finally release the sort
of cloud based itunes service that
everybody's expecting I mean they bought
lolla so we are expecting to be able to
stream music from home that we don't
want to carrier probably we can't afford
a more expensive iPhone with larger
storage and we just want to keep some
music at home and then continue I don't
know listening to music streamed on our
device but there are rumors that the
whole thing is actually not going to go
to the cloud the probability is that
Apple is going to release a social
network free to share bots on music now
what's cool about that I mean can I do
that on facebook and on myspace I mean
why would I actually need a I don't know
social network for sharing comments on
music because apparently the rumor
states that it's not going to be for
sharing music so what's the point part
of news that is actually getting very
boring is Apple suing everybody for
everything esting spend Apple I mean why
do you have to be suing everybody if
your devices were so cool and magical
wouldn't they be able to stand on their
own without your need of suing everybody
for I don't know everything what's next
you're gonna sue motorola because they
invented the cell phone a no that was
your idea and I Johnny I it's actually
designed it I can actually see you
coming up with that eventually so the
way things are is HTC's and apples
patent infringement lawsuit is really
going bad i mean HTC is saying that
apple is really wrong with their pens
and you know I'm actually with them
because apples pans are too broad they
want to cover everything you just can't
cover everything things have to be
really specific and the problem is some
of the things that HTC is arguing is
actually on for example the slide to
unlock pattern that actually Apple got
granted a week ago so things are
actually going to get bad don't really
know what to make of it but really Apple
you know that attitude really sucks
that's not the way to make business I
mean I think your devices were good
enough for them to stand on their own
and you not to have to have to be
fighting everybody that's really the
reason
and why you really can't mingle with
other companies and I don't blame
competition for doing their best to make
it better than you do that's it for
today's i reviewed thank you very much
for watching any questions or comments
you have about this video let us know at
twitter.com slash pocket now sweets or
youtube.com slash pocket now video
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
