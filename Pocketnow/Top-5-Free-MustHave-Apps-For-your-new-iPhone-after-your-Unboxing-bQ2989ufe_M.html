finally got it either it's the iPhone 4s
the iPhone 4 the 3GS you finally pulled
it out of the box and that kind of hurt
but you're wondering now what to do with
the phone so well I'm Jaime from
pocketnow.com and here's our top 5 free
applications we recommend you get for
your new iPhone number 5 Evernote or
pretty much any other notetaking
application that's free now the cool
thing about Evernote here is the fact
that you can not only create notes you
can actually do from your PC from your
phone we even have a blackberry and
Android device an iPad pretty much
anywhere that Evernote runs you could
actually run it and then you can sync
your notes between devices really easily
quite seamlessly cool thing again is
that it's free and the fact he could
actually even take images voice notes
and just about everything to categorize
your notes and with the amount of
storage you get you really think if it's
worth it to have any other notes
application type remember note number
four is a really good storage
application and well there are a lot of
options like for example box net sugar
sync but the one we recommend the most
is Dropbox
the reason being is because Dropbox is
pretty much the easiest one it
integrates really well with your iOS
device meaning you can actually get an
email from anybody it'll give you the
option to upload whichever attach file
you get into the Dropbox immediately you
get two gigabytes free storage so a lot
of people can actually pay for any other
option but the coolest thing is that on
your PC or Mac it will create a folder
and you can just drag and drop files
into it photos and just about whatever
you could think of and you can carry
these photos on your PC Mac tablet phone
just about everywhere the Dropbox works
and again it's another free application
but we do recommend you get number three
definitely has to do with music now your
iPhone brings a lot of storage you can
definitely purchase a lot of your music
or use services like Spotify where you
have to pay for most cases or you can
pretty much go for Pandora which does a
really good job and detecting the music
that you like after you choose one song
the good thing about it is obviously
it's free and all you have to do is
register for the application and you
don't have to be worrying about your
storage on your device all you have to
lose
turn on Pandora and let it do the work
really good number two well go social I
mean the only reason smartphones got
really good over time was because of the
fact that they were really good to loose
to remain in touch with just about
everybody obviously the top number one
application out there's Facebook
everybody's after Facebook I could
mention Google+ but I have an account
out there and I really don't use it so
pretty much it's Facebook and then
obviously it's Twitter the good thing
about Twitter is it integrates really
good with your iPhone you can upload
photos from the photo application and
everything but then again it's Twitter
so again Facebook has its own
application also has a free messenger
application all you want to do is
message but still Facebook is pretty
much like the biggest thing out there
and well your iPhone has a really cool
application to take the best out of it
it even has the new Timeline feature so
make the best out of that and before we
get to number one let's talk about a
category that's out there but still
didn't make the cut and it's messaging
and the reason why is because well not
all applications are free pretty much
the best one out there is what's
happened the only reason why whatsapp is
really good sadly about except for the
price tag which sometimes it cost a
dollar sometimes it gets free look out
for it but the good thing is if your
friends have a blackberry you can
whatsapp with them if your friends have
an Android phone you get whatsapp with
them if they have a Windows Phone you
can whatsapp with them and pretty much
that's the really cool thing about it
it's like blackberry messenger on
steroids because you can talk with
pretty much any platform so let's again
and then make the cut because it's not a
free application but it's also something
we recommend you get and while the top
number one application or category
should look for on your iPhone is
actually a phone substitution
application now the reason being is the
fact that well any phone is to make
phone calls but why make phone calls we
have to pay for them if you have free
substitution options now the iPhone
brings face time which is your face to
face a voice conversation application
but the problem face time is pretty much
you need Wi-Fi and then the other person
needs an iOS device or a Mac so a really
good option is Skype and the reason why
is well you can make free phone calls
Skype the Skype phone calls or Skype the
PC phone calls or if the other person
has a Skype phone number you can also
make free phone calls out of that
obviously have to pay for that and then
afterwards well you have the option to
actual
to make video calls with Skype just
about any other platform other options
obviously have Google Voice and then
there's really cool application called
boxer which turns your phone into a
push-to-talk application to be able to
communicate with everybody else so the
cool thing about Skype again boxer just
about these other services as well you
pay for an air data plan the voice plan
but you don't really need anything but
data once you're in a really good
coverage section so think about those
and well that's pretty much it for top 5
if there's any specific application
wants to go into depth or review just
leave us a comment down below don't
forget to leave us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I'm high memory
