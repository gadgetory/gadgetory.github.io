pocket now and not a musician seriously
think you're doing anyway so we are live
welcome everybody to a special edition
of pocket now live Samsung has got some
stuff to talk about today we've been
waiting for this event pretty much all
year we are going to find out about the
galaxy note 3 hot off the heels of one
of the most popular smartphones of all
time the galaxy note 2 which was a lot
more successful in the first galaxies
known as people start to realize that
these big phones with with a stylus
actually makes a lot of sense we are
here with a bunch of guys were here with
Adam and Taylor and hi May and Joe in
his automobile on his nexus he's in his
prius is it at Ostia how's the mpg game
going all right now I'm getting zero
miles if avail I'm significant your line
well we've got some feedback in sport
 about where's that crazy if not
coming from with shame who's
watching the stream Adam hey it's not in
its not me can't possibly me a lot more
success first close me eyes ok everyone
move your microphone except for me yeah
good so galaxy note 3 we kind of know
what to expect already without actually
seeing it there haven't been that many
leaks about the galaxy note 3 except
kind of these front panels that look
like the galaxy note 2 but with a
thinner bezel and just like from the
galaxy s4 or three to four we're going
to get thinner bezels we're going to get
a higher res screen 1080p which is going
to be really nice we're probably going
to get over that two gigabyte of RAM
threshold that no smartphone has gone
over yet probably to 2.5 or three
gigabytes of RAM with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 CPU the fastest mobile
chip that's out there it's it's going to
be pretty amazing what I'm looking for
is enhanced S Pen features I think
features in the note 2 and the note 1
were a little bit gimmicky for my own
use and really didn't didn't work
towards the trade-off of having such a
big phone I'll take a big phone with my
small hands if it really increases my
productivity so I'm going to present
that question first as we're watching
the live stream guys what will it take
for you to use a note 3 as your daily
driver let's start with Taylor because
Taylor is a big note to user yeah it's
interesting because I've kind of changed
my stance I used the note 2 since the
last announcement which was last
september's is and I loved it and I
finally kind of met my match with the Z
ultra it's just too big and I kind of
came to the conclusion that you know all
this extra real estate is kind of a
waste because I'm not like you said
getting any more productivity out of it
the s-pen does help but I'm really not
using my phone in any different way than
it would the 4.7 inch Moto X the one or
even a 5 inch phone I'm surprising you
say that Taylor because no matter what
phone you're reviewing you always seem
to have the note 2 also in your other
pocket yeah and I have for a year now
and and maybe I'm just kind of taking a
sabbatical from large phones because the
Z ultra was just way too big and be very
upset yeah it did it upset me and it
ruined my life um are you here any
recovered I'm in the recovery phase
right now go into therapist and whatnot
drugs don't know yeah so I kind of took
a step back I carry two phones now and
for the majority of the last year I
carried just one phone so that was a big
difference carrying a big phone if
you're only having one phone in your
pocket one thing having two phones makes
it a lot different and having a large
foam as a second phone is yeah makes my
pants really tight that's too much
information I should also mention i
should also mention that today we're
expecting the the announcement of the
galaxy gear samsung's first SmartWatch
which I think has the opportunity to do
what Apple was expected
to do which is propel the SmartWatch
industry forward um a few you guys use
the pebble watch I don't use it because
I don't think it's going to do enough
for me Joe's got his pebble watch their
Taylor's guys have a watch Adam looks
like he's getting pebble watch Jaime's
got some silver anything that doesn't
this how many does that tell you how
many emails you have does it tell you
the temperature you know I I think my
phone does a better job man I think
that's my problem but it looks just like
a pebble I was gonna say I'm just gonna
put a wrist strap on my fear ah well
that that's a smart watch so yeah now
we're talking close enough so so like
this is this is pretty big I'm probably
more excited for the SmartWatch thing
because I think there's a big future in
in a wearable computer on your wrist but
I don't think anyone's figured it out
yet and I think the technology is almost
not ready and we're going to see a
device from Samsung i think is going to
be a little thick a little weak on
battery life and a little bit limited
and i think the real year of the
SmartWatch I hate to say it it's going
to be when Apple comes out with theirs
because you know they're the kind of
guys that will come up with something
that is a little beyond our expectations
and will fulfill any that we didn't know
we have but maybe Samsung you know will
surprise us so we are watching the live
stream here and we are watching violins
now hey Brandon you reviewed an LG Smart
Watch years ago oh how was that oh my
god I I was looking at that a few months
ago that was barely a smart watch it was
it was actually like a miniature phone
you put a sim card in it um you're
kidding me no it wasn't like a terminal
like the pebble um you could die it had
a dialer on it it was very Dick Tracy
like and I I don't remember what
operating system in Iran um I think
they're about to show the galaxy note 3
yeah they're talking about the note 2 in
the note right now you know they they've
got to stop this hyper quase thing
especially if they're going a little bit
bigger on the screen you got to have a
good grip on such a large phone somebody
say that's what she said anyway check
this out some adjectives to describe the
victory slimmer lighter larger faster
I rest after punk Wow yeah we are so
that punk when you need them how about
Kanye one lunch is I Kanye yeah I ever
saw him I saw him for the note to a US
launch event and i did not enjoy myself
i did because it was an open bar but
that's only why wow so they've got this
awesome immersive surround screen thing
holy moly I so do you think they can't
go any bigger yes right there man oh my
gosh it's a razor blade oh no oh now now
they're using the number monikers oh
that was numerals so its galaxy note 3
with a three nah they're done with it or
else people Thunder yes oh snap son what
are we looking at is that a leather oh
yeah yeah it is maybe that's a cupboard
a special cover Wow stitching on it haha
I thought has stitches there no it looks
huge it looks like the note too but like
we described thinner bezels school more
squarish screens bigger definitely it's
thinner I mean exactly like we oh that's
really cool how they put the three and
like cursive oh that's interesting very
much that's a cool move there it is
that's too cool hey look that thing
doesn't look that big in his hand I mean
how big can that guy be it doesn't look
like it helps any bezel you know just
like the galaxy s4 it's exactly like
this looks exactly like this the S Pen
is totally different yeah accordingly
according to wikipedia he's 8 foot to
know I was about to say that's is that
so was that basketball who's that
basketball player that used to play for
the Houston uh what's best chinese
basketball player for you yo sorry
forgot about that Taylor yah yah yah
what is what is basketball look at that
yeah design that's I think that's an
optional cover the weather stitch thing
I think that helped me I'm on board I'm
all aboard you're on board for a extra
bulky cover that's made out of faux
leather yes
so Apple is moving away from the stitch
leather and Samsung is pulling it in uh
well software and hardware two different
things photo recipes and I photorealism
should die a horrible horrible painful
death alright so so apparently one of
the things that this phone is gonna do
better is powerful multitasking oh god I
would love to see that see that that's
really the point of a big screen what's
the point about carrying a gigantic
screen if it's just gonna be a bigger
experience of something you can already
do in a smaller phone there's no point
you don't need to see Twitter in five
point seven inches of glory you know
much no no you know I guess that's the
only reason why you know I wanted that
note 2 and I enjoy using the note 2
because of the multiscreen but I now do
that in the gs4 but but I guess that's
the only reason why I wanted it really
yeah there really is no phone that
really gets multi thing right yet and
hopefully this is the one I doubt it but
hopefully God have you tried the
espelette screen thing on the Galaxy
products uh not the only galaxy product
i have is a gs3 which doesn't have that
i have done the whole watch the video
while your texting thing so that's kind
of fun but but i haven't actually had a
side by side split screen that was one
good thing about the the Z Ultra is a
sony has done some pretty cool stuff
with multitasking they they allow you to
turn any widget that you have into a
floating app or a small app as they call
it so you can turn like I can turn my
twitter feed if i use plume i can turn
that twitter feed into a floating app
and do several different things at once
using that that's interviews it is
actually yeah okay so wait a second are
we look they're talking about the LTE
speeds what do you do what season yeah
baby yo look at the s-pen health how it
kind of like hangs out I don't think
it's optional that's not an optional
cover every picture they've shown is I
had that cover on the back I think
you're right yeah okay wait a second
wait a second he's showing his watch
what uh there it is oh my
allow the guy all right it's it's a lot
of brushed metal a lot of brush metal
and TouchWiz oh god please no oh god no
no he's wearing an orange watch it
doesn't look quite right for a
businessman oh my god as well is this a
pocket-handkerchief though so I just
tweeted galaxy gear nope because that
looks like a glorified pebble with a
touchscreen you know my my tail is is
flaccid right now there's no I find it
very unattractive I mean first
impressions really matter and I don't
think I would want to wear that it's too
like techie looking dish out it's not
elegant do you guys agree knowing why I
would have loved a metallic ban and
that's yeah that's the way I like him
that doesn't look like it's compatible
with other bands though so yeah I mean
you got screws so you might be able to
replace it with another samsung band but
you can't put your sweet I don't even
remember what the pdx I don't know what
it is not PD kk t things are
transmission and suppose so ah come on
come on Joe that would be nice BMO what
what is this thing go you mind can we
can we try to figure this out what does
it do it makes calls or texts calls err
ok let's see it smart freedom so you get
notifications I mean it'll be
interesting to see what it actually does
yeah it matches your phone color though
it is that's all it does that's it
that's it it's just a screen you greet
you in the morning tells you whatever
you want SmartWatch with in my orange
camera it has a camera it has a camera
I'll check out this promo what oh my
gosh your Galaxy Note it does not have a
camera ok no another galaxy bro hey Jim
Hey Joe look I mean listen but by the
way listeners though and readers and
viewers those of you that are joining
right now we're going through the
Samsung event and this probably the
fastest event which kind of has me
worried because that could mean that we
are getting tap dancing after this
finishes the guy is really the guy just
breezed through the Galaxy Note 3 and
then he breezed through the gap
a year and now we're getting the galaxy
note 10.1 well and i'll probably take 15
minutes on it this is this is a surprise
okay oh my god yes the screen
resolutions 2560 by 1600 that's the same
as the nexus 10 thank god that's going
to be an awesome tablet final group it
only one over here to recreate the
tablet they already made I know okay
look it's gonna have twit it's got to
come to come with Twitter okay Brandon
let me understand is why would you
prefer this tablet it not the nexus 10
that you can already buy because it's
it's it's a more productivity or into
tablet with a with a stylus I mean it's
good perfect for getting a little bit
more work done also gonna be hyper blues
it's gonna be hyper glazed well and I'm
not sure I necessarily need a stylist on
ax ya Tony highness it's it's probably
going to have a Snapdragon 800 which is
a lot better than the true Exodus look
at this 3 i'm really actually pretty
impressed that they're doing a tablet in
i believe i've noted on 15 minutes i
will probably buy the note 3 now because
really the only thing I didn't like
about the note 2 was hyper glaze yeah
it's gone and they replaced it with
stitched leather talari leather that's
all of it that wins me over man Taylor
take your note to apply some sandpaper
and you've got Saturday all right so we
got three new products denounced and now
the tap dancers on stage everyone no no
it looks like he's wearing some hipster
version google glass renewing is up with
this got this guy's shades what he wants
to be bono that's I told you it's a
hipster version of google glass now he's
apparently a very popular guy in the UK
I don't know who he is or what he does
but apparently he's very popular I think
cam Bunton of uh today's iphone told me
that I don't know maybe it's all
happened way too fast can some yes
that's what is it listen baby they
pretty much didn't talk about the galaxy
gear he just went through the fact that
you get notifications and then you have
camera what else is there to say about
this thing I mean I guess that the
biggest news today is the fact that the
Galaxy Note just you know got much
better and pretty much the note tablet
version just became what it should have
been since day one I wish they would do
that with the 8-point know like like for
example I would like the 8-inch tablet
to have you know a much better
resolution display and everything I
don't know a big tablet with an S Pen is
like imagine that big thing and white
screen with the stylus I don't know it's
uncomfortable for me Joe you were viewed
it well yeah especially when you when
you've got a UI that's not tablet
oriented this not tablet specific that's
not him friendly it's just it's a big
screen and that's all it is and there's
something to be said for that but we
gotta get something where we're moving
more to a stylus friendly environment
we're having the stylist really adds
something in right now spen its its
novelty there are some things that it
does well and a whole bunch of things
that it doesn't that it should do well
yeah hey guys yeah I eat I need to jump
off which it's convenient because
everything happened already Rob yeah but
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be watching later
to see what you guys actually think
about this one some specs hit the wire
I'm watching my inbox for an official
press release and I we should afford it
or you guys send it to me um yeah but
yeah does have a the galaxy or does have
a camera I found an article on it nice I
oh yeah what what that's for I don't
know that's like a it's probably like a
vga camera alright so for those for
those of you that have just joined the
we were getting some few oh no Joe it's
she what were you saying sorry and
wouldn't it be cool with galaxy gear the
watch were miracast enabled and it was
basically a second screen so you could
have that to screen experience in your
pocket and on your wrist you can watch
youtube videos on your watch you want to
do that anybody pass I don't want to do
that I want a bigger screen to watch my
videos that a smaller one I don't know I
just I keep fumbling with the cons
of a SmartWatch it's just that I'm
trying to see ya it's like I have my
phone right here if I get a notification
I have the choice between looking at my
watch and looking at the phone and it's
it's like that whole air of you just
your thing it's like what's easier
looking at the display and touching it
or doing this let's see here if your
phones in your pocket looking at your
wrist is much easier that's the whole
room if you're driving for example that
can also be like the perfect distraction
by the way no I mean I have my hand on
the steering wheel or usually just one
hand and it's right here you just look
down its I'm not looking for you yeah
you're supposed to be looking on bro
yeah you oh just a notification on my
phone I'm gonna reach down and pick it
up and look or look down at it and if
it's right here on my wrist I'm already
I'm looking down two inches versus
staring down a my waist Taylor's ranch
in in his pockets get his phone he's
gonna run off that none and it's just
gonna be a sad day instead Hirano for
them we actually actually have auto
breaking on my car just for nuns it
should be men and sorry Adam you're gone
couldn't hear anything yet yeah I'm
starting to learn to read lips but
anyways listeners viewers welcome to our
special episode of the Parker now why
we're covering yet damn son got gotten
used to that sorry sorry Adam but we're
get going through the Samsung event we
will give you a little recap we have a
new Galaxy Note 3 we have a new galaxy
gear which we still don't know much
about and we've got a new Galaxy Note
10.1 the differences are you know you'd
think that they're not substantial
because the Galaxy Note 3 looks a lot
like the galaxy s4 but you know I think
Samson got the cue that nobody likes the
hyper glaze coding because they've got
this like sort of Matt stitch leather um
a sort of a back panel instead of the
current hyper glaze that we see in the
s4 so that's that's really like stepping
it up a notch like okay business
professional yay yeah it's like okay
fine you know that's actually very bad
blackberry you remember the old bull
love urgent that I love that design yeah
yeah so thank go ahead I guess it was
the ninety ninety nine hundred um the
one with no leather back on it it wasn't
it was that it was the 9000 action well
there was the nice out of all the 9900
headed to several of them did yes so I
guess they finally got that Q that
nobody likes the hyper glaze they're
getting rid of it that's great i wish
they wouldn't i wish they would offer a
nominal go ahead what he's talking about
the i can't hear him the audio is very
low really let me see if i get him here
okay so he's describing the note
designed the whole new aesthetic he's
called the back cover leather but it's
not actual leather okay okay listen we
don't we don't want it to be real
leather we just don't want it to be
shiny and all glossy and ugly that's
really what we want I mean Jace of the
bowl that was never it was never leather
in the case of the bolt no no it was
never leather um but yeah I mean okay so
we've got a bigger galaxy s4 and they
made this new backing which I wish they
would bring to the galaxy as far as well
they might you'd like their flip covers
or hopefully hopefully and for seventy
dollars they better because that's what
they're charging for that damn flip
cover I told myself that I wasn't going
to get the note 3 that I didn't care and
something as simple as leather on the
back or pleather has totally changed my
mind that's all it takes for me I'm so
easy to win over okay so we've got a
couple of color options look at this jet
black classic white and blush pink color
options Motorola is going to sue Samsung
because they also have a blush color
option yeah well pathway a second there
are apparently more color options or
that could be just leatherbacks that you
can buy that are optional I think that
yeah I mean look we've got the storage
we've all it rain blue what they have a
flip wallet case that's oh look at that
look at that look at the front panel the
thing is there is this huge delay in the
you see the front panel you see the swap
and I think we lost Joe yeah we did it's
the S viewer coverage what they're
called
holiday glam hey that's pretty swanky
whoa I like that red oh that red okay so
we're looking at more colors right now
that they're offering they've got
electric read some sort of unarmed this
I said this on the podcast I said that
Samsung is going to jump in the color
option thing too and all they're gonna
do is throw in a battery door and it
makes sense i mean what in the case of
samsung it is just so easy for them to
do it now and they kind of did it with
the galaxy s3 you remember those like
blue I've actually got this for the s3
yeah you've got that for the note 2 so
you know I guess that's so far um the
galaxy note 3 is not at all a
disappointment obviously we have to wait
for our hands on coverage from Tony and
Michael which are on in Berlin at the
show floor um probably my biggest
concern is the galaxy gear we didn't see
anything they pretty much just the guy
just showed his notification on his
watch that Samsung CEO and then he came
up and said ok so I just gotta know they
just got a notification and Joe and got
some lovely feedback you know it might
be coming up though cuz you know they
started off the the mini presentation
went note three gear and then followed
by the the the 10 so now as did the note
3 again so they could be coming around
to the gear again so wait yes doesn't
make sense be hey this is what we got
and then people tuned out like this
we'll see how that goes welcome because
learn how to make look president tap
dancing kids does make sense is that
where we are no oh wait wait a second no
tap dancing please please no tap dancing
come on I don't know those shows were
kind of clicky when he was coming out on
stage they were British hey welcome
right you all right so Joe before we
lose you again first impressions on the
galaxy note 3 galaxy gear and the 10.1
what do you think ok so disclaimers up
front I am mobile I have not seen what
you guys have been seeing so I'm going
just on what you have been relaying to
me another it has pleather I love that I
you guys saw the back of my Nexus
or so it's it had leather but it was
final I did that I think it's
professional I think it looks good I'm
finally not super slick slimy blade so
I'm really happy with yeah okay and and
what about You mr. Dowd before you go on
mute yeah millions of fake cows are
shaking in their boots right now as
they're looking at the note through this
note 3 it's pretty much what I expected
bigger slimmer longer faster stronger
and all that Kanye stuff um the the gear
I just I'm so on the fence about smart
watches I just think people are I think
they're almost trying to do too much I
just I'm just not sure that the
SmartWatch is there yet I think you
don't know you don't know yeah usually
you up and we can we Anna we lost you
man who else you know we will give you a
choice of a new computer or Adam doubt
is our new mine at pocket matter okay
all right it's funny I'll go off on the
High God are you touching your keyboard
at all because it auto mutes if you hit
the keyboard so yeah yeah when you talk
just put your hands up like this okay so
while you're okay that's true mr. moon
this is a new feature here um air
command so good more proprietary
pictures no wait a sec that's actually
cool like it's good as we cannot yeah
and the galaxy note 2 u.u tap twice with
the s pen and it would give you the
notes but now you get more options you
can actually tap and hold and you get
the option of a screenshot it's like
that whole next is dumb actually that
that that was not Nexus that was
actually the whole camera UI from the
the Motorola Xoom from
like years ago I remember like no like
the quick command or the quick controls
in the browser that that is no longer
around or pie controls yeah the
ventricles exactly that that's actually
cool what about you Taylor how are you
feeling about everything um I'll
probably get one I wasn't gonna get one
I didn't care and now I'll probably get
one yeah yeah you know it my personal
thing did we see how big the screen is
because I haven't read anything on it
and I've not only been like listening
like Tim person so I think it's
something look up uh hold on hold on us
great see twitch other uh it's gonna be
defined okay five point seven inches on
the display stop getting bigger ah the
way it is on weight the weight is 168
grams does anybody remember what was the
weight of the note 183 how much do you
weigh let me try oh that's actually like
a lot lighter um I'm pretty sure this
one wait a second is that lighter than
the Lumia 920 wait hold on i'm looking
it up the 920 is 180 i believe yeah
that's like 183 is a note too so yeah I
had that right I got a really good
memory uh yes 2920 is 185 so yes it's
lighter well in the no tools letter I
guess all right so how many viewers do
we have Taylor we have 255 viewers okay
thank you for joining our live stream of
what's going on at the Samsung event I
guess that uh you know I guess we're not
disappointed about what we're seeing I
you know we are phablet users at least
Taylor and I we like the note 2 and i
think that the note 3 it's funny all it
took was a backplate all it took was a
different back plate for us to be like
okay yeah we want this phone and that
should tell samsung something yeah well
yeah so it's it's really in our court as
customers to really make a big deal out
of this and say we like this we want
this so they bring us to their phone
line
beautiful I don't want a leatherback on
my smart watch though so damn good for
them back on that strap maybe back to
Washington yeah yeah that's going to be
guarding I was just going to say the the
one thing that doesn't look like it's
changed is the fake metal trimmer on the
outside so that I didn't like that only
s4 didn't like it on the s3 and like
only s2 I've never liked it or the the
nexus 4 I just don't like fake metal it
you're you're either going to use metal
or use plastic don't try to make me
think you're using metal and then in the
case of blackberry what was that
metallic trim was it plastic or metal do
you remember it depends on what phone it
was the bold 9000 was metal a lot of the
times it was it was most the time was
plastic with the bold 9000 was aluminum
yeah yeah thats its man i want this
guy's glasses i need a pair of shades
like um somebody in the comments on
YouTube said his name and he's the host
of the gadget show reasonably popular
his name is jason bradbury i have no
clue who he is but i have AC library
jason bradbury that's I guess popular in
the UK not here no offense but I don't
know he is we've got some more comments
on YouTube we love you pocket now thanks
for live coverage thank you for joining
really appreciate it vardaan is telling
us that it's a 5.7 inch 1080p display
yes I wish we could do you have the
pixel pixel per inch calculator I
Brandon's not here yeah a resolution is
a 1080 yeah yeah Brandon's like an
automatic so we're getting cilix this
stuff up before that's why yeah yeah
yeah 8680 stop 386 386 that's that's
good okay so apparently now 11
interesting twist here apparently this
phone is not offering a 16 gigabyte
option apparently they're starting with
32 gigs nothing wrong with that now
appreciate that one that's that's really
that's I want to know the new contract
pricing and I need to check my email to
Seoul Alaskan 32 and a 64 yeah yeah 3264
plus expandable storage oh ho that's
beautiful you Adam doubt he says his
computer is just not handling it well so
he's off we all miss you out of God well
so long mr. mime we'll see you next time
okay so somebody's asking us how are the
comments to the note 3 in relationship
to the Xperia z1 so these are two
different category phones um the Xperia
z1 is actually what the experience he
should have always been I think that's
our general consensus before we started
this call um obviously the problem with
the z1 is that we're still waiting to
get our hands on it because um the
biggest issue with the Xperia Z is hey I
was there at CES when they announced it
and I did not see any any viewing angle
issues until we actually got the review
unit so yeah we don't really know I
remember I look at the display from all
angles and everything looked fine until
I review units arrived it's like if
they're made a last-minute engineering
decision to go for a much cheaper
display but it's not really what we saw
at the event that was the event that a
guy grabbed a phone out of my hand while
I was shooting a video really it was a
German guy I was shooting a video and I
was just I had my camera pressed up
against my body and I was holding the
phone talking about it and I did this
like I tilted my head back and he just
ripped it out of my hand started
shooting his own you're kidding me I was
not happy and by the time I finished
talking to him he put the phone down and
walked away yeah I was very angry what
did you get all that on film no that's
that ok start off the camera when I
think I might go a little crazy yeah so
so far I guess that the biggest the
biggest mystery here is is what to
expect from the galaxy gear I mean even
a samsung executive came up and said
that it was a concept product that
apparently it won't be like
the mainstream device that a lot of
people are expecting and I guess that's
actually accurate i mean the CEO barely
showed it off for those of you that are
just joined joining the event that's
pretty much the way it's gonna be I
don't think that they're actually going
to retail that thing until Apple pulls
over there SmartWatch so there um I
think you're showing off chat on does
anybody actually use chat on no no I
noticed that you can easily copy a
message from one side from one message
to let school BS friend that's cool but
nobody uses chat on nobody and literally
they had to ask someone to sign up so
they could shoot that little clip right
there okay okay so you know it's funny
because for example Fisher has a note to
and Taylor has a note to I have a note
to as well and I guess I'd like the only
one that doesn't really use the S Pen
much and and we were talking about this
on the pack podcast recently and I guess
the reason why I don't use it is because
yeah first of all you're kind of
obligated to TouchWiz meaning the S Pen
is completely I mean if you want to root
the phone and use the S Pen and anything
that is not touch was you can't well why
not just use your finger at that point
exactly and get well yeah but for
example I yeah the note and put the note
taking that's actually cool that's fine
but I guess that you really have to love
TouchWiz if you want to get yourself a
galaxy note that's like the you know the
bottom line yeah the the downside to
this is that we can't hope for a galaxy
amana galaxy google play edition get
note 3 and that's unfortunate because it
wouldn't be and this would be useless
but i was just going to say I carried
this around in my pocket just to feel
normal when I'm not using the note 2 oh
look at this Taylor they're doing the
whole small apps thing from the
experience on the note with the S Pen
huh so the calculator day Samsung's done
floating apps before yeah but they did
it with the tablets they didn't do it
with it with the phone well they've done
pop up video pop up browser yeah big
diet before yeah but not with the
calculator for example not with like
but you know who uses a calculator
nobody can calculate I do i do I suck at
numbers back in here man anyway okay the
galaxy gear versus the sony smartwatch
what are your options well the iWatch
wait for it uh the sony smartwatch don't
just don't do it don't do it please know
i guess i guess i guess my biggest
concern with the galaxy Gear's the fact
that it's just another sony smartwatch
it's just look the difference that you
get touch was on this one and you get a
camera at a camera and you get a camera
so you can you could totally be stalking
your friends with your watch be like hey
look at this on photo photo opportunity
come on people in the comments are
correcting me I said 386 pixels per inch
and they said actually it's 380 6.47
pixels per inch because that 47
absolutely matters that's awesome Cory
Watford thank you very much okay all
right point of further clarification a
pixel is a pixel you really can't get
sub pixels without breaking the math yes
yeah a little bit will give it so let's
round up I was talking in school so will
this round up because you can't have a
half pixel but but it's less than half
okay so we have to round out but no if
you're rounding four holes you can't
have a half so you have to round up you
can't have another person or half a
pixel and you can't count it out so
we're rounding up okay seven so it was
new stuff so somebody is asking us in
the comments if this is a non pentile
display do all the galaxy note 2 was a
non pentile display so we're just we're
guessing that they're sticking to the
RGB display range for was pinto yeah but
i guess the s4 is just something
different i guess they do that they jump
around you can't just they have no rhyme
and rhythm to it they're just really
like i will look true so sometimes they
know yeah the note 2 was non pentile so
we are assuming that the note 3 will be
non pentile as well but obviously we
still don't know that we it'sit's that's
kind of a tough one now one thing is for
example one of the things about this and
3 the special is apparently it'll and it
makes sense apparently there will be
just one unit that does all the LTE
bands that you need um which goes
completely against the rumors in the
past that there were seven different
units of the note 37 different variants
now apparently there is between one of
those leaks that we saw which were
probably prototypes apparently there
will be an active version of the note 3
that is something that will most
probably happens shoe that is something
that will make Michael very very happy
oh yeah it's gonna make Michael pee in
his pants probably something worse than
that but he'll you'll be able to use it
because it works when it's wet right
okay right that's that's what I'm saying
yeah yeah you gotta Joe you got it you
got the fine so you're saying he'll pee
in his pants just to test it yes going
directions I them and then you won't
have to send it back because nobody
wanted after that yeah so the mess on
the comments are saying my mom has a
note one and she's never uses the s-pen
I'm like well does she carried in a
backpack you guys remember how wide that
no one was that is why does the the LG
optimus view yeah but then that that
note one was like I remember when I saw
at the ferg for the first time in
Barcelona because I could I didn't see
it at Eddyville Tony saw it and I
couldn't see it until I got to Barcelona
the next year and I looked at that thing
and I was like man who is gonna buy this
thing and apparently a lot of people did
Wow deal so there's really not any
information on the note 3 yet not that
I'm saying no apparently we're
apparently we're going to talk about
wearables now so yes probably we will be
getting more information on the Galaxy
gear now let's hope because this is it's
weird how they did this presentation
with here will show you everything up
front and then it's over and I'll show
you more about it later again kind of
weird really backwards probably samsung
CEO didn't want to be you know he didn't
want to be on stage for a long time so
that's the reason why he announced
everything and then ok so here we go
apparently we are getting this
SmartWatch information now
all right in there there we go yeah it's
got a camera in the wristband oh so
there is no way you're gonna replace
that wristband for that wristband which
is the first thing that everybody
replaces when they get a pebble and how
many how long is it going to take to
scratch that lens up because it's right
here oh oh man that is maybe two who's I
deal with that that is that is gonna be
yeah that is the most scratched up part
of my band and is that natural like
where's your viewfinder most probably
the camera most probably that so you
have to look down at it you're gonna
look like this gonna be but this is
gonna be like the perfect tool for
candid shots as long as they don't make
this like a vga camera or something like
that hey somebody go out and make a
website right now just for candid active
shots or whatever film-- is where shop
smart watchful shots candid gear shots
candidate in here NSFW gear com two
categories one NSFW and one LOL sfw okay
three categories and everything else
just defaults to creepy yeah yeah
alright so paperwork though okay so
we're getting a comment that says
pentile will ruin the display samsung
please don't use it you know you know
pentile was an issue when you had qvga
can you make this noise again Hyman ok
it's ok entao is an issue with you it
has many gigs of ram yes what for for
like three photos what's the size of
that camera three gigs of ram and a two
point three gigahertz quad-core probably
Snapdragon 800 I'm guessing um you're
getting a Snapdragon 800 on the watch I
want to see that no no no no the note 3
i'm gonna talk about galaxy okay we're
talking on my school years a come on my
phone has two gigs of ram my watch has
fired what
we share gigabytes of RAM between each
other when that'd be cool you get
bluetooth Ram sharing okay so okay so
you're swiping through this that okay I
can say that a one inch touch screen
display is probably one of the worst
experiences I've ever had I my head it
with the little iPod Nano and I put a
watch band on it it was so awful man i
really want a tip the art there's
nothing state-of-the-art about a one
inch display okay is that okay is that
what that is that thing waterproof
that's what I want I'm never gonna buy a
watch if it's not waterproof very trap
well water resistant at least
water-resistant whatever three advil
that's the kind of the standard for
watches and then eat okay so is it with
me is it just me or I really want to
talk to somebody in samsung and just I
really want to learn what is their love
for black why are they always bringing
these black user interfaces everywhere
it's like why is that color black
emmalin you I amoled amoled is well I do
i do understand that but but come on
it's it's terrible I mean AMOLED it's
either battery life where or not yeah
you're there saving precious battery
life that's why I do it you got a point
so this is crafted by stainless steel it
is still alive you know that's
interesting because the iphone was
stainless steel and i was a heavy phone
1.63 inch Super AMOLED display with a
320 x 32 knee resolution single core 800
megahertz Exynos processor metal face
and I'm looking for megapixel count on
the camera 4 gigabytes of on-board
storage 299 s asking price $300 Wow five
hundred dollars for something that will
just save you a couple of seconds from
pulling
phone out of your pocket it's 1.9
megapixel camera 1.9 yeah oh yes yes
that's it that's what I wanted 720p what
do you want to stay yo I don't know if I
want to say it anymore huh come on fire
away go twice as much money for a pebble
for in this it's basically just a
colorable touchscreen with a camera yeah
and you're paying twice as much for it
it's gonna adds 1.9 megapixel camera
though you could take sweet shots with
that take a 720 video argument and say
but I've got a camera on my phone why
don't I just pull out my phone okay so
so the latest second apparently you
can't take calls with that thing
apparently you can relay the calls from
your phone to your watch speaker phone
yeah a Dick Tracy speaker phone tab yo
what's up how's everything shoot I don't
care about that can i search google now
from my watch that's really the only
thing that would even vindicate the Z
would be cool now ok Google now that
would ban ah yes a phone went crazy ok
now see that Taylor would be cool if you
could you know just interact with Google
now and not necessarily just whole what
the the speaker and microphone are in
the wristband so so yeah bro yeah oh oh
you're kidding these you're gonna pull a
mission impossible with that you're
gonna be like yeah alright yeah call my
MA look samsung come on I mean this is
kind of cool but in a way like like it's
cool to really nerdy people because I
don't mind my phone like this I would
talk like this all day because I think
that's awesome I think it's amazing and
I would feel like a superhero or some
kind of super spy oh hi this is the
ninety-nine percent yeah ninety-nine
percent of the population would be like
I'm not talking on a watch like this is
stupid okay so this is gonna sound kind
of
you know kind of bad but I feel this is
like one of those moments from like men
i'm glad i work at pocket now is we're
gonna get review units on this thing
we're gonna do the whole dick tracy
thing and not pay the three hundred
dollars but oh no no s voice I don't
want s voice nobody nobody in their
right mind wants SP 00 I wonder I wonder
if it lags and if you disable s voice if
it runs perfectly smooth but it's okay
so why is he behind all the time because
s voice is enable your your some lags
because s voice is enabled on your watch
okay so fine fine viewers this is not
just the pebble it's got more things
than a pebble it's just that none of
these features are actually were never
proven to be good um these were at AO
Gabrielle a I guess that's how you
pronounce it i slaughtered your name
whatever he said um what were they
smoking when they created the galaxy
gear oh they work smoke a pebble that's
for sure whoa whoa dropping bombs over
here Joe Levi hey what's going on on
Twitter alright that's me so so okay so
the galaxy gear is Nemo Gregory I'm
trying to find out what this memo
grapher is so it's almost two o'clock
same here uh-huh Damian at least we
don't have tap dancing that's that's you
know Tony must be still sitting down
okay so wait a second so you can what
what you can read texts at what we like
okay so they're saying that you can take
a picture of text with your wristwatch
one you're gonna have to like you can't
see it if you're taking a picture
straight down and that also means that
to read the text you're going to like
that can you pinch to zoom on this thing
you're going to have long as my
technology you're going to have you met
technology and cross your eyes to pinch
to zoom on the watch
money should hire me okay so this says
don't like great great moments live
awake listen I I feel that the whole
concept of taking a photo at a candid
moment has already been solved with the
phone Jones are on Joe leave I froze at
the best time possible had the best time
puzzles is this is it you know I think
ok so the question is Taylor does the
SmartWatch okay you use your pebble
hazard really okay so think about it
think about not using your pebble think
about uh the fact that you would have to
sell it for any particular reason what
would you miss the most about it just
the notifications I don't care about
taking a picture with my watch I get a
notification and my phone I can leave it
in my my room when I'm at home or I can
leave it on the desk when I'm here I can
leave my phone somewhere I don't have to
have it on me all the time and if I get
a call or somebody text me i look at my
wrist you know i have to worry about my
phone being right near me all the time
that and changing music those are the
only two things that are you care about
and that's what it does really was so
apparently you'll be able to install
applications there are there's path
there's banjo there's oh god there is
even a golf game golf application you're
probably the track where you are hello
Joe you frozen great laughs whoo whoa
that was that was harsh I'm sorry sorry
okay stop amazing Joe 11 commented on
YouTube three hundred dollars you can
get a nexus 4 4 199 I was about to say
no you can't anymore they're kind of you
can get it for you can still get it for
250 which is fifty dollars cheaper than
the watch yep and i agree with VAR Danne
um Taylor you should work for them they
should hire me because I have great
ideas okays crossing your eyes to zoom
on something rising cross is innovative
new innovative God you know you okay so
this is probably what I'd like the
best comments of the day seriously why
would you pay for this SmartWatch when
you can just go get a nexus 4 yeah you
know it's this is okay so wait a second
let's assume that they say and let's
okay what what is the price gonna be on
the LG Nexus 5 what do you think the
price is gonna be it's relieved at least
there be 300 or less yeah yeah it's
gonna be three hundred dollars amazing
but I yeah what what yeah but most
probably they're not gonna pull a
gigabytes anymore I think they're moving
away from make digs yeah oh yeah if you
throw home if you put a boat with 8
gigabytes on the market and people buy
it they're gonna be upset with
themselves after just a few months so
just save yourself the trouble don't
make an 8 gigabyte phone ever again that
is not enough storage for anyone let's
move on from that let's start with 32
gigabytes and go to 128 because Samsung
has made 128 man chips and I'm sure
they're not cheap my light just been out
alright so when will Google release a
nexus SmartWatch I don't think they ever
will umm don't say that I want the nexus
watch right is throwing I mean they're
playing with their Google glass and
google glass nobody much this what what
Helia just hang google smartwatch the
other day wait a second so they're
they're finally saying that you can
record 4k video and then three google
acquired win labs yes I forgot about
that yet google acquired win labs so
Google is working on its own SmartWatch
yes and true okay so by the way for
those of you that didn't know you can
record 1080p at 60 frames per second
there is 4k video on this thing and you
will never be able to watch it because
you'll probably get rid of the phone and
then bluemix phone and you'll probably
be by the galaxy note 7 when you'll be
able to actually have one of those 4k
TVs in your living room in correct hi
mate there is one for thirteen hundred
dollars on amazon and it's actually
really good
really yeah which one 19 I would have to
pick my mic up to drop it so I don't
want to do that um but what would you
say ok so we're finally getting the
specs of the note 3 but we won't we
already good went through them but i
guess probably i don't know 4k videos
like oh man well here's my point than
i've been making in in the pocket now
forums um I gotta drop that plug in
there uh I've been saying that there
have been people asking what is the
point of 4k video because we can't take
advantage of it and the there are three
reasons it's going to exist in phones
right now one is marketing if you've got
a 4k recorder like a the ability to
record video in 4k versus an ATP
obviously people are going to God can
record 4k they don't care if they can
use it or not you know many people went
nuts over 3d video and 3d pictures with
the evo 3d it was yeah and then and even
know and I was horrible listen send the
next year and then the next year no
phone came out with 3d that wasn't
enough yeah but for case that's not
going to happen because 4k is actually
going to be a standard 3d was not a
standard 3d is not something people
actually want I go to a movie I go to an
imax theater i hope they don't have 3d
because i know you had watching 3d mice
I ditch 3d I don't paint I don't pay
more money to actually get a headache
watching a movie yeah but with with 4k
it's different because it's just
resolution it's it's a better clearer
picture and no this 4k recording is
probably not going to be that great it's
not going to be great but the point is
if you have 4k video recording how great
is your 1080p going to be so you have a
4k the ability to record in 4k they've
made that possible you can probably
record really great 1080p it is possible
well at least you're getting 60 frames
per second on tonight impedance that's
awesome that's cool exactly that's kind
of the point is it beefed it up so much
you can get 60 FPS ok so if ability to
zoom don't forget that you can zoom into
the parts that you're really interested
ok that's what I was about to say that's
what I was about to say ok so but this
requires software the problem is doing
that Joe require software like for
example I use
I'll cut to edit my videos um and so far
Final Cut does not support 4k it should
support soon but it doesn't support it
so there's no point of me being able to
pull that clip if I won't be able to do
the zooming so if Sampson gives me 4k
video on that phone but I won't be able
to edit the video within the phone so
that I can crop into the portion that I
want and get a 1080p clip that is with
lossless zoom if they did lossless zoom
video on a phone through the 4k specs oh
that okay that would be man that would
just throw it out of the park right
there so I'm thinking step outside of us
and are we shoot videos we edit videos
with colors videos way back in the day
when DVD can write one of the features
was pop in the disc and you could zoom
into parts of the DVD as you are
watching it so appliance a metaphor here
consumers will be able to zoom in on
their screens and see detail hey
retailers I mate yeah hi may I have to
call you out because you told me I was
wrong you called me out on the podcast
and said I was wrong I said the Lumia
1020 did lossless video will also zoom
in 1080p in the video so you have the
41-megapixel sensor you can zoom in and
do 1080p at four times oom lossless
interesting no I don't know I know yep
so you can do that and judging by that
you could do the same thing with a fork
a sensor or 4k video recording where you
just zoom in and you you actually just
do it at the time of capturing the video
not post processing I will have to have
the phone with me it's it's or for any
of us to test that I guess again it's
it's it's something cool to have but if
there was the software to be able to
actually take advantage of that it's
like okay I took the video right now but
I want to zoom into a portion of it in
1080p because you know I was like it it
was it was a baseball game and I was so
far back but I want to actually see this
special portion so I want to cut into it
that's what I want uh they don't have
tap dancing this time but they have a
video
of puppeteers like fake puppeteers break
dancing and stuff I'm sure Michael is
going nuts oh yeah Tony's most probably
out of the event right I don't know what
Joe's doing either I did a puppeteer oh
all right we're not a couple of tears
but puppets like string puppets
marionettes marionettes that's the word
I was looking for okay so for the record
ladies and gentlemen viewers I how many
viewers do we have to we have 259 nice
thanks for watching guys thank you for
joining so far i want the note 3 I think
you want the note 3 Taylor what about
you Joe oh yeah I want to get back into
S Pen a commoner just said r.i.p hd-dvd
a lot of acronyms there but our HD DVD
died with blu-ray blu-ray just
demolished it so HD DVD has been going
for a long time if you bought an HD DVD
player I'm sorry what is use this for
playing all your HD DVD discs that you
bought when you thought it was gonna win
so soma tell Gabrielle is asking what we
really need for K it's like well you
don't really need it but that's not the
point that's not it the third point that
I didn't get to that I kind of got
sidetracked for the third point that I
was going to make is it pushes
innovation so we were saying the exact
same thing about 1080p displays in
phones we don't need 1080p and 1080p is
overkill the 720p display looks just
fine I'm at most sizes the 720p display
on the note 2 doesn't look horrible it's
not the best but it doesn't look that
bad teenager dissolution overkill but
the whole point of 1080p is that it
pushed innovation and now our displays
are absolutely amazing their mind
blowing and that's going to be the same
thing with the the video resolution you
can record in 4k and it's going to force
other people to improve their video
quality just like the 41-megapixel
sensor in the Lumia 1020 is going to
force other cameraman or mobile
manufacturers to make better cameras so
its innovation
pushing forward that's all it is do you
remember way back when we were playing
with the the nexus one and we were
shooting videos on how to hand that to
enable HD video recording on it and it
was a huge big thing because we could
yeah we dropped frames all over the
place but we did yeah but the difference
was really because we can yeah but the
difference was Joe that back then you
could afford a HD display you know HD
was becoming it was already the thing
back then so um ok so i guess that the
only the only I don't know I you the
only positive thing that I see about 4k
is the fact that this is really gonna
force manufacturers to not make camp
quarters expensive you know that yeah
that's up so it brings prices downs it
brings prices down it brings up
competition and it forces other people
to innovate so yeah it's good all around
do we need it no but that's not the
point at all like when we were at CES
you remember that Sony demo that 4k
camera and it was like what was the
price of that thing I don't know if it
was like seven or eight thousand dollars
it was very expensive it was really my
and your base price for the television
was like twelve thousand dollars yeah um
it should shoot me to 20 grand sure
beats 20 grand which is what Samson was
charging for there's um but again I
guess that I guess that that's that's
like the only positive thing do you need
for k no you don't but it is gonna make
the market very interesting next year
next year most probably you know these
companies are going to wait and see and
see what they get yes so needed it with
the Xperia z1 these guys are doing it
with the note 3 um you know and it's
interesting wait a second because I'm
sure that this is the same exact camera
sensor of the galaxy s4 so most probably
the next week that we're going to be
seeing at xda-developers is people
figuring out how to get 4k video out of
the s4 nope why now the difference is
your snapdragon 800 vs your 600 it's the
capability of the processor i don't
think the processor is capable I don't
this that Snapdragon 600 is capable of
recording that right over there well
there will be a Snapdragon 800 version
of the s4 and Joe you're gonna say
something yeah I got Jeff's going over
right now but yeah whether or not it can
do it I bet they're gonna find a way to
be able to do it even if you like five
six frames a second out of it yeah do it
basically you can make a really cool gif
yeah stop porque gift which would be
like like eight hundred megabytes for
like a few minutes or like 30 second
loop it's like eight hundred megabytes
okay so one of our commenters is making
bottle Maldonado saying here I got to
wonder how long it will take for the
note 3 to get tipped cat since the note
2 is still on 4.1 point to yes you okay
so i guess the only disappointment that
i have about about choosing a Samsung
product right now is the fact that
Samsung has been doing a terrible job in
updating last year's phones well they
did it on purpose they skipped for that
too because for that three came out so
quickly yes but now they're gonna be
like oh we're gonna skip four not three
because for that four is that I guess I
just listen listen I mean I have okay so
i have android 4.2 point2 on my HTC One
X on the One X not even the HTC One has
four point to point to and I already
have it on the One X uh so I feel that
Samson I you know okay so most probably
listeners we will be and read and
viewers we're most probably going to be
seeing these updates now when the once
the note 3 wants to know three retails
they're gonna wait to sell them like
hotcakes and then they're gonna offer
you the update so most probably I'd wait
for 2014 honestly and I'm talking about
the s3 the s for the note to these
devices will not see an update until the
beginning of next year that's what I
think yeah we didn't have a problem need
to tell you all of their new devices
before they update via talk like if you
want to do less new product or wait for
a reasonable amount of time after the
new product is out before they're going
to give it to you that's just it
epworth I can't imagine this comes with
a four dot too though this has got to
come before dot 3 because for 231 out
for a while well that was the rumor that
we were getting four not three here yeah
and in part we have to remember that
part of the problem isn't Samsung on
these firmware updates Samsung is pushed
out updates very quickly to
international devices it's a lot a lot
of it has to do with US carriers so so
or not even just US carriers but
carriers in general because they were
pushing they were about to push the fort
at to update to the note 2 in I think
Japan or somewhere I can't remember
where it was but they were about to push
the for that to update and then they
said no we're gonna pull it in wait for
four not three so yeah oh so they're
showing an ad right now or they're
sponsoring Leona and Missy you know it's
the best soccer player in the world with
with the whole note branding it yet does
anybody have anything to say about the
galaxy tab that sorry the galaxy note
10.1 uh it's a bigger note 3 now I mean
is anybody getting it probably not no
I'm now get a nexus 7 with LTE and call
it a day yep yeah now that's what I was
about to say you know it's just what
could they price that tablet for a
gimmicky feature that almost probably
not use those are the ugliest hats have
ever seen in my life they're the
cheesiest hats I'm gonna just just like
the guy's hat I'm sorry guys had the
guys shade sorry I really hope they
bring out a tap dancer just for my gold
just provide for know they've got
violence for him they've got Violetta's
somebody could have danced to some
violins okay so I believe that the event
is pretty much wrapping up now I think
we should let's look to be honest I mean
the event was over five minutes in yeah
yeah this is what we got ok thanks bye
ok so the positive takeaways is that
they have made the note a more desirable
product I mean they've made it slimmer
they later they made it slimmer they got
rid of the hype
blaze they're giving us 1080p we're
getting the s-pen we're getting some
smarter multitasking we're most probably
getting 4.3 on this thing we're getting
4k video watch with a camera in the
wristband that you can't use he can't
use ok so the event is pretty much over
um now they're they're probably gonna
show is everything that's going on it's
Times Square our own Michael and Anton
are right now most probably walking to
to their hands on boots which I am
noticing that is outside the venue so
we'll probably see them on camera right
now hopefully Tony and raise your hand
come on Tony all right so I guess that
we I have a lot of good things to say
about the note 3 and it's not because ok
so we are like it's not that I hate it
when people are like all these guys are
Sam's and fanboys no we're not sponsored
by Samsung we're not paid by them we
don't get anything from them we review
their products and we don't really it's
not like if we gave the galaxy s4 a 10
out of 10 review like we did we gave it
we gave a 92 the HTC One I gave the s4
like a 8.3 yeah there's an 8.4 yeah and
we gave the HTC One a much better rating
because of their choice of materials
because honestly since five is a and I
guess that's the only thing that I'm
going to lay on the table I'll tell you
who didn't get the memo that Samsung
finally got and that's motorola because
this thing is like yet lass it's not
good it looks terrible so I guess the
only point I guess the only point that
i'm gonna make here is and this is
something that i just need to say they
like what they're showing a video clip
of a woman trying to use like dial a
number on the Galaxy gear and swipe
around and it's not doing anything and
she's like hitting all the wrong buttons
yes great that's great they're like
let's show this all no let's eat the guy
with the camera like cutaway he's like
let's go over here okay so honestly I
guess the only negative thing that I see
out of everything that we've seen today
is touch with is that it looks exactly
like what we've seen always TouchWiz is
getting old yeah
honestly I feel it touch was is getting
old I mean I honestly they revived the
HTC One X for me when they updated it to
sense 5 I think that HTC finally got the
memo yes this is what a better you wanna
has to be it has to be minimal listening
it has to be useful it has to be awesome
typography has to be great and it has to
be useful and you know TouchWiz well so
they're shooting another video of this
woman recording a video with her iPhone
of the galaxy here that's a terrible
thing but you know honestly the again
the only thing that I don't like about
this event is that TouchWiz is not is
has not changed it's the same thing it
needs a refresh it's it's been there
long enough and now I mean even Apple is
refreshing there you know then why and
that's what TouchWiz is a copy of
whether we want to admit it or not you
know they need to do something so we can
expect rainbow colors in a couple months
I'm afraid we're gonna get rainbow
Pascal my problem with TouchWiz is um
okay so they've added a ton of features
and a lot of its cool especially on the
note lines you get a lot of multitasking
stuff stuff specific to the s-pen things
that you are useful you also get a lot
of crap that's not and it bloats the
crap out of the software so your your
system image is like I don't know five
gigabytes its enormous and you're not
going to use half of the stuff but
that's not the biggest problem the
biggest problem is that it was created
back when Android needed a facelift when
Android was ugly as sin and it hasn't
changed but Android has android looks so
much better now but TouchWiz looks the
exact same as it did way back when so
well part of that problem is we're
lumping in all of the tool S Pen
features all of the pool s all all of
that and with TouchWiz which is the UI
where we could easily separate if we
they could easily separate those out and
make their software utilities weeks
separate from the OS separate from their
UI but they're not no no you're not
they're not doing what Google is doing
Google is separating it's a
experience from the UI and updating
everything without updating Android so
if Samsung just did the same thing which
they're not going to do but if they did
all would be a the world would be a
better place oh and they could they
could do that they could offer all their
apps available through the Play Store
but only compatible with samsung devices
they can do that the technology is yeah
yeah yep you know and I guess my problem
is not really with the apps my problem
is really the UI per se it's like you
know i guess i didn't find iOS to be
asks you more fectly ugly as I far in
touch with honestly you know I don't
hide it I never found that with iOS 6
and the previous versions of iOS yeah
the stitch leather looked ugly and
everything but I don't know the problem
with the samsung UI is that it looks
like like lollipop kitty it looks like
it looks childish I guess that's that's
that's my impression of TouchWiz price
that's what if it's fisher-price it is
and I feel okay so the only thing so we
have a great note 3 we like it we're
getting it most probably we are I am
gonna fight for it definitely i'm gonna
call mr. Fisher the livestream ends and
our viewers jumps like 100 yeah yeah
well I I think we yeah we should
definitely be wrapping it up we have a
lot of work to do a lot of it at oriole
so Michael and Anton are gonna
definitely be comparing this phone
against the HTC One the galaxy s4 arm
and just about every other phone that
they have they have like 12 phones in
their pack right now um they definitely
have a pebble to compare the the galaxy
gear so expect all our hands on coverage
a lot of editorials coming up soon so
far so nobody's getting the note 10.1 um
we don't know what to slammed on the
Galaxy gear yeah we don't know what to
say about the galaxy gear and we are
definitely sweet camera yeah we
definitely we definitely are getting the
we're definitely getting the the Galaxy
Note 3 so final thoughts mr. Joe Levi I
think it's great I think it's a you know
a push forward they showed us a lot of
cool things and they also showed us
they've got a lot of
what a room for improvement yes that's a
good one that's ago when mr. Martin um
Samsung has officially changed my mind
because they actually listened for once
I didn't want to know three I didn't
care about it i'm happy with my Moto X
I'm still happy with the Moto X but i
want to know three now which is
something I couldn't say an hour and
half ago so kudos samsung you actually
changed my mind in your favor for the
first time probably ever yeah that's us
to do it it didn't take to have dancers
all it took was fake letter yeah you
know honestly because they've made the
phone smaller and they've you know they
made a display bigger the phone slimmer
it's lighter and I get the s-pen do I am
I gonna keep the s4 in comparison to the
note 3 no I'm getting it up three if I
have to choose between them I'd rather
stick to the note 3 that's my opinion
but it was you can follow mr. Taylor
Martin at tas protect mr. Joe Levi at
