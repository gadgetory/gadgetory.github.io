and also an Android launcher iOS 7 is
looking into some launch delays and
rumors of the new Nexus 7 half begun I'm
right not to be that man no I'm not
being sponsored by tommy hilfiger but
one that'd be cool this is out
daily for those of you wondering what
will it be a phone and operating system
and are an application well it seems
that well it's going to be all three of
them apparently Facebook home is a
smartphone made by HTC or probably
that's just the demo unit that's being
used for that but apparently this is a
launcher as well that has integration or
more focus on social media obviously
Facebook and then again well we'll have
an April fourth event which is tomorrow
to let you know what exactly this is
going to be and it just makes you wonder
I mean and the facebook application
isn't the best thing out there I mean
why would they want to do a phone now
now let's move into the galaxy s4 for
those of you concerned that the
pre-orders on April sixteenth are gonna
be for 250 bucks for the 16 gig model
well Sampson has just confirmed it on a
TNT this device will retail for 250
bucks for the 32 gig model and then you
could get the 16 gig for two hundred
dollars so obviously April sixteenth let
your wallets wait let's see what we get
now let's talk about the nexus 7 that is
pretty much confirmed that a Susan
Google will be building this tablet
again together which is actually a good
thing but apparently we will be getting
a smaller bezel a snapdragon processor
this time because the Tegra 3 was kind
of a disappointment we will also be
getting better pixel density and believe
it or not this thing will retail for 150
bucks now obviously a lot of things can
happen from here to there apparently
this device will be retailing in July
but obviously it'll most likely be
launched at Google i/o which happens and
May so stay tuned we'll keep you posted
and speaking of events we know that
almost every major version of iOS has
been launched at WWDC in June but
apparently iOS 7 is significantly
delayed and apparently it's so bad
they've had to pull resources from OS 10
in order to work on iOS 7 now we know
that Scott Forstall is no longer there
iOS 6 is a significant mess it is
terrible and we do know that this is the
first collaboration between Craig
federighi and Johnny
I've in iOS 7 so hopefully we will be
getting something good on the table and
most likely on time so stay tuned and
finally for the nostalgic news of the
day did they march the 40th anniversary
of the first cell phone call to happen
between Motorola's Martin Cooper on his
humongous motorola dynatac remember
saved by the bell that huge thing
between him and his AT&amp;amp;T competitor just
to tell him that he had just won the
competition he had built up her cell
phone and think about it how much has
technology evolved I mean in the first
20 years it wasn't really much phones
were still humongous when I got my first
one but then eventually they got really
small fin and now we get 4G LTE so that
leads me to the question of the day
which was your first cell phone and can
you tell us your story about your first
phone call in my particular case my
first cell phone was a nokia 250 you can
have a hard time finding photos of this
phone but the point being is that I was
late for work and my first phone call
was to call my boss and let her know
that I was extremely late because I had
slept in so leave us a comment down
below what's your first story and your
first phone of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
