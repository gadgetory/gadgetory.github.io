new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device a couple weeks after release
and when it's not shiny and new anymore
I'm Taylor Martin with PocketNow this is
the Google Nexus 4 and this is episode
15 of after the buzz the Nexus 4 by LG
the fourth iteration of a pure Google
handset is now over four months old
how's it holding up in terms of hardware
software and performance about as good
as you could expect from any $350 phone
today it was finally unveiled we were
all surprised a bit based on it looks
almost identical to the previous year's
Galaxy Nexus by Samsung the face has a
similar buttonless all black glass slab
but the chrome trim around the outside
of the bezel is where the similarities
between it and the Galaxy Nexus end at
least in terms of design the soft touch
plastic around the edges Linde the
device ignites grippy feel and the
speckle glass around back makes LG's
Nexus feel much more premium than the
last over the course of two months the
Nexus has held up quite well
majority of the time it has been used
without a case and the only signs of
wear are barely visible micro scratches
in the chrome trim granted the day I
received it I slapped a carbon fiber
skin on the back to cover the all too
fragile clasp our own Joe Levi had much
worse luck with his first Nexus 4 unit
which meant it's unfortunate and abrupt
end when it came face to face with the
concrete floor in terms of
specifications the Nexus 4 was never in
the top of his class his chipset the
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro was always
snappy and over time it has served us
well with few to no hiccups and
performance but the storage on the Nexus
4 is as big a problem as ever
unlike the Nexus 7 Google
yet to introduce a larger capacity model
so the Nexus 4 owners are limited to 8
or 16 gigabytes of storage when you
consider the standard is slowly rising
to 32 or 64 gigabytes and game and movie
file sizes are growing exponentially to
take advantage of high resolution
displays storage is getting notably
tighter over time and no option to
expand is a problem that will
respectively grow over time the one area
the Nexus 4 has certainly lost its
luster however is in its display at 4.7
inches the Nexus 4 display was never
among the largest which isn't
necessarily a bad thing but its
on-screen navigational Keys also take
from size just ever so slightly and is
stuck with a resolution of 1280 by 768
pixels while most of the high-end
Android handsets of 2013 equipped 5-inch
1080p panels the resolution isn't
necessarily the problem though a rating
of 318 pixels per inch should definitely
suffice but the panel appears washed out
and dull alongside newer high-resolution
SLC d3 and Super AMOLED panels the Nexus
4 display was never a highlight feature
but it's slowly turning into a sore
point although the hardware of the Nexus
4 is relatively premium especially
considering its price tag being a purely
stock Android device means the software
is where the Nexus 4 truly shines it is
guaranteed to be among the first devices
to get any updates straight from Google
since February the Nexus 4 received an
update taking it from four point 2.1 to
4.2.2 a minor point update that still
boasted some nice additions and bug
fixes and the ecosystem is on an upswing
more and more applications are
undergoing dress free designs that give
them the fit and finish to rival their
iOS counterparts unlike many of its
Android competitors which feature
proprietary interfaces put in place by
manufacturers the Nexus 4 can utilize
the raw power of project butter meaning
it's not subject to many slowdowns and
performance problems this results in a
much more smooth and polished experience
that you don't necessarily get on many
other Android devices while the Nexus 4
may only incorporate last trip processor
technology from Qualcomm the s4 pro has
plenty of horse power to muscle through
most situations
it handles gaming like a charm and it
cuts through everyday tasks like butter
the downside of the Nexus 4 however is
that it does not have any carrier
endorsements and not all the right parts
meaning it has no official access to LTE
users are stuck on HSPA+ serious
compromise for some but for us the HSPA+
speeds on 18 t in the Charlotte metro
area have been passable and stamina it
may not host a monster battery like the
Droid RAZR MAXX HD or the Galaxy Note 2
for the Nexus 4 is 2100 million power
battery is enough to keep the device
running most of the day occasionally on
days of heavy usage you might consider
keeping a spare charger around just in
case so after four long months and at
least a dozen flagship later is the
Nexus 4 still worth the buy for the
bargain seeker absolutely for anyone
after the purest google experience in a
smart phone definitely but with Google
i/o just around the corner and a host of
more powerful more advanced smart phones
with 1080p displays on the horizon the
Nexus 4 has past its prime and we
couldn't recommend it to anyone who
seeks bleeding edge technology or needs
the latest and greatest so that's all
