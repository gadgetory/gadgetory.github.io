mobile platform on a regular basis hi
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
these are 10 essential cross-platform
mobile applications no matter how bad we
wish it were more simple making the jump
from one mobile platform to another is
never quite as easy as swapping SIM
cards and logging into a few accounts
application libraries are often the
biggest hurdle in the way of a smooth
transition or even using two devices
with different operating systems
side-by-side an iPad with a Windows
Phone smartphone for example or an
Android tablet with an iPhone
fortunately there are several
cross-platform applications and services
that can greatly help make future
transitions seamless and painless part
of every mobile ecosystem is some form
of cloud service that offers document
editing note-taking and task management
but if you quarter yourself for the
single platforms offerings you can't
always switch operating systems on the
fly without having to manually transfer
all your data to another service or deal
with insufferable mobile web interfaces
the perfect cross-platform solution is
one that is widely known Evernote it
helps you keep track of everything
through taking notes adding various
forms of documents saving pictures or
even making lists essentially it's the
ultimate digital notebook Evernote is
available on Windows Phone Android and
iOS as a free download but if you need
more storage space you can upgrade to a
premium account without a proper way to
communicate smartphones would be a lot
less useful of course voice calling is
universal as as SMS but what if you want
a video call or instant message with
some friends you can't FaceTime your
friend who has the galaxy s4 and you
can't hang out with your friend who has
a Windows Phone for video calls the best
bet is to turn to Skype it's available
for free on Android iOS and Windows
Phone and of all the various video
calling clients it offers some of the
best video and audio quality it also
doubles as a great instant messaging
service even for group messaging but if
you prefer a dedicated i.m service
whatsapp is one of the most popular
mobile instant messaging services around
and GroupMe serves as a great group
messaging client apple offers iTunes
Google Offers play music and the
subscription service called all access
and Microsoft offers its own music hub
and Xbox music
all are great viable options for getting
your music fix on-the-go
but what if you want to stream music
across multiple devices and platforms
the best option is to choose a
third-party service that's available to
all such as RTO or Spotify using Spotify
you can stream music on the same account
using a PC Mac Linux Android iOS or
Windows Phone but if you're not a fan of
subscription music you can always go
with a free option pandora that lets you
create radio stations based on songs
artists or genres and stream up to 40
hours per month for free of course you
also need a way to identify that song
that's playing on the radio or that you
hear on a TV commercial for that there
are two great cross-platform options
Shazam and SoundHound press a button
wait just a few seconds and you will
have the song title artist album info
and lyrics life is much more dull
without videos of people doing stupid
things in this video tutorials and of
course phone reviews having to deal with
a mobile platform without a proper
YouTube client is something we wouldn't
wish on our worst enemy fortunately
YouTube applications are available to
users on iOS Android and Windows Phone
okay well for a short while there was an
official YouTube app on Windows Phone
not one of those janky mobile web app
shortcuts but it was pooled for not
adhering to google's terms now Google is
helping Microsoft develop a proper
client with ads and tow until then
Windows Phone users can download one of
the many third-party offerings for your
streaming TV and movie needs Netflix is
the best cross-platform solution pay
$7.99 per month and you get instant
access to a vast selection of movies and
television for streaming anywhere
unfortunately there are no decent
cross-platform solutions for purchasing
television shows and movies only iTunes
for iOS and Google Play movies for
Android for the shrinking number of
people who still read buying into
Google's playbook service or iBooks
isn't a terrible idea
but what if you want to read your books
elsewhere like from a dedicated e-reader
then you might want to consider going
cross-platform and switching over to
Amazon's more open offer Kindle the
Kindle application is available to
Windows Phone iOS and Android and it
supports bookmark and page sync across
all devices
taking care of finances is important and
if you can't manage your mobile banking
efficiently it can be a real problem if
you bank with Bank of America or HDFC
you're in luck
they provide applications for all three
platforms and if your PayPal user eBay
provides PayPal mobile applications for
all three platforms as well if you only
use iOS and Android there are dozens of
cloud services that interoperate quite
well with the two platforms but when you
throw a Windows Phone into the mix the
list of cloud storage services that work
well with all three Slim's down pretty
quickly there are a few options and
among the slim pickings two champions
emerge box and Microsoft's
cross-platform SkyDrive of course when
it comes to social media sites there are
tons of options the Facebook application
for iOS and Android was built by
Facebook itself but the Windows Phone
and Facebook application was made in the
house by Microsoft still it has most of
the same features as other Facebook
Applications and Foursquare the location
based check-in network has an official
application on all three platforms as
does Twitter but for Twitter there are
ample third-party applications that
allow some extended functionality on all
platforms
