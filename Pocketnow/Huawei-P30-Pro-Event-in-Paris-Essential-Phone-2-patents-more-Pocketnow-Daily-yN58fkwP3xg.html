bringing four cameras and will be
launched in Paris and March
it looks like the essential phone to
might happen after all in it will bring
an amazing screen and Apple finally
released the fix for their FaceTime bug
as well as some others I'm Jaime Rivera
and I think that the reason why this
t-shirt is my favorite of all time is
self-explanatory happy Friday everyone
this is fog announced daily and for
those of you that are looking for these
t-shirts there's gonna be a link in the
first common addition to a discount if
you're interested but anyways the
official news today begin with hope
there's actually rumors as we've got
Russian websites already speculating on
the galaxy s 10 and what you're getting
apparently pre-orders will begin on
unpacked according to the source so
February 20th devices will be shipping
on March 8th and if you pre-order it
seems that you will be getting some
Wireless of Samsung buds for free which
is definitely a good way to sweeten the
pot and speaking of wearables let's talk
about smartwatches we know that Google
acquired a significant chunk of fossils
a pretty much R&amp;amp;D in mobile department
and it seems that it's going to start
paying off they're looking for a VP of
engineering and even design for
wearables so it seems that Google is
gearing up for something really really
good we just don't know when now for
those of you that were victims of the
FaceTime bug it's sad for you I hope you
weren't doing anything weird think about
it is there is a fix already iOS 12
point 1.4 is already available I
actually jumped on that update like
immediately so make sure you update your
phone so far my phone hasn't been
bricked so I'm hoping you don't have to
worry about it either but yeah it also
brings some other fixes Apple just
doesn't disclose which ones now let's
talk about essential I mean I don't know
if this company still exists or not I do
love the essential phone
sadly brandon has mine Anton has my
other unit but anyways the most
important thing is that there are leaks
of a patent that shows that there
probably will be a phone - with a
fingerprint scanner down at the home
button section of the display meaning
it's a display but it's where it's
supposed to be and then the camera will
be behind the display or something like
that we wonder if it's a punch hole in
the middle or whatever
but let's hope there is an essential
phone - why not and finally the hottest
interested I have to do with the Huawei
P 30 and P 30 Pro we've got some leaks
of the p30 that shows three cameras so
pretty much what we have with the p20
pro is what we're getting with the
standard p 30 that's great but then the
p40 is rumored to have four cameras like
yeah four cameras at the back and the
event is rumored to happen sometime in
March in Paris so in the comments down
below I would love to get your take on
what you want those four cameras to do
so queuing all the Superman type of
photography that we know you guys are
gonna comment on and leave us a comment
down below I would love again a wide a
telephoto a monochrome and a standard
that would be great for me but leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us I'm
talking about kind of destructive of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one you follow me on
Twitter I'm at recorder get on instagram
at high metal Iveta please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw
