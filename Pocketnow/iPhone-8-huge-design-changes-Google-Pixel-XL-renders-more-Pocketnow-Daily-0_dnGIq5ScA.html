begin with the iPhone 8 rumors new
renders of the Google pixel XL paint a
prettier picture than expected and those
of you waiting for Android wear 2 you
are gonna keep waiting I'm high metal
Iveta and you know it's hard for me to
acknowledge the fact that I just learned
it today is still Thursday this is
parking out daily official news today
begin with a very interesting IndieGoGo
campaign for those of you that are
disappointed with the lack of a
headphone jack on your iPhone 7 and not
wanting to use the dongle and you still
want the headphone jack there is this
case right now that's currently in
campaign it'll cost $60 and the whole
idea is to add the headphone jack to
your phone the other question is you
know do you think of that case will you
know hold water and survive mainly
because well it's much bulkier than
using an adapter it was a comment down
below speaking of the iPhone 7 for those
of you that are struggling to get
certain Android wear watches connect it
that's because there are problems
between them Google is actively working
on this according to Google's support
groups we're not exactly sure how long
it'll take but you can learn which
watches are having trouble connecting to
the iPhone 7 in the looks of the
description and that's actually not the
only thing that's going bad for Android
wear those of you waiting for version 2
the one we love that Google i/o there
are delays we're not exactly sure how
long those delays would last it makes
sense if Google wants to hold off for
new hardware to run it thing is we're
not sure when that hardware's going to
happen and Google hasn't really said
that according support groups though if
you have the Developer Preview you will
be able to load standalone applications
wherever available now let's talk about
the Google pixel XL because we now have
rendered videos that show as the phone
is actually not as ugly as we thought
now the video is rather interesting for
two things number one because it shows a
stereo speakers at the bottom that would
be great we wonder how that's gonna work
but we assume that HTC is gonna play
with it given the design that we
currently have on the HTC 10 and number
two is the fact that according to the
dimensions of the leaks this device is
not going to be as large as the Nexus 6p
those are great news stay tuned as we
learn
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with the iPhone 8 because the
iPhone 7 is already old news right we've
got some very interesting rumors coming
from trusted analysts that claim a
couple of things number one the glass on
glass design is apparently coming but
instead of aluminum it seems that we're
going back to stainless steel just like
in the case of the iPhone 4 and iPhone
4s now according to the source because
stainless steel is more expensive than
aluminum apparently this will only be
available for the higher tier models and
the penalty Apple wants to take that
glass to the next level meaning the home
button will be integrated to the glass
and apparently even the front-facing
camera will somehow be blended into the
glass
we cannot wait to see how that's going
to work but it leads me to the question
of the day do you believe that these
rumours are possible
you know embedding the fingerprint
scanner on the screen in addition to
somehow omitting the camera if they
happen that would be awesome but leave
us a comment down below we love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
