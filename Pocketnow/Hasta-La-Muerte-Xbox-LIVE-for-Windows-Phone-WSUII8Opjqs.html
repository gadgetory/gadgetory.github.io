we're going to take a look at this
week's new xbox live game for windows so
let's check it out okay we've got hasta
la muerte today some new xbox live game
and this is our first look okay here's
the menu and you can see plays at the
top we got leaderboard achievements open
options but you can't touch any of these
buttons there's a little guy in the
middle and you got to tilt them to go
different places alright so let's see
how it works and then you can press play
and here's your levels you can scroll
through them it's kind of slow scrolling
you can select this one and load and we
see the graphics are really hand-drawn
this is not an iphone port this is a
exclusive to xbox live on windows phone
but it looks kind of unprofessional with
these scribbly handwritten stuff so
here's the info about how to play here
we go and tilt them and if i press the a
button down there i'm using the soul pet
feature and that's thus the little guy
following me and he's got some special
running and i want to go into those
circles because those guys are going to
kill me too
just save that soul and this a button is
like right next to the back button so
it's kind of a poor placement because
you could really easy to see where it is
right there you can really easily hit
the back button see what I did that was
by accident I hit the back button
alright let's look at the options real
quick it's how to play credits menu
which just brings you back to the menu
and parameters are the real options
sound effects you can calibrate it the
first time i calibrated it i calibrated
laying down and this was all the way
down and then that kind of made it so
that the little guy only moved upwards
no matter what I did to tilt the phone
but it seems like it's still working
okay now overall I really don't like
this menu they have to tilt and he
doesn't easy to run faster if you tilt
them more so it's not there's no physics
in it which so it doesn't make sense
really I kind of rather have just a
d-pad to control this guy actually in
the menu I'd rather just have buttons
and the a button being right next to the
back button is not really good design
anyway that's our quick look at hasta la
muerte coming soon to xbox live for
Windows Phone hope you enjoyed this
quick look and that's it for now
