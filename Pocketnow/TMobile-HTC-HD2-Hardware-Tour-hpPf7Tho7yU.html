calm and we're here with the t-mobile
version of the HTC hd2 it's going to be
very similar to the european version of
the hd2 that we've seen before there's a
couple differences on the internals this
has 576 megs of ram and one gig of rom
capacity the European one had built less
ram but it turned out that it actually
had the same amount it was just hidden
anyway I will take a look at this as you
can see it's all screen and we have a
tmobile logo at the top there and over
here we have proximity sensor and
ambient light sensor and then a little
LED light right in the corner there with
the speaker grill and moving on down big
big screen HTC logo call send button
hold button start menu button back
button and end call / suspend / power
off button you press the end call button
wants to end a call and you can press it
again to suspend the screen put sleep
mode of course and hold it down to turn
it off completely see those buns are
nice brushed metal there on the bottom
if you focus we have a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack microUSB port and a
microphone over here we have the volume
up and down
top has nothing and the other side has
nothing again just a little latch for
the battery cover let me just shut off
open it up
there we go that's a 800 or 480 x 800
screen and all right here we're going to
open it up dig in there that's some
metal backing this is a kind of a nice
rubbery feel to it and we have a 5
megapixel camera right there let's take
a look at that with the two LED lights
for a flash and another speaker over
there the lights are really bright
actually so here's our battery that
comes out like so
doesn't say but we have a sim card here
and we have a micro SD card slot there
and this one from t-mobile actually
comes with your 16 gig sandisk card so
you don't have to get your own there's a
soft reset button put the battery back
in there and we got nice backing HTC
with HTC Sense and it's kind of snaps
back on there alright that's a glass
screen capacitive multi-touch and this
camera sticks out a lot but it comes
with this big rubber case it doesn't
protect the screen but let's slide it in
there put it on its like so and now yeah
a little more protection for the camera
so that's pretty good it's got a nice
feel to it so this is the tmobile hd2
and that's the hardware tour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
