tablet will probably be launched the
google i/o reverse points in the i watch
sporting around this flame being
manufactured next month and it seems
that somebody finally figured out to how
to do wireless charging right I'm hi
Metairie meta and in a perfect world I
believe that no charging it all would be
even better and this is parking out
daily my god the assu spat phone X has
been tipped for AT&amp;amp;T for the longest
time up to the point where the company
had to pull out this tweet saying it's
no joke the tablet will be launched and
it will it's happening on june six
you're getting the full bells and
whistles of the PadFone but even cooler
it's only going to cost you two hundred
dollars on contract meaning the phone
plus the tablet dock so this is pretty
much a very very sweet deal for the
product uh stay tuned and tell us what
you think because definitely the price
tag is just really compelling now on
other cool official news probably one of
the biggest burdens that's made wireless
charging not a standard that everybody
wants is the fact that well there are 10
of standards and they just can't work
together so you've got the she standard
you've got other standards and
apparently broadcom is working on
building this chip that will allow any
folks who work with any type of wireless
charger or the other way around it's
actually still in the works but the
whole idea is to make wireless charging
cool in the future the question is do
you use it do you like it that leave us
a comment and let us know now in some
interesting links from famous tipster
efflux we've already got some photos of
the probable Moto X plus one yesterday
we're talking about a 64 gig variant of
the Moto X but there is this 5.2 inch
Motorola flagship that was caught on
camera so it could be that both devices
are in the works and hey Motorola want
sleep the Moto X is the entry-level
phone and then leave us the Moto X plus
one with the 5.2 inch display and better
specs as the more expensive variant
we're all happy now let's talk about the
google nexus 8 very interesting we heard
rumors that the nexus program was dead
but apparently this tablet will still
happen and it'll probably be launched at
Google i/o just like every variant of
the Nexus 7 was launched in previous
years
sure if it will be made by HTC but the
rumor points to Google wanting to try
new things with Android particularly the
64-bit version of Android something
that's not there yet even more
interesting is the fact that apparently
it will be rocking on NVIDIA cpu for
that to happen so even though a lot of
us hated the Tegra 3 let's see what they
bring and finally for some interesting
news today it seems that Apple is
already planning to start manufacturing
of the iWatch within the summer which is
actually a bad thing and the reason why
is because even though we are expecting
iOS 8 to bring as a new health features
they won't work without a wearable so we
don't really know what we're getting at
WWDC next week but even more interesting
is that apparently the design of this
SmartWatch will be round and you know
that actually leaves uses the question
of the day if you have to choose what
type of SmartWatch do you want to square
this play smart watch we're around this
place mart watch in my case honestly I
like round watches and squared watches
but I do prefer the square ones that's
the reason why I like the pebble so much
but leave us a comment down below which
would you prefer and friends you know
the drill if you want to get to those
earlier before this video is filling
machine followers I'm talking about
comment subscribe to channel as well it
also follow me on twitter hein
underscore iveta please give this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw i am
a meta leave it up thank you very much
for watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
