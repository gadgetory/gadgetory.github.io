poof you really don't want to hear me
rap I mean you're drunk you said you'll
come back next October but it's not here
yet and that's the cool thing about
using jokes with the wrong date people
actually notice without the bargain out
daily my life felt so empty so glad
you're back kinda and I'm glad to be
back and I really love reading these
comments making these daily videos is
difficult and it's always so reassuring
to read that you guys actually like what
we do that's right it's that time of the
week I am hi Natalie then this is pocket
now and this is the vaca now daily recap
for last week so last week we actually
started on Wednesday I was traveling the
first two days and the news were about
the iphone mini rumors are that it'll
get the specs of the iphone 6 not the
success and that it'll keep the design
of the iphone 5s and i asked you would
you pick an iphone mini if it had specs
they're not on par with the iphone 6s
which is the flagship we had 776
comments we start with hell yes i love
the 5s design and i know a lot of people
that did i actually didn't but mainly
because of the chamfered edges i used to
have an iphone 5s and had a hard time
moving to a bigger iphone but now that i
have the iphone 6s I can't use a smaller
screen maybe bigger is better and yeah
that's what she said but true I find
myself in that same scenario I find
myself going back to the iphone 5
whenever i go for a run that's the phone
that i use and i just find it to be so
small and cumbersome that I don't like
the experience no I'm rocking the iphone
6s plus and I'm loving it even the six
feel small in my hand now and I have to
agree with that I've been finding myself
considering the iphone 6 so small that
it's probably just too small for my
taste but that could be what she said as
well then on Thursday the news were
about Samsung's marshmallow updates we
learned that devices like the galaxy
note 5 and s6 edge plus you're getting
it this year but then everybody else is
getting it until februari March April
particularly in the case of the galaxy
s5 for example and I ask you how do you
feel about Sam Singh speed at software
updates this year we have 699 comments
we start with at this rate the iphone
success will get
the marshmallow updates before my s5 and
that is true it'll never happen
definitely but my god I mean it is
extremely slow for software updates
reach some Android handsets particularly
from Samsung s5 and April that means the
update would reach users by May haha a
month later I would be rocking the
Android end developer preview on my
Nexus come on Sammy and you know I
hadn't really noticed the timeline and
the amount of time that it will actually
taken my god you're so right it's gonna
be terrible this is why Samsung should
really think twice about releasing 50
different products a year you know I
feel that Samsung has so much rd and so
much resources that i do feel it's not
the amount of phones i just feel that
this is what sammy does to be able to
sell more phones and finally on friday
we were shocked with the news that LG
was canceling the watch urbane second
edition you know the cellular capable
watch for reasons they didn't specify
they just said they had hardware issues
and wealth didn't confirm when it would
happen if ever and i asked you do you
care about so they're capable smart
watches are not we had 333 comments we
start with i don't care for a SmartWatch
in general and yeah that is the news for
almost everybody a lot of people don't
really like smartwatches and i tend to
feel that they don't know what they're
missing but then again for the price tag
right now it's kind of understandable do
you hear about spending many hundreds of
dollars for something useless yes I care
and you know I don't find smartwatches
useless up to the point where i can't
find myself not using a smart watch
anymore I've been trying other
smartwatches right now for a segment
that we're working on and it's funny if
they're not good at notifications I come
to the point where I just don't like
them that that's how bad it is I already
pay enough for my phone Dana I don't
want to pay even more for just the watch
plan and true you're right that is
definitely the biggest problem with
these sellers are capable watches and
obviously if you have like for example
an AT&amp;amp;T family share plan then it'll
pull from that same bucket of data but
not everybody has these plans I do feel
that there is a market for these smart
watches people that like to run Iron
Man's your big marathons don't want to
carry a phone around and just want to
use their wearable hey they've got
communication in case they get lost or
in case they have problem
I feel that there is a purpose for these
products but again paying extra data is
just not the point I feel they should be
smarter like for example what they did
with the Kindles where people don't
really know that they're paying for
their whispersync through the kindle
ebooks that they buy they don't know
that and I feel that there should be a
way for smartwatches to bring that over
I would rather pay a little more premium
and not pay for data then have to pay
for data every month that's it for the
parking out daily recap thank you very
much for watching a couple of tips if
you want your comments to be featured
