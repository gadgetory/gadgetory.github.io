just a day away and we know a lot of you
have been waiting for it i'm high memory
better with partner common let's go
through our top five predictions of what
we might get tomorrow in the event
number five a newer ipad and we've
already seen the leaked photos of the
current generation ipad sporting the
lightning connector that we saw on the
iphone 5 we aren't expecting any changes
when it comes to design but we are
expecting for the ipad to retain the
same price points now we expect for
apple to deal with all the flaws that we
saw with the new ipad we're expecting
faster charging times no heating and
probably faster processing with the a6
chip we'll see about that number 4 I
thought one upgrade to iOS 6 even though
Apple can fix all their Maps issues in
their servers we know that if Tim Cook
came on record to apologize over Maps is
because anything that spells iOS 6 means
bad news Apple will most likely have to
change the name to Iowa 6.1 deal with
the problems with maps and we'll
probably see that later this year since
we haven't received any betas yet number
three is an enhancement to ibooks and
yes if you didn't know what Apple
actually sells books the problem is that
amazon kindle ebooks are cheaper most of
the time you can read them everywhere
whereas on apples iBooks you're stuck on
reading them only on iOS devices now
everybody's speculating that the theme
for this event has to do with books so
we are expecting for an upgrade to
ibooks even though it's hard to tell
which the enhancements will be some are
speculating that it has to do with
education number two is the obvious
assumption and iPad Mini but since the
theme of the event has to do with book
some of us are speculating that Apple
will revive the name I book in order to
compete with the Nexus 7 and with them
as on kindle fire now whatever Apple
calls this thing doesn't really matter
this ipad mini will happen i mean rumor
mill has been filled with images of this
device price point starting at 250 bucks
or 330 bucks in some places and even
though some are speculating that it
won't have a Retina display it doesn't
really make sense for Apple to release
an e-book reader with fuzzy text and
we're also assuming that Apple will
bring the a6 chip in order to make this
the perfect gaming device at its price
point most likely this will be the new
entry-level iPad and Apple
we'll ditch the ipad2 altogether and
finally our top number one prediction
for tomorrow's apple event is one more
thing and the reason why is because if
you think of it we've got the nexus 7 we
got the amazon kindle fire HD we've got
even more tablets being launched with
great designs great displays and Apple
launching the new iPad Mini is just not
enough there must be one more thing that
makes this tablet stand out from the
crowd or else it has no reason for being
and some of us are speculating that
Apple's patents from years ago where we
had a hybrid ink display that also
turned into an LCD could probably be the
case others are assuming that will have
a new product that we haven't even
thought about so that leads me to the
question of the day what do you assume
would be that new product thorne one
more thing that we haven't thought about
leave us a comment down below and I will
be covering everything live as it
happens starting tomorrow at ten a.m.
pacific time 1 p.m. Eastern so make sure
you follow us on Parker now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary later thanks
