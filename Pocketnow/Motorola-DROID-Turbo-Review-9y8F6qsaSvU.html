phone you can rise to the moment with
and considering all the power Motorola's
crammed into it's beefy frame that makes
sense
everything about the newest droids
branding emphasizes speed power and pure
capability so does the device live up to
the bold messaging I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and let's find out in our
video review of the Motorola Droid turbo
as we said in our moto X comparison
video the drej turbo is a tank of a
smartphone that's true for the
metallized glass units and doubly so for
our ballistic nylon covered special
edition model which is thicker and
heavier than it's already chunky
siblings it's the kind of phone that's
unlikely to impress fashionistas but
that's not who it's made for it's for
people who want a phone they can drop on
a dusty dashboard or a damp dock we have
a few minor quibbles like mushy feedback
on the side keys and capacitive buttons
that give it an old-school feel but
after 2 weeks of testing we feel
confident that the droid turbo could
definitely last two years of rough
handling especially given Verizon's
one-time screen replacement offer for
those who managed to shatter that
gorilla glass 3 face as for the display
made it to that face it's very
respectably sized at 5.2 inches with a
quad HD resolution that also makes it
one of the sharpest on the market
whether you actually need that added
resolution is something of an open
question
the added pixel density definitely makes
it tougher for the back light to shine
through so this droid suffers from
readability problems in direct sunlight
an annoying handicap for anyone who
works outdoors and given this phone's
target audience that's kind of a
head-scratcher of an oversight still on
a phone called turbo its admittedly nice
to have every possible spec maximized
and that carries through under the hood
as well here you'll find the most
advanced Qualcomm processor you can get
in a modern smartphone with maxed out
specs supporting it at every level
the only thing missing here is microSD
expansion but with available storage
options up to 64 gigs and some of the
fastest 4G throughput we've ever seen on
a US carrier that's not as big a deal if
you make use of cloud services and if
you live and work in one of Verizon's
X LTE coverage areas sitting atop
Android is a very Spartan Motorola skin
with a home screen anchored to the far
left position and a single pre-installed
widget serving up time weather and
calendar info it's about as simple as it
gets until you hit the custom Moto suite
and here a small time investment in
learning something new goes a long way
if you've seen our Moto X coverage
you'll be familiar with this the Droid
turbo can read text messages aloud when
it detects that you're driving or when
it knows you're at home and you can
dictate replies to it as well
the phone can automatically silence
itself when you're sleeping or during
meetings when it lets you know of
inbound alerts it only uses the pixels
it needs and only then when you reach
for it or pull it from a pocket and you
can control the phone remotely using
just your voice hello mojo what's up
hello
the time is 3:17 p.m. nothing what's
going on right now
now this moto suite is one of our
favorite parts of Motorola smart phones
but its reliability
frankly comes and goes sometimes it's
quick as anything and sometimes it takes
so long to execute a voice command that
you definitely could do it more easily
and quickly using a finger also even
given moderate background noise the
turbo is more likely to keep listening
after you've finished speaking meaning
it just hangs there and won't execute
whatever command you're giving it
elsewhere this being a verizon phone
we've got a fair amount of carrier
bloatware ranging from the purely
redundant to the mildly interesting most
useful if you share a lot of photos is
droids app which allows for instant
Bluetooth sharing to nearby phones that
also have zap and even provides a voice
command to share a screenshot
zap my screen gimmicky yes
but it's nice to see third-party apps
tying into moto voice like this hello
moto you can use voice to launch the
camera too but it's much easier to use
Motorola's double-crank gesture it may
look funny but it really is the quickest
and easiest way to get to the viewfinder
in a hurry that viewfinder is the same
one we've seen from Motorola for the
past two generations and it's not our
favorite it's awkward to get focus and
slow to snap photos and the interface we
cheered as simple and fun last summer
has now come to feel very limiting on
the upside the image is produced by the
21 megapixel camera can come out very
nicely given the right lighting of
course you can say that about any
smartphone camera but the added zoom
ability from the higher resolution gives
the turbo a bit more breathing room than
its Motorola contemporaries of course
low-light shots are still challenging if
you miss qu the dual LED flash and given
the slow viewfinder response time the
turbo wouldn't be our first choice for
action shots either all those bizarre
James Franco commercials bragging about
a quick and powerful camera they're
overstating the case it's tougher to see
the holes in video so we like the 1080p
footage here a little better it can
shoot 4k as well by the way there's no
optical stabilization here but the
software does a good job of smoothing
trembles and bumps and audio pickup is
nice too as long as there's no blowing
wind in the way
any smartphone priding itself on power
better blaze and in day-to-day
performance the turbo of course keeps
pace with other flagships but does it
blow others away now as the Android
landscape continues to homogenize it's
harder and harder to see differences in
things like general responsiveness and
even high-end gaming performance for
what it's worth the turbo does get an A+
in both categories but don't expect
those three gigs of RAM or the
Snapdragon 805 to eliminate every last
bit of lag like other smartphone
platforms androids architecture assures
you'll occasionally be kept waiting for
things like the multitasking ribbon and
from what we've seen of the newest
version of Android on devices like the
nexus 9 and those occasional bumps
aren't going anywhere even after the
turbo gets upgraded to lollipop so to
further justify the powerful reputation
its branding suggests Motorola has
imbued the turbo with a monster of a
battery the same sized pack as Huawei
used on its ascend mate to the one we
called the everlasting smartphone it's a
huge power pack and it should result in
huge endurance but sadly the company has
over-promised and under-delivered here
we were never able to get more than five
and a half hours of screen on time on a
single charge over two weeks of testing
in very good coverage areas to be clear
this phone will last you all day and for
some people that's enough it's not
horrible it's average and with the
battery that size you should be getting
more than average endurance and in our
experience that's just not the case
fortunately the turbo does come with a
high speed charger in the box which gets
us from a dead battery to a half charge
in about 45 minutes if you're judicious
with your juice and prudent with your
plugins the turbo charger will come in
very useful indeed
for what Motorola calls pit stops
finally there's audio quality Motorola
added a fifth microphone to its crystal
talked noise reduction rig here but
callers told us they could still hear
plenty of background even in a moderate
breeze earpiece quality on our end
wasn't terrific either with most callers
sounding pretty fuzzy Verizon's CDMA
network can probably take the blame for
at least some of that when we switch to
Skype or Google Hangouts clarity was
much higher the front firing speakers
phone isn't the loudest we've heard but
it's in the right place and it has
enough oomph to make itself audible in
most settings
the Droid turbo is an absolute
powerhouse both outside and in no it
doesn't quite live up to the hype
but then again what smartphone does if
you're on Verizon Wireless and you're
looking for a durable smart phone that
also brings features you can't find
almost anywhere else the droid turbo
runs for $1.99 to 249 with contract
along with some uncharacteristically
generous trade-in and early upgrade
programs from Verizon that makes the
turbo one of the best deals you can find
on America's largest network and all
things considered one of the best
contract values you can find anywhere
are you stuck between the Droid turbo
and the Moto X but we've got just the
video for you click above for the
straight comparison and also check out
our Moto X review here on YouTube and at

been michael fisher with pocket now
captain to phones on twitter reminding
you to get your device info from reviews
