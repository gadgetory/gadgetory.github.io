confirm the minimum storage options for
the iphone 7 design lee show us the two
HTC nexus devices might be identical to
each other and if you've got the one
plus three Ram performance update you
might want to think twice I'm Hyman
Rivera with a massive cold and wondering
why there's no thundercats movie this is
parking out daily we try to launch every
single day with deals but today we don't
have any because fourth of July pretty
much took that over but we do have some
very important information regarding
software updates starting with the one
plus three up one plus ceded their high
quality update to fix the whole Ram
issues with the phone and it turns out
that the update is now being pulled by
the company because it doesn't seem to
be that high quality so if you've got
the up that you might want to wait we'll
let you know as soon as it hits back on
the air other important information when
it comes to software updates has to do
with Apple as the company has just
seated iOS 10 watch os3 and the mac OS
sierra beta tues to developers and the
main changes here have everything to do
with the fact that you can now unlock
your Mac using your Apple watch and also
the fact that you've got a ton of
stability improvements you have to know
that beta ones are terrible beta 2
hopefully is a little more stable we
will keep you posted as soon as we give
it a try and tell you more about it and
since we're talking Apple let's start
talking about iphone 7 mainly because of
the Wall Street Journal and it's
credible sources have already begun
shiny and on storage options and even
though we don't hear the maximum storage
options for the iphone 7 we do hear that
the minimum will no longer be 16
gigabytes apparently we're starting on
32 it is great news we've been waiting
for that for a while I think that the
iphones have been starting at 16 gigs
ever since the iphone four and twenty
ten that's a crazy amount of time from
them to here so let's just hope that the
price tag doesn't become crazy after
that as well as will the spotlight over
to hcc for those of you that are
wondering how well the HTC 10 is doing
we've got some very interesting
information the links of the description
that shows the statistics of different
companies and probably the most
interesting one is HTC the HTC 10
continues to be one of our favorite
smartphone
of the year but it seems that that's
just the case first reviewers because
sadly in the market it hasn't really
performed well after the point where the
trendy analytics claim that there won't
be more than 1 million HTC 10 sold and
that is really sad given the fact that
this is a really really good phone up to
the point where it's currently my daily
driver um but yeah it seems that HTC
still needs to do some more work to gain
back its limelight but finally the hot
news today have to do again with HTC and
what the company is trying to do to
regain its limelight we've been talking
about the HTC nexus devices that we
should be expecting that we get the
first leaked images of the phones they
look nothing like the HTC 10 I'll tell
you that they look extremely different
mainly from the back because apparently
we've got a lot of glass in the visor in
the back then we've got some metal at
the bottom and it's a very interesting
change in design but the most
interesting part is that apparently both
devices are going to be the same phone
or should I say just one is going to be
larger than the other or whatever other
changes of hcc and google plan to bring
here the thing we notice is that there
is no nexus branding there's just the
google logo leading to the rumors that
well probably the nexus line will
continue but these could be google
phones but it leads me to the question
of today what do you think about these
leaked images of these HTC nexus devices
or google devices for that matter do you
like the designer not because in my case
I like the design I just hope they don't
only launch them in black because that's
gonna be rather unfortunate in my
opinion leave us a comment down below
