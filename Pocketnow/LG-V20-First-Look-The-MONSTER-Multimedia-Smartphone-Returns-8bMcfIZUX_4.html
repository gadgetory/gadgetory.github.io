aside the v10 was my favorite phone of
2015 and for those of us tracking tech
this year there were certainly some
concerns over what LG would deliver as a
follow-up
let's put most of those concerns to rest
the LG v 20 gives off a fantastic first
impression as LG has walked away from
the g5 s primer coating delivering a
true metal shell with corner pieces that
allow for radio reception where many
were concerned in the leaked photos that
this might be a modular design this
quick release key is how we pop open the
backplate apparently the v20 doesn't
need any connected friends and if this
delivers better access to the battery
sim and SD cards then we're more than
happy for this phone to be a lone wolf
walking around the design we combined
the tech and lifestyle features of the
v10 with a harder-edged version of the
g5 s curves the forehead and chin angled
away from the front screen but do so
with more deliberate lines the bottom
collection of speaker imports is sharper
and the dual rear camera module is more
clearly delineated from the rest of the
back shell this first look was on
pre-release software and utilized LG's
newest skin which eliminates the app
drawer we don't know if that will be
replaced as it was on the g5 but we do
have Android 7.0 nougat to play with
bringing a cleaner notification shade
and Google's native split screening apps
the settings menu is still customized
but it's less garish than previous LG
phones have been in tweaking this list
the look of this phone screams business
and the hardware has the goods to back
it up first of all as a lifestyle device
we're happy to see that LG still rates
this phone as milspec 810g drop and
shock-resistant we might lose the v10
steel rails but this phone should still
be able to handle daily abuse with grace
we're working with three cameras overall
the V tends dual selfie shooters have
been condensed until one lens which is
capable of both normal and wide fields
of view and the rear module adopts the
g5 s dual sensor setup this is the most
feature complete photo and video app
ever delivered by a phone manufacturer
the user has exacting controls over
shutter speed white balance ISO aspect
ratio frame rate and bit rate for video
the video mode also refines the terrific
microphone directionality and gain
adjustments plus LG claims the b20
microphones have been improved capable
of recording in louder environments
before clipping your audio and a high
quality audio capture app is included to
showcase that new audio hardware the
headphone jack is asked to a formidable
entry in this year's race for best
smartphone sound the ESS Dax in and
provide fantastic fidelity and more than
capable of driving higher impedance
headphones Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen are
responsible for tuning the audio
software and the International v20 will
include bno earbuds in select markets we
might not get them in the United States
due to carrier influence which would be
a shame the show floor was a poor place
to really test audio quality but the
first listen was promising and we'll
certainly be testing this in our full
review the secondary ticker displays
subtly refreshed with a few more options
for shortcuts and controls it's a handy
resource for quick actions like throwing
a flashlight and lastly maybe the
weakest performance area for the v10 was
its mediocre battery life LG is
addressing this by including a slightly
larger battery 3200 milliamp power over
the v10 s 3000 but the V 20 will also
benefit from a more powerful and more
efficient chipset in the Qualcomm 820
and hopefully Android nougat will also
improve standby times and low-power
modes so what makes a phone a power user
device LG has a unique answer to that
question here in a gadget that looks to
crush multimedia and delivers rich
content creation tools right out of the
box like the v10 before it this is a
phone with a focus and it looks like it
might be another absolute monster but of
course we'll have to spend a little more
time putting this beast through its
paces as always thanks so much for

v 20 and help us out with some sharing
