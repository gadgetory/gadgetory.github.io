assume that at least they look alike but
that's a different story here I'm gonna
be better with pocket now here with a
quick show floor comparison of the LG g5
versus the LG v10 brought to you by deep
brand if you were a fan of LG's previous
design language this comparison is going
to be tough LG claims that the v10 was
the direct inspiration for the g5 but
these phones could not look more
different the g5 a smaller slimmer
lighter and far more elegant that the
rugged finish of its predecessor the
stainless steel and plastic finish we
saw before are now gone and instead we
see a more futuristic and I'll get
looking LG g5 covered in a uniquely
treated metal that does away with the
antenna lines these improvements are
both good and bad depending on your
perspective the g5 feels smaller than it
looks in the hand thanks to the gentle
curves at the back while the v10 was
designed to make a statement sort of
like the engine name that it tries to
mimic the display on the g5 is smaller
and also lacks the dual display of its
predecessor but compensates with an
always-on mode that provides some of
that functionality and a new IPS display
that provides better contrast and
saturation in addition to more
brightness when needed the g5 also
sports the newer Snapdragon 820
processor one more gig of ram and
doesn't lose the expand ability of the
v10 with expandable storage through the
SIM tray in addition to a replaceable
battery through the slot that still
lacks a name do keep in mind that the g5
has 200 million powers less than the
power pack but we assume that
enhancements in the processor might
contribute to some sort of efficiency as
the LG v10 was no road warrior anyways
other major enhancements come in the
form of the camera to a certain degree
the g5 is said to sport pretty much the
same camera of the b10 which is great
but the g5 brings a separate wide-angle
camera to complement the experience in a
way it follows the same dual camera
feature that the v10 brought in the
front-facing shooter in that sense the
v10 is superior than the g5 in the
front-facing cameras but the g5 is
better in the primary ones this
wide-angle camera is designed to enhance
your experience when you can't move away
from subjects and sports a larger field
of view than the human eye can detect
the g5 also follows the v10 in that it
supports hi-fi audio through a separate
accessory though we'll talk about those
features in a separate video then there
are the more controversial changes where
the infamous LG skin is still here
though now running on android 6.0.1
marshmallow and with the added work that
it doesn't include an app tray now and
apparently there's no way to disable
that we know a lot of people won't like
that
bottom line we do have to acknowledge
that both phones cater to a different
crowd the v10 is larger and more in
charger while the g5 is far more modern
and innovative we obviously have a lot
more to test before we can come up with
a final verdict but so far I'd say that
the dramatic changes of the g5 actually
complement what the v10 got started our
