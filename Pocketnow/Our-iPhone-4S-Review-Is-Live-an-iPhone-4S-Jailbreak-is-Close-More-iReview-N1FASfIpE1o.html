iphone 4s jailbreak seems to be just
around the corner and I zooms match
seems to be closer than ever all this
and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi Mary veteran welcome to
the park and nail I review the show we
go through all this week school and
they're not so cool inside the role of
Apple's iOS devices let's talk this week
off with the cool that's right brandon's
full review of the iphone 4s is now live
and so far wallet device scored grade on
our thoughts and even test we dug deep
into siri told you what it is what it
should be and what we didn't like about
it we also compared it to some really
good smart phones in the market like the
samsung galaxy s2 and even the droid
bionic and we even compared it to the
iphone 4 to help you make up your mind
whether you should take up on the iphone
4s is stick with the iphone 4 we sadly
wishes the iphone 4s looked a little
different than the iphone 4 but to be
honest with you even though it's last
year's hardware design the design last
year was really years ahead so anyways
apple still hasn't given us dates as to
when we can expect iTunes Match to
becoming reality but so far we are
already getting resets on iTunes Match
to developer accounts and well Apple
seems to be working on it and hopefully
we will be getting it really soon
remember I to and smashes that service
that will allow you to legalize your
pirate it I'm sorry I mean downloaded
music for as little as 25 dollars a year
and you can also stream your music to
your devices if you choose to stick with
a low and intro model iphone 4 for 8
gigabytes or an iphone 3gs so it's a
really compelling way to stream music to
your device as long as it's in your
library now the net is full of rumors
about Apple working on an Apple TV and
while i'm not talking about a typical
black box that's an apple TV i'm talking
about a real TV that's made from apple
now even though we don't really cover
TVs here what's interesting here is that
it seems that Apple is planning supports
Siri onto this device as a remote now
can you imagine talking to your TV and
asking it what's coming up on CNN and
having the device or is TV tell you and
or can you imagine telling your TV hey I
want to record this show that's coming
up in a couple of hours it's really good
to see that Apple could probably be
bringing something groundbreaking to TV
Steve Jobs biol talks about the fact
that he probably cracked the code on how
to get a really good TV coming to the
market so it's really compelling to see
what Apple can bring to the table now
what would be really cool is I've if I
could talk to Siri on the move on the go
and tell Siri hey I want you to record
this TV show coming up and Sarah would
do it remotely from my iphone to the TV
that's at home now that will be really
cool now let's talk about jailbreak so
far no iOS 5 devices reach in unto their
jailbreak and we'll obviously no a5
processor device like the iPad toward
the iphone 4s as a jailbreak either
neither tethered nor untether now
interesting enough we ran through some
images of an iphone for us having a semi
tethered jailbreak now by Semites
Heather what this means into the dev
team figured out a way for you to happen
a tethered jailbreak on your device but
if your device gets stuck or you have to
reset it well the device will boot up to
your typical iOS 5 UI and well you won't
have a step of ice brick waiting for you
to connect to your pc once you connect
to your pc well you can just reboot it
to your tethered jailbreak status so
really cool to have this coming up
though we still don't have any dates as
to when we could expect it
that doesn't really cool that's
continued on with the not so cool what
are the two major complaints about the
iphone 4s so far Sprint customers are
complaining about the beta speeds of the
iphone 4s and well interesting enough
the sprint CEO came on record to state
that no the prom is not really the
iphone for us but actually all the
Android smartphones out there so sprint
first of all let's leave the excuses and
just figure it out because i phone 4s
customers do deserve to have your full
network working and the other complaint
has been that customers have been
complaining about the iphone 4s battery
life so far even engineers have been
calling customers to ask what's going on
and whoa they just want to find out
what's the prom either could be hardware
or it could be that the device has a
farm with iOS 5 so far wrong let's hope
Apple brings up a new iOS update that
can figure that out because hey we all
need battery life and so far in our
review it came out to be good but it
could be a lot better so let's hope they
fix it up that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm hi
Natalie better remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
