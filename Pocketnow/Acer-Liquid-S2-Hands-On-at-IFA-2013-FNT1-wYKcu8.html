still at Aoife day one this time at the
acer booth checking out a monster of a
smartphone the acer liquid s2 let's
check out this beast so folks just see i
have a concept of how large this device
is check it out next to the quite large
in its own right galaxy note 2 from
samsung go ahead and flip them on their
sides here to show you that the liquid
s2 is also dinner and on the front face
sorry we just wait these off but they
get smudging very very quickly you can
see that the liquid s2 is just a beast
of a handset in the hand it feels quite
nice and you take the Galaxy Note 2 away
despite the the trend toward you know
polished glossy plastic finishes this is
a matte finish this one is in red but
it's in several different colors here on
the desk including black and I believe
white this camera on the back here just
to continue the hardware tour is a 13
megapixel primary shooter it is
complemented by a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera obviously a
notification light there look at the
stylized earpiece to I mean this is very
very cool stuff you know it's subtle
it's not too flashy but it definitely
lends something to the device also
capacitive keys below the screen
including our home key design I haven't
seen anywhere else maybe on the previous
liquid there's the volume rocker on the
side here and I believe we've got a
couple of trays here for either this is
the Micro SIM and this here is the
expandable memory I am guessing I can't
see it quite on the spec sheet there was
so taken with the hardware we really
wanted to get into this right away you
can see a little hardware call out down
there is calling up dolby surround sound
that makes sense because of the left and
right speakers which are on the bottom
of the device if you hold it in
landscape anyway enough of me to join
let's go ahead and power on the display
which unfortunately you do with the
power stand waking up top which is just
kind of ridiculous it should be on the
side there's no excuse really a device
of this size but then some tablets have
it up there too so what do I know here's
Android very close to stock build of
Andrew
we go through you can see fairly
responsive we've gotten it to hiccup a
little bit between the home screens of
course these are retail floor units acer
not going out of its way to show off any
custom widgets but let's see if we can
see what's going on here here's all our
home screens drop it on here let's see
if what what they've included in terms
of widgets some very nice clock and
weather combos and drag and drop onto
here this display by the way is an IPS
panel this is for dot-to-dot to
jellybean is a full HD IPS display and
it is Gorilla Glass 3 protecting it up
top and I do not believe that the
battery is removable but at least we do
of that expandable memory noise
cancelling mic up there acer liquid s2
you know definitely doesn't at the top
of our priority list to check out i
gotta tell you feels really really good
in the hand and we might try and get a
review unit for ourselves to check out
even though it's unlikely to come to the
states last I checked maybe I'm wrong on
that we'll have to see that's Anton
behind the camera this is Eva day one
from pocket now stay tuned for a lot
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
