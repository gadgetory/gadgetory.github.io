than six months since the launch of the
Xperia z2 in just a few weeks after the
XZ 2 premium sony has just surprised us
with another more modern flagship for
2018 that's still missing a few bells
and whistles
reporting from e fed in Berlin I'm he
met me there with pocket now and let's
go hands-on
to start please pardon the feather on
the units on display this booth has
really been packed for days so this was
a real problem trying to get a good
glimpse of the goods for you at first
and I will admit that I wasn't really
very interested in the eggs III mainly
because it looked pretty much like a
magazine too in every way but it turns
out that appearances can truly be
deceiving from the back it doesn't look
like a nice gig - but economics have
been addressed the fingerprint scanner
seems to be in the middle but it's
actually higher so you won't be
confusing it with a camera lens anymore
from the front this looks nothing like a
Sony as a matter of fact the design of
the bezels remind me more of the pixel
to excel with rounded corners and larger
top and a bottom
the Gorilla Glass 5 has now curved at
the front of the back taking ergonomics
a step further Sony is dubbing this its
new HDR bravia OLED display with quad HD
plus resolution an 18 by 9 aspect ratio
which honestly looked really good in the
demo brighter in the booth so assist
with content consumption those thicker
than average bezels actually serve a
purpose as Sony signature speakers are
here now being dubbed s force delivering
front surround and the vibration trick
that we saw in the egg z2 and didn't
really like tucked inside we have a new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor 6 Iike
bytes of RAM 64 gigs of expandable
storage if you don't use the secondary
SIM slot a 3300 milliamp hour battery is
she wireless charging an IP 68 water and
dust resistance and yes we were really
expecting to see the new 48 megapixel
sensor from Sony instead we have a new
19 megapixel camera the company is
dubbing motion AI with an ISO capability
of twelve thousand eight hundred at the
front we have a 13 megapixel shooter at
F 1.9 aperture and yes no worries the
dedicated camera button is still here as
well probably the coolest feature about
this device is the fact that it's
launching with Android Pi out of the box
though it isn't stock we have the
typical sony proprietary launcher now
blend it with some elements of Pi here
and their pricing and availability is
still not provided but we do have some
new color options to drool for so yeah
this is the new Sony Xperia x III I'm
not gonna lie I really like this phone
it looks a lot better when holding it
than what you've seen in renders but let
us know what you think about it in the
