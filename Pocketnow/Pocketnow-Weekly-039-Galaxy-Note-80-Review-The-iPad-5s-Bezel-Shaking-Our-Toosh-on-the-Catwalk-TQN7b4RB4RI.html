than three is a podcast and two is a
conversation something whatever that
means to you if it means anything you've
stumbled upon a very lean episode of the
pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss smartphones tablets and the
state of mobile technology in 2013 I'm
Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and it's a lean episode
because i'm joined only today by jaime
rivera multimedia manager good afternoon
to you good afternoon to you sir how's
everything ah man rough it's not it is a
very difficult day on the on the podcast
because we were supposed to have Tony
with us at managing editor Anton Dino
Joe but he was unable to join here the
last minute of obligation pop up Brandon
was too busy and he was busy with Steven
shanks so neither of them could come on
the show both Adam Dowd and Joe Levi
were unavailable due to other
commitments and tailors getting coffee
is ya know he's getting a car I think
but you know really yeah one thing of
the other yeah besides I'm buying up the
entire American coffee supply today
because I need it so desperately so your
entire American coffee supply which
comes from Honduras columbia and and I I
think dang boy and go out of kate's it
in in chemical factories I don't think
there's anything natural about and
Dunkin Donuts yeah I still can't believe
you prefer Dunkin Donuts a ver starbucks
man seriously yeah starbucks just tastes
like they take a blowtorch tube to a
guitar I don't know that's the eternal
debate right anyway it's the eternal
debate fire away it is a so it's a
two-person show today listeners thank
you for joining us and we have a little
bit to talk about there might be a
little bit shorter than usual but now
that I've said that of course it's gonna
be 90 minutes long we've had her crazy
busy week haven't we haven't talked to
you even via I am in its days you've
been like so busy you've been
unavailable well it's been crazy man
we've got a couple of good reviews
coming up good good devices that are
arriving I it's been good it's been
and we've had a couple reviews this week
we've had yeah the HTC one review for
the sprint version of the HTC One went
live on Monday which would came courtesy
of me and then the the samsung galaxy
note 8.0 review for by our own tailor
martin came up on the following day on
tuesday yeah and was that that was
Taylor's first tablet review right
that's right that's right and that was
uh that was your editing work on the on
the video review I thought that was a
good review it was a good review I don't
know I told you I liked that note at
eight point oh I wish it had a better
display but so far I feel that's like
the perfect form factor for for you know
for stylus but anyways we'll talk about
that I think no I think you're
absolutely right and we should we should
talk about it briefly now because I i
think that the 10 dot one with its
horizontal form factor is not all that
conducive to the kind of work that I do
but something that's a little bit
smaller and portrait orientation with
the S Pen that's a nice nice size sweet
spot for that kind of device you know
seriously i am not sure how long it's
going to take android oems to figure out
the fact that no landscape tablet has
ever taken off none yeah well is that is
that true that's actually true think
about it how many landscape tablets out
there have you seen have had as much
success as the nexus 7 or the ipad none
but i mean there are mitigating factors
that right because they because the ipad
has just a bunch of of issues in its
favor and the nexus 7 was too cheap to
ignore but yeah but you're right anytime
that I have a horizontal tablet come
into my life I'm like a landscape tablet
I'm kind of like okay how do I fit this
into my flow I've been using the envy x2
recently as I think I mentioned I
mentioned on the air last week right
yeah I did yeah and as I tweeted
recently I think it's kind of reminded
me of or maybe I didn't tweet or maybe
this is a first heard statement there's
kind of reminded me of all the reasons I
really don't like Windows 8 now but
that's a software thing right so and we
can talk about the software stuff that
that gets down to that and I kind of
don't want to talk about it with only
you on the air because with no with no
control rod I feel like we'll just we'll
just
lose everyone um i don't know i think i
would need am laying on the podcast
account yet definitely that would be
awesome I mean I Adams got a lot of
perspective on Windows that he's been
he's been there for years he's actually
RR he's our oldest member in pocket now
and he's been here ever since the
beginning so here's a thousand right
yeah exactly you know so so going back
to the noid the to the note 8 point
Taylor's perspective on the review I
love them you know it is a good tablet I
think it's a good concept but just like
the Galaxy Note one I feel that it
requires a second version you know a
version that improves on it on
everything that the first version didn't
have like like the terrible display that
it has like the fact that that you know
the speaker placement just so many
things of the tablet could have been
great and Samson just went to cheap on
it I think that was the the biggest
problem in the review yeah I I think
you're right and I also was thinking
about the display at sub 200 DPI or a
ppi yeah yeah that's that's that's
pretty crazy and I I you know to be
honest Tony and I didn't I or at least I
didn't see that much of a problem with
it in in Barcelona but then again it was
really early in the morning and maybe I
did I haven't looked back at our hands
on video or some of that just don't
remember that being the issue an issue
with the display I do trust Taylor
completely though and i bet i was
surprised i think it's a promising
product i just feel that the you know
again Samson they're not charging cheap
for it starting there let's start there
it's not a cheap tablet and I said what
is the price center just to refresh and
remember the the price but it was a
little bit over the ipad mini i believe
yeah i'm going down to pricing and
availability you Wi-Fi only 16 gigs just
hit the UK for 339 euro okay that's a
lot more expensive than an ipad mini
yeah well yeah well three ninety-nine
ninety-nine so that's what 70 bucks more
right is the ipad mini still 329 not
yeah yeah okay yeah so yeah and you know
when we talked to Samsung about this in
Barcelona we mentioned that actually we
were talking about like okay so here's
the price disparity is seventy dollars
more than the ipad mini and samsung's
kind of immediate response was yeah but
this does more we uh you know agree it's
great
yeah I didn't have more utility hardware
it does more of what people haven't
really started caring about yet right so
it's yeah it's like it's it's sort of
future proofed in that respect and it's
not at all future proofed in terms of
some of the underpowered specs like the
display how many times have you used
your s plan come on you've been a big
galaxy note 2 ambassador you got me to
use one yeah I dad and and tell me I
mean how many times you use the S Pen
because i don't i love the phone because
of the size and everything but not
because of the s-pen ahhh when I carried
it more frequently i used the s-pen
quite a bit but to be quite honest I
haven't I haven't really used the note 2
recently it has fallen into disuse in my
household thanks to the HTC One here
yeah yeah lucky you yeah stop it diet
which you know I'm starting to think
about the one and and we can talk about
it very briefly obviously the entire
tech space has kind of fallen in love
with this unit and it's something that I
think we've been waiting to applaud HTC
for a while rather than just kind of
encourage encourage it and hope that
hope that the company creates something
amazing that we that we know it could do
and I think a lot of people regard the
HTC One is an amazing device and I'm
certainly one of them but I've been
prompted recently in the past day or so
to just kind of take a step back and
make sure and just check in with myself
and make sure that we're not all just in
this crazy delirious honeymoon phase
that's going to pass at some point and
we're all going to realize that we've
oversold this device have you dropped up
dangerous you know he dropped it I have
not but brandon has and his that that
chamfered edge that beveled area is
quite susceptible to impact so it's soft
metal there so yeah no no it's just
important to retain some perspective so
that's what I'm trying to do over the
next couple days over the weekend I'm
going to just make sure I look at the
device with a bit more of a critical eye
I mean already you know the review is
out I still stand by the review I still
pointed at the low points in the in the
device and there are some low points in
it but from what I've seen from
everything I've seen over the course of
now I guess 10 or 11 days of using it um
it's it's it's
it's the most solid android phone i've
ever used yeah I is just really
something else so I I can imagine I you
know after your review and Brandon room
and Brandon's review I've really you
know I've it's not that I changed my
mind i still feel that i will be more
suited by the galaxy s4 for my
particular specific needs um but uh yeah
I'm curious I want one can you please
get me one I was gonna ask you by the
way since you got the sprint version as
a review unit yeah does that one have a
sim tray yeah does and sprint usually in
the United States sprint has this thing
where they have not historically
included removable Sims I think both the
galaxy s is the galaxy and the gun 02
they have integrated Sims this would be
the second phone aside from the iphone 5
that has rule sim now the question is
have you tried placing another sim card
on it I haven't I realize like my debt
that sends my tech cred into the
basement right that's like the first
thing I should have done if I were well
here's the deal I mean in the case of
the HTC One I believe there are there is
just one model and that model I'm by the
way I'm just throwing it out there i'm
not sure but in the case of the iphone 5
for example there are three models and
blt cdma variants does support gsm you
know you can use it on AT&amp;amp;T and it's
unlocked on verizon by law but then on
Sprint's it is locked so i'm curious to
know what happens when you try to pop
another sim card on that i will get back
to you on that i like that was one of
the things i meant to test before the
before my review actually and I didn't
get to that that was like the one of the
two things that slips through the cracks
so I will do that i'll follow up but
what is interesting that you now that
you bring up the differences between the
HTC One units the and I just wrote an
article about this the one on sprint
does not have any carrier branding on it
yeah she has a and the one on
eighty-eight she does and not no one in
eighteen t has the Death Star yeah now
what a question I mean there were minor
apps i mean i thought there were only
like one or two right what up the
bloatware yeah the bloatware oh no it's
friggin ridiculous there's so much blood
on this thing spray oh no sorry aight
the AT&amp;amp;T variant is the one that only
has two yeah i think they wouldn't
really slide on the on the software
there so there's a balance but it was
interesting to get comment from
rent and HTC on the lack of hardware
branding because you know that's unusual
in the United States we've had some
commenters helpfully chime in from other
parts of the world where apparently in
Argentina it's very uncommon to have
carrier branding so that that must be
nice oh and my country it's zero carrier
brand that seeks way that's crazy
because in America you know how it's
frickin nuts like verizon's throw in
there check mark on the home button the
galaxy note 2 and Dora Mike yeah 4G LTE
stuff everywhere like there's always
always always silk-screened carrier
stuff and on the HTC One that's not the
case so it's so unusual to carry this
device and you know basically have
people asked you like Oh what carrier is
that on because it doesn't say it on it
you know anywhere it's do you even even
more interesting is is that not
happening with HTC because you know
Samsung pretty much you know obviously
Apple change the game with the iphone
there's no carrier branding anywhere but
then you know Samson did the bold move
of you know bringing the galaxy s3 as a
one device where you can pretty much
just flip the battery cover and you
don't know if it's carrier branded or
not if you get an original battery cover
you don't know if it's a sprint brand
that our AT&amp;amp;T branded device on the s3
yeah and and in the case of the HTC One
you know HTC has always been the company
that tries to fit the phone to as much
as the carry requirements as possible
and still for the first time ever we see
an HTC phone without carrier branding
that's really interesting it's cool yeah
not only did they take the step of
catching up to where Samsung was last
year of saying no it's going to be the
same hardware across all carriers we're
not changing any we're not adding a
keyboard for you but they also took in
the extra step and they were like no
also no branding at least on sprint so
that's interesting in Sprint's comment
on this was very enlightening where I
was like what HTC must have thrown a
bunch of money at him or something like
that but no Sprint's basic position was
that yeah look if we don't put sprint
branding on this we can go ahead and
later down the road or even immediately
if we want to siphon off you know a
couple thousand of these units and throw
them in the boxes within throwing a
boost box or throw in a virgin mobile
box and for a prepaid device without yet
without having to rip off the logo or
without having to change it you know
it's just one less step for them and
that makes a lot of sense logistically
right well well there
by a new company now so that's another
all right I keep forgetting about the SK
Telecom thing yeah yeah i was going to
softbank so we're soft soft not as they
say I'm sorry yeah I was gonna ask you
one last question okay you are a
photography tog raphy buff you love
taking photos I'm like it yeah it's
super amateur but yeah who cares you
know that the point is you use your
phone for the camera a lot true true so
bottom line are you making this phone
your daily driver and tolerating the
camera coming from a Lumia 920 I am and
it's working out quite well because the
Lumia 920's camera is excellent but what
are its hallmark features optical image
stabilization and low-light performance
yeah and you get that on the one you
don't get the optical image
stabilization on the one but you do get
the excellent low-light performance and
frankly the 920 I which I still adore it
frustrates me because even after the
software update I still have some kind
of soft focus issue I have to take a
shot multiple times to get a really good
sharp one and with the one you know it's
obviously a camera of half the
resolution but it's other aspects kind
of jump in to fill the gap Plus as an
Android device it has Instagram and then
well there's that fine get me a phone
get me a phone now let's just leave it
there before you and I you know have our
first podcast fight on the on the air
right well it's we've been talking about
the hd2 on this whole week so let's
let's let's move on a little bit before
we jump into windows to cover that one
more remark about the envy x2 a lot of
people have been asking if I'm going to
review it it's a little late to review
the envy x2 I mean it's been out for
months now we are probably not going to
review it but I might try and sneak in
and after the buzz if possible yeah you
could probably just film the macbook air
and since they look pretty much
identical they look so similar but you
know it's so no idea envy x2 is so
beautiful but there's so much that's
different about it and there's so much
that I don't think works I'm a little
surprised it got the high reviews I've
got from other outlets because I I'm not
seeing it but we'll maybe we'll save
that for after
the buzz I'm just I'm still getting to
know it I don't know let's be honest I
was an HP customer from the year 2000 to
the year when I when did I buy my first
mac on 2009 mm-hmm I was a nine-year HP
customer from the times of compact to HP
I used everything from pocket pcs to
everything I liked HP's taste their
taste not necessarily in design because
not everything is original to them but
they you know they did something very
smart when they absorbed compact they
kept the designers from compaq and these
are very good designers I mean they your
yeah i mean and i feel that that x2 that
is like the only Envy i would ever buy
not necessarily because it is um not
necessarily because it's um it looks
like the macbook air no I don't like the
macbook air actually I just feel that HP
you know it's it's probably not a bull
design but it's it's like the way
windows 8 was intended to be used but
then Windows 8 has its own flaws that
make the tab that make the product uh
not not its best thing oh god that's the
thing I mean using the envy x2 I my
complaints are seldom about the hardware
and in data use I first of all I'm still
on my first battery charge I think it's
been three days since i unbox the thing
and I've used it every day yeah i've
used it over totally so that's amazing
and the hardware is quite beautiful and
having the detachable tablet its
top-heavy which is very annoying but
that's about my only complaint about the
hardware that on the fact that the
keyboard isn't backlit but it's not the
hardware that i'm complaining about us
the software it's just man windows 8 I
you know and I'm still relearning it i'm
still trying to get the gestures down
that the surface taught me but jumping
constantly between the modern UI desktop
and the traditional Windows desktop
which for some reason I'm forced to do
considering something about my usage
habits forces that it has rendered the
experience very disjointed and I really
have been having a very difficult time
so okay Microsoft of you're listening to
this we don't hate your mother your
modern UI just do is above it just do as
a favor whenever 8.1 comes out could you
please give us the option to turn it off
well the modern ease now ya know cuz the
future is there right if you know in the
modern
do I but but I mean okay can we just
either stay on the modern UI or stay on
the desktop and not have that flipping
around well why don't you yeah you have
a surface RT and just remove the old
school to fake desktop because i miss
the browser from the server side she
actually and i have a such a stupid
question this is why i kind of wish we
had a third on the show who is a little
more familiar with windows because i
might my i want to make this clear my
experience with the envy x2 this is not
a review unit this is a personal you
know it's mine so I I'm not working when
i'm using it i'm using it as a user I'm
yes I'm getting some impressions from it
as a as a reviewer as a writer as
whatever but basically I'm just you know
experiencing it for my personal use so
there are things that I come across
where I'm like wow I can't solve this
problem like I'll jump to the browser
and I'm like wow I still I wish I could
jump into the like the surface RT's
version of internet explorer that keeps
me in the modern you know interface land
which too because if you are in the
modern UI you get one browser and then
if you're in the other you while you get
the other right and I'm on the end on
the envy x2 I have to go to the whole
desktop with the browser anyway it's ah
got it so so uh anyway I need a class i
basically need a windows 8 class because
i can't and the thing that i was excited
about it compared to the surface on the
surface you can't run like old yeah Oh
old games and stuff I then it was like
maybe I maybe I'll be able to run Hugo's
house of horrors are like spit wad
Willie or some of these old dos games on
the on the envy x2 and I know there's
different processes open state was
behind really yeah but ya know I'm
getting those you know this device does
not support full screen mode errors and
stuff like that and granted I didn't do
any research before i picked up the
product i just have what's in love with
it ever since berlin and i was like
maybe i can do it no I can't and then
you need a rocket science degree to
understand the error codes it's like
error 2002 x3 god I know which I didn't
remember those but I didn't get any way
anyone look it look all right before we
before let's let's jump into Windows
Phone 8 while we're on the Windows Phone
bandwagon for a second and talk about
the Nokia Lumia 928 which has been
leaked for verizon this is basic
the verizon variant of the Lumia 920
right yep but it's a different phone I
mean it's amazing well I'm trying I'm
trying to understand this I mean there
was nothing wrong with the Nokia Lumia
920's designers I from the wait but the
design looks a lot like the Lumia 720 or
the a little bit like the HTC 8x is okay
well that's where I'm trying to go um
you know when when microsoft launched
you know when microsoft and HTC launched
the windows phone 8x they were like
these are the signature windows phones
and we understood that you know they
parted with HTC for the for the
signature experience I wish there was
something like that on Android know the
Nexus products or not um but but what
I'm trying to say is that I'm trying to
understand what happened in that meeting
because then we get the Lumia 720 which
looks a lot like it and then the new
flagship coming to to verizon keeps the
same designs I'm like is Microsoft
influencing design in any way for these
products look so similar to each other
and not get sued by anybody that's a
really good question i don't know what's
happening there I know verizon is
continues to be the prime offender in
redesigning hardware for itself oh yeah
you know I mean the lumia 822 is a great
example of that where that looks like no
other phone and if anywhere I think
there's an international version called
something else I don't know but it looks
nothing like the original 820 that it's
based on I think I actually have one
sitting right here in front of me it's
oh god it's just ugly but then that's
just how much you like the phone you
don't even remember if you have one
there yeah exactly right it's a solid
performers just in the ugliest case ever
so we know verizon has a very strong
influence on how devices are designed
particularly ones that are on kind of
underdog platforms now this 928 928
doesn't look bad at all but I find it
interesting that this speaker grill on
the back suggests that they've moved the
speaker from the side bottom from the
bottom side to the bottom back yet
avenues but I'm looking forward to that
xenon flash man you saw that oh I'm
looking at that right now is that what
that is that's a xenon flash on there so
it's got a small LED and it's their
adult video spotlight or something right
yeah and it also has a xenon
flash that is gonna be awesome I mean
the only other device that had a xenon
flash was like the the what's Tony's
phone that anyway that that's what i
call it now I don't call it a peer
review at the 808 pier i call it tony's
funny Scott he's the only human being on
this planet i thought it holds that
phone actually me too yeah but I love
hanging out with him cuz whenever he
uses it i am envious until he starts
typing or doing anything that a
smartphone requires but when he's taking
photos I'm mph it's gonna be very
curious to see this thing in action III
and I'm excited I think we need to keep
some perspective here and from an
American standpoint it's very important
that Nokia get a version of the 920 on
verizon cuz right oh yeah the high-end
Windows Phone experience on verizon is
what it's there isn't any 8x well it's
the 8x and that's about it well I said
there isn't any well yeah well rumors
are that sprint is gonna be bringing the
achieve s to their lineup so that's
pretty cool but you know it's good to
have verizon bring in some real premium
stuff here I'm gonna ask you a Windows
Phone question that that's actually I
should have asked you this like like
when we talked in Vegas yeah um do you
you came from windows phone seven and
then 28 just like I did um do you notice
that the keyboard was more accurate on
your Lumia 900 back in the day than on
the 920 um no because the Samsung Focus
the original Samsung Focus had the most
accurate keyboard probably that I've
ever used in my life you know where are
the most frustrating thing for me to go
from my 8 old HTC Titan to the 8x yeah
is that the Titan was like perfect yeah
obviously the screen was a lot bigger um
but you know I never it's the best
keyboard that I have ever used Windows
Phone either on the dell venue pro
that's they're in the drawer or the time
that's also they're in the drawer it was
perfect but then when i moved to the ax
you know to be honest with you the
reason why i don't use the phone is
because the keyboards expedition is
terrible mmm oh wait what and Windows
Phone 8 yeah oh it's not no it's not
it's it's great what do you mean it's
not it's a prediction problem with me
it's a precision problem though it could
be that I'm used to bigger screens now
it could be because we're all getting
used to bigger screens right but III
there there's obviously they had to
chain
everything at a kernel level when
they're bringing stuff from windows
phone 7 Windows Phone 8 so there was
probably some kind of just very minor
very moderate tweak that happened in the
keyboard that maybe you and I are both
experiencing or it could very well be
sought be hardware because we know that
Lumia 920 brings a lot on the hardware
front to change the screen yeah so I'm
not sure what it is it's still I still
find the 920's keyboard to be excellent
it is still one of the best keyboards
I've used but i still i miss my samsung
focus keyboard and it's interesting to
hear that you have a similar experience
with an older Windows Phone 7 device
that's crazy yeah yeah I still have that
tighten too yeah I have the title the
original tighten the be the dell venue
pro was my first Windows Phone it was my
favorite like it was my that is such a
sad story that thing could have been so
amazing right it could have been the
perfect phone yeah yeah I i would still
really like it if if something like that
came out again listeners for the record
out of every phone that i've owned and
owned currently owned the dell venue pro
is like the first phone that i really
really want it i really wanted it and
then thank you and then it took forever
to launch and then they killed it like a
couple of months late in the yeah before
we before we start talking about this
pre 3 i've got in front of myself
emporia so I'm talking about the sob
stories of mobile let's talk about the
Nokia catwalk real quickly this is the
phone that people keep throwing around
in comments like it's going to be like
whenever somebody brings up a cool story
about some other phone like if the if
the the underserved nokia nokia fans or
like get a little bit bent out of shape
about not being mentioned in long enough
to be like yeah whatever catwalks gonna
kill this thing so whatever yes i pop
open the story expecting to see the
rumors of a really really cool you know
EO slight device but no the spec leak
here that we're if it's are to be
believed it's it's like an aluminum 920
right it's an aluminum 920 and i'm
looking for spotify here right now to
look for my my song of right said fred
you remember that i'm a mom however that
i'm too sexy song yes from nearly 90
horse and the guy was saying they using
yeah he's shaking his little tush on the
cat walk away where did the
get that me oh these code names are
always greater than tit yeah but okay so
so the thing about this catwalk is and
I've been following it obviously for
parking out daily um we thought that it
was gonna be the 928 we thought that it
was gonna be the 928 so much do you
remember those news with Stephen Elop
through an iphone on the floor from yeah
from this presenter well the presenter
was telling him where is the Lumia 928 I
want a Lumia 928 I have an aluminum
iphone here and I want this on a nokia
he said something like that um right so
we were expecting this 928 to be the
aluminum design that that's pretty much
the catwalk so far it seems that the EOS
technology is probably not there yet
because it's not on the specs and we
just wonder what's what's holding nokia
back from from adopting you know other
materials now for the record I matter
about us speaking here personal opinion
aluminum is not the best material for a
phone your HTC One and my iphone 5 can
talk about that I mean it is I don't
know it looks terrible once can speak to
it yeah oh yeah but but i'm saying you
know a lot of people want this aluminum
phone i don't i want a 1080p display
Lumia that's what I want well the this
aluminum is so gorgeous and it's so
amazing to the touch I am terrified of
dropping it as i said in the review i
feel like i'm gonna drop it all the time
because it is so smooth and slippery but
and it's not gonna it's not gonna deal
with impacts well i don't think but
we'll see I don't know we have a
commenter asking not a comment or a
letter writer actually asking about
phone material which we might not get to
actually i'm not sure but we're not
going to get to anything if we don't
move on so we have windows phone yeah
1080p lumia i agree would be amazing and
we're starting to see well we will start
to see by the end of the year windows
phone 8 devices supporting 1080p is that
correct yeah gdr3 would be the update so
by the way i believe there are two
updates that have to happen before gdr3
so that's probably gonna happen by the
holiday season yes okay well that's
gonna be cool I not that I'm you know
it's funny when I was doing the
blackberry z10 vs HTC One comparison I
was talking about the screens and I'm
like well one of these is basically a
720p I think it's actually 768 or
whatever
yeah I don't know yeah so that's still
so I'm gonna expose a little bit of my
math ignorance right now and I don't
care but like I know they still consider
and whatever 1280 by 768 to be 720p
screens but are they technically because
it's not by 720p in the other no it's
not technically 16 by nine it's like 16
bytes is 16 x 10 right okay all right
that's what that was the missing the
aspect ratio is what I was missing
anyway yeah the aspect ratio is what's
different but the resolution is the same
yeah the point is i still want to do
this blindfolded thing or phones in a
duck blind thing and take him out on the
sidewalk and show people at 720p screen
in one hand and a 1080p screen and the
other and ask him to tell me which one
looks better because I'm still convinced
that half the population wouldn't be
able to tell the difference but now
they're beautiful I can't tell the
difference and this is just funny I you
know I obviously reviewed the Xperia ZL
yeah and Brandon asked me about it this
morning on a call that we had and he was
like so how's it going I'm like I hate
the display I'm like having a nexus 7
moment here right now I love everything
about you except the display oh oh yeah
and so he's like what phone are using
I'm like I'm back to the note 2 and he's
like what you got less pixel density I'm
like well some of us just you know some
some of us just fine certain pixel
density to be enough being a friend yeah
yeah that's a that's a big conversation
let's talk android let's to be since we
kind of sort of segue into it a little
bit then got away from and the HTC first
the facebook phone has been announced
the last time we had a pocket nah we CLE
is well last week of course we had the
podcast i think about 20 minutes before
the facebook event started before the
event yea which was just dumb so you
know we were not privy to the details
and then we we saw it so we talked about
it then on the pocket a lot like I via
the following day tell me I'm a your
feelings on on facebook home ok Facebook
a you're starting with Facebook home I
want to start with Facebook home because
that's the more significant thing I wish
you would have started backwards all
right go go to talk with HTC first then
we're okay you know I look at the HTC
first and i remem
the nexus 10 really I love the nexus one
I love that phone I mean it was so thin
so light so slick so very well made it
was a beautiful phone and you know 720p
a 720p display on a 4.3 inch you know
the device and it's so minimalistic you
know obviously it's submit to your phone
I understand that but you can you could
get stock Android on that thing I don't
know I I kind of like the phone I feel
like that as a sentiment that has been
expressed by many people in the tech
space over the past couple days where
people are like wow it's really tough to
get a stock like experience on a device
like this these days particularly one
from a manufacturer's high tier is HTC
so yeah I mean if they would have
snapped at you know I wouldn't care
about the dual core processor if they
would have snapped an eight megapixel
camera on that thing you know even if
they would have given me the HTC One X
camera on that thing I wouldn't have
cared if they would have given me that
camera for me that would have been my
next phone yeah seriously but but you
know you know aside from I feel that the
HTC first you know HTC has got their
market very well defined they know that
HTC home is for teenagers that you know
adults we have already moved on and we
know that there's something beyond
facebook there's also Twitter no there's
not google plus there's also two enough
really yeah which is just funny you saw
this this uh just a little commercial
you saw that google is giving away like
21 Nexus devices on a giveaway for the
next two weeks yeah and okay the
requisites for you to participate in
that is for you to follow google play on
twitter not google+ really twitter yeah
well that's good to know that they've
got some you know realistic thinkers in
the marketing department there exactly
exactly but you know going back that's
how much they care about google+ but the
point being is i think that the phone
has a future it would it would have been
great if they would have made like a
line like a high-end HTC first uh for
the you know for the adults that are
learning about facebook like my dad
right yeah and then a low-end market for
the teenagers and they didn't do that
that's the sad part but obviously you
get the op
gonna be in being able to install it on
your Galaxy s3 or galaxy note 2 yeah I
don't know I'm glad what are you what
are your impressions you like the phone
I've had to make a serious effort to
formulate some impressions because i'm
just so completely disinterested and not
engaged personally I understand how it
is a very important device for facebook
it's a very it's even a very important
device for HTC I'm having a difficult
time envisioning what consumers are
going to go for this device and I think
I talked about this a little bit on the
live last week where it's like you know
if you can install facebook home on
another device I don't understand what
would push you to get the HTC first I
don't like the design I I differ from
you I think the design is I think the
design looks like an original iphone
from 2007 painted with soft touch and
you know with like giving a button
interesting perspective I don't know ok
so here's the deal you make a solid
point and I remember we were at the
round table before your pocket now live
and we were talking with Brandon and he
was like uh no he was like you know the
the iphone is no longer the phone that
everybody wants you know they don't want
the phone that dad has they want their
own phone and they're going into Android
so that the phone makes sense and I was
like not really um you know I gave my
son the option you know I was like okay
uh what android phone do you want or
because i had bought a 1x you know it
was four months old i had barely used it
sounds like i have my first iphone 4
there in the box that i'm not using and
i have the 1x which phone do you want my
son is 12 years old he said the iphone
hmm and so you know but I had another
iphone 4 there and then my my wife's
older son was like you know hey so I got
a 1x I got an iphone he's 18 years old
what phone do you want he's like I want
the iphone um I don't know why because
we had iphone so it I don't feel that
that teenagers want to break away
necessarily from the high end stuff that
they feel that their parents have yet I
don't think we're there yet but again
you I feel that we're matching in
perspectives that there is really no
market for this phone true you know
obviously it is for teenagers the
question is what a teenager prefer this
over a galaxy s3 that will most probably
drop in price in the next month
right yeah that's always the question
right that's the eternal question that
arises anytime we just got some
mid-range devices where it's like uh-oh
does this I just got distracted by tweet
I'm sorry there's like I want to spend
my fifty dollars on mid-range device
that's brand new or a device that last
year at this time was a flagship that's
definitely gonna last for long because
it's built with premium stuff you know I
don't know I don't know for a hundred
dollar difference between a flagship in
a mid-tier device I would earn the extra
hundred bucks and I would just go for
the high for the flagship even if I was
teenager yeah and that's a predictable
answer from from all of us right because
we like flashy new cool stuff but let's
talk about this awesome awesome
development in the Play Store I read
this news and I was initially not going
to include it in the rundown within it
it got me so excited that I just wanted
to talk about it very briefly there have
been a record number of apps apparently
pulled from the google play store yeah
and we're talking about a quality
assurance move on google's part the
breakdown is not exact we don't know
from this report exactly how many we
have google to thank for and how many
were actually developers you're pulling
their own apps but we're looking at
something like 60,000 apps we have fed
from the play store from februari to
this day and it's you know I just I
don't know if I was I don't know well I
don't know if I prefer that approach or
Apple's approach where you just don't
get the app at all ok so here this is
that's a very timely thing because this
morning I was looking at a post on io9
talking about I believe it's a comic
book series I cannot remember it I
tweeted it earlier but I'm not gonna
look at the link now it's a comic book
series that are a graphic novel series
are possibly just a fiction series that
I'm not familiar with I sound very
undereducated at the moment but its 12th
installation the the cover art includes
a depiction of two men kissing or
something like that and Apple has
decided somebody within Apple apparently
has decided that that is graphic content
and so that issue is not going to be
covered in the in the in the app store
now it is only a matter of time until
the decision is reversed but because
it's their PR that they're going to get
is just ridiculously bad but you know I
that leads me to say I
don't prefer apples apples model because
you get situations like that whereas in
the google play store you know yay
pulling you something after the fact is
roughly analogous but I don't know I I
feel like I still prefer Google's
approach guy I feel like apple's app
store is a little too draconian for me
still oh true okay let's let's just say
that we're happy that Google at least
did it I'm very happy that's why I was
elated to see this because how many
times have you looked in the Play Store
or other app stores and just seen like
just page after page after page of
crappy ebooks masquerading as apps
crappy ring tone generator stupid
soundboards fart apps you know you're my
face no wait a second you're talking
about Windows Phone there well I said
smaller L in the blackberry from
blackberry app world to the Windows
Store the bastards other I'm serious you
try to in the past you try to look for
Spotify or Pandora or any of the big
things and there were all these like
alternate like there were not even
alternatives I don't know what they were
they were like launchers into the net to
the browser or whatever in Windows would
and I'm like man windows funky please
write this down um that's like a really
good idea but anyways anyways black
black black berries them the big
offender nowadays yeah let's just be
happy that it happened but hey you know
one thing we we actually didn't discuss
facebook home you didn't give me your
opinion on what you think about facebook
home we just talked about the phone by
the way right so I don't would you use
it we use it everybody knows what it is
so would you use it I don't I guess what
are you I would use it to try it out I
would never use it as my I don't you I
am the opposite of the target customer
for that I have a Facebook account I
enjoy my facebook account but i do not
want it to be the center of my mobile
experience at all because i have
something on the order of 700 friends
and you know i'm not saying that to be
like well look at me I'm popular but
like every single interaction there are
some of the interactions that I don't
want to be bothered with that all the
time I don't want that on my home screen
every time I look at my phone yeah I'm
probably the most compelling thing to me
about the facebook phone as chat heads
but like it's like I say I'm not the
target user I try and think about users
like my my mother for whom facebook is
in fact most of what she does on the
internet in terms of interacting with
relatives friends sharing news you know
everything you know i mean i think that
the facebook phone would be compelling
for my mother if she did not already
have the iphone 5 which she adores so
interest goes back to your point well
interesting but i don't know if you did
know this listeners but the APK was
leaked by modaco recently and we were we
were actually just getting ready we're
rushing to film a video about it you
know just to give everybody a a hands-on
of the APK working that the ones i was
working on yeah joe uh Joe actually got
it to work and Taylor got it to work as
well um and you know I just find it
interesting the Taylor's response was
like man this is so beautiful really and
I'm like really and he's like yeah
because we had just gotten off the air
from the from the from our roundtable
and you know he was saying I don't want
to use Facebook home i barely use
facebook at all i'm a Google+ user so
rarely well if you alone Taylor might be
he was like men the cy is like very very
nice it's very intuitive it is like very
smart made and I'm like okay uh right
okay okay let's let's let's wait for it
to happen again I'm gonna be like you
Michael I'm gonna give it a try um and
again I am sadly not very tolerable when
it comes to you know things that I'm not
gonna be we're waiting for version two
so it's gonna get one try I feel like if
I'm Tony right now talking it's gonna
get one try and then if it doesn't work
for me but I was just uninstalled it I
love you know it's true ya know you know
exactly right and i think that i will be
surprised by two it's important to
remember how much of our experience if
we let it can be governed by
expectations i have so often been
surprised in this industry and IA it's
because i have preconceptions i have
prejudices for or against a product
get it in my hands and it surprises me
and that's what I think some in some
ways we have to be careful about because
it'll color your perception if something
surprises if you're not expecting the
world from something and then it
actually delivers a good experience
there's a really very real danger of
reviewing it to positively yeah and the
opposite is also true but we try and
keep a leash on that but let's talk I'm
done with I don't wanna talk about the
facebook phone anymore you're done with
it because I'm done with that yeah good
my my bubble has burst on the facebook
phone for the day and that is a very
clumsy segue into this cool story from
Stephen shank and editorial that was
posted just today this morning entitled
the tablet bubble may have burst and
this is fascinating to me and Stephens
basic point is like but it is like hey
look there was a big tablet explosion
and even so we're in a world where
tablets are not terribly popular outside
of the ipad consumer tab yeah and i love
the point he makes it's a very simple
point but it's something i've also been
thinking about recently and that is
because about a year ago at this time i
had just been hired by pocket now or
about a year in a couple months yeah and
i was hired by i don't think this is a
secret really i was hired in order to
write about tablets yeah and that is
because there was going to be a point at
which the part of pocket now was going
to focus exclusively on tablets and a
blur was gonna focus on phones and yeah
if that were still the plan i don't i
don't know that the tablet division of
pocket now would have had enough to
write about mmm you know it's kind of
interesting we're i recently filmed the
top 5 smartphones and then when we were
trying to think about you know what are
the top five tablets for the next video
we're like how many tablets are that are
actually that are considerable for for
this video you know that's like it's
it's the ipad and everything else and
now the surface pro yeah but you the
some people still debate if it's a
tablet or not um you know I feel I'm
classifiable yeah i feel i feel that
Stephen made a solid point like like
okay if you would give me a hundred
percent of your time you know
in a number how much do you spend on on
a tablet regardless even if it's an ipad
nexus 7 whatever tablet it is how much
time do you Michael Fisher spend on a
tablet a hundred percent of my usage is
that the hundred percent okay so you
know in a hundred percent of your day
how much percentage goes to a tablet Oh
probably 15 to 20 if we're talking about
day if we're talking about usage of like
mobile devices higher percentage so
obviously i'm talking about tablets and
okay the point being is if i would have
if you would have asked me this question
a year ago since the hype was the ipad 2
years ago sorry uh-oh fifty percent uh
you asked me now and i barely use it
five percent of my day what I forget
about the tablet no way what do you
write do you read in bed uh I don't read
in bed you don't read in bed you know
and finally like I had my emails before
I even get out of bed in the morning i
use a tablet i have a kindle well that's
a tablet sort of oh it's a reader to
reader it's any of you know it so i read
my email on my phone you know read the
experience of reading email is not
necessarily better on a tablet than on a
phone you know other things are better
like navigating the weber things like
that but not necessarily reading email
which is what i do most of the time in
the morning okay I'll buy that yeah so
so I feel I feel the tablets are
something that's nice to have and people
are quickly realizing like for example I
you know I my wife has an ipad and she
ended up giving it to her older son
because she was like you know it's
something nice I love it it's cool to
have around when we travel somewhere and
I don't want to carry she got back but
but I don't really use it other than you
know on the on a trip or something so so
Stephen makes the same point he says it
despite what some people might tell you
a tablet is not a replacement for laptop
it's and I got for a piece of
electronics to add to our repositories
yeah absolutely i but but then there's
there's an interesting counterpoint in
the comments which we don't often think
about who's there's a commenter who says
basically like yeah not for you guys but
for someone who who primarily uses a
laptop for browsing email and that's
about it a tablet is a really solid
choice for a computer replacement so
there is a subsection of people out
there who do that okay you did again
my mother's getting a lot of
representation this bike has my mother
day okay so the the I don't know which
which reader wrote that comment he has a
very solid point but then i'll give you
this much the problem is that even
though tablets are getting cheaper the
better tablets the ones that are still
leading the market are not cheap so if
you come to a point if you're a college
student and you come to a point where
you need to choose between an ipad which
is not going to let you do everything or
a computer that's gonna cost you
sometimes even less than an ipad you
know some people are compelled to end up
buying the computer the problem is not
that there isn't a market for them no
the problem is that the market has you
know the taste and the need for
computing has evolved so much that the
tablet is a little late actually because
because people's needs are more complex
we don't even use printers anymore well
do you even have a printer now a lot of
things have changed over the years and
so tablets are a great product to have
yes there is a demographic that benefits
from it yes there is a market obviously
that's why they sell but you know I'm
I'm a fourth-generation iPad users
saying that I have a nexus 7 in my
drawer that I never use anymore and that
I have an ipad mini that I always keep
in my backpack but I rarely remember to
pull it out why because there is just a
point where since I know that the tablet
is not gonna do everything that I
sometimes will need then I just don't
bother and I just pull out the laptop I
get that completely because I have
carried around my macbook air two places
and eat you know because I have
developed a cool workflow on it because
i use it for most of my day sometimes
pulling out the ipad 3 here or the nexus
7 it's just more hassle than it's worth
i already have the computer here it's
nice and light it's portable i can use
it and i can type faster on it still so
yeah I think there are different use
cases for this I think it all comes back
down to the point that we so the user or
you were already it all does depend on
user and yeah for users like us it's a
tablet is not a laptop replacement but i
think i still i don't know i think the
real question for me the real
interesting part for me was that it's a
year later a year ago at this time i was
writing editorials like will android
tablets ever be compelling and today we
could still if we weren't in such danger
of
yourselves in the headlines we could
still write pieces titled that we
probably still do and I just don't see
him um no that's not true i know we
still do and I do see them but I don't
write them anymore because I have
nothing new to say yeah fortunately we
have enough people on the team now where
other team members have something have a
new perspective on I have no new
perspective on it because really these
things even that the the Sony Xperia
Tablet Zelda bear that was a very nice
now it's so absolutely gorgeous and
Steven references in the piece but like
what's what what what is driving the
conversation it's the google play store
it's the content offerings it's the
ecosystem which android is still trying
to get a get a grip on so i don't know
you know it's funny because i think that
that tablet z is like the perfect
example you get a waterproof talent
that's been extremely thin that it's
extremely beautiful and still people
don't buy it well yeah and edit but is
priced dad pretty high too right well i
mean it trust me yeah somebody was
asking me why do you want a waterproof
phone and I'm like why not I not exactly
why aren't phones waterproof already at
this day and age of watches have been
waterproofed for the past 30 years
agreed three uh anyway yeah well before
we get too proud there what I would so
want to stick with tablets but I want to
move into iOS a little bit because we
are talking about this purported next
generation iPad bezel showing up oh
that's gonna happen that's the next
generation iPad is gonna be an ipad mini
bigger that's just the way it's gonna be
yeah because that's the way the
industrials is that they're gonna retain
the industrial design of the iphone 5
the ipad mini yeah you know it's kind of
interesting because the ipad mini does
have sham furred edges as the iphone 5
and has the HTC One but you know I think
that they use a denser aluminum for the
ipad mini because mine is in pristine
condition do you drop it often well i
haven't dropped my iphone either and
it's got dents oh it could be there
might be some material differences there
i'm not sure i'm not what's the news on
this one the news on this one is that
the bezel appears much thinner on the
lot well you know that apple apple and
that you know they develop the
technology on the ipad mini that also
works on the iphone
five and you know everything that's I OS
six based you can actually hold a tablet
and put your finger on it it'll detect
that you're not using it for anything
just holding and it will not scroll or
do anything so you know I think that
that was just the move that was coming
they need to make the ipad thinner
lighter and smaller but keep the same
green size yeah I mean for me getting
the ipad mini wasn't a matter that I was
dissatisfied with the bigger iPad it was
just that it was a bigger iPad and I
just you know if I have to be carrying a
tablet and a laptop I would rather carry
a small tablet anything you know the
laptop so so so I feel that you know the
ipad the ipad 5 has to do that I mean
the iPads design is already dated yeah
it is and so so this is what Apple has
been getting beat over the head with for
like a year at this point right the ipad
3 the ipad 4 they're both too heavy yeah
and i think that they are probably that
is going to be one of their biggest
surprises for us or maybe surprises and
air quotes but it's going to be one of
their biggest reveals at the next iPad
announcement is the weight and I really
think it's going to be a very light next
generation ipad now it's gonna be
difficult to do considering the battery
has to be massive right to to deal with
the pixel density of the display and the
backlight has to be bright and all that
kind of stuff but i think what going to
find a way to do it well they actually
the the cell on the ipad mini is a
different type of cell that they pretty
much invented it's a single cell battery
that's extremely thin so they'll bring
this technology and just make it bitter
and most probably bigger sorry and most
probably what they'll do is just shrink
the internals for the battery to be
bigger and just take over where the
processor is right now for example I
don't know I just I feel that you know
in the case of the ipad the design it's
it's just funny do you remember when the
first generation ipad was launched
people don't really remember how thin
computers were back then if you don't
you actually that was the wrong way to
refer to slot how thin it was how thick
how things yeah yeah yeahs and tablet
PCs were back then i mean they were
humongous i mean i remember when the
first tablet pc was launched the HP
Slate it's not it was under a or
whatever there was 1000 it was the HPT
it sounded like the terminator but but
it was a slate tablet it was
a beautiful product that had this like
click on keyboard it was really nice but
it had all the fans and everything
within the tablet and so so you know you
know there were two things that made the
iPad the WoW product when it was
launched number one is how thin it was
back then and number two ironically how
cheap it was back then because the
tablet pc cost two thousand dollars back
then write fifty hundred bucks and then
you give people a tablet and you charge
in five hundred bucks so now we're in an
era where you have a nexus 7 that brings
down the price to 200 bucks you have a
nexus 10 which is also cheap rings
high-resolution everything you know
Apple really needs to figure out how to
differentiate this iPad further or else
android tablets are gonna be gum you
know much more important as time goes on
you know just because of the price I
think in a software from a software
perspective we're gonna see them do that
with iOS with the next version of iOS
and I really think that because there is
so much riding on it and because they
know that Apple is going to bring some
serious heat in software and I've
continued to be excited for it yeah that
is gonna pop up in kind of strange ways
that at least I i know i don't expect
and that is this other story that also
came from you on april fifth that
there's a there's a patent that has
revealed that iOS maps is gonna get
street view yeah well just the question
is were they gonna get street view from
i was just gonna say how is that going
to work i mean that doesn't have a fleet
of cars with cameras okay for the record
listeners of Apple has patented like a
million things that they haven't
developed yet yeah right this so so you
know a first question to you like is
there any hard evidence is actually
happening there no well they've patent
so many things you know they're just
opening the patent for people to pay
them if they come out with the idea
first you know they figure out to
implement it you know it's just the way
it is but I don't see if the pet yeah
you know or they'll probably license it
from google most probably i don't know i
I just don't find the point for iOS maps
anymore when you have google maps on the
iphone just seriously yeah and I wonder
I would like to see the adoption specs
on that yeah you know and just you know
following on what you said about iOS 7
and what to expect you know before we
move on up just a point Apple is
actually moving
a ton of their engineers from the OS
10.9 project to work on iOS 7 yeah
because they are this weekend yeah yeah
because they are far behind that was the
news last weekend and you know it just
proves there must be something really
significant coming yeah and when was the
last major high-profile move of desktop
and employees to mobile and I wonder
when the first generation our generation
iphone rizzoli exactly so i mean i think
we're looking at something pretty
substantial there which will ultimately
be this is maybe an obvious statement
but which is going to shape the future
of Apple not just in terms of mobile but
in the desktop products as well because
we know that the future is not on the
desktop really now no it's not and it's
just to prove but you know speaking of
the what's happening right now with the
overhaul of iOS 7 you know we we had
this piece today of you know what this
update on the Google Play Store tells us
of Android you know just moving a little
back into Android I don't know how have
you gotten the update to the google play
store on you know I know I've been too
busy I am well well just just remember
listeners you go back to the link the
APK is there in case you want to
download it it's very clean Michael it
looks good it looks cool and it's it's
as whitish as white at times when
Android has always been about dark areas
everywhere like the settings menu and
everything has been just dark um I don't
know I noticed that on on Taylor's note
8.0 review where everything TouchWiz was
whitish and not darkish as it was in the
past on this eight-point oh so it does
seem like if Google is moving into using
different Matt's different designs more
and more simplistic and I really if it
could have been any more simplistic so
key lime pie is actually gonna be very
interesting well spot will most probably
see it you know in May and then we'll
get iOS 7 in june with WWDC so this is
gonna be a really interesting summer
yeah he said it is you have to remind me
you've reminded me have to put WWDC and
in my calendar because i don't have it
there yet and i forgot that there are
major events happening and in May
and june because i was thinking about
the summer recently i have there is
breaking news from my from my personal
life sphere right now i just got it on
my pebble my father has sent me an email
that says hi Mike sprint has don't call
me Mike by the way only my family can do
that sprint has terminated my service
the internet will have to do the reason
what the RIA the reason I got that email
is because my father is one of the last
few handful of hundreds of thousands of
people on the on sprint's identity work
the legacy nextel network which is
steadily being shut down site by site
and I guess they finally got to my
hometown by the way I'm still bothering
sprint to try and go on a ride-along so
I can see one of these idents aight
dismantle months I hope they allow me to
do that they have been they have been
getting back to me on their own schedule
so hopefully I'm able to see one of
these and report on it listeners I hope
you get to see my video on that at some
point but in the meantime I have to get
my father a new phone that is not based
on iTunes technology off geez poor
little out for next tale that won't be
too difficult wherever will I find a non
ident own let's talk let's close it out
in iOS the curved screen for the next
iPhone you think it's gonna happen uh
why not I would love that why not I be
lady that's one thing that I liked about
the dell venue pro I just you know Apple
Apple is about prototyping so most
probably what was leaked as a prototype
because it did look real it didn't look
photoshopped I didn't realize this was
an image this is crazy this from
gsmarena yeah yeah and so it doesn't
look Photoshop but you know the reason
why I think that it's probably fake is
because usually when Apple builds these
you know prototypes what they do is that
all the numbers at the back below the
iphone text are all access and these
were actually numbers like real numbers
so I you know it could be photoshop I
think it's fake yeah it looks like a 3d
model it looks like a 3d model but still
i mean the dell venue pro addict crib
display was good you know we've seen so
many obvious ly and roy you know the
Nexus S on the next and the Galaxy Nexus
had an inverted curve I don't know it
would be awesome let's just see it looks
like did you just talk about the iPod
the iPod Nano
uh no no yeah no I'm sorry i was i was
wrapped up and looking at the image this
was like a pair of ipod nano from dad
that is an awesome boy yeah yeah exactly
that would be so cool yeah we'll see
we'll see i'd love to see that happen
right but what were we just talking
about apple's industrial design language
and we were talking about them bringing
that all in line with the next ipad
which is going to look like the ipad
mini probably but what then they're
gonna go a different direction with the
iphone hardware that doesn't make much
sense well I'll tell you something I
mean a if you would ask me if I prefer
the iphone 3gs with the curve backer the
iphone 5 I prefer the 3gs well because
it's friendlier to the palm exactly so
for me I I think that it would be a
smart move even if they wouldn't curb
the display they would curve the back
would be awesome I'm gonna say this i
don't think the image i'm looking at on
this story which listeners if you want
to see we're talking about it's in the
link on the post it's from April fourth
if I love this image i would buy this
phone almost regardless of what OS it
ran because i really like this hardware
I think that's so not Apple I don't
think there's any likelihood that this
is legit I think this is a fanboy
concept well so so did we say about the
iphone 5 i don't know if i said that
about the oven but i said that i look at
the iphone 5 weeks and I was like this
is not as his BS yeah let's all write
that or not we'll save let's jump in a
listener mail though because we do want
to go at some point here soon and we
have a couple of compelling pieces of
listener mail and now we have actually
one more since I mentioned that
stainless steel bit off to jump into the
mailbox to read that because it's not on
the run down the first piece of listener
mail is a piece of meta pocketnow
discussion from Carlos Monroe and I hope
I'm pronouncing that right Carlos
pocketnow asked on Facebook who the
sexiest member of the team is all right
so listen I I know was that I don't know
i was at what it was not me it wasn't me
either ok so let's that's not spit we
know who it was i say i don't know who
was but i don't wanna so listen uh I
don't run the facebook page I had to
find out about this cuz I think Brandon
sent me an email with a screenshot or
something I was like
no have you seen how many fans yeah I
didn't I'd i looked at the comment
thread for like 13 seconds and then I
was like I'm die can't I can't be in
this um but that's not what Carlos is
asking about to his credit he's saying
many people were declaring sassy Bob as
the sexiest member oh yeah I don't mind
naming a female sex sexiest for
politically correct reasons but is sassy
Bob that girl this is still Carlos
speaking from the opening sound bite
that no one who came in after November
2012 can really specify is she really
sexy enough to be sexier than team
members so yeah that there's a story
behind okay so there is a story behind
that and and this is the reason I
selected this piece of listener male
Thank You Carlos for the letter by the
way is because that's a question that
always used to pop up on our older
PocketNow videos intro we had that you
know that electric guitar janod chicka
chicka dancer there and you know
rotating tiles containing excerpts from
previous videos and one of them was
sassy Bob who I guess did a couple of
videos for us before I came on board he
sazkebab did a couple of his daring yeah
well she did a couple of very good
videos for us so uh the way the way this
work was we actually we contacted sassy
Bob top her job because um we needed a
female person on the on video we wanted
it would be nice you know listeners
you've seen you've seen the commercials
that we so a lot of people are asking us
like when is the next after the buzzer
what are you gonna do it after the buzz
on the nexus 4 so it was more than a
year ago that we came up with the idea
of these commercials and we thought you
know since it's it's kind of difficult
for us to be able to schedule a lot of
things you know with honest specific
like oh it's gonna happen every Thursday
it's we want to get there but it was
still not there yet because of the
amount of content that there is and
because of the way NewsWorks you can't
equals x do that ya know you can't
always do that not in technology not yes
no and not even you know not even the
big outlets tough enough to keep the
podcast on the same day every week
exactly exactly and so so once we had
that idea you know we were Brandon it's
like it would be awesome if we hired a
girl and and he was like men there's
this girl from from the I've seen on on
on YouTube you know her
sassy when she does app reviews and
she'd be awesome I like okay contact her
and so we actually contacted her and she
did you know she did an HT beat the
review of the HTC rhyme for us and bit
which was viewed the rhyme that HTC the
yeah yeah I'm about tentacle yeah the
girlish phone you know the purple that
was a quote girlish phone yeah so she
was there on time and she and she did an
awesome video cuz she went on the road
asking around to people you should watch
this video I know what asking asking
people it's like do you like this film
would you buy this phone just because
it's you know purplish or pinkish or
whatever and she asked le she went to
salons beauty salons and she's a very
very creative girl on video yeah it's
just too bad that you know at the time
that we hired her we actually did a
tryout for the commercials that
everything was working well but you know
she actually got a different proposal
immediately and and she was like you
know I I I really wouldn't want to pick
but you know this is actually like the
thing that I've been dreaming for sounds
you know I it was great it was awesome
working with her we the sadly we just
couldn't continue yeah she is actually
she has quite a quite a large following
if you are wondering who says he bob is
its SAS SI b OB she's on Twitter as that
I think she's definitely in YouTube as
that and she she continues to generate a
lot of video so oh yeah she's really
really really good sorry town I'm sorry
that I came aboard after after she had
departed it would have been nice to meet
her but she she was it's so funny that
she was like such a huge part of the of
the pocket now branding considering that
she only did about two videos for it but
she was on every single intro of every
video we did for what more than a year
so more than me yeah so hopefully that
clears it up thank you I'm it for the
behind the scenes intel on that from
from the days before i was around yeah
and sadly now people have to see me
doing the commercials oh well oh well oh
well you do you do great commercials
yeah you're you're nice like that right
well i am recording next to my Star Trek
intercom panel and my my cell site
notice sign I mean that you know you've
got the studio for that I mean you know
I'm
the booth lets the last piece listener
mail or second last pieces from Kenneth
Meadows the second I included this
specifically for you hi maybe because I
have no idea what to say to this I have
a friend who is computer illiterate she
has a 16 gig ipad wants access to all of
her pictures she took with her digital
cameras and the iPad she used the SD
card to ipad converter plug in and
copied over pictures from her digital
cameras now the device is full she does
not want to use cloud storage because
doing that would mean paying annually
and without Wi-Fi she would have no
access to her photos I'm completely
stumped on what to do hope you guys can
give some suggestions uh I'm looking so
listen I mean you're the expert but let
me just weigh in right before you go
here it sucks that she is a 16 gig ipad
I never recommend devices with low
onboard storage for exactly this reason
because you will eventually will one day
regret it and I understand the objection
to paying annually for cloud storage but
in the same breath I I don't it is a
very worthwhile thing to invest in and
if you're gonna spend money on something
cloud storage is pretty damn valuable so
that's my opinion so okay so here's the
deal and in the case of the iPad you
have two options actually so she bought
the kit and that would import photos by
the fault you can't really just view the
photos from the car which is something
unfortunate on iOS I believe I'm not
really sure because I haven't bought
that adapter because they haven't
brought it out while they have brought
it out for the ipad mini I just I don't
care about it and the reason why I don't
care about it is because I actually
rarely ever see photos even if I can I
carry a batch of photos and that's it so
what I did is it depends of you if she
has windows on her personal computer or
or Mac but it regardless itunes allows
you when you sync with iTunes you can
tell itunes to reduce the size of the
photos and that's something you should
really do because digital photos i mean
if you have an 8 megapixel camera even
on a phone or even from the tablet
photos are much bigger than what the
tablet is actually able to display so
it's really it's really pointless for
you to carry photos on their full size
so my advice to you is remove the photos
from the ipad and then just pull
into your computer and then import the
photos from the computer into the tablet
using iTunes and just tell itunes to
reduce the file size of the photos that
is a suggestion that see this is why I'm
glad you're on the air because I would
not have realized that and I hope yeah
thank you thank you ok that is option
number one option number two get dropbox
and just throw the photos into dropbox
and you can actually select folders from
dropbox to remain permanent on the
device and you can also tell the device
what is the file size or if you want the
vice you know if you want the the
dropbox to reduce the file size for
optimization or not and so you could
just download that specific folder and
tell it that you don't want it in full
size for the photos and that way you can
use cloud storage so you can actually
access these photos from everywhere but
also though they'll remain local on the
ipad as long as you specify it that's an
even better suggestion that's yeah
awesome i love it and drop out of
courses that's actually what I that's
actually what I do really yeah yeah you
guys everyone in the team is a big fan
of Dropbox I seldom use it but I should
yeah so there it is hopefully that one
of those suggestions will work out for
you for your friend Kenneth Jaime thank
you for the informed advice like I was
saying I wouldn't been able to provide
that first suggestion I probably would
have eventually got around to thinking
about Dropbox but yeah I have a final
question from our old friend I cannot
pronounce douchey nth I mean I know it
can't be it can't be pronounced the way
i'm pronouncing it so I'm sorry but
don't pronounce my name right so right
now because I haven't been to the are
rolling class here happy at Joe Levi's
become an expert yeah with the addition
asks while everyone's going on about
plastic polycarbonate aluminum has build
materials for phones why doesn't anyone
think about stainless steel yes that's
right good old stainless steel Apple did
what in the band on the white iphone 4
is that what it is I foreign for us yes
right cheap readily available and
scratch proof to a large extent what do
you guys think about that scratch proof
to a large extent no well more so than
aluminum right no actually a stainless
steel is amorous
watch brown than aluminum just try it
off look at your watch look at your
watch count your it's not bizarre softer
than aluminum right you know you're
using a pebble sorry but if you have you
used the regular stainless steel watch
you'll notice I've got a watch band on
my pebble that cost a good amount of
money it's not you know it's not plastic
anymore no no I know that you replaced
that the point being is the thing is
your your bracelet is Matt it's it's
it's black color it's DVD yeah it's
tinted but the thing about stainless
steel well stainless steel has a couple
of problems the first one being it has a
couple of problems in a couple of
benefits the first benefit of the first
problem of stainless steel is it you
know it's actually more resilient than
aluminum for a dent but you know I
scratched the bands on the four and for
us a lot more that I that I could you
know scratch anodized aluminum hmm so I
don't aesthetically yes somebody's
already thought about it Apple did and I
think they moved away from it after
antennagate so that's actually a problem
second actually stainless steel is not
as light as aluminum yeah i'm looking i
just googled stainless steel phone and
it would be would there no kiddo there's
the LG shine was out a while ago as a
dumbphone years and years ago and that's
coming up on this is like having a
stainless steel finish but I don't think
that's true I think the thing was
plastic wasn't yeah and now there are
some benefits from Taylor it might not
be right go ahead good well there is one
benefit from stainless steel um this is
actually something I was gonna film a
video on this and I just I haven't had
the time but the cool thing about the
iphone 4 and 4s is if you scratch it
dented or whatever happens to the same
let's see i'm actually gonna give you a
tip just go into a supermarket and buy a
soap scrub for washing dishes you know
that green with the brillo yeah yeah
okay so you buy that and then you just
scrub the stainless steel with this with
this uh whatever thing and it'll
actually polish the dense and remove
them because you're actually this this
material is made out of stainless steel
particles as well so you're scratching
metal with metal don't do this all the
time you can only do it like once but
you remove all
scratches and dents from the band with
that thing in about five minutes yeah I
it's always difficult when you have to
do you advocate like self repair for
things like scratches especially in
displays like a lot of people do the
toothpaste stuff oh yeah and man if
you're not careful if you don't use the
right grit and stuff you'll end up with
a really cloudy finish on whatever
you're trying to polish so watch out for
they'd be careful there have been some
stainless steel nokia phones it looks
like the nokia 8800 might have been a
stainless holiness yeah that was a
beautiful phone yeah really was the man
nokia says made some house i was
thinking about that phone a couple of
days ago i was remembering their
advertisement campaign it was really
good yeah it'll days so yes stainless
steel is out there the problem is it's
not lighter than aluminum to my
knowledge and none of us are chemist
here by the way despite my recent foray
into the sapphire world so okay so but
you know it's just clear you hold the
iphone 5 and then you hold the 4s which
is only partly made by stainless steel
and you can feel the weight difference
it's insane like stage yeah so yeah so
that's that it's a solid question thank
you for for bringing it up we were not
going to be able to fit it in but it
looks like we came in a little bit under
our usual over time at least but i think
it is it is about time we cruise out of
here so how might we have closing
thoughts from Honduras actually I'm
gonna ask you a question uh what okay
after all the phones you've tested
reviewed and everything what would you
agree to be your favorite material for a
smart like what forget about what people
consider build quality what had what
have you felt has worked best for you I
have never fallen out of love with the
polycarbonate used on the One X phone
last year and the one XL that delivered
to me a better experience tactile in a
tactile sense than the Lumia 900 did
which used polycarbonate as well of
course but it just felt different on the
one that it was shiny on the under Lumia
920 well on some finishes of it
including the 1i have yes which is
annoying but so yeah the 1x really
really that polycarbonate was my
favorite and continues to be my favorite
finish
on a phone what or material that if M is
used for what about you in my case I
would have to agree as long as you
choose a light color for that
polycarbonate being white because the
problem is it's a real smudge magnet in
dark colors but for the record listeners
i mean i've been using i use the first
generation iphone you did too uh
aluminum is a great material but it's
not gonna look good after two months of
usage actually i didn't i didn't use the
original if i use the iphone 3g i never
sorry sorry Brandon bit yeah Brandon did
but you know the point being is yes I
mean we're seeing this resurgence of
aluminium on on phones and it's really
cool it's awesome it is I just I just
wish you would see how much I take care
of my I was actually gonna use a bad
word right now how much I take care of
my beloved iphone 5 and how bad it looks
already after no falls so you know even
if it's the resurgence I feel that at
this moment probably aluminum will get
better years from now but i feel that
polycarbonate is still the material that
all last longer for you to your contract
uh so motorola v60 what was that made
out of ooh that's a good member just
like that was the big like it was like a
metal phone and that was the the piece
of novelty that they were selling i'm ok
part of that motorola branding was like
mini metal moto but that's that's a good
question i don't know what metal it was
that was my favorite phone of all time
it looks like a quick Google searches
saying anodized aluminum well
interesting well that's interesting
because they use the sort of aluminum
finish that was actually brushed and not
analyzed yeah well you know but they
were also about what a hundred and fifty
versions of the v60 so who knows like
that some of them were polished some of
them were not yeah I actually have the
v60 I where you can remove the covers
remember that oh yeah yeah you could put
on the yang could put on like a cheap
plastic like a red cover if you wanted
to yeah yeah and then some of them had
extendable antennas some of them had
stub antennas god oh yeah you know
you're making a good point we've had
cases with the VV 60 and the v3 the the
razors the original RAZR where metal has
actually worked okay like fine you know
good point good points there sadly for
this year's line of smartphones
I was actually gonna write an editorial
I'll probably probably will wear its
title chamfered edges don't work that's
gonna get about 150 comments in 20
Shaffer edges don't work but they're so
gorgeous but you know this I say this
before before I forget man you were
right I baby the hell out of my HTC One
I'm so worried about it that I that I
don't put it in pockets with zippers
that could scratch the casing like I you
know yeah if this were something i
bought an intended to use for two years
i think i would be too too scared to
even bring it out in public and that's
saying something that is your girlfriend
was be jealous man ah well she would
feel the same way he's cuz she's a phone
nerd too anyway yeah it would be great
if it if it really endured and after the
first time I dropped mine I'm sure it'll
happen you know we'll see how it goes
actually I shouldn't say mine after the
first time I drop a review unit because
I still don't have a personal one yet
but i probably will end up buying one
because i really like it that much but
we gotta jet so I it was awesome to have
