last month you could say Motorola is
owned quite the role and the latest
Verizon Droid just arrived on our
doorstep in case you didn't recognize me
without the Hat I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow
and this is our unboxing of the Motorola
Droid ultra so in the last month alone
Motorola has announced four new phones
and four of those four are available on
Verizon the droid mini the Droid ultra
the Droid Maxx and the Moto X and we're
kind of asking why all four need to
exist on one carrier but that doesn't
really matter we have the I guess staple
of those four devices right here in
front of us the Droid ultra and this
will be available I know it is available
now as of August 20th on Verizon for
$200 with a contract or about $25 a
month with the edge plan so we are
getting into the packaging that is all
in our bubble wrap or bubble wrap and as
you can see here this is your typical
Droid branding boxing and everything
it's it's what we've seen a million
times from Motorola and Verizon your
droid with your droid
so without further ado let's get in the
box and we'll talk about specs and
everything in just a second see what's
inside so very easy to open this is the
phone sat that aside of course some
ingress I guess paraphernalia
advertising saying that you should play
ingress which is a MMO for Android users
it's pretty cool I've played it a little
bit but uh not really my thing inside we
get more paperwork get to know your
phone global support information
important consumer information product
and safety and warranty information a
lot of reading material that's your sort
of thing they also have your standard
microUSB cable we have an AC power
adapter and more cardboard pasteboard
and stuff so that's really all that's in
the box nothing special no headphones or
anything just your normal information
and
power supply so that's all inside the
box nothing fancy cool stuff I guess
whatever we'll set that aside this is
what we really care about the phone the
Droid ultra so like all the other droid
devices from Motorola this time around
and the Moto X this one has an
integrated battery so no removable
battery which is the same as the razor's
and all of that this one has a 2130
milliamp hour battery inside so it's
actually smaller than its smaller
sibling which is the Moto X this one has
a 2200 milliamp hour battery
this one has 2130 and its specifications
are pretty much in line with the Moto X
except for the fact that this one only
comes in 16 gigabytes its display is 5
inches versus 4.7 and the rest is pretty
much the same they both have a 10
megapixel camera they have the x8
computing system from Motorola which is
a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core Krait CPU
Adreno 320 GPU and 2 dedicated
processors 1 for motion and other
sensing and the other is for natural
language processing for your touchless
control let's get the plastic off here
it looks like the plastic that's not
gonna make a whole lot of noise will
move it over here no noise really
unfortunately we'll get the other
plastic stuff off as well one off the
camera and I believe that's about it
there's some fuzz up here but other than
that there's not a lot different here
from from actual the razer brand
earpiece your standard buttons here
which are not on-screen like the Moto X
are actually capacitive you've got task
switching home back volume rocker and
your power switch on the right side
you've got a speaker grille around the
camera which is pretty nice some some
some aluminum trim for your moto your
Motorola logo headphone jack on the top
nothing on the left edge and your micro
USB port on the bottom and as far as
hardware goes that's really all there is
to it
one thing we'll note is
I've been holding this device for about
two or three minutes now and it is
absolutely covered in fingerprints like
Samsung's devices it has a very slick
polished back on the backside it's
plastic and very slick so it's a
fingerprint magnet which is pretty
unfortunate but you can see there's a
significant size difference between the
Moto X and the Droid ultra and if we
power this thing on really quickly
hopefully it's got a charge it does
motorola a Google company so this is the
new Motorola if if you haven't realized
that yet so no razor branding just Droid
ultra and if we get it powered on here
we'll see that there is a fairly
significant difference in size in the
display and that's one reason it's it's
kind of amplified because this has
on-screen buttons but we're not here to
do a comparison this has been the
unboxing of the droid ultra stay tuned
there's gonna be a full review and some
comparisons one with the Moto X and with
other flagships there will be a lot of
coverage for a lot of different stuff
next week but this one will be what I'll
be focusing on a review and comparisons
for the droid ultra so thanks for

coverage in the next few days and weeks
