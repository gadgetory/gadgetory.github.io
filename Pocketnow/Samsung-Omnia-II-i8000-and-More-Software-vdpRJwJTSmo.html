pocketnow.com
and this is a video where we're gonna
show two capabilities of the samsung
omnia 2 that we haven't shown in the
previous two software videos I'll put
those videos up at the end of this video
so that if you haven't seen them you can
go and click on and watch them so the
first thing I want to show you is a
program called meadow me now meadow me
is available as in iPhone app and you
can also go to McDonald now what you do
is you sing or hum part of a song that
you have in your head and you're trying
to remember what is the name of that
song so I am going through hum in the
end by Linkin Park and I apologize in
advance because I am NOT a singer and
I'm perfect you in a second alright here
we go bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
bum bum bum ok so I told you I wasn't a
good singer but hopefully good enough to
wear Amadou me picked up on what I was
trying to sing there it is perfect at
the top even with my horrible voice it
picked it up and just to confirm confirm
we can tap on the speaker
and we can hear a little snippet of the
song just to confirm that yeah that's
the song that was in my head so really
cool application the second thing I want
to show you is actually a pretty slick
video editor that comes on here
a lot of devices haven't done much with
on device video editing the iPhone does
it a little bit but this really takes it
to another level which is really great
so I'm gonna tap on the center there to
select a clip and I'm going to select a
clip of the office that I have on the
device it's gonna extract it and I'm
gonna pull it forward here by tapping on
it and I'm gonna choose from a few
options down here so if I tap on this
speaker icon I can actually record my
voice over what is being played on the
video so if I play the video and I press
record hello hello I'm recording on the
video and I stop it
I click done if we go back and play the
video video from the beginning
all right so that's pretty neat we can
go back into the clip hopefully comes
forward and we can do other things like
we can draw on it or change the
background or a whole host of things
actually I don't think you would want to
produce a whole movie on here but you
can definitely do a lot of editing and
you can actually have multiple videos
and make kind of a succession of
storyboards you can cut out certain
scenes with this button and if we go
into this we get transitions so we can
fade in the black or or zoom in or have
text fly across the screen and when
you're done you can hit the after you
kind of zoom out like that you've hit
this button it will render the video you
can preview it here and then it will
save it to your device which is pretty
cool there's another feature of this
that will let you do a slideshow with
music so I am here and it's looking
through a these are the choices for
background so I'm going to do the beach
as a background for my particular
slideshow I go to the next screen and
now it wants me to choose pictures for
my slideshow I've taken some pictures
with the Omni at two earlier today just
select four you go over to the right
extracting okay and now we can go to the
right to the next step
oops it actually says select photos so I
have to actually choose these photos
again and then it wants us to choose a
sound to go in the background so I don't
really know what's on here but I'll do
classic car probably not the most
appropriate thing and here you can trim
classic car I'll just keep it as is and
then we can enter text I'm going to skip
that step and we can see it after it's
done it's kind of processing right now
so it'll take about 20 more seconds and
we can play it so we get the beach
background and there come my pictures
and there's that sound in the background
you probably want to have a more
entertaining
background and a better song than that
so just wanted to show you those two
capabilities for more on the Samsung
omnia and other windows mobile devices
