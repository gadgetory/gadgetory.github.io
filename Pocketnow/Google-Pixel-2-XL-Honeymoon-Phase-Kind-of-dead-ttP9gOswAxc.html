best and most expensive phone that
Google has to offer and if you've been
following the news also the one that's
been causing the most amount of concern
it took a while for my unit to arrive
but now that it's here it's time to see
what all the fuss is about I'm high
medal event with PocketNow and this is
the honeymoon phase with the Google
pixel to excel brought to you by D brand
so right off the bat the first thing
that I can tell you is wow I mean the
first generation pixel was ugly but I
did love how it felt in the hand the
pixel to excel has a few tricks to
retain that delicious feel and is now
far more refined than its looks the
glass and aluminum are now curved ever
so slightly around the borders the
aluminum is also textured like a thick
matte pink job on the table and in the
hand this is clearly a well-crafted
phone last year I chose the smaller
pixels since the bezels were ridiculous
this year I chose the XL variant given
the adoption of the 2 by 1 aspect ratio
I wouldn't say that the bezels have
disappeared more or less redistributed
if you look closely but that doesn't
really determine the modern first
impression that I get from it unboxing
the phone is full of the same things
that you saw on hawaiians video of the
smaller variant we have the phone up in
front a USB OTG adapter below and then a
USBC wire a USB wall adapter for fast
charging and the infamous dongle to
replace the headphone jack and no
headphones setting it up for the first
time was full of pleasant surprises
though for starters you no longer need a
SIM card for project Phi the pixel to
excel is smart enough to support isom
though I popped my project 5 sim just to
keep things simple then everything else
is as practical as can be I use the
wired restore process through the OTG
adapter and this was probably the
fastest that I've ever been able to
restore phone than in pretty much five
minutes though I skipped restoring
pictures as these live in Google photos
anyways then you set up your Google
assistant and you're taken to your home
screen
and yes the launcher is already ordered
as your previous phone with apps being
grayed out as they continue restoring
Thank You Google this has been long
overdue Google then prompts you that
there are still more things to be done
like enabling the squeeze feature to
launch the Google assistant though I
haven't really been using that much of
since now let's talk about the elephant
in the room
this display people complain about it
being dull and I am going to have to
agree this doesn't look like an OLED
panel at all
Google claims that it decided to push
more accurate colors but this red on the
chrome logo looks like a blend of orange
and red and green seem like if they were
meant even compared to last year's pixel
I mean if this is a strategy then why is
the old pixel more vivid Google did hear
the complaints and is now shipping the
phone with the vivid mode activated by
default but we'll have to wait for a
promise software update to bring an
extra vivid mode in the future do I mind
yes I'll have to admit that I do for
this price tag even the black and white
animation from standby to on makes the
impression more striking as for the
bluish hue of util the device it is here
if you nitpick and use a white image to
find it which no one really does in real
life but hey while you're at it why
don't I show you a Galaxy Note 8 under
those same circumstances yep it's here
though to a lesser degree it's sadly an
OLED problem and even if I use an iPhone
Eights IPS LCD it does shift to a darker
tone or even red in some cases so let's
not use this against Google as it's only
really noticeable if you use a white
image and not in real-world use other
complaints have to do with screen burnin
though I'll have to circle back to that
in our full review as for this first
week of use I don't really notice any of
that really the only thing that I can
praise about this display is the
always-on mode with the use of icons and
the adoption of color accents and
notifications Android 8 Auto Oreo is
powering the show and this is one of the
major positives awesome fluidity all
around and with a ton of conveniences
that are exclusive to Oreo picture and
picture continues to be my favorite for
speedy multitasking and can I say how
much I love all these Google Earth
wallpapers and best of all how the user
interface adapts to a darker or lighter
theme depending on your wallpaper
as for the daily grind the pixel to
excel battery life has proven to surpass
my expectations I've end the day's just
fine and I haven't really been
piggybacking on another phone or at
least until now that the iPhone 10
arrived another thing I really love
about this phone is the speakers they
are loud and they are deep though wants
real audio review of the pixel tool will
provide more insight and when it comes
to photography
I think generation 2 is enough for us to
say a pixel is a pixel watch wants real
camera review of the pixel - for more
insight my first impressions are that
the camera shows how versatile the right
software can make the right hardware
obviously there is more testing to be
done so I'll provide more insight in our
final review so far the Google pixel to
excel has left me with a very polarizing
first impression I love how it feels I
love how it looks from the back but I
feel that Google needs to drop its whole
failed attempt at providing accurate
colors on this display
it's a Nolet so the technology is there
for a more vivid experience
like seriously Google there is no need
to reinvent the wheel here and you know
we humans like color whether Google will
do that or not as yet to be seen and
that's what our full review will be for
in addition to more comparisons that are
coming up so stay tuned and fun fact I
really wanted to pen the Google pixel to
excel but it was out of stock so that's
when deep brand comes in deep brain
skins will not only give you more color
options but also help you eliminate the
fingerprints and smudges visit the
brand.com slash pixel - to customize
yours and while you're at that remember
