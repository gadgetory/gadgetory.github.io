and today I'm going to show you how to
sync zoom past music to Windows Phone
now we're looking at my tab pc and
explain some leann rimes this is a nice
screensaver does with the now plain
absolutely gorgeous and so i'm going to
get out of this and if i want to
download some music i'm already logged
in as a zune pass all right let me tell
you about a zune pass it's going to cost
you fifteen dollars a month and you get
ten song credits each month so that's 10
songs to keep and as long as you're a
subscriber to the zoom pass you get to
download and listen to any music you
want so I already have some zoom past
music in here this one Jessica Andrews
who I am those are just downloaded I'm
going to select those and put them into
a playlist there's my zune pass playlist
and now to get them into the Windows
Phone obviously zune software does not
sync with my windows found otherwise
that have a device menu up here and I'd
be able to drag stuff to this not only
syncs with zune devices currently but
windows media player also plays zoom
past music there you can see it working
and you can hear it because windows
media player uses the same digital
rights management as the zoom and guess
what windows media player syncs with
windows phones and my playlist is right
here soon pass music so I'm going to
just set up this storage card
there it is this is one time setup but
it will be automatic after this I'm
going to sink it automatically going to
remove all of those except for zune so I
just selected my zune pass music
playlist to automatically sync with my
windows fog every time it's plugged in
and over here we see sync in progress
and down here you can see sync status
and you see it's synchronizing six
percent all right you're going to have
to wait for that but in the meantime if
I right click on the zune pass sounds I
can look at media usage rights and here
we get some more information this file
can be played until 13 2010
collaborative played not allowed file
cannot be burned can be synchronized two
more times until 13 2010 so part of your
licenses you get to synchronize your
zune pass music 2 3 portable devices so
this is counting my windows phone as one
of those and we can't back up the
meteorites so there we go
and it's sinking another note you have
to be connected through windows mobile
device center or active sync for this to
work because it needs that for windows
media player to know that your windows
phone is compatible with the digital
rights management if you plug it in just
a hard drive and copy the music over
that won't work because media player
needs to transfer the licenses to the
windows phone so that will apply let's
see I think that's enough time now let's
look at this and I'm just going to say
play Jessica Andrews and it's going to
load up windows media
and there we have ours you music playing
on the Windows Phone of course you can
use your bluetooth headphones with this
plugin in the car if I go to library I'm
going to see those five songs are right
there beautiful so that's it not that
pretty easy you're probably seeing this
video and seen well all they really need
to do is make the zune software detect
that your plug you know you have a
windows phone plugged in and then it'll
be super easy well you're right but for
now you gotta go through windows media
player so there you go that's unlimited
music as long as your subscriber on your
Windows Phone for fifteen dollars a
month not bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
