pocketnow.com and in this part of the
video review of the mwg zing 2 we're
going to take a look at the preloaded
software accessing YouTube and using the
keyboard first off let's look at the
preinstalled applications under the main
start menu we have the basic calendar
application pocket Internet Explorer
pocket outlook task manager in windows
media task manager is a new Windows
Mobile 61 application which allows you
to view what is running and also n tasks
this application provides you with many
more viewing options than the original
windows mobile memory applications we
found under the system setting next
we'll go to programs first off we'll go
to the mobile office programs which
include word excel one note in
PowerPoint and they're all compatible
with office 2007 in the main program
group we've got the standard calculator
camera standard contacts file explorer
GPS viewer which I used in part two
internet sharing the java runtime is
preloaded messenger IM i installed the
windows live search the mwg auto config
which does not configure the device for
North American cellular carriers go
figure how they did that I did install
my mobile er which I used in part to the
standard notes remote desktop which is
new to Windows Mobile 61 the search
application sim manager streaming player
tasks windows live search in the zinc to
menu system which is what i call a poor
man's HTC touch flow all kidding aside
the zinc to menu allows you quick access
to windows media pictures and videos
camera and games it's easy to use with
your fingers as well there's no way to
terminate the application on the screen
but you can use the button on the left
hand side let
take a look at settings under the
personal settings all the basic settings
are there in the system settings all the
windows mobile basic settings are there
and in the connection settings you've
got a couple additional programs one is
the band selection which allows you to
select 3g 2g or auto the wireless
manager at the bottom here which allows
you to control flight mode and turn on
and turn off radios and then you have
the Wi-Fi utility which allows you to
see which Wi-Fi hotspot you're connected
to let's bring upward and test out the
keyboard first of all we'll pull out the
screen and you can see that the screen
rotation that happens quite quickly
which is very good so the keyboard has
three rows of keys a dedicated start
okay and soft menu keys the keys are not
raised this is a flat membrane keyboard
with ridges between the keys at first I
thought it might be difficult to type
with but you do get used to it because
the keys themselves are large and the
tactile response of the membrane is
quite good you do have to use the
function key for numbers and symbols and
I wish they would have made the spacebar
key larger it's basically the standard
key size but overall I have to say that
I like this keyboard now for the final
test in this review will take a look at
youtube I'll bring up pocket Internet
Explorer which up preloaded with the
mobile YouTube and then we play the
video which initiates the streaming
player that connects to youtube and
starts buffering my signal strength here
is pretty poor so the buffering could
experience some issues but it's playing
pretty smoothly right now by pressing
the screen I can go into landscape mode
and into full screen and you can see
it's doing pretty well although here it
stopped offering and went back to
portrait mode so my next test will be to
see if I can get a better signal through
Wi-Fi so I'll jump over to the wireless
manager and bring up the Wi-Fi which
will connect to my access point exit out
of there and go back to pocket Internet
Explorer and try to reinitiate the
streaming player I've had a problem
where when I go back into pocket
Internet Explorer sometimes the link to
the streaming player won't work i have
to close out internet explorer go back
in and then click again in the second
time it seems to load the streaming
player i'm not quite sure what that's
about the streaming player here tries to
connect but with Wi-Fi turned on I keep
getting errors so my deduction is that
the streaming player only works with the
cellular data network and because I
don't have a good enough signal in the
house it's not connecting well at all
which is I think a very poor design it
should use the fastest available network
whether it be Wi-Fi or cellular that
does it for this part of the review and
I'll be back with some final thoughts
and a usability test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
