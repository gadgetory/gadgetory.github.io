world's biggest smartphone makers is not
a smartphone
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is a first look at the new read a
miniature handheld camera from HTC an
inhaler a periscope a water pipe the
list of everyday objects the re
resembles goes on and on but that weird
form factor makes it pretty easy to hold
and it makes the re stand out or stand
up if you prefer it fits easily into a
pocket and it's designed to be used one
handed because HTC is thinking with the
Riesz that a small dedicated camera does
a better job of keeping you present in
the moment then does burying your face
in a smartphone frame a shot to make
sure you capture everything without a
viewfinder the re features a 16
megapixel sensor made it to an
ultra-wide lens offering a hundred and
forty six degrees of viewing angle
there's no flash and no optical
stabilization software smoothes the
shooting and it also adjusts for the
fisheye effect the wide-angle lens
produces the controls are limited to the
shutter button under the thumb and the
slow motion trigger on to the forefinger
there's not even a power switch sensors
embedded in the casing detect when the
Riyaz being held and a quick flash of
the color-coded LEDs tells you the
battery level every time you pick it up
shooting is as easy as pointing the re
and pressing once for a still shot and a
long press for a video the Reacher
resistant so you can also shoot
underwater footage is then sent to an
app on your Android phone or iPhone for
sharing the software also includes
remote viewfinder functionality and some
other perks but unfortunately the app
wasn't yet finished at the time of our
hands on also the software powering the
re itself was still being revised at
press time so you'll have to wait for
our full review to find out how well it
works and what we think of the final
photos please be advised that sample
shots you've seen here are not only
using pre-production software
but pre-production hardware as well the
read goes on sale later this month in
the u.s. in three colors and in other
markets
soon after be sure to check out our
hands-on experience with the HTC Desire
eye a selfie centric smartphone also
announced today in our full hands-on
post at pocketnow.com until next time
this has been michael fisher with pocket

to read invent yourself we'll see you
next time
