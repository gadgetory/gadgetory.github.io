Android M for its google i/o event
Samsung reports unprecedented demand for
one of its Galaxy s6 models and if you
want the Apple watch and stores it seems
you're very close I'm hi Mary vera and
I'm not going to brag I'm gonna let the
shirt do the talking this is out
daily
the official news that I have to with
Samsung as the company has just
manifested how much people are going
crazy over buying its gold version of
the galaxy s6 that's the gold platinum
variant by the way and this is not in
every region this is actually only
happening in Europe apparently they've
sold a 25-percent of its units are the
golden models they're not providing
exact figures of how many units were
sold but yeah it seems that people are
liking this new color and so much so
that they've provided a full press
release of why people are following the
golden trend links in description to
read that other official news have
Google's launched a project Phi the
invites have gone out and people can
already tested so long as they got
invited and this is cool first of all
because you're getting it but tell me
not everything is great it seems that
services like Google Voice are dying
with project Phi those of you that get
to use a service will actually have to
decline using google voice going further
and it seems that it even hinders some
portions of googles hangouts services I
wonder if that's going to be forever we
will keep you posted as we learn more
and talking about motorola we've got
official and non-official news and let's
begin with the official ones as the
company has made its android 5.1 update
official at least in paper they have
confirmed all the bug fixes that we are
getting etc etc but we don't really get
any dates the good thing is we get the
press release for all Moto X models even
the old generation one but we don't have
any date sadly hopefully it'll be better
than with Android 50 and when it comes
to rumors we've got according to some
trusted sources what we should expect to
be the next Moto X and it seems we're
getting a Snapdragon 808 5.2 inch quad
HD display for gigs of ram and other
goodies in the links of the description
as well and for those of you that are
getting July estimates for the Apple
watch it seems that Cupertino is already
preparing to have the Apple watch
available in stores not necessarily for
you to walk in and buy one but the
company's website is already prepared to
be updated whenever your local apple
store has a unit in a way for you to go
pick it up in case you want to go for an
in-store pickup it seems so that's the
way it's going to be we sadly don't have
any day test to when that's going to
but in the fact that this availability
is there doesn't necessarily mean that
it will happen we just be a website
update but hopefully it'll be before
july and finally for the very hot news
of the day google has just sent out its
schedule for google i/o that's happening
in the next 21 days and you think that
that be it the company within the
schedule said learn how Android M will
bring the power of android to other
workplaces so yeah even though we didn't
know that Android and was coming at
Google i/o the company pretty much
teased it and disclaimer they pretty
much remove that from the schedule now
so it could have been a mistake or it
could have been intentional whatever the
case may be Android M seems to be coming
and we need it desperately specifically
because of how bad lollipop handles ram
but it leads me to the question of the
day what would be your primary wish list
for Android M what would you want in my
case I want timely notification that I
enjoyed but that could just be me leave
us a comment down below what is it that
you want friends you know the drill if
