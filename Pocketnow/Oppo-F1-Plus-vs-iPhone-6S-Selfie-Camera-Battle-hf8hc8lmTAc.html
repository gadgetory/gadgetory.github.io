pocket now is the folks at Oppo sent
over an f1 for us to play with now the
killer feature on this phone is the 16
megapixel front facing camera and they
build this as being the selfie expert
the folks at Oppo were pretty adamant
that we compare this against another
flagship phone in the United States
ecosystem and they seemed really excited
about pairing this up against the iPhone
6s so with all of the design omage that
we see Capo paying both to the software
and hardware of the f1 plus they're
pretty confident that their front facing
camera solution is going to bully the
front-facing FaceTime camera on the
iPhone 6s so while I'm at this park in
getting rained on we're going to give
these two front-facing shooters a little
bit of a comparison see which one
survives our front facing camera battle
it's an uncharacteristically rainy day
in Southern California it's a really
kind of a fun way to test front-facing
cameras for our selfies and stuff
because we don't often have middle of
the day gray storm cloudy soft lighting
kinds of conditions it's doing wonders
for my complexion right now but III
guess I should really say I've never
been a fan of selfies of these
front-facing cameras on our phones I've
always looked at them as pieces of
hardware born out of necessity for those
situations where we might want to engage
with something like a video call makes
perfect sense we would want a camera on
the front of our phone we can all
acknowledge that more resolution does
not mean better camera quality but I am
happy to see that on the Oppo f1 even
though we've got more than three times
the number of pixels in this
front-facing shooter over the iPhone 6s
that it doesn't seem to have overly
negatively affected indoor and low light
performance especially compared to the
like a1 lamp test in my office both
phones seem to expose roughly about the
same and both teams seem to handle hand
movement roughly about the same although
I have to say that these these sort of
front-facing screen flash solutions not
really enough illumination to make sure
that you're getting crisper selfies and
you're getting faster
shutter speeds so especially for those
situations you're trying to take a photo
of you and a friend at an in a dimly lit
restaurant you you really just need more
light our phone screens as bright as
they can get really aren't going to
tackle that job for us for the iPhone 6s
being a flagship device there are a few
disappointments when we start looking at
this front facing camera first of all I
can't find any settings see we can bump
up that video quality that we're looking
at a 720p maximum video resolution with
a 5 megapixel image sensor we should be
able to crawl up to something like quad
HD video like we find on samsung devices
it's a really high quality video that
you can produce from a galaxy s7 or a
galaxy note5
also it's just a for a company that gets
audio so right on their headphone
playback apples recording a video is
still supremely it's it's really
disappointing to see that we still only
capture a mono audio signal on our video
now it's a very high quality mono don't
get me wrong it's got excellent noise
reduction filtering and you're you get a
pretty decent amount of dynamic range on
these microphones but it's still just
mono so yeah the f1 it's going to allow
you to save 1080p video from that
front-facing shooter
fortunately the phone doesn't seem to be
powerful enough to match the type of
image processing and higher resolution
video capabilities that we might see on
other devices but it's still going to
handily be the iPhone for just the
number of pixels on the screen and also
it is saving a stereo track now to be
perfectly fair I actually think that the
noise reduction and wind filtering
capabilities on the iPhone are a little
bit nicer but you still get a better
sense of the stereo environment around
you from the Oppo especially when you're
watching some of these videos back on
and you're using headphones I'm going to
say those two settings the Oppo and the
iPhone 6's battle to a tie but I will
give it to Apple that at least for still
photos for those still selfies and we're
capturing that full 5 megapixel
resolution that they're image processing
is still top notch it's still the most
consistent image processing I think I've
seen across any smartphone in the
ecosystem and they still maintain HDR
settings for your selfie photos now
unfortunately I'm shooting in conditions
where
it's going to be really difficult to see
significant differences meeting lean
normal photos in HDR but HDR processing
on the iPhone even from the selfie
camera is still probably best-in-class
and I couldn't find any settings like
that commiserate any similar settings on
the Oppo which is a little disappointing
for having an amazing an amazingly high
resolution on that front image front
image sensor there are a bunch of
situations where you're trying to take a
photo from that front-facing camera and
lighting conditions are not ideal like
you're trying to take a picture of
yourself at sunset and you're backlit
well you're just going to be a
silhouette if you want the really pretty
colors of the sunset behind you but if
you focus on your face and you expose
for your face and it's going to blow out
all of those really pretty colors it's
going to wash out the scene it's not
going to look very nice HDR is one
solution for balancing the subject and
the background yeah I gotta say I was a
little disappointed to see that once we
engaged video on the Oppo f1 that it's
cropping the frame in so I was really
hoping well maybe we're going to see
some kind of software image
stabilization on the output from this
video but that doesn't seem to be the
case this seems to be just as shaky and
just as twitchy and right now just so
that I can kind of stabilize this a
little bit I am using a little stick
with the smartphone cradle on it just so
that I can keep one hand free have a
better grip on the phone especially
because it's raining out here and this
one is getting kind of soaked but at
least we can say I cop oh really does
know their target consumer for this that
person who's really going to fill their
phone full of selfies this phone does
come with 64 gigabytes of built-in
storage so right off the bat you know
not having to buy a memory card for the
equivalent of $400 u.s. somewhere in
that ballpark I think you're getting a
sizeable bucket to throw all of your
front-facing camera photos and videos
into it's just kind of ridiculous to me
to think you know this thing has a
higher resolution sensor on the front of
it than it does on the back of it now I
try not to get overly snobby about a lot
of the things on our smartphones but I
ranked camera quality pretty high so in
the past I've been known to mock or
derive the quality of the photos and
videos we get from front-facing shooters
but we can't deny that this there's been
an explosion a whole car
industry of direct to audience
conversations like vlogging where you
have instant access to people sharing
their thoughts or communicating ideas
and it can be really compelling and
engaging content so you know it makes
sense that we would want to focus on
improving that front-facing camera
quality beyond just what we what is
necessary for things like FaceTime calls
Skype calls video calls things like that
I don't know I don't know that the oppo
is really changing my mind on
front-facing cameras and there have been
plenty of times throughout even just
this little interaction walking around
this park where I really just wanted to
flip back to the room rear mounted
camera even though it's lower resolution
how that would affect purchasing
decision overall when you're looking at
Android versus iOS when you're looking
at Oppo versus Apple that if the selfies
are so important to you or that's that's
such a killer app or a killer feature
for you then yeah then the Oppo makes a
very compelling argument for why you
should pick it over the iPhone 6s okay
so we should probably wrap this up this
videos long enough already but we're
looking at front-facing cameras and
which one of these two phones wins I
don't know that I can declare a clear
winner I the Oppo is going to provide us
with much higher resolution Stills and a
noticeably higher resolution video but
Apple color processing and the audio
improvements for noise reduction and
wind filtering should not be ignored for
myself personally and this is totally
subjective
I'd probably side with the Oppo just for
a little extra flexibility when it comes
to cropping images zooming in on the the
photos and videos that I'm shooting but
that's not some kind of clear
endorsement nor is it any kind of
runaway victory for the f1 plus and you
don't know I could be shooting this
video right now and some other kind of
smartphone as always folks thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for more fun comparisons
like these and to hit that thumbs up
button for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos now you can chat me up on
Twitter and Instagram as some gadget guy
and I will catch you all on the next
comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
