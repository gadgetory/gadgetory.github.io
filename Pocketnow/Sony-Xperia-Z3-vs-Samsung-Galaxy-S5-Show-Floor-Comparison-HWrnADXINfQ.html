here a while but each represents the top
of its little segment of the Android
world i'm michael fisher with pocket now
at Aoife 2014 let's take a quick look at
how sony's new xperia z3 compares with
the samsung galaxy s5
if you've watched our LG g3 versus
xperia z3 quick comparison most of this
will seem familiar
once again we're faced with a slightly
bulbous rounded plastic phone up against
a slender sharp cornered glass one and
they each feel very different in the
hand as a result both of these devices
are water and dust resistant but even in
that respect there's a difference of IP
67 and 68 ingress protection the
differences continue from there with
Samsung's battery slightly smaller but
removable Sony's RAM outpacing Samsung's
by a gig and Sony's 20 megapixel camera
able to produce higher resolution images
than Samsung's 16 megapixel unit Sony's
got a hardware camera t2 for those who
dig external audio Sony's speakers are
mounted on the front instead of around
back and display density in size are
nearly identical on these 1080p panels
though Samsung's Super AMOLED is as
usual bringing more vibrant colors and
truer blacks than Sony's IPS plate
software is the same old story from each
of these companies neither has done much
to change up its Android skin recently
leaving Sony with the classy smoked
glass look and Samsung with the bright
and playful colors you'll either love or
hate
Samsung brings the better multitasking
as usual you can run two apps side by
side instead of in Windows but most
other differences are cosmetic at least
those we're able to test out in a short
look on the show floor we'll be taking a
closer look at the Xperia z3 in the
coming months but in the meantime let us
know which of these you'd pick in the
comments below we're interested to hear
it till next time this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow with taylor Martin
