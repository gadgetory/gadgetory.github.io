in the wild apple enoki poster quarter
results two positive numbers and
Microsoft is working on making windows
RT better that's even possible I'm hi
Mary better and I'm getting that CES
plague once again with the cough this is
parking out daily nokia has just given
us a pleasant surprise but sadly it's
both good and bad their quarter results
were in and well they finally brought
profits after more than a year of
terrible losses but the bad news is that
they didn't make those profits out of
Lumia devices they actually made them
out of their Siemens department so they
did double their sales of Lumia devices
this quarter so it does seem that
everything is going high peak and Lumia
920 actually deserve that now when it
comes to animal things are a different
story analysts have spent days
predicting that Apple would not reach
their profitability record that they
have in the past quarters pretty much
for the past years and as it turns out
Apple actually did they broke records
and even history records when it comes
to profits they manage to sell 48
million our iPhones and 23 million iPads
in that quarter and things are not going
down the only thing that's currently
down is Apple's stock but you know the
way that behaves once they bring another
product to the market so you should buy
now Windows RT on the other hand hasn't
proven to be everybody's favorite
operating system from sluggish
performance to initial confusion to lots
of bugs people complained a lot about it
and Microsoft is now letting the public
know that they're working on a major
update for Windows RT that should come
in February though let's hope they're on
their time frame this time now we can't
expect anything we can't tell you
anything that's going to be included but
let's hope that Microsoft finally
figures this one out and for those of
you that were excited about the leaks of
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 well we've got
recent photographs as the device being
available in the wild people are
apparently already testing the device
and to be honest with you it doesn't
look very cool so this does seem like
the perfect segue for a Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 to be launched at mwc 2013 so
let's hope we bring you some good news
and finally for the interesting news of
the day Nokia's just released their Maps
plus beta application for all in those
phones not necessarily just nokia
devices to bring turn
turn navigation to the United States the
UK and other countries in Europe the
service is actually quite cool it works
quite well on the HTC 8x that I've been
testing it on even though it's not
available in my country but it does seem
interesting to see what Nokia is doing I
mean they offered their map service to
iOS recently eventually Android now
they're doing this to every Windows
Phone it dispatched to wonder what note
is doing we know that the highly
considering to drop their hardware
division and that actually leads me to
the question of the day would you prefer
a Nokia it does anything I mean software
or anything or you prefer the Nokia that
you currently know the company that
provides great smartphones then in my
particular case I actually would love
for now get to retain their smartphone
business but leave us a comment down
below what would you prefer and if you
want an early or scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet roll make sure you follow us on
parking now calm this is this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi Mary that up thanks for watching see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
