cooler than we were expecting
eat your Apple watch rumors claim that
it will be more designed towards health
in mind and get ready for the Legend of
Zelda reaching mobile very soon I'm
hiding that I let up recording this
video early editing on a plane and
publishing from a galaxy far far away
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today have to do with modo and its
future lineup as the company hasn't
really pulled back about the fact that
we've got leaks about everything to
expect over the Moto X for now we see
slides over what the company is planning
to do with ultimate everything they're
calling ultimate to absolutely every
single one of the experiences that they
offer with the line ups and moto and so
the Moto Z is going to be at the top the
Moto X 4 is going to be at the bottom we
see the future of Moto G as well and
just how the company is going to be
playing the market obviously the most
ultimate way for the company to reach
anything is sure to launch updates to
its phones we can't wait for that
now it's move the spotlight over to
Nintendo the Nintendo switch continues
to be one of my favorite products of all
time I loved playing Zelda breath of the
wild and it is going to reach a mobile
very soon now for very soon apparently
it's going to happen sometime in 2018 we
don't have a final date we're just
wondering exactly how Nintendo plans to
innovate with respect to what we saw
with Super Mario on iOS and Android
where I'm not going to lie it's a cool
game I just I I find it a little boring
after some time leave us a comment tell
us what you think what you'd like to see
now let's talk about Apple's WWDC is
right around the corner and we hear a
couple of things that the company is
bringing number one trusted sources
claim that a narrow bezel iPad pro is
coming to make things awesome because
obviously we have the iPad that's the
entry level and that's very aggressively
priced then this pro is going to be just
something completely different in
addition to that that Siri speaker is
definitely going to make an appeal
we just can't wait to see how early
these products are going to reach the
market a product we're not expecting to
be announced at WWDC but it's coming
soon as the next generation Apple watch
according to sources this Apple watch is
going to finally do what Steve Jobs
always wanted to do because we know that
project is very early on the problem was
that Apple wasn't really able to make
the Apple watch something that somebody
with diabetes can use for example
something that reliable I will tell you
that series 2 has one of the most
accurate heart rate sensors that I've
ever used on a watch
bear in mind on a watch and it sees that
this new one will bring a glucose meter
for people with diabetes to be able to
use it in addition to other features
that are focused on health and Apple
continues to work with companies in
order to make this such a reliable
source that it would even be approved by
doctors I don't know we'll keep you
posted as soon as we learn more this
Apple watch might not be launched until
later this year
and finally the very hot if they have to
do with the HD see you 11 it is now
official yes I had some time with it
earlier last week and I will tell you
this much it is absolutely everything
that HTC needed to do to fix the state
of the you ultra this brings a design
language is the you but under the fact
that it's the successor to the 10 which
is the reason for the main everything
that it brings us cool great
specification the fact that it finally
brings ip67 water and dust resistance
for those of you that are not looking
for that tall display that we get on the
galaxy si or the LG g6 this is pretty
much your conventional smartphone with
all the buttons and everything and that
edgesense feature is actually something
that made me giggle the moment I started
using it because I considered it genius
it's the fact that you have a button
that's actually not there but is there
whenever you need it I find it to be
really cool but it leads me to the
question of the day obviously watch our
hands-on video of the U 11 and tell us
in the comments what you think about it
do you think this is the phone that HTC
needs in my case I do believe so leave
us a comment down below we left on your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
if you want to get the news earlier
before the video is filmed all those on
Fargo calm and hit that subscribe button

that I run into the grandma'd heinously
