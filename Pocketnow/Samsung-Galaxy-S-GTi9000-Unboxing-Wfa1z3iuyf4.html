packing.com and today we're unboxing the
Samsung I 9000 galaxy s so this is the
first Android device to use Samsung's
Super AMOLED display so let's check it
out okay so let's rip this thing open
here and if we have the Box pretty
simple box which is good that they can
serve some resources and do not accept a
seal is broken so that's good that
that's open this is an 8 gigabyte
version model and this is the IEEE 9000
so I'm just gonna open this seal here
maybe I can use it he hears something
like that there we go now we'll slide
open the box and set the device aside
for just a second wow that's really thin
okay so let's open up the box let's see
nothing on there I've got some
documentation looks like a full color
manual which is good let's see open this
up check out what's inside Bluetooth
information more like an advertisement
for Samsung's Bluetooth device and a
manual so that's great let's see here
what else we got warranty card more
garbage let's see get to know your
Galaxy S so this is like a QuickStart
guide which is pretty good that's in
full color okay so we have our European
charger this is from the UK and if you
want to pick up this device you can go
to clove code UK that's who we got it
for we have a pair of stereo headphones
here which is great and also has a
microphone and I believe it has controls
on the note just to call or end so
that's okay I guess we also have the
micro USB adapter which plugs into the
computer so you can sync up your device
or transfer files whatnot and we have
our battery this is a 15
100 milli amp hour battery school as you
see it's pretty big battery for a small
device so let's check out the phone so
this is a very thin phone it's like tiny
in hand let's just take off this plastic
here looks like the slides right out wow
that's nice black plastic on the back
with kind of a blue accent if you can
see that of course it's a Google device
5 megapixel camera but we'll get into
more of the hardware stuff in the
hardware review let's just look at that
screen Wow feels like it's glass we'll
have to check that out so let's just
compare this to some of the other
devices out there after I turn on the
screen because I want to see how great
this screen is ok so this screen is
amazing you can see it from any angle
and the brightness and clarity is like a
photograph look I I don't even believe
how clear this screen is I don't even
think that this could ever happen
anyways to compare this to some other
sized devices I have a credit card sized
object so it's quite larger than a
credit card sized object as you can see
the device is very thin though it's only
it's less than a centimeter thin I can
pair that to wait a dollar bill I didn't
actually have a dollar but oh it was 100
anyways it's about the same width as a
dollar bill and a little bit smaller let
me zoom out real quick as you can see
it's a little bit shorter than a dollar
bill so we'll just move that aside ok so
I have a few other devices here I have
the HD 2 so the screen on the HD 2 is a
little bit larger than the screen on the
eye 9000 galaxy s but the galaxy s is
quite thinner about less about 2
millimeters thinner than the HD - the
Nexus 1 here the screen is larger on the
galaxy s of course it's about 0.3 inches
larger than the screen on the Nexus 1
and it is also a thinner of course as
you can see that and we have the older
eye 8000 here which is a lot thinner
than the eye 8000 and the screen of
course is larger on this device so let's
compare the screens real quick okay so
I've downloaded the exact same image
from Google Images and as you see these
are all AMOLED displays but of course
it's not only fair to compare the HD 2
because it's still using the LCD TFT
display and the clarity on this screen
is
just amazing as you can see it's so
clear the colors are so vibrant it's it
just is it's like a photograph I mean
that's the only way you can explain how
clear this screen is and the device is
so fast but we'll get into that in the
hardware review coming up and a software
review coming up shortly so this is the
unboxing video of the Samsung I 9000
Galaxy S and as you see the screen is
actually glass I did check that out it's
also very fast to respond this is
probably the most sensitive screen I've
ever used on any device computer or
anything so stay tuned for the hardware
and software views coming up and if you
want to pick up this device just go to
