yeah I I just broke my Galaxy s8 this is
a very sad day we usually have a
durability report where we tell you just
how phones of age when it comes to wear
and tear but this actually came a lot
sooner than I thought I've pretty much
only been using this phone for two to
three weeks and I'm actually not here in
this video to tell you that this phone
is not durable actually the total
contraire
I have not babied this phone at all this
was actually the first time that I had
ever used this phone with a case but
before that I already dropped this phone
three times without a case it had fallen
on tile and even though there were some
very minor scratches on the aluminum it
was really almost invisible thanks to
the coating that's on the aluminum the
problem is that today I was going out
for a run it was really early and I was
like you know what I'll wear a case just
to you know protect the phone in case of
anything while I'm running the problem
was that as I was getting off the car I
totally forgot that the phone was on my
lap and it fell face-first and so here's
the thing is this film durable yes it is
probably one of the most durable phones
I've used the biggest problem is not the
durability of the materials but really
the design was it a problem with the
case no there isn't
the problem is how cases blend with the
edge display this is how it goes the way
this edge displays are protected is
really just the narrow lip at the top
and the bottom and obviously there is
really no protection on the sides or a
very small protection on a specific
corner of the sides because obviously if
not you won't be able to use the edges
on the display it makes all the sense in
the world the problem is what happens if
the phone Falls specifically on those
specific areas that's exactly what
happened to me I'm not calling out
Samsung for this
I'm not calling case makers for this I'm
just saying that if you're buying a
phone with a curved display you might
want to get yourself a screen protector
I've always been against them I actually
take them off whenever I start a review
but this is one of those phones where I
feel that if I was wearing a screen
protector the display would probably
still be intact now the biggest problem
right now is how do I fix it I'm
actually going to try to use Samsung
services to try to replace the display
and I'll obviously report back in a
future video with the full durability
report tell you what happened so far it
doesn't seem that that is going to go
too well because this is a Canadian unit
and apparently I can't fix this Canadian
unit in the United States and that's
actually not a good thing
stay tuned for a future video I will let
you know how that goes while you're at
it make sure you follow us on social
media and hit that subscribe button down
below for more videos like this one you
can also follow me on Twitter Hind
underscore any better on instagram @
Hinde every data please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
even if I don't like what I'm seeing
right now I'm Jaime Rivera thanks so
much for watching we'll see you on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
