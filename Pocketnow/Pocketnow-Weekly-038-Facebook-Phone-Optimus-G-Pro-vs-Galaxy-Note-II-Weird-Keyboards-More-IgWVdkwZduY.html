roll into Android and a facebook event
impressed everyone or left everyone
disappointed we're not sure all that and
more in the hour ahead on the pocket now
weekly the once-a-week podcast from
pocket now where we discuss smartphones
tablets and the state of mobile
technology I'm Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and I'm joined
today by Joe Levi the android guy good
morning to you in Utah sir good morning
to you and everyone else who's tuning in
from wherever they are in the world yes
including but not limited to super
Carolina because we are also joined by
our resident Carolinian Taylor Martin
good morning to you good morning hmm
good morning I understand that you are
you're very recent addition to the
waking world yeah you and I are both
grog I think Joe is groggy headed to on
account of in Utah it's like 2am over
there or something it is it's it's 2
a.m. hawaii time i think ok no it's it's
seven in the morning here oh that
reminds me when I was getting hired at
nextel the training officer like in
charge of training us was demoing push
to talk this is 2004 when push to talk
was still like becoming a consumer thing
and he he was like watch this its
nationwide push to talk and we're in
virginia and it's like 9am and it's
training session and he chirps his
friend and like two seconds later or no
it was like 10 seconds later his friends
like beauty what what man he's like oh
man I I'm sorry did I wake you up he's
like yeah I'm sorry go back to bed and
we're like what just happened there and
he's like my friend lives in Hawaii oh
so yeah time differences are fun what I
said about the facebook event in that
intro is entirely true we're recording
this episode it a stupid time slot and
that's my fault we normally do record in
the morning usually it's Thursday
morning and that's what it is right now
but normally there is not a event of
newsworthy notable pneus in the
afternoon and that's what's happening
today so we have no idea what the
facebook event
how disappointing it was or wasn't we
have a pretty good idea of what's going
to happen at it but by the time this
podcast goes up the world will know and
we will with Europe we're already behind
the behind the curve chance but shall we
unless we speculate and then we're ahead
that's what i wanted to i want it i want
to speculate a little bit because we
seem to have been presented with a whole
lot of leaks and information that has
found its way through the cracks to the
public to the common world this event it
seems at the very least poised to
deliver us a new facebook app one that
is deeply integrated with a phone and
specifically speaking it looks like that
phone might be it is very likely to be
the HTC first which frankly I didn't
bother looking up until I had to prepare
for this podcast because I knew it
wasn't going to be a terribly impressive
phone and we're looking at kind of a
mid-range Snapdragon s4 device coming in
different colors but i think the real
story here is a software so DS does
anybody do either of you guys feel
exceedingly passionate about this device
one way or the other I mean men by this
device I mean this new Facebook
integration first of all what is
facebook I'm like very clear on that oh
dude it's like a mash-up between Twitter
and Google+ but it's like with a bunch
of people that you went to elementary
school with that you don't care about
right oh very similar to friendster calm
and and my face might whatever that was
oh yeah yeah did you see that the mark
zuckerberg first like very first web
site was was probably uncovered but
didn't know that did yeah it's like an
angel fire page yeah oh god it's amazing
it's got some sweet sweet animated gif
action on it yeah there was John Lutz
step up from geo cities then right okay
uh yeah well yeah definitely definitely
um so but but what about this like I
think the real story here is the
software right there's this kind of
Facebook it looks like a custom HTC
Sense skin that doesn't look all that
great I don't know it's like the the HTC
salsa 2013 yes so there's not really a
lot for us to get excited for our
kind to get excited but there are a ton
of people out there who obsess over
Facebook and unfortunately I'm friends
with a lot of those on facebook and they
would eat this up it would eat it alive
now I are kind you mean the cool kids
right I'm talking about the people who
obsess over specifications you know yeah
yeah well and I so I don't I mean I we
know that I don't care about specs very
much and I really glaze over when we
start talking chipsets and and stuff
like that so um but even so I feel like
HTC should have learned it's lesson from
the chacha / salsa / status / haha oh
yes right oh wait the cha-cha-cha was
the big one with no keyboard right well
I don't remember anymore yeah there were
two there was like to try well anyway
and I stuck up for the cha-cha actually
I wrote an article sticking up for the
cha-cha and that's what got me hired at
pocket now over a year ago that article
got you i'm tony to call me at least you
should be proud thanks thanks i gotta
ask tony if he remembers that I
appreciated you taking a position that
was ridiculous but so I feel like HTC
probably should have learned it's lesson
from from that device which was
mid-range and which I appreciated
because it was different and I admire
when a company is brave enough to do
something different but which didn't
really impress anyone in terms of how
well it did anything because I don't
think it really did anything to well
except have a facebook button that was
the cool part about it it had I was a
button that's all they had to do and in
fact on this one all they've got to do
is the the facebook today screen that's
all they've got to get right everything
else who cares it's the facebook today
right and I'd like at the risk of
bringing up a point that we've brought
up in a billion other people have
brought it before don't we all already
have a facebook phone guys like yes the
app integration and the app itself and
the integration with the OS particularly
on Android oh and iOS now is is such
that and on Windows Phone you get the
People Hub I mean like you have a bevy
of options already for a facebook phone
why would anyone want to buy a facebook
phone if they research
did any more than just watching a
commercial because it's Totally Rad yo
said um poor baby powder blue right
right right uh but no I wrote an article
about the cha-cha and salsa it was a one
word article should anyone by the chacha
or salsa if the answer that the whole
entire body of the article no one word
no is that along with Jo Doug I didn't
do it I'll joke about it but I never got
to I always wanted to do that just a one
word post no in like 50 point nice curly
letter some say and and no pictures of
the device is a picture of me looking
discontent what's your hands up in the
air like why would anyone do this yes ok
so to answer your question Michael I'm
looking at this on my Nexus 4 right now
which by the way is now screen protector
lassan the front because it got like um
big lint ball underneath it so I don't
know how to clean it Joe we saw what
happened last time you did that I've got
something new to show you that's in the
mail so no spoiler alerts there but it's
bright yellow so yeah but late TC nokia
action there so anyway i'm looking at my
nexus 4 i've got my facebook plug in and
i just added there are exactly two
widgets that i could put on my screen
one of them is the status which lets me
post what's on my mind and a button that
lets me scroll through the latest couple
of bazillions of posts that i have in my
wall and then another widget that lets
me put a pencil in a square or take a
picture or poke myself in the eye I
think that's a map check I don't know
yeah that's that's it that's all I have
so as far as saying you know we've
already got a facebook phone yeah but
the widgets at least on Android or crap
yeah the legends you have some air war
yeah the way it's are the applications
themselves aren't that great and then I
I constantly deal with you know not
being able to load new notifications or
or even load a new feed or anything like
that so it's i mean that's that's ios
and android and if i'm correct they both
have gone native right they're not html5
anymore
yeah at the android version I know for
sure is no longer html5 right and I
pretty sure the went native but they
didn't date they still have not even
made an Android tablet application yeah
oh my gosh that kills me why I don't
even like Facebook and it makes me so so
mad you know I my thing is this like I I
don't want to talk about this too much
because you by the time this post like I
said this is all going to be old news
and but I think that the best thing that
happened on the hardware side with this
was the was the button was the hardware
button and not just because he was one
tap to jump into Facebook it was you
could long press it and check in
somewhere it would glow
context-sensitive Lee depending on
whether yet if you had a photo on the
screen the button would glow and it's
like yeah yeah i will share that
facebook i think that was impressive
that was cool i hope we see something
like that on this HTC first I don't
think we will but we're really gonna
have to talk about our next week because
I just we just can't we have no we've
the information we have which is less
information than any listener has at
this point so sorry for the scheduling
snafu i emailed joe at 1am last night i
was like you still awake and if Joe had
answered I would have been like we have
to record this in the afternoon but just
donated his rest so uh so I don't blame
you one bit oh my day oh let me back up
my wife's day and my wife is my life
starts at four thirty so bedtime for us
is 830 or nine last night we stayed up
real late to like 915 you wrote well
cool so anyway we'll talk about this
next week I want to just touch really
quickly on a cool road trip I took
yesterday while we're speaking about
hardware to a certain extent I got to
take a tour of the facility where
sapphire is made artificial man-made
sapphire which is relevant to
smartphones in that you can make
smartphone screens out of it that are as
harder than any material except diamond
which is awesome yes it's unless you're
toting around a pocket full of diamonds
and really who doesn't on a Friday you
are going to do well you're not going to
have a scratched-up smartphone screen it
was so cool to see how they build this
stuff this was if you haven't seen the
video you should watch it
it was the tour was given to us by Jeff
Nestle Pat the Internet's most liked guy
on a pocket now video do you guys catch
those comments as they were coming up
when that video posted from mwc know is
that well Jeff's giving us the demo at
mwc knees like using a concrete from the
parking lot it or scratch up the screen
and then look in the YouTube comments
like inexplicably like like 20 to 30
people on YouTube it felt like maybe I
was last night was like 10 or 15 people
in YouTube the pit of comment despair
the place where everyone goes to be
hurtful and mean like 10 or 15 people
roll up and they're like Jeff seems like
a cool guy I like Jeff I was like you
know I agree it was a cool guy to talk
to but it was just so amazing to watch
the internet just embrace Jeff Jeff of
GT advanced technologies anyway he gave
us a to give us a tour yesterday and it
was just awesome to see all this high
technology science building sapphire
displays and I want to know from from
you guys Joe see this this is a
technology that wouldn't help Joe and
this is asked in the comments a lot
because even though it is less scratch
about it is more brittle because it's
harder and so you know it's a harder
substance so the Sapphire will likely
not be any more resistant to shattering
than gorilla glass and it might even be
less resistant to shattering so I guess
that's my question really quickly for
you guys Joe first I get now now Taylor
first cuz we know Joe's position on this
what what's more important to you
shatter resistance or scratch resistance
and a smartphone screen um shadow
resistance really yeah that's it sounds
like a man who's shattered a screen
before I have not I've actually never
broken a phone shattered the display
ever really yep I had dropped my galaxy
note 2 I may or may not have had a
couple drinks and I was uh in a bathroom
at a bar and I just went to use the
bathroom and somehow my phone's defy the
laws of physics my phone shot out of my
pocket right
I have no no clue anyway it flies across
a bathroom and hits the floor and just
everything goes in opposite directions
it was a note to so battery door one way
battery the other way in the phone you
know another way did the S pana pop out
or that stay snowed and it stayed in
good my battery door wouldn't fit my
cone but everything else was perfect no
scratches nothing so really yeah um yeah
but I feel you know shadow resistance
you can use a phone if it's scratched um
you cannot really use a phone too well
if it's shattered no sure glass shards
and your thumb yeah that where the
digitizer doesn't work anymore or the
digitizer doesn't work anymore I mean
there are a lot of things that that can
happen with a shattered display
something that's scratched it's going to
look ugly but you can prevent that so if
you have shattered protection you can
get a screen protector for scratch
protection but but the thing is like on
my note 2 or even my HTC One X or even
the nexus 4 none of them have scratches
so I don't use scratch screen protectors
but I don't have any scratches on any of
them so at least on the display now I
don't use cream projectors either and i
buy only major display casualty has been
my galaxy nexus on verizon greg it was
in my pocket and one of the steel
buttons and that closed my cargo pocket
like I must have sat on the phone wrong
and the button just went right through
the screen boo no I was a big ol hug
them print shatter but but Joe destroyed
his phone yeah and so what does that
make you feel about shadow resistance
versus scratch resistance first it makes
me feel sad mm but once I get past that
I'm gonna go a route that do you you
wouldn't imagine that I'd go I'm going
to agree we need to have we need to have
shadow resistance I think that can be
accomplished many different ways but
scratch protection can be done by very
inexpensive very nice high performance
screen protectors
the one that I just took off my device
due to an adhesive failure is what they
use in the military to put on the
leading edges of helicopters yes yes I
know they're put through a whole bunch
of abuse and if I do end up getting a
scratch on it warranty notwithstanding I
take it off and I put another ten twenty
dollar piece of plastic on it and I'm
back and I'm fine a side effect of that
particular one was also
fingerprint-resistant switch now that it
is often i'm using a bear screen I have
to keep wiping down the screen to get
all the fingerprints off but but but
that nexus 4 screen is so smooth it is
it is it's pretty feel so smooth and now
that i have that screen protector on the
back to make it not as slippery its i
hold it a lot better but we talked about
this on the last talking out live that i
was on a little bit regarding removable
batteries and how they might help with
keeping screens from shattering and
phones from just committing ritual
suicide by having that removable battery
with the door that just pops off when
you pay wrong energy yeah you're
dissipating all that energy across the
floor sometimes but it's it's not all
trapped inside the device and finding
the weakest point to escape through
which happens to be your ridiculously
brittle though ridiculously
scratch-proof front screen or mac screen
do you know we have to do we've given me
an idea Joe like it all that energy
banging around inside a phone as it
falls to the ground would probably
visually be very compelling if you
capture it we need to get a
hundred-thousand-dollar high-speed
camera and just start doing like the
best drop tests you've ever seen on
phones at like ten thousand frames a
second I think that would be amazing see
how much the body warps exactly yeah
yeah for the funny thing when I promise
you no warp like like ripples on water
before it shatters I'll be amazing I bet
it does that'll be so cool I'll be
awesome I love science we rather one of
the requisition with Tony yeah I do yeah
I'm just gonna go ahead and buy an all
expense that I'm sure they'll understand
ask
forgiveness yeah guys we I'm sorry we
have some breaking news I this is going
to affect every single one of our
listeners to his core the LG optimus G
just got a jelly bean update on AT&amp;amp;T and
you check your email slow shut up Taylor
number of jelly bean Android for that
one yeah yeah because I do that yeah
they gotta do that Optimus cheese skin
on it but the optimus G needed it cuz
like yeah a lot of devices still need
the ICS update to jelly bean but the
optimus G is actually kind of a
beautiful device and it was a shame that
it wasn't running jellybean yet so that
that's the the nexus for LG right um
sort of yet except i like know better
don't care yeah yeah anyway um blasphemy
yeah I know right we can get a no hold a
conversation with it before we get
that's the nexus 4 LTE yes right
something x is for that should have men
let's jump in please to Windows Phone
very quickly because there's not much
there and we want to talk about Android
and I want to get beaten topics not
windows phone in general right let's
jump right into Windows Phone everybody
get your live tile suits on you know Joe
I haven't been able to pay attention to
anything in this podcast since you
mentioned that you're receiving some
secret package in the mail that's bright
yellow are you kidding is it a secret
what's going on it's a secret for me can
you reveal it on the podcast can you
share it with our listeners you hear the
roar listen to the roar the whole I'm
gonna do a disservice because I don't
remember the names what are you getting
what is it a device a phone no Taylor
you've got the other Kevlar back to your
nexus 4 right yeah and I uh I looked
those dudes up and I am getting the
bright yellow weather Wow hey it's
bright yellow which I kind of dig from
HTC nokia stuff and it's leather which
it's gotta be gritty so i'm gonna take
my invisible shield from the back of my
next for when that gets here and i'm
going to put on bright yellow leather
whoa whoa it will be gorgeous and people
will make fun of me I cannot wait and
you go on the pocket now live with that
I want to see it we go ahead 20 I was
going to say I've got the leather from
them too it's not terribly grippy but
it's definitely more grippy than that
than the glass is it more grippy than an
invisible shield dad I don't know we
were gonna make coming I'm we were
talking I was at the microsoft store the
other day to pick something up which I
will discuss in a second and I brought
my friend over to the phones and it was
like hey have you seen the HTC have you
seen the windows phone 8x and he's like
yeah of course I've seen the 8x I'm like
no not this one because at the far left
extreme position of the microsoft store
windows phone display they have an HTC
windows phone 8x that is the awesome
awesome highlighter yellow yes and wow
if you've never seen it with your own
eyes like I don't you you can't I don't
ever want to shoot a video of this phone
because it'll never read on camera like
in person it actually hurts to look at
like it's and I'm not saying like it
hurts looking like oh it's so ugly no
like it your eyeball doesn't really know
to do with that with that color yeah
well all your colors even the blues
they're just so vibrant they've got some
other janessa quad yeah move you bitch
Jones Levi a blue ring in French to the
podcast an episode 38 it was about half
the French that I know right there so
one hundred percent of the French so
that it um remember anyway no no we
can't talk about French anyway um the I
that's why I thought you were getting I
thought you're getting a windows phone
8x in in highlighter yellow and I was
going to be so amped but we tried to
change theme colors on it I was like
Chris do you think that there's any do
you think there's any Windows Phone
theme color besides the the neon yellow
that'll work on this and we cycled
through about five of them and nothing
works if you buy that phone you have to
use it with the yellow thing so yeah I
got to see it in in Las Vegas at CES I
was at a HTC dinner and they broke out
this suitcase it was a super-secret
suitcase with like I think I showed you
the picture this my head yeah yeah yeah
there were like 30 HTC phones in the
suitcase yeah and all just super bright
colors I wish I had mine
like real camera I would have taken some
nice pictures but yeah it was like oh my
gosh just it was a blinding box yeah it
was it was Dane on the other side of it
they had all these Rolexes yeah and
they're just they're just a bunch of
free cash in there and some guns to tell
HTC roles to trade well it is what
failure so um I want to get myself an
HTC 8x and I have for a long time but
I'm not going to and I hope they make a
sequel that has better buttons moving on
to the no theater Lumia family and maybe
a little thing about no no keep keep the
thickness we need some bulk we need
somebody out there to say you don't need
to be anorexic to be a good looking cell
phone it's exactly right to say enough
is enough it's okay the thing is is
surprisingly thin I I didn't even like
the way it felt in my hand when I picked
it up the first time she's like so and
yeah it's so thin and what's more on the
edges yeah yeah do you think that the
sequel to the HTC windows phone 8x
because despite their disappointing
sales you know they're going to make
another window around windows phones
considering their relationship with
Microsoft do you think the next round of
Windows Phone 8x type HTC devices will
have an ultrapixel camera Jen's I'm a
bet if it does it'll have a higher
megapixel count mmm yeah it's got a
there is no discovery Ilona yeah but
it's interesting you say megapixels
don't matter and then the backlash has
been that hey it doesn't have enough
megapixels well yet don't matter to an
extent and then to a different extent
they do matter I've been using the one
with new camera software so I've been
taking shots kind of left and right and
very soon there will be a comparison
video posted and by very soon I mean
somewhat soon there will be a comparison
video posted detailing some of these new
shots and we're gonna we're going to
talk more that conversations not over
because the software update has done
something nice to it but anyway whatever
we you know the one got so much
attention we're just not going to give
it any more on this podcast actually we
are later on but
we're not gonna give it anymore not a
little later let's talk right now just
quickly about this phone that's probably
fake it's a nokia lumia 950 is the rumor
before we came on the air i tried to
look for updates on this it taylor is
this one confirmed fake yet or what I
don't know but it just does not look
like Nokia design whatsoever the Nokia
logo on the top looks photoshopped it
looks like it's not it's ask you oh yeah
it's not even see honor it is it doesn't
look centered and it doesn't look I
guess parallel to the top of the display
yeah that's what I meant by ask you just
as easily as they photoshopped Lumia 950
on the front they flopped that Nokia
logo in there so this is a device if
you're not looking at it listeners that
whatever it's a rectangular smartphone
blah blah blah that gets the most
distinctive feature about it is this
kind of square windows phone button on
the bottom below what appears to be a
somewhat under sized display and it's
one of the uglier leaked photos I've
seen I think it's probably a 3d model
photographed from a monitor or something
I don't know it looks fake I think it's
bogus there are rumors i I'm just bait
we're just basically waiting for the
fake confirmation on this right now why
do you think the display is small why do
you not think those buttons are
extremely large you think why do i not
think i'm looking at a windows phone
phablet from now kid yeah this is their
tablet this is their first windows from
the windows tablet it's the nokia 7 you
know how will it button all the size of
a coaster i will gladly do a windows
phone challenge when they come out with
a phablet yeah i will do you think it's
gonna be windows phone or do you think
we're gonna go with surface what Artie
on there yeah that would be rough or
Windows 8 pro even oh gosh no I wrote an
article about this it does not along
folks so that's that's what I'm alluding
to you've got such similarity and user
interface but such disparity and I'll
everything else is there experience yeah
yeah it's it's a hodgepodge jumble of
chaos so I got so fed up with dealing
with Windows RT and not be
you know I feel like when we complain
about Windows RT people immediately
assume that maybe there are some
performance issues or things like know
it runs very smoothly but it is less
capable once you get into the the old or
Windows environment so I got so fed up
with it that i had the opportunity to
secure a an HP Envy x2 for myself and i
did just that that's why i was at the
microsoft store i was picking it up and
so I have an ID now I'm a proud owner of
an HP Envy x2 which I had this was like
two days ago and I've been so busy that
I haven't even been able to take it out
of the box I tried to vine my unboxing
last night on Twitter but I didn't have
an iOS device so i couldn't find it was
like come on but i'm going to have some
more thoughts about windows 8 pro on an
atom powered device soon i don't know if
i'm going to write about it i might just
talked about on the podcast but in any
in any case the windows 8 and windows RT
comparisons are not over at all Joe
you're still so fed up with windows 8 as
I before the podcast you were trying to
figure out some skype settings right
yeah it there's two ways to do
everything in windows 8 pro I mean it's
and you never know which way is the
right way or which way isn't you've got
to update things in two places they're
very different but sometimes are the
same most of the time they're not ah
yeah I plugged in a hard drive to my I
had windows 8 running through parallels
on my macbook and I needed to find out
how to clear the defaults because I
accidentally told it to load to windows
8 by default so every time I plugged it
in oh no it would try to search for
windows 8 all my gosh it was awful all I
almost wiped my computer or wiped
parallels and and reloaded windows just
to clear the default it was that bad i
searched for three or four hours trying
to figure out how to do that I could do
it him like I could do it in two seconds
own so windows seven but windows 8 it
took me forever to things is awful first
of all I understand your pain about a
dual-boot about a boot default problem
because the same thing happens on my
touchpad ever
since i put android on my touchpad it
defaults to loading android when it
boots I don't take out my touchpad so I
can have an Android tablet i use my
touchpad to use webos so that's annoying
I haven't written out how to fix that
I'm sure it's a very easy fix but the
second thing is I also run into the
problems that you Joe and you tailor
have experience with Windows RT and
Windows 8 and I feel badly about it
sometimes because I do get I will say
this i do get more wrong on a first pass
on Windows Phone or Windows RT or
Windows 8 then I do on an Android device
because sometimes it's because I'm I'm
rushing and then I have to go back and
correct it but more often it's because
while I find the windows design language
beautiful and while I find the UI
compelling and good-looking and it well
it feels good it's not terribly
intuitive is it yes counterintuitive if
you don't know how it works there's no
way for you to figure out how it works
other than by stumbling on something by
mistake right yes and that's where
skeuomorphism comes into play and we
don't need that either so but we need
something that's kind of halfway between
the two maybe you got to have hints on
what something is and how to do
something but to mirror your rent there
Michael when I take windows 8 off of
this not if but when i take windows 8
off of this computer i am so tempted to
go to a boon to rather than try and dig
up one of my licenses for windows 7 yeah
i mean that that's how bad Windows 8 is
yes I'm I'm willing to go to open to and
I'll learn that cuz I gotta learn this
so I may as well learn something new but
anyway this isn't a bash on windows 8
podcast this is pocket house so look if
you're moving to China then that'll help
you to write yes that was awesome news
kind of scare you but awesome what is
what is the news lubuntu is the official
operating system of china wow that is
direct and I think TI basic is the
official operating system of
korea korea super cool super korea so
all this is to say that HTC is going to
bring a Windows 8 tablet this year and I
am not sure whether to be excited about
it or not I'm excited to maybe I'm very
excited about it in the sense that i'm
sure it will be beautiful hardware if it
happens and i hope that windows blue
makes windows 8 a little bit more ullu
yeah a little more blood everything
should be a little more blue I watched
enterprise forgot to wish for that yeah
our own Adam line he uh he never lets us
forget when HTC made Windows tablets
before yeah every time any any mention
of Windows tablet an HTC or mentioned in
the same article well he said they're my
HTC shift and I love that thing when I
was uh when I was in high school I
wanted the HTC shift so bad so bad and
he's so sweet looking what the hell was
the HTC shift it was like a I don't know
what size maybe seven or eight inch
tablet that ran windows and it has a
like a possible I don't like like the
tilt though so yeah probably so it was
like a big smartphone like a really big
slide-out keyboard on it yeah nothing
was also pocket now review it doing it I
don't know if Adams talking about we'd
probably did pocket now HTC how to
run OS 10 on the HTC shift pocket now 20
whole yes are you kidding me oh this is
awesome that's a Brandon article from
2010 it's an HTC you can do pretty much
anything with it I mean these are the
same people that brought us the the HT
too Wow yeah yeah not to mention the the
HTC arrived but it's not the one I'm
thinking of the touch pro 2 with the
full debt it she loves doing this pop-up
screen when it does the side sliding
QWERTYs and when i was a college kid i
was really amped on that yeah it was
like wow i could put this on like you
know the desk in front of me and like
not type like it's a computer but at
least hide my IM conversations from the
professor i really wanted one of those
but they were like 600 bucks on contract
anyway let's move on i was a really
quickly but that was my friend he passed
away but that was his favorite thing
about any smartphone ever was that
tilting screen really I we would get in
these heated debates over my phone's
better we were you know 16 17 and and he
he just pulled his out and he'd flip his
screen up and I'm just like yeah
whatever moving parts trumps everything
that's why I will still if you put if
you have a flip phone with a button with
a push to flip button you win it doesn't
matter what I know there it's awesome
let's talk about Android please because
we we need to move away from windows
phone for the moment so we can get more
done Taylor compared two phablets on
video the LG optimus g pro which we saw
at mwc and the samsung galaxy note 2 the
incumbent the entrenched incumbent my
new favorite compound word of the week
um very curious I I watched the video
just before we came on the air taylor
was i will say this i feel like Taylor
took a took a page from the from the
michael fisher school a book of being
too generous because i always do that I
I frequently will go back and watch my
reviews or whatever like that I'm like
wow you could have docked this another
point-five and that would have been a
lot more accurate but Taylor was very
very fair to the to the optimus g pro
and i guess that's why it's good that
you were in charge of this yeah so yeah
uh I am I momentarily distracted I've
received a text message about our
bandwidth so sorry it's like we run the
podcast and I'm like oh this is great
this is rich sound and stuff and then
all of a sudden we have a bandwidth
constraint but the point is what the
hell's a time oh the point is taylor you
were very generous to the to the optimus
g pro I don't think you were wrong but I
want to I want to hear your thoughts on
this Jeff in general how well it holds
up against the gay to a 10 minute video
doesn't do it justice um and and you
know having the phone for four or five
hours before I start writing the script
it doesn't give me the time to really
really you know get into the meat of it
this is basically a comparison of just
you know almost like first impressions
how the stacks up yeah
s and at first I you know I it's sitting
in the box and I pull it out I'm like
ooh like that's all I think it's hard to
imagine a device that feels lighter
cheaper and and made more poorly than
you know a Samsung device it's not that
they're made poorly but they're made of
pretty cheap materials and it's hard to
imagine something that could be made
more cheaply and the only way to imagine
something like that is getting a phone
like a one of those et easing along with
prepaid phones right and that's kind of
how this thing feels in the hand and at
first it's really off-putting it's
really nasty um because it's it's all
plastic and it's about 10 grams lighter
than the note 2 and you've the white one
yeah yeah yeah yeahs tennis later in the
no.2 and and this is the one with the
battery door which I described at mwc as
as looking like a bathroom tile bathroom
floor in a budget hotel yeah yeah yeah
um yeah and it's got the same plastic
fake metal trim just it's basically a
note to LG style and the thing is that
they didn't do it like optimus G they
did it like they're older like the g2x
like that l9 or something like that yeah
like a cheap plastic remake and I don't
know it's hard to not like it because
they did such a good job on everything
else but it's also hard to look past
that can I talk before we I'm sorry
Taylor before you go on about that I
don't want to lose the thread this is
important you mentioned that you had had
the device for what would you say like
five hours before you wrote the script
yeah if that yeah so when we do
comparisons I want to make this clear
when we do a review we're actually
getting much more in-depth than that the
comparison videos could generally come
first and when they do come first when
we are time constrained when we do want
to get a comparison video out more
quickly than usual listeners what we
will do is if we don't have information
on how a device compares say as in terms
of battery life you won't see it in the
review you'll see welcome pair of specs
will compare milliamp hours basically
we'll compare every
that we are able to compare with the
time that we've spent already and then
we'll follow up with other stuff in the
review so I just want to make it clear
we're not just throwing stuff out
willy-nilly because you know after after
a couple hours with the device we're uh
we ain't doing no early galaxy has full
review or nothing like that yeah so go
ahead no I'm you probably need to ask me
like specific questions because I could
go on all day mmm what do you think to
look I've left dog nerd I don't know
what I am now what is it one of my
nicknames oh oh that's right yes the
talk and talk and talk or fight right
I'm already what do you want to know Jim
I just want to know when I'm gonna get
my hands on it I want one yeah yeah I've
you know i like i like the note 2 i've
seen the note to the note 2 is a big
galaxy s3 i wanted i really want to see
the LG i know it is it is ooh is not a
big galaxy s3 it pretty much is it's
very physically yes it is not in terms
of software and not in terms of the
s-pen I mean well in software it is now
oh my peak updates multi-pane on the s3
now yeah they added pretty much all the
software that the note 2 has except for
the s-pen stuff like the double tap for
us I'm s note and long press with the s
pen for a screenshot so so let me revise
that just to make you have on power my
own it's just a big galaxy s3 with an S
Pen you go alright and a huge battery
and yeah all right all right that's a
big astray that's all it is we're going
to circle back to this in the in Alien
listener mail because you you're making
a good point Joe and with those updates
to software on the galaxy s3 that really
does dilute the difference between these
two as it should that's exactly what
Samsung's trying to do but give me
something different even if they screw
it up give me something different so I
can see how they're screwing it up and
then we can learn from those mistakes
and go forward I don't know that LG
screwing it up I just want to see
something different because I don't need
to have a note too because i had a
galaxy s3 for a few months I know what
it is I know exactly what it is but
without the s pen
which I am a fan of the stylist by the
way so yeah now while we're talking
about the s-pen Taylor will ask you
something specific I guess I mean you
know you touched on it a little bit in
the video but I feel like the S Pen is
is a big value add of the galaxy note 2
when compared to this LG competitor it
is it definitely is um you don't have a
nest or you don't have an S Pen you
don't have a stylus on the lg optimus G
a pro um it's just you you get at large
antenna which is so used which is only
useful for television in Korea so there
are rumors that the international
version and the US version will have a
stylist in lieu of the large antenna but
there yeah that's what I've heard
interesting but while i can while i'm
reviewing this thing i'm totally going
to pull out the antenna before our place
calls in public because it's like it is
literally like a foot long will you
please do that in the coffee shop that
you routinely word from you just you
have fake phone call so at the antenna
okay so i've got some observations on
that yeah first of all i have a couple
different stylee stylized stylist asi's
what how r you pronounce that diversity
is yes that's a yes stylist to seize huh
um there is you can use a stylus on on
the LG not a problem it's just samsung
has built in so much extra stuff to take
advantage and to really make use of that
stylus of their stylist but that just
saying i can buy a stylus for my device
doesn't do it justice so samsung is
getting it right there it's a totally
different stylist that's been is
inductive and it that gives you a lot
more capabilities when you're using it
like to write handwriting or draw or
anything it cuts off capacitive input so
you don't get you don't get like these
marks from your hand and mark from the
stylus Reza normal stylus is just
capacitive it's an extension of your
finger not to mention the digitizer from
wacom yeah go ahead yeah the apps and
the the user interface editions exactly
it's that ecosystem that's the best way
to put it to Michael that we're talking
about
that's not there on really anything else
right now Samsung's got the market and
that's fabulous moving over to that
antenna most people don't know that the
majority I'm not going to say the
majority a good deal of GPS receivers
have FM receivers built into them and as
long as you've got headphones plugged in
you can listen to the radio because that
that antenna that you need for the radio
is the headphones that wire is your
antenna why they didn't do something
like that for the this LG we're talking
about I have no idea I mean wait are you
saying you want it you want a
terrestrial radio antenna for your for
their for the LG fabulous I'm saying the
opposite of that I want to have a TV
tuner that uses my headphone jack and a
plugged into it as the antenna so I
don't look stupid with a big honking
foot long antennae sticking out the top
no I know that there's probably somebody
out there who's much smarter than I am
who's going to say well you can't have
that because it's the propagation of the
the radio waves and the signals for TV
requires a broadband such that half
radios on the back of hurts big wave
subspace propagation John I need some
chocolate pudding yeah but that was
anything that's what I would expect to
see here and really that's kind of cool
as long as you've got the right bands to
be able to watch it in the right places
now of course this is a Korean phone so
it makes sense that it's got the Korean
TV stuff in it but bring it stateside
and let us watch you know digital TV
here that'll be cool and that would be
cool but the reason I kind of gave the
optimus g pro leg up on the the note 2
is in at least form factor in design is
because it's so much narrower it's only
four point four millimeters but it it
makes a difference when you're holding
the device this feels more like the
droid DNA then the in size than the note
2 it's just a lot smaller but it's the
same thickness but it's just narrower
and it's easier to hold one hand
so so that that that's one reason that
gave it you know kind of a plus one in
InDesign okay and it looks like a truer
sixteen by nine letter box layout yeah
there is a very little bezel on the
sides very little less than half on each
side than what the note 2 has that the
downside to this hardware is like LG
just does not do buttons well at all I'm
going to click this you might be able to
hear it oh yeah oh yeah it it's mushy
but it clicks and it's hollow sounding
it feels like okay the only way I can
really explain this is say you get like
a mcdonalds toy yeah with your happy
meal and it has like a push button that
lights something up like I click like it
yeah it just I don't know it feels like
a hollow like mushy like hollow toy
click I will say this i think that there
are a few things more annoying than bad
physical response on a physical and a
hardware button but i will put up with
it if that physical button also includes
a built-in LED yeah and that's one thing
this button does right and has a sweet
multicolor LED below it makes it like
the button right lights up the whole
button all the outside of the name of
the but yeah and can you use light flow
to control that or have you not tried
that yet um they've got built-in
settings for control awaiting who is it
is it like five color or what oh you can
get this see I gotta do just do besides
red and green and so I guess that's what
I wanted yeah yeah it does um does it do
besides ready it was an awesome sentence
does it Davis a thread um yellow blue
white green red think it's pretty much
everything I would buy that phone just
for that I'll of LEDs I love status
lights yeah the button is sweet software
it's pretty bad it's heavy and and very
customized the settings page the
settings app is tabulated yet tabbed and
stabbed yeah that's hella do it house
but it but the responsiveness has got to
be amazing though I mean response but
the screen I swear it
picks up my finger before I touch it oh
it might because the Lumia 920 does it
yeah I don't touch it sometimes and it
selects things so you adjust the screen
sensitivity here now I don't know I
haven't been able to look that up yet mm
so did they fix the problem that some
people reported with the nexus 4 where
you touch the screen and it's off by a
dozen pixels or so I haven't I haven't
had that problem on mine for my eye for
eye I've only run into it very very
infrequently and usually when playing
ingress but I just some people note it
more than others not to mention any
names brandon but which brandon was on
the podcast yeah nothing on here for
adjusting sensitivity okay what we do
have to move on from this at some point
so I want to say that we are we do have
a review coming from you on this but not
until next week is that correct oh
that's pending I don't know when but you
actually yeah I might know I don't want
to pin you down to next week not until
later it's going to be monday in the
morning and everyone can set their
watches there will be something monday
in the morning maybe I don't know it's
know it is there it won't be monday
morning it'll be tuesday oh I mean well
I mean well there will also be something
monday oh yeah it's gonna be like skulls
and stuff not from you to it yet though
there's gonna be some it's gonna be a
very busy week next week not from you
back in your cage jacket you Wow oh go
ahead I was just gonna say last thing
I'm performing wise and synthetic
benchmarks the optimus g pro blows the
note 2 out of the water but in
side-by-side performance they are neck
and neck so there's that we've hit our
plateau gentlemen yes yes welcome to the
deepest benchmark era it hit 20,000 n22
and 12,000 in quadrant standard quack
Wow geekbench on it or have it written
all of them I just kind of did you know
a couple more the comparison the note to
got 6,000 in quadrant standard so half
that of the optimus g pro and and 22 i
think it get like 15 or 16 thousand so
it's a big difference in benchmarks but
in day-to-day performance you don't see
any sort of difference whatsoever but
neither of them lag i have recently
found a game that makes me care about
benchmarks all of a sudden because it is
very graphically intensive it's called
like sky defenders it's only for iOS
it's an aerial combat game and it's
amazing I gamblers sky gamblers that's
what it is doing us do you like sky cam
blurs you do you play it I have yes oh
man let's play cuz it allows multiplayer
it's it's like the most in-depth
ipad-based or ios-based flight simulator
I've ever seen you can play it from your
macbook to why are you serious waiting
can you plug into USB joystick I play it
I don't know oh my god if that is the
case you will not see me again I'll just
glue recede into my game cave which I
don't even have but I will build a game
he will make a gift if I can use a
joystick with a flight simulator you've
got my god all right listen we are all
right so thanks for joining us for the
podcast Michael's gonna go phillies an
example whatever understand really nice
all of you Joe you got the ship let's
talk about or do Rosen's please cuz you
know i do want to have you talk for a
second row because I Joe wrote a piece
which was really cool and really aptly
titled called what you need to know
about Android Trojans and it wasn't
until just now that I thought of the
concept of an Android Trojan horse which
would be really interesting and not like
a computer code but like you know it an
actual robot horse but I want to know
about this because I've been running
naked on all my android devices for a
long time IIIi don't use a virus scan or
anything like that and I find a lot of a
lot to be suspicious about in terms of
those security programs that often come
pre-installed on Android devices from
carriers and blah blah blah blah blah
and I want to know how much danger you
think I'm in Joe and I want you to talk
about your piece and I want you to talk
about how you got an animated graphic in
the middle of you
peace which is pretty cool but so to
answer that one really quick that's
called a gif some people pronounce it
jiff and you can animate those oh and
it's huge it's just so animated so it's
like a bitmap then yes but it moves do
you know what movie that came from by
the way what the too many secrets let's
see tech is strongly too many secrets
cooties rat no but I love that you're
like throwing in random jokes that
nobody gets like i like i do i was a
Robert Redford movie how can you not
know it I don't know ever seen a Robert
Redford film in my life oh my goodness I
know I know right she owns the city here
in Utah so I guess I have to know him
yes Sundance Utah folks if you've never
been there it's a beautiful place with
the honey what this is sneakers where
they are and see how you know word of
sneakers I haven't yes I'm so bad pop
culture so they're trying to figure out
what this c-tec astronomy means and they
get the what does that scrabble letters
out there's badly arranging out and they
have the cooties rat something else we
want to keep this PG so we won't go
there and too many secrets is that's
what it turns out to be that's what
anyway uh obscure movie references aside
yes back on point yes there are viruses
yes there are Odin's yes there's malware
adware ransomware all kinds of stuff
that exists everywhere including Windows
Phone and iOS and yes even Android we
are not alone then the article kind of
goes into that a little bit it goes into
some ways that you know what a what a
Trojan horse is could including history
we talked about the Trojan War the Greek
and Trojan War it's the first time I've
ever written about that outside of like
junior high so that was fun but very
very short Trojan horses are when we're
talking computers all the way back to
the very early days of computers it's
basically a program that you invite into
your your environment your operating
system whatever it may be whether that's
through a document a disk USB Drive a
program whatever
maybe that has an unintended payload and
that payload can do any number of things
it gets kind of confusing when you're
talking about you know computer malware
that's kind of the generic term these
days or in law they are calling that a
computer contaminant now whoa yeah I
that this might be the first contaminant
ever had the words payload and
contaminants on the air that was awesome
let's talk about space and subspace
distortions yes facial torsion facial
distortions but essentially what happens
is there's something inside this program
that you think you want that does
something that you didn't really want
today that usually is stealing
information and reporting it back to a
third party over the internet because
we're always connected today which we
weren't in the past or making text
messages to premium services using your
number which cost you lots of money very
fast and probably the most insidious one
is being able to steal enough
information from the hardware of your
device to clone your sim and then
intercept your your text messages your
mms make phone calls as if it were you
just anywhere in the world which can
then of course incur some significant
costs in international roaming and
whatnot so not good the article goes
into how how you can protect yourself
that's number one that's probably the
most important thing to do but also some
things that Google is trying to do that
their competitors aren't and how the
fact that apps that are in Google's Play
Store that aren't quote-unquote reviewed
before that there before they're
submitted and added to the catalog
aren't a problem or that that's not a
big deal most people think that the
review process for both windows phone
and iOS apps will cover them and will
make sure that all of the apps are nice
and clean and aren't doing anything they
shouldn't be doing that's not a case at
all of us false sense of security it is
it is exactly a false sense of security
they are not doing a code review at all
they're doing a does this fit within our
style guidelines review is this causing
undue taxes on the the processor on the
RAM by slowing things down and it is
this a nudity and most importantly is
this doing anything that we should be
getting money for like being able to buy
stuff inside the app so they're
protecting them not you when they're
doing it to your point sorry you're
saying that when I whenever I ignore
whenever ignored these permissions and
I'm just want to install an app real
quick and it's like this happens the
following permissions and I'm like yeah
whatever whatever whatever right I'm
putting myself in danger yes in fact i'm
not aware that the Windows Phone or iOS
does that I mean correct me if I'm wrong
here guys do they expose what
permissions that app needs not beyond
run not on Windows Phone as far as I am
recalling I don't have my lumia next to
me so I can't confirm that right now but
I've never been presented with a
permissions list I don't think you know
so chuckling those either so something
android does that the other guys either
don't do or don't do well enough because
nobody knows about it is they tell you
every single thing that that app is
getting permissions to keep that who
gives them the permissions the person
who's installing it if you don't like it
if you are editing about it don't
install it keep talking I'm going to get
my lumia keep talking guys because I'm
gonna figure this i'm not i'm not gonna
incur the wrath you just went on
Immunization in the comments yeah I
thought I happened I thought I had
fallen victim to some sort of hack or
something at one point it was a few
weeks ago everyone who was calling me
was getting answers from some other
random guy across the United States I
don't know where he lived but they were
getting there when they called me he was
answering and if I would send a text
message when they replied he would text
them back and it took me forever I just
they were getting random stuff from this
guy and I had no idea who he was and if
i texted him or anything all the texts
just came to me he wouldn't answer and
I'm just thinking when the war
like how how is this possible and it
took me months to figure out that I had
actually logged into google voice from a
review device and somehow added that
number to my account so all of my text
messages and calls were being forwarded
forwarded to his number which was a
recycled PR number yes I've had that as
well as if I was on the opposite end of
that someone else had that that review
number before I had and so I was getting
all of their stuff I may have been that
guy so it was awkward i was getting this
lady's kids trying to get ahold of her
for whatever else she was like a mommy
blogger so i was able to track her down
and actually call her have a nice
conversation with her you know here's
this strange guy calling out of the blue
from many states away and we just had a
nice little conversation it was kind of
fun okay yeah Mike like that numbers
yeah I code numbers are a terrible
terrible thing yeah and there's really
no way around that until we get to the
the post phone number world well not
even that but if we can get to a
personal phone number and that's what i
think google voice going way off topic
here google voice is a very good thing
just for that because i have complete
control over that number until google
says i don't and it's one number if i
change to a different provider if i move
to a different country I just update my
google voice and it done I don't win
used to know using google voice since
2009 and you are absolutely right about
that it is very convenient as long as
you don't want to get picture messages
but that is even further off topic
that's what emails were and that can do
that if they're being sent to or from
sprint you know yet no no it is
technically possible it is in practice
it completely unreliable I routinely get
picture messages like two weeks later i
get i get non it anyway let's not talk
about google voice when you guys are
tightly when you are on a yeah keep
right first of all just realized that my
sim tray is out of my lumia which is
annoying i should go find that now that
would be a good thing yeah lose that and
you're gonna add a lot and screwed so i
have found the windows phone store on my
device i have loaded an app called TOS
calm which is pretty cool looks like
communicator Star Trek communicator for
windows phone you should look at my
communicator review that much play it
was awesome thank you so on the detail
screen we have the size of the app the
rating one screenshot a small
description from the from the dev you
can report our concern to Microsoft you
can learn the publisher when it was last
updated the version number and you can
see more from that publisher there are
supported languages English okay and
then right under that it says requires
data services movement and directional
sensor so I guess it does tell you to a
degree it doesn't break it down like
android does in a bulleted list of like
what the app can do it just has a small
little line of text there that just
requires its it it probably should be
called out a little bit more because I
was already to say it doesn't say that
at all but yeah it's it's oh yeah i
don't think i was now that underscores
the point if even if it is there if it's
not if it's not prominent yeah if it's
not advertised as it were and this it
doesn't do anything small you're talking
about before it was regard to the modern
design language like it's beautiful and
i love it and it's minimalistic and
that's what all the reasons i love it
but it also is not terribly conducive to
getting you information quickly you know
yeah because the minute you bold
something or italicized something or
whatever you're basically a lot of the
time you're breaking the rules of that
design language because it looks worse
but it also looks different and that's
what your eyeball is drawn to yeah own
on iOS the only thing even remotely
similar to that you get requires and
then it tells you system requirements
and that's it there's nothing that tells
you what what it needs to what needs
control of so to contrast that for
Android when you're looking at something
in the Play Store you're not told when
you're looking at the app what it
requires so you have to instead download
it and as soon as it's downloaded in on
your machine not installed yet it will
then tell you what permissions you need
to grant that app before you install it
sometimes people just overlooked it but
the the newer versions of jelly bean and
I forget if it was in original jelly
bean or jelly bean The Revenge if but
they're now exposing that even more to
let you know which ones could cost you
money so if right you know if it has
permission to send text messages it'll
tell you that and you then as an end
user decide whether or not you want to
install it so going to my article and
the section how can you stay safe
Michael read the permissions hmm look at
them that is what you are telling it oh
no it's okay if you do that so really if
if you get a you know cell phone bill
for a thousand dollars because you
didn't read the permissions if I'm
working for that carrier I'm going to
tell you too bad you said that it could
do that you should have known better
this is your this is your learning cost
you know you go to college you pay for a
course in college it's going to cost you
a lot of money well here's your
education it just cost you a thousand
dollars right and that's probably taking
to heart of a stance but you know you
said it was okay be aware coming from a
father who I've actually been on the
other side of that conversation and had
a kid by two hundred dollars worth of
stuff for his virtual aquarium before so
yeah put a pin on if you're going to let
your kids borrow your device's anyway
next is check the reviews so before you
download it before in a while you're
looking at it saying hey that's a really
cool-looking app what do other people
say about it how many stars do they have
absolutely do that either you've got
people saying this is bad it does icky
stuff you probably don't want to install
it and then avoid shady apps all
together and a self explanatory like you
have to have a certain degree of like of
of what's the word you know not panache
but like a world you know world
sensitive street smarts you need to be
able to look at a nap I Connor be like
that is either ripped off or it's lame
or why is this a pixelated version of
what it should be yeah yeah yeah shady
apps are pretty easy to spot if you're
not
Leslie what why is this facebook app
read right you know yeah yeah even that
you know that's that's kind of a clone
of a nap or a fake app or whatever you
want to call in fact I talked about one
of those called fake Netflix I don't
know a nice alysha's copy of the netflix
app this was just used to steal your
netflix account information I don't know
so that these could watch sneakers I
guess I don't know what that's available
for streaming or not anyway the shady
apps that I'm talking about is hey you
want to be able to break into your
neighbor's Wi-Fi so you're going out
trying to find a a Wi-Fi network hacker
whatnot first of all that's not going to
be in the market very long you're going
to have to get it elsewhere but the same
permission screen that you get from apps
installed from the market you're going
to get from apps installed from a
third-party market or side loaded on
your device as well one major advantage
to Android there but I go into and I'm
just going to read this it's very short
there's no such thing as a free lunch
and an app that seems too good to be
true probably is apps that imply they
can enable you to do illegal immoral or
unethical things should be avoided not
because the type of activity that they
allegedly enable after all who might
have step on your values or your belief
systems but because the quote-unquote
bad guys often prey on the type of user
that installs this sort of software by
including malicious code in them that's
right do not be a dirtbag because you
will get dirt bags taken advantage of
you exactly so that goes back to our pre
podcast conversation Michael that's my
libertarian views Who am I to step on
your values or belief systems just be
aware those kind of people might put in
something that you don't want in there
so just be smart like your Wi-Fi kill up
yeah just skeptical that thing to close
this out to do i need a virus scanner on
my phone Joe long story short no great
so there you go now let's go expand on
that most virus scanners include stuff
that will give you heads up about weird
stuff that's happening look out as one
of my favorite I'm not so for
endorsing them but I have it installed
on all of my devices it lets me find my
devices when they're lost it lets me
send out a signal flare when the
battery's running dead so it can tell me
the last place that I was before I died
was here combined me that's cool it'll
take pictures of whoever's trying to
unlock your device and email them to you
so you can know maybe that's the maybe
just record them but yeah so if you've
got somebody trying to hack into your
device whether it's a kid or whether
it's you know roommate or some guy at a
bar you'll have pictures taken of them
so you'll know who it is and then you
can turn them in to authorities the
parts on device they're sent off the
device so all kinds of cool one thing
that linkedin linkedin one thing that
look out does that others don't is they
will monitor phone calls from apps and
from websites and let you send them
through instead of the dialer it'll let
you send them through look out to make
sure that that number isn't on their
list of known malicious numbers and it
will allow you to intercept them before
it goes to the dialer app itself so neat
features and functionalities there look
out cool AB you know it's it's great now
that one is free and remember what I
just said about a free app there's no
such thing as a free lunch exactly this
one is freemium meaning they give you
the base set for free but then there are
additional features and functionalities
that you can enable through purchasing a
subscription so and whether or not you
want to do that it's up to you i haven't
the base version does everything that i
needed to i got some i got some advice
at my college graduation party from a
family friend is this kind of older guy
who's really cool but he was you know
trying to give me some advice he was
like now remember you know there's you
know you're grown up now this is no more
free lunch not not that you were not
that you were getting a free lunch but
you know what i mean like yet yes i
think I'd know i don't but thank you I
get that just because I don't want to
hear you try and explain it in right
anyway um let's let's let's move on a
little bit Joe I love it when you write
pieces like that there are I I think
frequently we users have very
straightforward questions that are like
how afraid should
I be to do this and you're instructive
articles help us answer those questions
so I'm glad if I help just one person
not get infected then I my job is done
I've and your job is done well we'll see
you we'll see you next year all right i
want to say briefly that there's been an
HTC one spotted with a removable back
cover and microsd support oh my god that
is for china so that click on food yeah
oh my grub worms yet there is a little
bit like you get really amped on this
then you look at the picture of it and
you're like oh wait the battery is still
integrated so this is only half cool but
the microsd support is the important
part the other important part is dual
sim support which leads to the third
important part which i already said this
is for china so if you're in china get
excited if you're not sad face then
salivate over here Chinese friends
exactly yeah you know it doesn't matter
i know we were not going to talk too
much about the one right now but i want
to say that in my time with the one I
have found the lack of a removable
battery to be acceptable micro sd's of a
little bit harder a pill to swallow but
but yeah 32 gigabytes 32 gigawatts yeah
no it's enough for me this is running
Android yes no no an iOS device no alive
well HTC has some ones or I don't know
some numbers that run Windows Phone so
and this kind of has the windows phony
look to it so right I'm wondering the
article doesn't really I assume it's
Android because I don't think you can
add so i massaged I'm sorry I didn't
mean I thought you were talking about
the one other your time the HTC one is
an android phone yes it's an android
phone I don't know though the 180 to w8
o2w yes I'm sorry um the W kind of
implies windows I don't know or maybe it
implies wcdma
that's a good question that my I'm not
seeing anything in the article I would
assume that this is a an android-powered
device just because of the supplemental
stitch but yeah plus and plus it is it
is like an HTC One like I mean them you
know there's the noise cancelling mic
there's that yeah I like it the hardware
is identical so it's ya know I think
that w is for wcdma but that's a cool
piece of speculation you had their first
right I removable storage on any OS is a
good thing if that were up windows for
iftar Wow HTC one with Windows Phone new
yeah mmm oh I'm sorry I'm just saying
it's between HTC and a bunch of numbers
at the end no no no how do I rushed the
premium the initial like I say I didn't
know I should have even said the number
when I announced it to ya 8 or 2w yeah
yeah yeah good good thing in there Joe
can we break from years of qwerty typing
I don't know just Taylor Martin no um
using 8 pin in its current form no
Taylor there I watched your video to two
nights ago listeners if you haven't
watched this video you owe it to
yourself to watch this weird weird
experiment eight pin is the weirdest
keyboard I've ever seen in my life and
using it you know normally you see
something like that you're like wow
that's got to be so intuitive like no
one would ever use that so it's got to
be so good but like watching you write
the letter A by like moving your finger
in a convoluted looping pattern crossing
three sectors of that keyboard I was
like forget it I'm done never again
house what good what's going on with
this big okay you're relieved to be done
yes what you relieved to be done you use
this for what a week yeah well about a
week and a half um yeah it was done I
had decided to do it after writing her
after making a video about Android
keyboards mm-hmm and it's I wasn't new
to this keyboard I'd used it before but
they changed the layout and it's
actually not so bad now I'm now typing
long word
and long sentences long paragraphs are
kind of annoying but it's not so bad
it's a it's annoying but you have to
learn the layout that's yes yes learn
where every letter is and having to do
that is like I don't know pulling teeth
for some people but I sat down and I
learned the layout within a few hours
and there are some letters that you
don't use often those I would stumble on
still even now but after you figure it
out you can kind of just loop your
finger around and type pretty quickly
it's hard to do it on this video because
one i didn't know what i was typing and
to you know reaching around a camera or
reaching over and up over a table so it
was a little awkward to shoot the video
that I struggled with it but um there's
a science behind it and the guys who
created a pin they said basically if you
give someone a sheet of paper small
square and say draw a continuous line
most people will make figure eights and
it all comes back to the center which is
the reason that there's a circle in the
middle they said that's a hot spot where
people will always come back and then
you have loops stemming from that Circle
Circle in every direction okay they said
the most natural way to write anything
is with a pen and paper and you can't
really do that so if you were given a
pen and paper about the size of where
you would be writing on a smartphone and
told to draw a continuous line that's
basically what you come up with and the
old layout was a beast was just straight
through the alphabet ABCD efg hijk you
know all the way around and doing that
you would end up having to stop and go
backwards it was like it was like using
a rotary dial phone um people keep
saying that about this one and it's not
so much the same it's learning different
loops so the a is you come out from the
middle to the right go up cross a line
come back to the middle and what you
think about it as all I need across two
lines three 9s and then you memorize all
these loops it gets to be pretty easy to
use I could I get to the point where I
could type with one thumb and not look I
could type right that's that's a pretty
yeah
that is in garrison now granted that was
after a week of just me using this and
and I had to really really try and learn
it but that was kind of the point we've
all used QWERTY keyboards from birth
every single one is we i mean every
keyboard now the qwerty the courts all
of those are based on typewriters which
are from 1860 i believe ya think i
looked it up so it's an old technology
and i still have a hard time believing
that nothing could be better than
something that was designed in 1860 okay
I have to stop right there and throw in
some completely random but relevant
information yeah the qwerty layout that
we use today that we've used for the
last hundred plus years was not the
initial layout on typewriters yeah the
initial layout was closer to what we now
know as Dvorak I've heard people say
that it was Dvorak I've heard people say
that it was similar to Dvorak so go to
your own research on that to find out a
lot of research went into that initial
keyboard layout to find out what would
be the most efficient layout so that you
could type words quickly and it was so
unusual and sonu of a concept to be able
to push buttons to make text appear on a
page that it took a while for people who
get really fast at it but eventually
people did especially the the office
workers who were predominantly female
they got so fast at typing on these
typewriters of the day that they were
faster than the mechanical mechanisms
inside them all right and would cause
that cause all the keys to jam up and
all kinds of stuff and they'd have to
stop have down time while they brought
somebody out to fix it and put the keys
and all the mechanisms back in place so
the qwerty layout was designed and all
the keys were relayed out to
deliberately slow down these people by
making the layout of the keys
inefficient so that they wouldn't break
past the speed at which the mechanism
could actually work to fire that
that letter onto the page which asked
forward to today we don't have that
problem anymore but we're still using
that that known and proven in efficient
layout for all of our typing if we were
to go back to a more efficient layout
like Dvorak or like whatever they had in
the olden days we'd be significantly
faster at typing but we don't use that
and it's interesting to me that we don't
have that even on our smartphones yeah
we would have to relearn it that we've
letting it and that relearn it and
that's what you're doing have them
that's what I was trying to do is to get
out of the concept of the mindset of
typing on a qwerty keyboard and and I'm
not saying that qwerty was designed way
back then in 1860s or whatever that's
not what I was saying I'm talking about
you know the alphabet on a square
pattern that you have to you know what
I'm saying the actual keys on a on a
plane Ford keys on a board yeah I mean
yeah but the point was you know can we
type on something that is not the
standard typical traditional layout and
it was tough there was a really steep
learning curve but you know I could use
8 pin and not pull my hair out after a
week you know so anyways be going to be
crazy and and most people probably
wouldn't get the whole gist of it why
would he even care but you know I kind
of wanted to do it to give 8-pin a
chance talked to the CEO and he said
there's a big update coming out and two
things that this keyboard would need for
me to actually want to use it full time
is prediction software like you haven't
slike a swipe or swiftkey or even the
stock android keyboard keyboard yep um
and a shift key there is no shift key so
you can't capitalize stuff you have to
make an entire loop around the keyboard
and then pick your letter I'll bullying
shift and I ya know so first like if I
wanted to type I don't know in all caps
every letter you have to make a loop
around the keyboard and they pick your
letter so some like if you
into type of W I had to make two loops
around the keyboard to type of your one
letter one letter might know this is you
know there's enough in efficiencies that
yeah but if you had word prediction in
there you would type one or two letters
and it would go being ordered yeah and
that's how I type with swiftkey I type
one or two letters and it generally pics
my next word for me are you kids in your
swiftkey I like my old crusty
inefficient stock keyboard but yet the
idea is not for me to say hey will 8pm
be the keyboard of the future now I
think so probably not but the fact that
these guys are thinking outside the box
is what drew me to the keyboard in the
first place it is it's impressive and in
the science behind the read about the
science behind if you go to their
website is bizarre it's crazy bum I mean
they beheld a chili it's 8-pin calm 8
pin number 8 PP en or p.i.m.p and utah
we pronounce a 10 yeah I know I've got a
lot of flak of that no no its work we
live in different parts at Tony would
pronounce it differently because he
lives way over there yeah so eight pen
is how its airliner and super carolina p
en and he IM are pronounced exactly this
is exactly the same do it dude you gotta
get that ate panda yeah yeah but there
are lastly there are a couple other
keyboards and some people in the
comments brought some out to me and I
may do another one of these experiments
with different keyboards one I will most
definitely do is minimum it's not out
yet it's they're seeking backing on
IndieGoGo and they've already exceeded
their their goal it's it shrinks the
qwerty layout into a single line that's
what I told you about yeah yeah minimum
and you don't have to be accurate you're
just gonna tap around the letter you
want and it'll they'll oughta grow out
what you want yeah and then there's
another called snap keys I think yeah
evolve like snap peas is the really
well-known one yeah and I tried to type
on that for a few minutes and wanted to
punch myself in the face is that who
blackberry partnered with to make their
keyboard
I don't know but good no because they
did they partnered with a width and with
a keyboard maker to make their new
software keyboard no I'm probably asking
stupid cuz it's probably somebody else
and I can't look it up right now we are
we are we are really short on time yeah
and the last one is message ease which I
use that in the past and it's okay but
yeah I plan on keeping my eye on a pen
and other keyboard makers we appreciate
your sacrifice yeah and if you guys come
across a you guys meeting our audience
if you come across a keyboard that we
haven't talked about or just got a major
update let us know we love doing these
kinds of experiments and putting
ourselves through this pain so you don't
have to send that to Joe Joe Joe at Joe
at pocket I was thinking Baylor in this
maybe I'll use swiftkey tilt for a week
next no I want to use well in as joe and
i know on the on the starships of the
24th century people can type entire
phrases with just like eight keys that
all have numbers on them so you know
there's infinite diversity that the
learning curve for that keyboard is
amazing yeah I find just while we're on
this I find myself using the google
voice keyboard more than almost any
kinds of his voice to text dictation
yeah so I just I hit that microphone
button on my keyboard and I just dictate
it out and I sense it's right nine out
of ten times Oh hooray ! I've been
looking forward to getting lunch there
comma but I ever had the opportunity
period smiley face yeah Michael and I
both did a week-long challenge oh that's
right yeah I was a phone dog and I did a
week-long challenge where I use nothing
but dictation on all of my phones yeah I
think I did it over a weekend I think
you had me beat in the duration on and
the timing no I did and the time I shut
up alright listeners Apple has talked
about really quickly iOS 7 is running
late is the rumor Apple is using and
there's another rumor in the same
article from Jaime from yesterday apples
using OS 10 9 developers to speed it
this is not unprecedented apple has
cannibalized from itself before to get
OS
out the door specifically the first time
they released the iphone in 2007 I
wouldn't be surprised if everything
we're hearing about iOS 7 is the truth
that it is a kind of a different animal
I wouldn't be surprised that Apple was
kind of you know cannibalizing internal
resources to to get it done and a
commenter has a really oppression thing
and says this supports my long-held
theory that Apple well no longer cares
about OS 10 I wouldn't go that far but I
think that the the future of Apple is
definitely more in iOS than OS 10 what
do you guys think you think this is
likely to be true or what well wasn't
there another rumor saying that the
production was scheduled to start this
summer or before the summer like in the
next month or so for the next devices
hardware production yeah yeah probably
was it part of that Steve Jobs article
that the iphones donna is still yeah
yeah yeah yeah no I mean don't know this
this particular thing the software I
mean makes all the sense in the world to
me yeah they need something major they
really do and I hope that this is
indication that they're doing something
major yeah I'm not holding my breath
though it well and the fact that it's
allegedly delayed and they're pulling in
resources from another development team
that that lends to the theory that it's
getting a major overhaul and that
overhaul they're going to invest more
time in getting it right so anybody
who's upset that it's being delayed
don't they're they're taking the time
that they need you're going to get a
better product because of it so keep
that in mind it's hard to be patient but
keep that in mind the second thing with
with cannibalizing desktop OS developers
to help them with their mobile OS from
me being a developer for my day job that
I think is a very very good thing
because you get a fresh perspective you
get people who are coming from an
entirely different user interface
metaphor over into this this very
mobile-centric thing and a lot of their
bias and Prejudice is going to come
along with them which means we're going
to potentially have more abilities for
our mobile
devices to act like to behave like to
mimic desktop and laptop type
functionality yeah so you you it's a
two-edged sword because they could screw
everything up that they've already
established and done right in mobile but
on the other side they could push this
mobile OS out of the mobile ecosystem
into more of desktop stuff and open that
up to some of the desktop apps that
haven't made it over to to iOS yet to
make them easier to to run and to use on
mobile devices and once we get up to 2
iPad sighs come on that's a tablet
without a keyboard so right or a laptop
without a keyboard so it's fun makes
sense it's funny we condemn windows for
potentially making a Windows 8 Phone you
know converging totally converging
mobile in and PC but yet that's what we
asked for an iOS well it's kind of a
slider all right well no the points the
points well made but Apple is kind of
doing this from the let's take a OS and
make it our omnipresent operating system
let's make it do everything whereas
Microsoft is kind of approaching it the
other way they're saying let's take the
mobile UI and put it on everything but
take the desktop OS and eventually get
that down to everything so they're
approaching it from both sides and it is
sloppy it's there's lots of weird stuff
going on and it's not consistent between
the three and it's it somewhat argue nor
should it be but the way the way Apple
is doing it they're they're starting
from one platform and they're building
out a Microsoft is starting from two and
building in and we're yeah it's weird
that's the best way to put it it's just
the definition of weird I like that I
like that headline but it takes a lot of
work to take all the shanty 3d effects
off all the interface elements on iOS
apparently she
is it that's pretty much what i'm
expecting is i'm expecting that to a
flatter just a flatter interface and no
more good no more water skeuomorphism
takes a backseat to you know you type in
it's like a good thing great thing i bet
they they introduce a doc like a
different doc paradigm to like a bit
more of a desktop thing i would really
love the ability to say hover a finger
or perform a gesture that would reveal
the doc on the home screen like I do on
OS 10 or just bring the mouse pointer
down and and the doc reveals itself all
I'm thinking when i hear that is the
webos sure i wouldn't wanna yeah now you
can get that get that on android by the
way yeah i know i was just thinking
about that last night like when when
everyone started poaching webos features
after the after the big collapse and i
was everyone's like you should be
excited you got cards on your HTC
android phones down like yeah it's not
the same dude no way to work homework
for all of our listeners out of the wave
launcher to you have seen that yeah yeah
what go ahead you so the name of the
article that we're talking about is iOS
7 running late comma Apple using OS 10.9
developers to speed it by Jaime
published this morning is that right nay
prepare yesterday morning so your
homework is to go out to that article
it's still relevant it's got relatively
few comments on it right now what I want
to hear from you our listeners is what
could a pelu in iOS to bring in some of
the gestures and some of the other
things that we're seeing in sailfish in
ubuntu phone and what not what should
they do it and how could they do it to
make it uniquely Apple to expose
whatever you think it should be the dock
or running apps or notifications or what
could they do to change it using
gestures that's your homework go nice
mr. Levi has spoken I like it he's given
us some parenting tips and now homework
from the from the classroom I like it
let's let's jump at a listener mail so
we can go this is robert hansen has
written to us with a really cool thing
jumping back in
android very briefly with something
we've talked about before hi everyone he
sells recently read about the samsung
galaxy mega 5.8 and 6.3 and i do not
know if i should laugh or cry this is a
madness but not because i don't like big
phones i own a note to myself but
because there's no clear distinction
between samsung devices anymore they all
have the same design and all have the
same functionality why do you think
Samsung is trying to fulfill everyone's
wishes because this is just confusing
and it's getting problematic do you
think there's a strategy or do you think
Samsung is trying too hard yes I is my
answer because I'm speechless he says
love your podcast look forward listening
to it every thursday give the good work
regards Robert Robert thank you for
listening this is a solid question we
have talked about the dilution of the
galaxy brand before we talked about it a
little earlier in the podcast in my I
will answer first very briefly and I'll
let you guys go to it I think Samsung is
absolutely does have a strategy but they
are very very concerned with uniformity
across their galaxy lineup and we can
see this in the forthcoming note 8 and
the galaxy s3 all the galaxy products
goes you know they all look the same I
think Samsung sees this as an advantage
because they are for some reason still
thinking like they're a young small
company trying to break in when in fact
they're already dominating so I cannot
understand the strategy but I think it
does exist I think it's also very boring
and very confusing so I agree with you
Roberts what do you guys think Taylor um
I think it's kind of the mantra that if
you throw enough things at the wall
something is going to stick but on a
higher level you know if we throw 50
different phones at a wall which ones
are going to stick and then they just
keep producing those you know this
galaxy mega will probably never see
anything else from it again you know if
it comes out if the 5.8 and 6.3 come out
okay so 5.8 sticks and 6.3 doesn't we'll
see maybe a galaxy mega 5.8 too but we
won't see the 6.3 or something i don't
know but um it's kind of ridiculous but
i think there
implementing a kind of a more PC centric
mindset laptops or they make a 14-inch
15-inch 16-inch you know all these
different ones just for everyone I don't
think it's necessary for devices so
small especially when you're talking
about a point three inch difference in
screen size between the galaxy mega 5.8
and galaxy note 2 55 yeah yeah it I
don't know I think they're just that
they want a competitor out there for
every phone like there is the 6.3 it
would be I guess 6.1 mate would be its
its competitor they want something out
there they want something out there to
compete with every other device out
there they want to own the market and I
don't necessarily agree with it but it's
working for them and if I was making as
much money as anyone who worked as an
executive in samsung I would be doing
the exact same thing so hmmm different
perspective your thoughts Joe so that
the word in that email that stuck out to
me it was strategy and I'm going to bias
my response with my developer background
again I see Samsung rolling out a lot of
different devices but all of them are
starting to have the same set of tools
utilities user interfaces and features
that aren't on their competitor devices
whether that's the s-pen whether that's
their smart stay and other stuff that
they're doing with the camera all of
these things it's it's a suite of
functions and functionality that Samsung
is using to differentiate their products
they're not ubiquitous across all of
their product offering yet but it is
becoming so once they have thoroughly
vetted out all of the features to find
out what people like what people don't
and then they can invest their time in
the ones that people really want and
kind of let the other ones just stagnate
at that point they will have made their
own separate niche their own separate
branch of Android
that at that point they can start
improving that core and all they've got
to do is write drivers and whatnot for
new hardware that that will then fit
upon and the the different sizes the
different specifications could be their
way of vetting out what the requirements
are what the system requirements are to
run those features and functionalities
properly and how to scale them to two
different sized screens different
resolutions and whatnot so I'm thinking
they've got kind of a cyanogenmod thing
going on where there is one core set of
features that is cyanogenmod and then
all you need is this vendor overlay to
support all kinds of different devices
as soon as a new feature is added or
changed or updated or whatnot to the
core it gets pushed out to you know to
github and everybody can check it out
and apply their vendor overlay and bam
there's a new update for the device it's
fast it's smooth its fluid it's
efficient Samsung's not there yet but
something to give that Falana to me
makes sense I don't know about you guys
but to me that makes sense something
that gives that credence and credibility
is cyanogen himself works for samsung
not anymore not oft okay worked perhaps
on end and maybe left some of that
vision behind where did he go he quit a
few weeks ago really wow I just hadn't I
just had to oh wow moments because I
never knew that the guy behind cyanogen
worked for samsung and I also never knew
he quit Steve Kondik he's an amazing guy
if you ever get a chance to talk to him
I've only had like two minutes of
conversation time with him but wow that
guy he's beyond words I think I got to
install cyanogenmod on a device more
than once before I do that well the nice
thing is it's if you if you're running
cyanogenmod 10.1 on any one device yeah
you know exactly what it is how it does
what the features and functionalities
are on any other device running
cyanogenmod 10.1 regard
the manufacturer it's kinda like a match
and very much so but Rana CLE but
imagine being able to do that across
your entire product offering if your
Samsung yeah so now everything is the
same it doesn't matter if you've got a
you know a mini galaxy or a maxi galaxy
or a mega galaxies they're all the same
they just scale to to take advantage of
the real estate and what's on that
device and they don't have to cook up
new versions of the entire rom all they
got to do is cook up new versions of the
top layer and new versions of the bottom
layer and then they can just intermix
and intermingle and push updates much
faster oh yeah hopefully I like it
that's a theory we haven't seen faster
oh yes it enables that that metaphor
right but whether or not they take
advantage of it remains to be seen they
probably didn't even realize that right
now just throwing things at a wall man
hey Sam's into the wall if you need a
consultant I think Brandon would be okay
with me providing some consulting hours
to you to help bootstraps happen there
it is one of the offers miele million
dollars right in there you got all the
Terry years where we're pushing the
longest podcast ever so let's think
we're gonna close it out and we all have
to get to this face circuit event that
