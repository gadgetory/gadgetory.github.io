and we're here with a the t-mobile
version of the HTC touch pro2 and we're
going to take a look at the hardware
tour so first off let's look at top up
here we've got the speaker grill and a
tmobile logo HTC logo you've got a
little LED indicator and a light sensor
here and somewhere over here is a
proximity sensor and we have our three
point six inch screen the bottom we have
a slider where you can touch to zoom in
the photos or opera mobile and here we
have some hardware buttons and got the
call and back home call send kind kind
of wish the home was the start menu key
like on the european version of the
touch pro two this just goes to the
regular touchflo home screen which is
and rather go to the programs but none
of them are customizable except for the
call send as it has a customizable hold
so if i hold it down i can launch a
program of my choosing in the buttons
control panel on the side over here we
have volume up and down it looks a
little bit different than the you know
european version we have a micro SD slot
but unfortunately it's really hard to
open without getting the battery cover
off first I'll show you how that works
some inning the bottom we have the HTC
extended USB port for headphones and USB
charging and syncing as well as a
microphone all there I guess I think I'm
one of five people that really like the
single port for charging and audio out
over here is we have a stylist you zoom
out a little bit that comes down it's
not magnetic and over here we have a
reset button as well as a second
microphone second microphone is used for
noise cancellation during conference
calls the top you got your power button
press it once to suspend hold it down to
shut it off and on the back we have a
3.2 megapixel camera and this is a mute
button for when you set it down and
you're on a call it turns into a speaker
phone automatically you can mute by
pressing that here's our speaker grill
we have two speakers behind there you
can see it's different than the european
version we have this nice bronze color
it's a little sparkly can you see ya
maybe and this is kind of a gold color
rib around the edge and so it's kind of
nice actually can you see that kind of a
c-3po color anyway there's a myfaves
logo a little slot for a lanyard now the
way this battery cover comes open just
slide it like that down here we are
there goes that comes off here's our
battery and down here is where you can
open that slot so you can open it a lot
easier with the battery cover off that's
for your microSD cards
I see this is different than the
european version because our banner
cover only goes over a little bit it's
not the whole sides let's get that back
on now let's look at that keyboard
very very nice keyboard lots of space in
between the buttons nice travel I really
like this keyboard it's got the bronze
kind of color again we see if shines a
little bit see a little sparkle and
there's no start menu button or ok
button so it's pretty difficult to
navigate if your type if your old into
like this it does have arrow keys though
so in lieu of a d-pad you can use these
to move around a little bit there's no
tab key though so you can't really
easily go to other fields we do have an
alt key which gives us symbols you see
those in green page up page down and the
Alt key can also used for some shortcuts
like if I do alt that it'll give me SMS
I also go to the comm manager real
easily like so you see that loads and I
can go to Internet Explorer real quick
with that shortcut and that's just an
email button right there and up here you
see some of these have 22 little icons
unfortunately they only work from the
home screen so if I hold down the three
it'll go into vibrate mode if I hold it
out again I'll just turn the audio back
on the eight if I hold that down it'll
lock the screen see it's locked now let
me get
and with the one if I hold down the 1
i'll call the voicemail so there is the
tmobile hardware tour touch pro2 it's
quite nice wasn't sure I would like the
brown but it's growing on me especially
with the nice gold on the on the edge so
there you go that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
