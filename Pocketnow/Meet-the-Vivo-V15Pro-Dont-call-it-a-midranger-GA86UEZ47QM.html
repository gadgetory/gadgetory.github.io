interesting approach that effectively
blurs the lines between will we get on a
flat ship and a small step into the
mid-range
reporting from both New York City and
San Francisco I'm hi Natalie that I
would pocket nom when this is our quick
look we've been covering rumors of the V
15 pro for a bit and let me just say
that this phone is even more stunning
when you hold it from the pattern in the
glass to the feel in its materials so
the 2.5 D glass surrounding it I really
like this phone there's a very important
reason why the vivo v15 Pro matters I'm
having a hard time calling this a
mid-range er C premium mid Rangers have
existed for bits but are usually just
nice designs with watered-down
specifications and features this one is
not really the only thing that's
mid-range about this phone is that you
powering it we have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 675 AI II processor oh and
the other thing is micro USB connection
even if it provides fast charging
capabilities the rest this flagship
territory with six rate gigs of ram 128
gigs of expandable storage a 3700
milliamp hour battery and dual-sim
capabilities we have a gorgeous 6.3 9
inch Super AMOLED display at Full HD
plus resolution at nineteen point five
by nine aspect ratio at ninety one point
six for screen to body ratio and full
support for the B three color gamut and
here is where the unexpected things on
the mid-range er begin and which vivo
pioneered there is no notch for instead
of motorized 32 megapixel camera yes 32
my test overall have really surprised me
given its dynamic range in overall use
of color and detail that's obviously
after I disabled all the beautifying
filters that shave the few pounds off my
face it was rather convenient the micro
stepping motor shares chassis space with
the NEX unexpected combo we have a
triple camera module but it's not
conventional one is a 48 megapixel
camera that uses pixel bidding to
combine each point eight micron into
four in one totaling one point
six microns the second is an 8 megapixel
super wide angle camera at 120 degrees
of field of view and the third is a 5
megapixel depth sensor there's a ton of
AI here even for body-shaping yeah I
know I switched it off but regardless
photos seem fantastic even with a
mid-range isp in the processor there's
an AI super night mode for long exposure
shots also included and my preliminary
testing I do have to say that the
results are way beyond what I expected
other surprises are the fifth generation
in this play fingerprint scanner it's
not the fastest I've used but this is
also a territory vivo pioneered and
remains really convenient and another
thing to note there is a dedicated
button for a Google assistant on the
side which is something that I'm notice
has become a trend lately now given the
fact that this phone is slated for Asia
you will notice a blend of services to
cater to that market this device is
powered by fun touch OS on top of
Android 9pi definitely not my favorite
given its resemblance to iOS but a good
option for those planning to switch from
an iPhone there's also another assistant
built-in called Jovi which I obviously
stayed away from because it helps you
find things in retail stores and stuff
which I don't really care
still overall the vivo v15 pro is a very
interesting option that i feel you
should consider
it's got flagship technology powerful
specifications in certain cases and a
really good camera I'm pleasantly
surprised with my experience so far you
