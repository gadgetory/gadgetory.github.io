the last few years is how much companies
have tried to bring the fingerprint
scanner to the display if you've been
following the party now daily you'll
know how much Apple and Samsung have
worked hard with synaptics to figure
this out and still no dice 2018 seems to
be the year though but this time on the
hands of vivo reporting from CES 2018
this is hai medley that I in Jules Wong
for Pocket now and let's go hands on
people may not have much popularity in
the West but back in China the company
is huge oh and if you feel that the vivo
unnamed smartphone looks a lot like the
1 + 5 T or the Oppo R 11s well that's
because they sort of share the same
parent company really to tell them apart
you'd have to notice the gold accents on
the champers of the chassis and the most
important of all party tricks synaptics
has finally figured out how to fit an
optical sensor between the PCB and the
OLED panel using a macro lens you'll
actually are able to see the sensor
hiding below the unlit panel it is
persistently active though so you can
press it just like you would on any
galaxy flagship and you actually don't
see the sensor once the display lights
up the result as the phone turning on
the display and the sensor using the
light of the OLED panel to capture your
biometric data to unlock I was actually
expecting this to be far slower than
competing devices but it's not
I'd say it's comparable when it comes to
speed at least obviously not everything
is perfect
those of you that were wanting for the
sensor to work across a display won't
really get that the area of recognition
is around 5.8 by 5 point 8 millimeters
which is no less than the current
fingerprint scanner on any other device
so I'm not really gonna dog them for
this you also have to press the area on
the screen with intent for the feature
to work as opposed to other devices
where you only touch the sensor and the
display unlocks and then there's the
fact that it failed to recognize my
thumb a few times during my testing
though that could be given the stage of
production of this demo unit that we've
got to see
Cantus ID what's most important is that
synaptics has finally figured it out
it's hard to predict if we'll see
products with this feature in the near
future but we're hoping that at least a
few 2018 flagship take advantage while
that happens make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to our channel
for more CES 2018 coverage you can
follow Jules at point Jules on Twitter
and follow me at high underscore Nevada
or on Instagram bet hi meri better
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am high netting
that I thanks so much for watching we'll
see you soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
