weekly we've got a week of lunches
Huawei took the wraps off of the May 10z
te took the wraps off of the axon M and
the pixel 2 has finally arrived in our
office we're excited about that plus cat
CrackBerry Kevin let's try that again
plus CrackBerry Kevin from CrackBerry
joins the show to lend some insights on
the future of BlackBerry we've got a lot
to talk about so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode 275 of the
pocket met weekly immediately at the top
of the show I have to apologize to our
viewers as I am once again super
congested and I'm gonna try not to do a
whole bunch of gross biological stuff
right in front of my microphone the
podcast recorded october 20th at noon
pacific this weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wished existed when you were a kid
and a floppy disk was more than just a
graphic for a save icon i'm juan carlos
back now senior editor at pocketnow.com
joined as always by plucky podcast
producer mr. jules Wong out on the East
Coast how's it going buddy boy hey hey
welcome back from your stint your first
show actually at Newegg now
congratulations on launching that with
trisha hershberger that was really the
show yeah that was that was that was a
great time and there's nothing types of
urgency to it yeah yeah big time we had
that full production crew like backing
us up to do that live broadcast and then
um it was really exciting because we
actually had all those vendors to talk
about things and people were like oh
it's just really a deal and you look up
the pricing they're like oh wow well if
it was a deal then it just evaporated
because they just sold out of all those
gaming chairs awesome but we're stoked
to be to be doing the live broadcast
over and they've got a couple other
things that are gonna be coming down the
pipe at new iknow and Newegg studios NDA
that's that's not I mean I can't I can't
tae Joos write it but I can't say there
will be more more there will be more all
right well at least at least there's
that end we should look forward to that
and in the meantime there's plenty to
look forward to this show around we have
very kevin i'm gonna try and pronounce
his name kevin make a look neasha Luke
like Alec machala I mean I tried finding
a pronounce er for his name because
everyone just calls him truck berry
Kevin and I walls himself CrackBerry
Kevin I went through like four of their
podcasts I was like well what's going on
I I'd like that's it's ridiculous but
he's he's a ridiculous guy in the
awesome so we're gonna be with them in
the next hour
in the meantime make sure you get your
questions in through hashtag pn weekly
on twitter and that's pretty much the
only place will look i mean i we know we
got the YouTube chat going often but
even in slow mode that's a pretty fast
feed to feel like have to look at so
hashtag being weekly on the Twitter's or
wherever else hashtags are accepted but
Twitter's also pocket now has the email
address that you can send questions to
we won't be able to get to them this
time around but maybe in the next
episodes podcast at pocketnow.com
definitely your source your spot your
place to send along questions if you
can't listen to us live you can't watch
us love but why else would you not be
here if you're not watching us fine well
and I think we should probably make it
more because we've gotten actually a
couple really good questions coming in
through the email I don't know Jules
maybe we should do like an end of the
month viewer mail wrap up as like a
segment yeah you know we get to the
emails a little inconsistent ly we just
put it on our calendar like hey guys
answer the email questions then if it's
on the calendar then I think we'll pay
attention to it we should have like a
whole like calendar setup for this kind
of thing that people know what's going
on like you know what's happening and
what the what feel is what's the buzz
that's I'm about to break out into like
a Broadway song so let's let's not do
that
well the don't don't sing especially
with your congested lightly pat my face
here but we've got some news
want to jump into some Biggie's the
official announcement kicking things off
our following pretty much here in the
office somewhere and you got to get that
throwback back into the view here but in
the meantime this is one of those phones
that has decided there has been always
been a stalwart of just being what it is
it's a six inch monster with a 1080p
screen even when people other
manufacturers have tossed in quad HD and
all this other stuff about zoom lenses
and dual cameras and whatnot
it's just carved its own path Huawei
partnered with Leica to do this mono
chrome in color lens kind of combination
so that produces a hybrid image and then
there's also the fact that ain't display
well not anymore finally 2017 is the
year of that Samsung Samsung Huawei has
jumped to the two by one trend and
there's a lot of confusion going on here
because like there's it there's a mate
10 and then there's a mate 10 Pro just
like last year but right the resolutions
kind of crazy said to me 10 pros 1080p
plus well the mate regular is just as a
quad HD plus and that's I'm not sure
what to make it is a mismatch outside of
just the screen I think this is one of
the dangerous aspects of a brand like
Huawei which is his has sort of grown
through being an Asian focused in Asian
centric brand he's become a top player
worldwide one of the dangers of trying
to launch globally while having
region-specific hardware these are
almost like three different product
lines that are all being called the mate
and different regions will probably end
up getting different flavors of this
phone I don't believe there is one
flavor of the maintain that I mean the
mate
ten that's gonna be global some will get
both versions of the phone I'm I'm
pretty confident the United States is
probably only gonna get one version of
this phone and so they're working with
different technologies what they can
source what they can what they can count
on for manufacturing and so I'm sure
there are a number of like to buy one
aspect ratio HD resolution panels they
can get so many of those verses sixteen
by nine quad HD panels so you have a
cell here yeah you have this like mix
and match of different aspect ratios and
panels and parts and pieces and I think
the only thing that we can count on
tying it all together is like the
chipset some regions are gonna be
getting different storage options some
regions are gonna be getting different
Ram options the cameras seem like they
might also be pretty consistent too but
but this is this is one of the big
concerns is you have one big launch
showing off the entire lineup but now
we're playing the wait-and-see game
who's going to get what flavors of this
phone and I think that's a really
difficult conversation to have with your
audience after the fact I think that's
really hard to get across like and and
not have someone feel like they're gonna
be left out of the good version or the
version that they wanted and so this
this to me is one of those danger points
this feels like something that a smaller
manufacturer would stumble through this
isn't something that the number two or
number three depending on you know how
many iPhones have been sold recently I
the the the second place worldwide
smartphone manufacturer should not be
confusing the market as much as they
have well I brought in Samsung as a 40
and slip because the thing I remember
the most was back in like 20 when was
the Alex this phone I think was the 2015
they had a Galaxy S five Prime with an
snapdragon Snapdragon 805 or something
like that like it was it was the quad HD
version of the snap of the galaxy s5 and
that was back when they were trying to
introduce that resolution and people
were feeling kind of kind of gypped oh
hey it's only Korea it's only their home
market that got this why not us and at
that time we just said hey everyone take
a chill pill you're not really missing
out on much now when we come to
standardization and hey we're missing
out on this resolution that everyone
else has or whatnot I'm gonna correct
myself here with with or clarify this
situation the mate 10 has a six-inch
near six inch sixteen by nine 1440p
screen then week 10 Pro has a six inch
1080p plus at two by one and it's OLED
not LCD so yeah I understand
there's gotta be sourcing issues to be
had and there's some sort of and there's
some sort of a mess to be had in just
creating this and tailoring each device
to the markets as opposed a lot of
Southeast Asian markets will get the
more advanced ones as opposed to maybe
Europe maybe they want to simplify their
Western expanse I suppose that AT&amp;amp;T
there they've been working with AT&amp;amp;T for
a while maybe they just want to
they've always been more tepid in
introducing their products to the US and
so maybe we'll get just them eight ten
with four gigs of RAM and whatnot but
well I mean that's that's very much how
the main nine went down you know there
was no maintenance maintenance design
that ever officially was launched in the
United States and I think we're probably
gonna be looking at that happening again
and that comes with another series of
small bummers so officially if we get
the unlocked
may 10 and not the may 10 Pro it's
highly unlikely that that's gonna have
daydream support because of the screen
panel used it means it'll will probably
only be getting the four gigabytes of
RAM model with the 64 gigabytes of
built-in storage and we probably won't
have access to any kind of mate 10 with
a 6 gig of 6 gigs of RAM option or 128
gigabytes of built-in storage and
especially after coming off the phones
like the P 10 P 10 plus you know like
there were some really nice benefits
- moving up to the higher screen
resolution and having more built-in
storage like those things those things
improve on the experience of a nice
premium smartphone so I'll be really
amazed to see how all that plays out but
that's awesome what's so frustrating
about announcing now this is the same
criticism I have with LG the way they
launched the g6 and the V 30s now Huawei
I think is kind of felling fallen into
the same trap you've announced the phone
you've impressed us with a ton of really
cool specs on different variants of the
phones and now we're all waiting to see
who gets what and so we've got a from
Renato in in on twitter using the pn
weekly hashtag and apparently the
netherlands is getting the pro and the
light and they might not be getting the
regular May 10 you need to make the my
Mon six aka I love that cranky you are
about guy when they call it like a mate
light you know Huawei is doing its game
with pushing different names for one
fare like we did like the honor eight
light and like Nova something it's it's
just crazy and whatnot but why the other
from Peter hating me here I'm curious
about the message who are we sending by
placing a headphone jack on the non
premium version of their premium foam so
that would be the mate 10 is that is
that something is that hinting at
anything that maybe
hey maybe Bluetooth is full or
bourgeoisie that see I guess no I mean
cuz I think you're right there Jules
doesn't this play into a regional
conversation that you are talking about
targeting different parts of the world
with different products and so you want
to offer up a flagship but for a market
where a thousand dollar phone is a no-go
so region shopping uh they vary very
much throughout the entire you know sort
of Asian continent and then I mean you
know for Europe European people European
consumers where
there's I think a bit more of a notion
of buying a phone outright versus trying
to engage in any kind of leasing or a
payment plan you know those price points
I think matter a little bit more than
here in the United States where people
have largely been excusing $89,000
phones eight hundred nine hundred
thousand dollar phones because you're
only gonna increase your bill three
dollars a month so nvd know I think this
is definitely a considered strategy for
the different communities in the
different regions who likely have
different you know buy ins I was just
listening to the all about Android
podcast and run on the olive an Android
podcast is super about Bluetooth
headphones but I'm listening to that and
thinking like man if I were in Brazil
right now that would totally sound like
let them eat cake oh your phone doesn't
have a headphone jack just go buy some
Bluetooth headphones for $200 you know
like that to me is is why you know part
of this conversation makes sense in a
developed first world economy and a lot
of this conversation does not make sense
at all when we start drifting into
different economic regions and this is
also I think why I mean getting back to
the main ten specifically why they're
looking at that kind of feature
fragmentation that one of the phones has
the headphone jack one of them doesn't
that makes sense to me who you're
targeting with each device yeah and well
there's also a b67 water resists and
water and dust resistance for them a 10
which is also kind of was it ip67 for
the main 10 pro or was it ip67 yes just
for the may 10 pro okay
it was me for the weekend pro so the
other ones just with a splash resistant
like IP 53 but then you flip this you
flip the script on that and you can say
this is what I love about numbers when
you don't give all the numbers so the
May 10 five point nine inch screen but
it's sixteen by nine the May 10 pro has
a six inch screen but it's 18 by 9 so if
you just tell me the screen diagonal one
phone sounds bigger than the other
the main 10 Pro but if you're talking
about surface area because of the
difference in aspect ratio the May 10
has more real estate for you to play
with it's just wider so this again
you've got the higher resolution larger
screen the bigger screen and the higher
resolution screen are on the May 10 the
small risk resolution is on the May 10
player Pro I mean it's like really
difficult to convey the nuance of which
phone is for you you've got a lot to
consider and I think Huawei is moving
moving the goal posts on their consumers
more than they really need to and it
really makes sense that you know at the
May 10 Pro is 8 grams lighter than the
May 10
following that conversation up I do want
to get a quick hits from you I mean I
know that you don't like having to deal
with the camera and you know the DxO
mark and you know it's a reference lab
and it seems like everyone respects it
it's pretty much the only gimme respect
DxO it's just I didn't like the numbers
and it's right that they use and you can
always get rejiggered I mean when we
talked about this so let's just tell the
story here the huawei mate 10 Pro got a
overall score of 97 on the DX
Omar global scale and that comprises of
a 100 photo sub score and a I believe in
91 video sub score the 100 sup score by
the way matches the Galaxy Note 8 and it
just is that follows the overall of 97
falls a point shy of the Google pixel -
it's just impressive optics all together
but it's I've never really liked we're
still trying to figure out what this new
first of all what this new scale is
because they're incorporating more of
the book and zoom features that's a lot
and some of the phones
/ respective feature are trying to
incorporate you know / iPhone 8 + or
Google pixel - yeah I mean computational
photography is becoming a huge deal in
mobile they had like a I powered zoom a
I powered beauty mode a iPad everything
other modes like the pixel but if we had
had a drinking game for AI you know I
got I'd have been dead in the first 15
minutes the Keurig 970 is the first a
I'd ship good I I respect the Richard
you but there's yeah there's a lot
that's actually kind of why we're making
fun but I'm getting back to DxO I
actually do rely on them as a resource
for when I'm crafting our real camera
review the problem is you've got a one
size fits all scoring system where you
as the reader need to go through their
analysis and see what they scored higher
and what they scored lower in each
individual category to see if it's the
right fit for you if you're trying to
make any kind of purchasing decision off
of just that score it's a 98 it's a 93
well you might be missing out on
something very specific to your style of
usage and then I so I feel like I think
they weight certain categories more than
they probably should
I think they leave out a lot of quality
of life stuff especially like app
navigation and ergonomics and
responsiveness things like that which I
think can make the difference between
getting a shot and not getting a shot
but that's not something that you can
we've talked about this on the podcast
before like how do you test app
launching time in a way that's
consistent and is meaningful to someone
that you can say like pro or con like
this this is something that that you
will experience once you load all of
your data and your apps into this device
so I I still I'm always reticent to say
you know because I know a lot of people
will go out there and say oh well DxO
they're totally rigged or they'll go
to whoever pays them the most to give
them the best score and I do not believe
that's the case I think they've built a
reputation that we can trust they're not
compromised but that also means it's up
to the reader to go and examine the
individual testing parameters to see how
they arrived at that score and I think
that's what's always going to be
horrific ly misleading about any kind of
scoring system where there's a certain
degree of subjectivity to that scoring
system and it's all being expressed in
one thongs of or thumbs down like that
can't work even when we're doing our own
reviews I always have to cringe
personally when we've got to do our
ranking system at the end you know like
build material I don't know 9 it's it's
an $800 phone they're all pretty good
like what that doesn't it doesn't mean
anything to me as a quantifier of what
materials were used in the build of this
phone to give it a number grade you know
9.2 it's a great tune but I can't dance
to it you know like III don't know what
that means
so I was at the axon M event
transitioning over yeah yeah I was with
my colleague not from 95 Google hired a
huge man who got an early unit of the
pixel 2 and right and I feel the same
way because even though it's supposed to
be aluminum that's casting around the
whole body of it it felt it felt more
like a hard you know a hard
polycarbonate kind of thing so and
what's what's hilarious is now I'm
inclined to give it a better grade I
mean if we want everyone talking about
pixel to mean like I've literally had
mine out of the box for a couple hours
I've only started setting it up today it
came late last night and I was just too
wrecked after doing a live broadcast
yesterday to really start setting it up
but this matte finish is so much easier
to hold on to the unless yeah slightly
more satiny texture to the aluminum part
of it there's less glass which I
actually do kind of like now that I see
it in person the glass isn't under the
fingerprint sensor that it's only really
at the top module and you're
under the camera and computer bills so
much like the cyan Lumia 920 that matte
finished polycarb I'm I'm in love with
the texture of this part of the phone
and I really wish they just hadn't done
any glass like just don't give me any
like crackable slippery fingerprint
smudgy part of the phone make it all out
of this and I think it just goes back to
the point like plastic really wasn't bad
for a phone cheap glossy plastic was bad
for phones you can convey a premium
experience and not ever have to worry
about aluminum or glass if you do it
right and so this this cut it's
hilarious that it took google going to
this matte finished aluminum frame to
get me back in love with something that
feels like high quality plastic i don't
feel like people should or are
evaluating how much of my $800 is going
towards this feel in hand like as long
as you get there as long as you're able
to hold on to it just a little bit
tighter so that you don't end up
dropping it and then taking it to like
you brick i fix for like a two hundred
dollar deductible yeah yeah that did you
have pretty well oh it totally does and
then also it's just i'll be curious to
see if i can find a good fitting screen
protector with proper cutouts for this
front-facing stereo speakers cuz this is
the first phone in a while i mean it
might be the first phone since the key
one that we'll be talking about more
when CrackBerry kevin is is on the show
that i'm really wanting to not put a
case on this phone I cringe every time I
leave the house with the new iPhone I
mean cuz I I cracked the screen on that
with any of the galaxies with my LG my
LG v 30 thanks to TK BAE a guest of the
show he hooked me up with a spare case
that he got from VRS so I have this is
now like how I leave the house with my V
30 even though it's
spec it's still glass on the back all of
these phones I don't want to Lee and I
used to be the guy who was like I only
ever want to use my phone naked and that
was during the note for era the pixel
now feels like as long as I can just
protect the front glass with a good
screen protector I might leave it naked
and I don't get to feel that way very
often anymore so that's that's actually
a pretty positive feel yeah yeah I'm
with you on that can we talk about the
display I don't want to touch that topic
with a mile long pole play on the V 30
because on the pixel oh I don't know
like everyone's been complaining about
this inside about the well at least the
pixel 2xl but like that's where most of
the complaints have been but even with
the pixel - it's just like hey it's
still it's it's reddish and it's like
well yeah that's kind of that's I mean
Sam if we were to go to it's a little
ready it's already but like if we were
to go with the like last year's pixels
we would assume that these panels are
provided that the pixel twos panel is
provided by a Samsung and they've been
having a little trouble this year so hey
I mean you know this is this is one of
the things no you're absolutely right
there and because I think if we're gonna
touch on display quality and consistency
LG is the is the inconsistent factor
this year so you've got the verge and
you've got people going out there
talking about how this is like a
distractingly poor display and how can
you even look at this thing and I want
to caution people it does seem to me
that LG is is having some problems with
display consistency but unfortunately I
mean if you really want something like a
V 30 or a pixel two you're probably
gonna have to play the did mine come out
okay game now that being said if your
test is let me put a completely plain
gray image with no characteristics
it's just a complete one shade of gray
image and then turn my backlight down to
0% is that how you normally use your
phone looking at one panel of color at
the backlight slowest setting I don't
feel that's a good way to demonstrate
what your screen problems might be so
there's there are some people on reddit
who are sharing images from their V 30s
where in in an app like in a browser you
could see some some distinct
inconsistency in the lighting and in the
color that is a problem display that you
need to go and get replaced my note 8 is
brighter in the bottom left-hand corner
of the screen than it is at the top
there's a hard band about two-thirds of
the way up or one-third of the way from
the top of the display and that screen
is super ruddy red that is still an
AMOLED panel that's operating within the
threshold of acceptable performance so
if you're going to test is that it's
like maximum lowest you know it's some
sort of you know way out there sort of
benchmarking style issue then you're
gonna run into problems and so my v30 is
way brighter at the top in the bottom
than it is in the middle but it it's
gradient is enough that in daily
operator operation use it's not
distracting when I'm in a browser or
when I'm playing games anything like
that it only manifests when I push it to
some extreme limit in a way that I never
use the phone
so my v30 is actually in my opinion
better than my note 8 because the color
tone is cooler so I don't have this
ruddy reddish overlay on everything when
I'm not in some kind of adaptive color
mode I got lucky that my V 30 is
actually pretty good so that that's the
kind of word of caution I would put out
there III want to say you know like if
you have a real problem with your screen
go get it replaced you know if you if
you think you're gonna like the phone
but don't push this phone to some sort
of artificial extreme in a way that
you're never gonna use it and then go oh
well this is terrible this is completely
unusable because the verge said so
that's not how we should be going about
evaluating our devices we're so far
beyond I don't know if you remember like
back in the day where we had to worry
about like dead pixels all the time does
your phone have more than eight dead
pixels well then you can get it replaced
that's not the situation anymore we're
doing way better but I also we've got to
be careful not to create this like
knee-jerk echo-chamber response every
single time there is a perceived problem
at the phone yeah I mean there's always
a bar that we've said that's way too low
high and I think we should probably get
a little bit more control on that as a
community but also I think that as you
know part of the unsexy context of this
this is the first real drive from LG
Display from it's a fledgling OLED
operation that it's just starting to
build up and starting to build out
thanks to money from you know multiple
sources Google for one which is why you
see on the pixel to excel and this I
mean it's not I don't I don't know I
don't know how to think of this as like
any other device that might take three
generations to start him before it
starts improving and whether or not we
should take that appropriate risk every
time that we deal with an LG OLED
display or like that's because that
that's that's BS I don't want that to be
a thought that I should be having and
there's also like the context even back
to the G flex devices plastic OLED the
first G flex was very terrible 720p six
inches so here paper here's part of the
issue though is like when we're talking
about these things there's a difference
between terrible and completely unusable
or a technology which just hasn't caught
up to the leader in the market so the
original G flex at it first time was
behind 1080p displays with a six inch
screen okay well that's definitely
something that we had
be concerned about but the actual OLED
technology was only about two
generations behind what Samsung was
doing at the time and I kind of feel the
V 30s in the same boat that not
necessarily for the quality of display
but for the QA LG is probably about two
years behind Samsung now what's
hilarious is right now I'm not super
impressed with Samsung that as they've
been shifting their manufacturing to
these to eighteen point five by nine
displays
I actually think display quality on
their phones has gone down from the
sixteen by nine era
I like the screen on the Galaxy this has
been the market leader that has 95
percent market share
I like the screen on the Galaxy s7 a lot
better than I like the screen on the
Galaxy s8 I mean if we're talking about
the display and color quality and we're
eliminating some of the hyejung Curry of
an adaptive brightness color mode the
galaxy s7 was for me one of the most
color accurate displays I'd ever used on
a mobile device the Galaxy s8 makes me
look like I'm always on Mars so again we
need to have reasonable conversations
about these things and know that what
we're complaining about and if you're
someone who's gonna be more sensitive to
color shift than you are to brightness
then Samsung vs. LG is a completely
different debate than if you're more
sensitive to patches of your screen
which might be a little bit brighter as
opposed to differences in color tone and
hue now if you guys give me just a
second I actually I think I might have
it in my camera I think I have I did a
test between my V 30 and my node 8 so
let me see if I can grab that you've
amped for just a second jewels I'll be
but I can just say III think I'm gonna
try and vamp on the axon m4 just a
little bit I know this is kind of unfair
since we're still talking about pixel
and LG but two displays as opposed to
wine all right talk about your display
well I try and maintain this facade of
continuity I'm it up since 5:45 this
morning and trying to an interpretation
it's fun it's it's been great and I'm
kind of hungry too again like a No
so here is let me go into screen share
real quick mmm YUM
screen share is the best share law so
can you see that so this is this is
matching the brightness so at its lowest
level then no eight screen is darker
than the v30 screen so that's also one
of the things that I find very
disingenuous if you expose for the V 30
screen the note 8 screen will seem more
consistent because it's brighter at that
I mean you know because it's darker at
that level so we have those kinds of
problems too where you're gonna see more
of the impurities on the v 30 screen
because they're not matched so what I
went through and I matched the lowest
level brightness from the V 30 against
the node 8 which means I had to turn the
note 8 up to match the lowest level of
the V 30 and you can see I'm you can
definitely see at the top corner on the
V 30 I don't know if you can see my
mouse cursor here on YouTube the V 30 is
brighter at the top corner and a little
bit brighter at the bottom than it is in
the middle but you can also see that
there's sort of a gradient shift on the
node 8 from the top right of the node 8
screen all the way into the bottom left
and I have a hard band that just cuts
through about a third of the way from
the top of the screen which display is
better the node 8 but not by much in a
usage mode that is completely
unrealistic for how people are going to
interact with their devices so I am
saying I got lucky that I got a pretty
even inconsistent LG screen all things
considered but this is something that if
you're really interested in the V 30 I
don't think it's gonna be a serious
deal-breaker
unless you happen to get one of the
panels that's way off when it's just the
bummer that you have to go through and
you have to you know potentially well
you try one and unfortunately that means
like you might need to exchange it but
again you for yourself as a consumer
have to weigh like how sensitive to that
kind of
you really are so you know there's a
more economical way of getting two
displays together in near proximity to
each other correct
why yes you could totally go for a sony
p series from 2012 so that's that's
totally one way you could have dual
screens on a device oh I I mean probably
from a very similar time error you could
go with like like a Kyocera what was
this Kyocera echo just do your before
yeah that's good you could do that too I
mean both of these were what they were
like super popular devices at the time
right really so yeah they were they
everybody watch Sarah back in 2011 so
indeed indeed and I surely believe that
the revival of the two screen single
device format will come with the ZTE
axon which Heimat
Rivera a pre-brief on and I was able to
attend the New York events the launch
event it's going to be on AT&amp;amp;T it's
gonna it's gonna have a Snapdragon 820
one which is still commendable for 2017
but um when you're considering the price
of this thing which ends up being $750
you're really paying for the novelty
screens or well I guess like a mini
tablet display as a novelty just yet
because we haven't actually tested it
but there's just I mean it's not cheap
device at all not in terms of the price
but also not in terms of the feel
they've packed a lot of technology that
the fingerprint sensing but um the power
button on the side just like Sony hey
you can get that technology finally just
not on a Sony phone gonna say ZTE worked
out their licensing issues Sony maybe
you could work out yours so I don't have
to flash different firmware on my really
awesome little Xperia xz1 see compact
all you have to do is get behind a
teensy
instead of Verizon
but yeah it's a and it's not without
lacking of some you know features to
make those things with me it brought
down by the bezels because everyone's
been still still just your can of I
don't have words for let me just ask
this go I I have a hard time imagining
what the usage of a fold-out mini tablet
would be if you don't have a good way to
hold it
I don't always love my infinity displays
on my Samsung's because I actually still
do have some issues with some apps that
interact with like the pad under my
thumb because I'm holding the phone not
because I'm actually trying to interact
with the screen so if we have something
that expands to double the screen size
and you don't have a good control
surface all the way around that device I
feel like that would just be a recipe
for a lot of broken dropped hinged dual
screen phones it's not just that it's
also the mid screen bezel that people
are just like yeah so I think that's
fair I that that that definitely I feel
like could be distracting if you've got
a bar that cuts through your viewing
experience but I also don't know that
there's a way to solve this right now
before we walk into the era of like thin
is a sheet of paper bending OLED screen
crease or Samsung you've got to show us
some concept on next year which Lenovo
Ravenna showing us some prototypes on
stuff like that and they all look super
flimsy and super fragile and like
something I think I'd really want to
look at my watch and just say that go on
go on people yeah you do that in the
meantime I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
use my ZTE axon em I don't know but I
think he has arrived at what I think
could be the best solution with our
current manufacturer
for a phone that costs less than $1,000
I would be okay with the bezel if it's
not dealing if it's you're not putting
like video in there
and thankfully you aren't web pages more
forgiving because I know it's just
static text you just move along the text
as you can really the modes that they're
trying to you know get people
accompanied with are you've got the
traditional you got the extended for
both and using two apps dual mode so you
have just one app running on one screen
one app I'm running on that or screen
its full size so hey you got that and
then there's the mirror mode which has
confused some people or has you know
they've drawn negative conclusions on
just because they don't see the case
where you might be facing another person
and showing off a video or a
presentation or something that it's not
a practical I I don't see where that
modes gonna get a ton of use on a phone
but again what I want to credit ZTE for
doing is illustrating usage scenarios
which don't involve the bezels
interrupting the screen right so they're
actually making a point out of showing
you different use models or usage
scenarios that are hopefully won't
distract you or won't highlight one of
the flaws of this current kind of design
and I think that's at least a smart play
for trying to improve on that discussion
they're barging the whole design of it
and I think that's a whole it's a clever
bages to call them at least I do have
questions about the single camera
there's only one camera on one side and
the whole paradigm in the software app
software is that you switch the screen
that you use it on that you use the app
on so that you can do a twenty make a 20
megapixel rear camera but you have to
hold the phone
this way and then if you want to do a 20
megapixel selfie you have to switch the
app and then turn the phone around it's
like yeah that's just what I'll be
curious to see though is because didn't
I mean Oppo played with that to where
you only had one camera but the camera
would flip from the rear to the front it
would actually fit for you yeah so I I
I'm actually positive on this idea even
if the implementation is a little clunky
because I got to tell you like using the
V 30 I never want to use the selfie
shooter on the V 30 it's pretty poor
it's not unusable but it's really like I
only want to tackle this when it's like
video call kind of stuff I don't want to
use it to kind of capture memories or
shoot photos or portraits but I've
gotten really good at using the rear
cameras on almost all my phones blind to
shoot selfie photos family and friends
so if there's only one camera and it's
the best camera like the rear-facing
camera I wonder if that's actually gonna
help improve the selfie situation for a
lot of people if if now it's just you've
got the full rear camera the mainstream
camera on the back of this phone which
it sounds like it's gonna be pretty
similar to what we had on the axon 7
which was a solid camera it should
definitely I'll perform most
front-facing cameras I think that could
be a really compelling usage use I think
one compelling use a juice that renowned
in LaPorte has is that keyboard inputs
that's going to have its own dedicated
screen so that if you're using a
chatting app in extended mode you just
you don't have to worry about not seeing
the message or not having the context in
front of you you just go on and look at
it and then start typing with a whole
display to you know do that with and
which is always cool and I kind of like
it yeah again it be as barges I just
sell write mode in holders on toes kind
of a poor use of space II sense but yeah
so shockingly the this Kyocera actually
did have some battery
okay it booted up it's on there's like
10% battery left and I gotta say ZTE
made the right choice in not having this
overly complicated swing out in I mean
props to kyocera for trying something
different way back in the day but if
you're you're worried about you know
Black Bart interrupting your screen it's
not as big as bad it's pretty good it's
it's not that bad oh no I think people
are over blowing the issue but you know
that's it's all relative and I could
even have like a way to fire up in an
old sprint phone anymore it's not like I
can put in a SIM card I really want to
try and use this because it looks
terrible oh well part part of my
concerns too is the battery which is the
the one battery is serving two full
sized displays and potentially two full
sized apps at the same time we're
talking about 3100 nearly 80 million
power battery which i think is kind of
undersized for this purpose but it's too
small and especially because we know
that the Qualcomm 821 was not a lean
chipset it was the sort of the running
hotter version of the 820 and I really
do think it speaks to ZTE s philosophy
on this device is that it's still a
regular phone first and foremost but it
has a larger screen mode that you can
use in situations that the general
purpose of the phone is not to be used
with both displays on all the time and
so I think they made a compromise there
it's a compromise I don't agree with
because I think I think most phones
would do better with more battery
especially phones with gimmicks like
this but I can at least understand where
they're coming from that this is a phone
with a flip-out feature not a mini
tablet that needs the kind of runtime
that a tablet should have if I've
expressed myself as
that's that's me all the time you don't
have to worry about that
so AT&amp;amp;T NTT DoCoMo in Japan they're both
going to carry this phone it's a big
step up for ZTE which I'm not sure
whether this in correlation like between
this whole concept or this this unique
point pointed statements and the fact
that this is their kind of first
platform that they're able to shout from
a mountaintop well I think I think one
of the bummers for ZTE is gonna be
they're sort of relatively the first
again to come to this kind of screen
usage and they're a company that's a
little bit smaller so their ability to
make noise is also not gonna match like
a Samsung and so we're all sitting here
and we're kind of you know we're kind of
lovingly poking a little fun at this
concept even though I think it is really
well executed considering the
compromises involved I when Samsung does
something like this I think you'll see
just a generally bigger more positive
reaction to them experimenting and
trying something bold even if it has
almost all the same compromises so that
that's always gonna be one of the
bummers if you're a smaller manufacturer
in this space is it doesn't really pay
to be first what you'll do is set up the
stage for the next person or the next
company I should say who's going to try
and experiment with something like this
so I want to give ZTE some some huge
kudos for trying to do something
different with the smartphone form
factor because I think one of the common
breads and a lot of our conversations
especially on YouTube is this stuff has
gotten a little plateau II it's gotten a
little stale you know there are only so
many variations on you know glowing
rectangle no other buttons touch screen
get app that we can really engage with
and you know we we want to see companies
that go out there and try and try and
experiment and do something bold but
then we're also sat there and mock the
first come in that ever goes out there
to do something
Xavier winter by the way I think has a
great conclusion to all of this and that
is screen gates all the phones have
screen gates they all have issues if you
push anything to the limits it's going
to show flaws so I agree Zayn
I agree Kevin Kevin is jumping in Kevin
you joined us just for the adblock let
me get this sponsor out of the way and
we can jump in we can chat some some
BlackBerry I've gone through like all of
my old storage cubbies for blackberries
and BlackBerry OS 5 so hopefully we can
talk about some fun stuff but before we
have you joined this conversation we do
need to thank our sponsor app River the
most successful business owned owners
out there are people who enjoy what
they're doing more than just enjoy
whatever their thing is they love doing
it but here's what they don't love when
they have to stop doing what makes the
money to handle something that doesn't
make money especially when it comes to
email and that's one reason why app
River shines a prover keeps your inbox
free from spam and viruses so you don't
have to worry about all that junk
cluttering up your day if you're running
your own email servers protect them with
a privy and if you're tired of that
headache just sign up for hosted
exchange or office 365 and get your
email from the cloud so here's the best
part call app River anytime night or day
and you'll get to talk to a live
us-based company employee somebody
trained to take care of your issue and
gets you back to doing what you love to
do visit a preferred comm slash weekly

the PocketNow weekly need we do and we
indeed thank Kevin for coming on we do
these like CrackBerry podcasts every you
know every now and then definitely not
on a schedule and they're pretty low
budget and comparison you know we don't
get these fancy sponsors ruidoso I'm
truly impressed
you you all last what was accepted Wow
doing great I appreciate it Thanks so
we'll go in the office background repot
it's a clock but three podcasts ago like
about 45 seconds into the show it fell
and it hit the ground and the back motor
and hands so I actually am you know I'm
just for a little branding today but you
can see the hands are like just both
pointing down
it's a sad it's a sad lot but it's all
kind of cool it was it was actually made
by a fan for us years ago and they
shipped it to me and we gave away a few
to members and I kept one so that's
awesome well I mean yeah I think it's
just a testament to the to the fan base
and the popularity of blackberry and a
company that were we're I mean here at
hockey now we're excited to see finding
some footing in a modern smartphone
world without having to wreck what the
brand represented yeah so we wanted to
jump in and again that didn't make this
too much of the wordid blackberry go
wrong because that's tired and it's
played out and we're actually excited
about some of the things that are coming
down but really quick like a 60 second
elevator exactly the you know what made
blackberry a brand that companies
respected where they maybe missed the
boat with consumers and now what they're
doing to rectify that in under four
minutes if you could so step one you
gotta remember that blackberry did not
sit out set out with his grand vision to
build smartphones right we didn't even
know what smartphones were gonna become
at that time they started with literally
a two-way pager and it was a messaging
device and at the core of it was
literally the BlackBerry OS and as you
know demands from consumers and carriers
and partners everybody's sort of evolved
they kept building layer on layer you
know PPOs one two three four five that's
something that at the core was like a
two-way pager never never envisioned
even the network data we would have
today and everything else and because
they were at the right time the right
place you know iPhone didn't exist
Android didn't exist and carriers were
investing into these networks and trying
to find products to use them blackberry
was in an amazing position which
obviously propelled them into the number
one smartphone position for a long time
and then they started going after
enterprise customers but what happened
was carriers wanted to sell to consumers
so blackberry which was never really a
consumer focused company at the core
right they weren't about building
beautiful products for users they were
like the antithesis of everybody's you
know sort of Steve Jobs onstage type of
vision they just found themselves
selling to consumers and consumers
started buying a product which was
really kind of never fully suspect out
for that but they still blew up the grew
you know people love their keyboards
people love the instantaneous push email
DBM as it was coming out all those types
of things and you know money and
shareholders were happy and plentiful
and all that stuff but but as the game
started to evolve it became clear that
you know where smartphones were gonna go
was next level and something would have
to happen to that and then if I that's
about two minutes now in the next few
minutes if I talk about like the three
fatal mistakes that I think were made in
retrospect you know hindsight was 2020
you know step one is the day the iPhone
came out at that point
blackberry should have said okay bebe OS
is not gonna be able to take this thing
on in the long run we need to build you
know quote BlackBerry 10 at that point
in you know 2007 instead what did they
do they kept you know they built the
blackberry storm on bebe OS they took it
an operating system never you know
designed for touchscreen and they made a
touch screen touch entry compatible that
kind of thing and then that led them
down a lot of years of fixing problems
instead of starting to build that
platform then what starts to happen well
then they decide okay we need to build a
new platform and they start working on
BlackBerry 10 had they at that point
said you know what let's go Android
instead because clearly Android is
Google's behind it it's gonna go big you
know you know it's gonna become probably
but if you look at the world of pcs it's
gonna become like a to platform race and
you also had Windows Mobile fighting at
the time so you have sort of forward for
people you know fighting for their their
position at that point and they said you
know what let's go fully Android we'll
bring our own blackberry flavor to it
we'll do our security thing or
productivity thing our efficiency thing
I believe they could have out Samsung
Samms
so you know Hadley started bb10 when the
iPhone came out came out they could have
maybe out Android at Android had they
then said okay let's just commit to
Android they could have out Samsung
Samsung they did neither of those things
and then you know we sort of ended up in
the position where they launched
BlackBerry 10 the apps don't come there
was quite a bit of excitement around it
they actually had a good comeback story
happening but you know once the apps
income it was gonna be a slow painful
painful thing and you knew that and even
I and even I checked out the last you
know couple years and where it got
exciting again to me was once they went
Android because they might have all the
apps and I'm not sacrificing my
experience to tone a blackberry I can
actually have a blackberry now that
gives me you know the best of all the
things I love blackberry years back the
things that are still true to their corn
and even more relevant and prevalent
today like privacy and security which
has become a hot topic in 2017 where you
know and through that in 2007 it wasn't
that hot and you know in the early days
people just didn't think about unless
there's a breach and you know now
they're back and they've got they've got
a keyboard phone here I'm holding up the
black edition blackberry key one and and
just for you guys I've got here a
blackberry motion if you want on the
pocket a podcast also was a good idea I
wasn't supposed to do this but I'm like
guys you know we got to bring something
special so we're talking to one of the
fathers come on a lot so now it's been a
crazy year in a year I did not see
coming you know at all if you want to
get into that later I can tell you about
the weird and awesome 2017 it's been and
I think you know it we're at this place
now where the years almost over and you
know these we have one phone that's out
and still rolling out globally there's
you know new iterations of it you got a
motion that's gonna hit select markets
and you know before you know it you're
gonna be into the 2018 and I don't think
it's gonna stop coming so I kind of feel
like the good old days of back but with
with better phones that have all the
apps and crazy good battery life and
it's fun and even even as we were making
that transition I think one of the
things to kind of go on your point we
went through this sort of teething pain
transition with the BlackBerry label on
the back of the phone running Android
and it still didn't feel
like we had that hope it didn't feel
like we had that potential of this
device really cracking into the market
I'm talking about the Prive which had a
lot of fans I've got a brand new one
here I just found in a box I'm gonna
give you guys like this is like Pele
here oh sweet I don't know if that came
through it was I got just the last of it
ASMR but but pretty close pretty close
so yeah the primp was you're right the
print was like a glimmer but they kind
of messed up right they went like here's
the way I would frame it or go ahead go
ahead because I don't want to lay that
on BlackBerry's feet because I think
BlackBerry tried their Android
experiment as a first party hardware
manufacturer at the same time that every
other company but Samsung was getting
burned by qualms
we watched LG have one of their worst
years ever we saw HTC basically
destroyed after the m9 the Flex - and
even phones like from Google at the end
of the year the Nexus is didn't whether
the Qualcomm 808 well and I really feel
like had the Privy it would have been a
remarkably better device and user
interests and then but that what's
hilarious is that that's what carries us
directly into this relationship with TCL
and the company's futures never looked
brighter to create a partnership that
that I'm actually really excited to talk
about go ahead I was just gonna ask
about John Chen because I think he has
sort of this pride in pride that you
know there's at least blackberry pride
about you know just holding on to its
hardware division and making sure that
it can control every little bit of the
boot stack and you know all the little
parts of it I was wondering how much of
that was a factor into leading into 2015
and 2016 oh you know that's a good
question I think devices like the prin
I'm trying to think
yo John Chen has been there three three
years now and what year did the proof
come out - two years ago 15 yeah yeah I
think a lot of that was probably in
motion but
for he leave ya unclear you know I think
like when he came on board before I
think I was at his first press event at
my World Congress in Barcelona and they
announced the BlackBerry leap which was
on bb10 he teased the blackberry classic
was coming so I was still very bb10 bb10
focused yeah yeah it's hard to say if
you know the privily you know would have
been already sort of I would assume they
were probably already at that point
starting to play with Android and work
on it just given the development cycles
I think one of the mistakes that they
made or not mistakes but your my
impression was when they did the prytt
was kind of like a blackberry for
Android people and if you look at what
they did with a key one they built an
Android phone for blackberry people and
probably for them to just force an
upgrade cycle and bring their customer
base with them as they move to Android
they should have done the key one design
form factor instead of the Prive you
know and maybe assuming they picked the
right price point and ship side and that
I think you know that some of the
excitement we're having this year they
could have had it a couple of years ago
now and even that could be more exciting
for them at this point because I think
you know and there's a lot of people who
love the proof but they ended up most of
them that I talk to you end up not using
the keyboard they just go with the full
touch and they've kind of transitioned
away from it and you know what the thing
with the key one is it's just very
unabashedly a keyboard phone but it's
it's a pretty solid one yeah I've got my
toy chest here now too and you know you
look at like this is the classic one of
the best BlackBerry's ever the bold 9700
and you stick this thing to the key one
it was like I could find I could find
wisdom I like you sized up like wow look
in I mean we talked about like oh the
screen is just so small but it looks so
tall and you're like it's not that small
we used to do fine so so we get into
this great transition was like for
example here our pocket now we didn't
actually get to spend any time with DTAC
and then as soon as Keenan really either
all of a sudden like you know we were we
were really excited about the idea of
getting back to a keyboard phone now
you've been spending some time with the
motion I really respect TCL as a
manufacturer I think they've done some
phenomenal work at the entry level that
kind of gets overlooked like the Idol
series a foams are almost always really
solid performers at their price points
but just read every reason don't have
the popularity of like a moto G series
for example but the key one has been
such an interesting conversation my dad
is interested in going key one my wife
is on a key one she's she was she was a
curve user back in the day and I was
really angry when her company switched
over to iPhones for their work phones
like I can't use this thing I can't do
documents on this thing why am i using
an iPhone and she's been using an
Android and reserve and now she's back
on a blackberry but with really
experiences like kind of poking around
with emotion and I know you're probably
not supposed to be flashing that thing
off too much because we've had these
experiences with different form factors
in with DTAC is it that the keyboard is
what makes the conversation so exciting
or do we think or do you think that
BlackBerry has their audience targeted
correctly for this other all touchscreen
kind of usage - great great question a
conversation to get into so I think
there's a pilot there's two pieces
there's a DNA thing we got to talk about
like what is in the BlackBerry DNA when
you pick up a blackberry phone and you
know what are the expectations and
there's obviously a keyboard discussion
and I think you know blackberry is the
keyboard smart phone company it has been
four years they've owned it since
they've kind of got into it years ago
and and you know nobody else even tries
because there's no point it's just if
you want a physical keyboard you get a
blackberry yeah I've got some friends
who friends and all the companies it's
really you know the best thing like sort
of implosion that happened at blackberry
was that all those brilliant people
ended up going like this and they spread
and now they all work at Apple and
Samsung and HTC and LG and you know how
do I try it to spend a decade building
contacts with all these companies
never would have happened right but
would you like focus on one intensity on
one company that kind of goes like that
Wow I know people everywhere now and
it's one of the fun things right I don't
want to keep my mouth shut so typically
if they're doing this a while but uh you
know somebody from Samsung once told me
you know there is no market for like
physical keyboard phones there's only
market like a market and demand for
BlackBerry's with physical keyboards
right so you know Samsung tried years
ago with was it the Droid Pro or
something like that and they spend money
and they were like we're gonna go after
that market and it's just like fail fail
fail and that's it you know so it's not
necessarily a crazy growing market it's
not going like that
but there's an audience there that's
gonna continue for a while and you know
I think Blackberry with this
relationship with TCL you know
blackberry Mobile's kind of the business
unit of TCL communication that's doing
the the manufacturing rough marketing
design now support everything those
people are gonna get served for a long
time and now you know with the motion we
see okay you know they're they're gonna
put out some touch full touch devices
too and you know I think it's a good
debate whether is that the the right
decision or not like should they just
stay with keyboards and nothing else and
you know I like the fact they've done
the motion I think you know coming back
to the detect question of we weren't
that interesting the Detex the key ones
got us interested again in blackberry
and now the motions here were maybe kind
of interested in that you know why I
think part of it is the DNA so you know
when I grew when I picked up the D Tech
phones they didn't feel like
blackberries to me and I think there's
this language legitimately idols with a
different bat place yeah and my thing is
like a blackberry I should be able to
close my eyes pick it up and based on
kind of the density maybe that little
bit you know typically get used to this
like soft touch rubber on the back a
little bit like there's this utility
feeling a little bit of heftiness in a
good way that I expect and you know that
yeah and the D Tech 60 was not that it
was like why why is this the things so
thin and light you know and the specs
were actually very high-end for a
blackberry but it was missing that
that's sort of you know I like to say
like tool like feeling that I want and
you know when I when I got the key one I
was super happy with about
life I think that was one of the things
I was like yes yes yes because we saw a
BlackBerry screw that up in the years
past where they had massive battery life
and then somebody in the company decided
well the battery only house lasts
through the day but they didn't realize
what power users would do and all of a
sudden I was using blackberry devices
that weren't making it through the day
and I was like they can they should not
let this happen and I think what we see
and because that was always one of the
major talking points was efficiency and
not just and not just battery life I
mean when we were in the the early days
of 3G networks and black was really
bolting on things like web browsers and
we were having to email attachments and
there was a conversation about
minimizing your footprint to get the
best possible performance out of weak
signal connections and SMO a battery
that can still fit in your pocket safely
and in for old blackberries and could be
removed from the device by the user like
that all was a consideration wrapped up
and the key one one of the reasons why I
find it so compelling were two reasons I
find it so compelling and why it's one
of my favorite go-to phones of this year
but first picking it up it feels like
it's made for grownups like it doesn't I
don't have that feeling on an HTC u11
even though I think we would all agree
that the U 11 is a screamer it's a it's
a great performer it's it's that candy
flashy glass mirror coating on the back
that makes me feel like I should be
taking it I was gonna make a joke about
taking it to a One Direction concert and
that's just how old and out of touch I
am but then that the first the first
weekend I had the key one it ran with me
for a 3d three-day weekend yeah charged
it once and that's not something that
you know I would ever trust my galaxy to
do or my v30 to do like that's a
singular conversation from a brand that
outside of a couple like other Chinese
manufacturers we just don't talk about
now people grumble about it then they'll
go and continue to by the thinnest
possible fashion phone that they can get
their hands on ignoring that we have
options completely agree like when I got
the key one I kind of have to learn a
little bit how to reuse my phone because
you could just
use it more and more and more like it's
almost the game to try to kill it within
a day and I don't know if I ever have
you know like it's even I can't we're in
a city like New York which eats
batteries I mean at least for me when
I'm roaming from Canada and I go to New
York I'm like I take it off the charger
at 6:30 and it's gonna be dead at 4
o'clock maybe I make it to 7 o'clock if
I'm lucky but if you're in New York all
day around those big buildings in and
out bad reception etc and you can get to
like 3 a.m. or the next morning on that
battery it's crazy and then if you're
entering your home environment where
you're maybe behind like Wi-Fi into your
house and home and jumping around the
city yeah it goes for days and the
motion is gonna get even better battery
life which is which is awesome you know
it's four thousand milliamp hour battery
on it I've been complaining especially
about some of the mid-range or chipsets
but I don't know in your usage I'm sure
because of it because of Android we can
always point to the occasional lag or
stutter and multitasking might not be as
powerful but I legitimately have not
found a situation on Mikey one where I
really felt constrained in doing
something that I wanted to do exactly no
I've been really happy with the phone
this year and you know I've been using
it since the key one since February and
living on it I mean even more than ever
because I've had so much travel this
year yeah and it's funny something about
the key one even makes me like use a
laptop less like if I'm around my house
where I would normally like grab my
laptop and sit on the couch from that
remote just like I'll just use the key
one it's work you know and it you know
again now that I'm on Android I'm not
blackberry 10 and I can have my my slack
in my skype and my Trello and all the
apps I need for work there Google Docs
etc I just use it as a primary like work
machine so yeah I mean the the battery
life equation in the mix has made it
just a beast and and then coming back to
like you know blackberry building a
touchscreen we've ran some surveys on
CrackBerry kind of asking like well what
do you expect in a blackberry what do
you want in a touchscreen blackberry and
you know battery life is I think always
this number one thing and and I don't
know if I realized that years ago you
might have thought all physical keyboard
etc should be the answer but you know
people want they never want to buy a
blackberry if there's crap battery life
it's got to be amazing and and that's
you know obviously things like privacy
secure
into the discussion there but I think
when I think about blackberry building a
touchscreen phone that's all touch
I just think whatever Samsung is doing
would say the next Galaxy device like
blackberry should just do the opposite
like you know if they're going edge
they're going edge to edge and beautiful
and maximizing get a concave display and
I think coming back to this one the
thing I like is it's better on the DNA
so when I pick this up you know if feels
it doesn't feel like as BlackBerry's a
key one like I picked this up I'm like
this is the BlackBerry of blackberries
this feels much more Blackberry for
whatever that means then addy tech I
still feel like it's not a hundred
percent the DNA I want to see in like
that ultimate touchscreen blackberry
don't really but it's better like it's
definitely in that right direction and I
think there's a lot of people who are
gonna like this device for a lot of
reasons and you know they're doing some
software stuff that's interesting like
my favorite feature I won't say I don't
want it like what's the word you know
put myself in a weird position here but
let's just call it the private locker
camera for y'all here in personal photos
it's pretty amazing clever feature so
basically when you're in the camera app
and I feel I can do it you know if I tap
the regular shutter button on the on the
touch screen it takes a regular photo
but if I take the photo by using the the
home screen button which has a
fingerprint sensor and I closed it up
there because I tapped it a little hard
it basically takes a photo and puts in a
private Locker which then you can only
access with your fingerprint so if you
want to take you know nudies or
something like that and you want to hand
your phone to your friend and they're
gonna Stu go to your camera roll that
stuff's not gonna be there right it's
like a parent friendly phone
kid-friendly phone so you can just like
within the camera app no extra work
taken it's like tap tap tap public
photos tap tap tap private Locker and
I'm like that's clever and you know the
other thing they did was software which
when it got announced a lot of people
kind of you know the Android Central
crew made fun of it I'm like you guys
are crazy this is actually a good
feature I have a programmed as a
shortcut on my convenience key but I tap
it and the screen goes dark no but but
then
I can drag a bubble here and it
basically lights up where my finger is
so if you're on like this field yeah
yeah it's a yeah so if you're on a
commute on the train you have a creepy
person beside you staring at what you're
reading in your email you can just like
click tap it's private and then you roll
roll through it and I don't know I like
what they're thinking even on the
software side beyond this utility
hardware side to kind of build a story
that I think is actually very 2017 and
if you think about TV shows like mr.
robots and that I'm like well this is
like this is you know the stuff that he
should be using right it's crazy
I want to get to some questions that we
have for you from our PN weekly hashtag
on aren't you supposed to set these in
advance so I could first look at
blackberry mobile from a fat produce
Andrew Wallace can what can they do you
know to improve on the sequel to the key
one maybe a key to what would you want
to see from a follow up a key to key to
so I would love an OLED screen I think
with especially like when I look at I
actually think that's a very good LCD
screen but I love OLED screens when
they're done well and I think when you
have something like a black Edition
which is just a you know nicely black
like a very they really did a good job
lacking this thing out but blacked out
with an OLED and the vibrancy would be
really sweet I think they need to up the
memory so you know the standard Silver
Edition key one shipped with 32 gigs
storage and yes there's a microSD slot
but I don't know I'm just like you know
give me I'll pay the money give me you
forgive me 128 or something as like that
I mean I can for it I think that was a
little troubling is I wouldn't have
minded a key one you know yeah a key one
at 30 dude as a base model and then the
ability to buy more if I wanted it
exactly a Black Edition added a fourth
gig of ram which is really nice compared
to the the three gigs in the silver
edition now that didn't really speed up
like the usage of the phone and I think
you know Michael Fisher mr. Mobile there
attested to this
- and we were arguing over quite a bit
because I kind of you know you guys
report you review far more phones than
me right and I think probably a lot of
listeners think you know more RAM equals
more speed and in reality it's like well
same speed note processor that didn't
change but I think you can just be born
on long run yeah yeah exactly and and
again coming back to like this chipset
and everything I haven't had any
slowdowns or anything but it's
especially with the Black Edition maybe
with some of the earlier builds I had of
the original Silver Edition and that was
also pre-launch like they actually you
know a lot of phones they do software
updates and they get worse the q1
actually got bought like a lot better in
some of those early builds as it first
came to market watch those early reviews
of the key one coming out of that those
those first presentations you were
getting a very incomplete picture of
what a phone could do and unfortunately
that's I think where a lot of people
stayed in the conversation yeah wanna
committed to TCO as well because of
their enthusiasm behind the blackberry
brandy were able to sort out talking
about the display that little issue that
brought up a jerry-rigged everything Zak
Nelson with the adhesive like they were
responsive and they said yeah we're
gonna do something about it I have to
drown drown one and throw the other one
at a brick wall to break it screen did
not pop out and we saw yeah they jumped
on that really fast and you actually
what worked in their favor though too is
you know the key one for us because we
live in this industry you know it's kind
of even almost a it's a little long in
the tooth because we got teased with it
in January at CES now we're just a few
months away from CES again but you know
this is a phone with a very long shelf
life and you know undoubtedly they're
gonna do the key to but there's this is
the only keyboard phone on the market
right it's not like LG launches
something and then another thing and
they have like a two month or three
month window where they better sell
before the Samsung comes with the next
pixel comes like this phone has a long
shelf life and honestly like there's so
many people who don't know where it
exists
so and I'm not talking and meet these
people and meeting them every day and
week still where they're like Oh
BlackBerry's making phones again like
this looks awesome I mean it just
launched in the u.s. or you're only
getting availability there so you know
with their with that screen issue when
it happened it was still very early
not yet high-volume you know the
unfortunate thing is it's the guys like
us who are the hardcore like fanatics
who are in but we're also probably the
most like you know forgiving because
we're still we want the damn phone so
we're gonna live through the pain and
and address it but yeah it was great to
see them jump on that really really fast
and and I actually you know I haven't
really talked about this but I did do a
trip down to Shenzhen I saw their HQ and
I saw we're doing QA and all this stuff
and manufacturing I saw the process and
it was you know it's rock-solid like
I've done a lot of factory tours over
the years and yeah they have a really
new factory built in the last few years
and but the way they're going through it
and the way they do the QA testing beat
the hell out of the phones themselves
like you know definitely trustworthy
right so I think for any of the old
black very faithful who are like oh you
know we give it to TCL this is what
happens I'm like add you know I'm kind
of like just like you know my thumbs up
it's not like the prints on you're doing
your ad readout so I mean I've got like
a plethora of fun phones with custom
leather backs to just like do you
remember cover they kid a ticket
engraved color where this was my jay-z
only man me and jay-z had these white
curve 8300 at the start this is our we
love these guys he's very much like
jay-z I paid $1500
this is a Team Canada black people's
8700 they only made 20 at least a game
to Team Canada and a couple of top like
carrier sales reps and one of them sold
one to me for 2500 so okay but I mean
like that's one of the exciting things
about going back with looking at a
company with such lineage and in such a
history I have to imagine that you
you know the the operation you guys are
running over at CrackBerry
that this has been kind of a roller
coaster ride over the last couple years
of what this brand represents what the
brand was actually executing and now
where we've come out the other side and
we're starting to crack through a
general consumer conversation again
what has the the tone of the
conversation sort of been like do we see
that reflected in the fans that they're
starting to get excited about the stuff
again - or the diehards being the ones
that are kind of reigning on everyone's
parade yes so that's a grow you're yeah
you're the hitting like the nail on the
head of some good topics here it's
interesting because I'd say you know
I've said this on our CrackBerry podcast
before and we all know who we are and
sometimes I'm that guy over the years we
all take turns playing it it's like
blackberry fans are super freaking
passionate and sometimes we're our own
worst enemies in in terms of how we like
harp on things right because we do get
probably the most angry when things
don't go our way when we want them and I
think what's interesting here is a lot
of the core there's a lot of love for
BlackBerry 10 which ironically left
nothing like blackberry 10 was starting
everybody was hating on it who was
hardcore because they were just like BB
OS is the best don't filthy p10 it's
gonna suck and then you know bb10 want
over a lot of the people and energy
built its own loyal fan base which was
never on the older blackberry phone
there's like a lot of sort of younger
BlackBerry 10 people who you know and
that OS came out they loved the swipe
they loved everything about it that was
their first BB BB it wasn't a PB OS
phone and the switch to Android they're
not happy about right they would rather
just like blackberry 10 be you know
supported forever and to me I'm like
well yes I get it it is a beautiful OS
blah blah blah blah blah true but
without apps
it's never gonna it's it's just right
it's a niche thing you know maybe you
have some enterprise reason for wanting
it or government reason for wanting it
but but even at this point you know
they've announced basically like
blackberry has secured up Android to a
point where it's as cure as they've ever
gotten VB tend to be to be secure there
or there like one release away from that
being you know on par so so even that
benefit of bb10 is
becoming sort of null and void at that
point so one of the DNA of blackberry is
also making it so that security is
second nature because we haven't been
talking about much of it and it seems
like oh yeah that's that's a that's a
pretty good thing and we don't have to
worry about that I think it's yeah I
think it's definitely like its second
nature to them it's DNA it's always top
of mind I think you know with TCL
building the phones now they're still
like it's still at some point goes back
yeah and it goes back to blackberry
blackberry to do their final like
intense security checks and everything
so you know they're they never want to
lose sight of that right I think you
know John Chen has been in a few
interviews recently and he's like look
nothing's 100% you know secure but he's
like really precise it's 100% secure as
a device that even the owner can't get
into yeah exactly exactly but he's like
you know we build the best you know we
built the most secure thing out right
now right and we're always trying to
stay on that and you know it doesn't
mean things can't happen but I think
there's a commitment from blackberry
that's pretty strong you know they're
they've been ok-ish on delivering on
their monthly updates as they promised
you know sometimes we've seen it be
delayed slightly which isn't cool you
know you want it to be like bang bang
bang on you know on spec right but I
think there is a there's a commitment
there that that's yeah and I think the
average person probably you know
assuming they know BlackBerry's making
phone still or again you know I think
probably would not question or doubt
that it's it's probably a smart you know
secure choice and I think part of that
is just the brand was built on the back
of business and enterprise so strong
like it was the it was the CEO phone and
that that message still holds now
whether you know whether that's true or
not it you don't have to be a CEO to use
a black bear you can use anybody but
there's a there's an element to trust in
the brand I think when it comes to those
topics and so we we kind of want to wrap
up this discussion kind of let you get
back on with your day and thank you for
joining us but I know from bike ride the
weather's beautiful outside I'm like I
brought my bike out of storage last
night I'm like look at the forecast I
gotta go this is the last day in
Southern California before over the
weekend we're gonna get scorched so I
want to get outside I kind of wanted to
ask your opinion of so we were just
talking about you like the ZTE
the dual screen phone the axon right
penis will screen experiment one of my
all-time favorite hardware build
experiments is the passport oh yes right
yeah now given the relationship with TCL
and the influence that blackberry still
has over their own design what are your
thoughts for the future do you think
that we're gonna get back into
blackberry experimenting with
productivity again or do we think that
that pie is pretty well been baked by
this point so great question so I think
well so with one thing that's
interesting is you know they were they
put Android on a passport and they were
actually working with like Google to
make that stuff happen but at the year
they were working on it Android
resolutions would not adapt and apps
just wouldn't get a welcome it possibly
it could work better these days I think
part of it comes to this decision of
like where do you think the BlackBerry
brand goes over the next couple of years
like if they say you know what we're
just gonna stick with keyboard like
physical keyboard phones and you know
you could think of like the key one I
would assume kind of like an iPhone
right they're gonna do a new version of
every year like I think this is a
winning form factor for the next five
freaking years like they need to you
know they'll tweak it each year make it
better like I would assume that's an
expectation we have but you know you
also want to have other variety
especially if you commit to keyboards so
maybe doing like an experimentation like
passport again could be pretty
interesting
but then at the same time if they're you
know doing a full touch doing a keyboard
how many phones year do you do I don't
know how much experimenting you do
versus just you know keep building the
story built the marketing built the
presence and and I mean I think the
bottom line with TCL doing the art right
now is they just can't lose money right
so ville experiments as far as they can
make money if they start experimenting
they're like wow this ain't gonna work I
don't foresee them doing experiments
that they don't believe will work so you
know is still in business 27 Chandra is
the keyboard phone the big experiment
like is that this experiment if you're
TCL I mean look I I met I met the TCL
guys back in your the BlackBerry mobile
you know president TCL president
sibel them back at Mobile World Congress
earlier this year I bumped into them in
Berlin and not ted-ed Aoife and you know
the one thing I said to them when I
first met them and you know Kevin being
very just not thinking what's
politically correct and you know proper
manners at all I'm just like man you
guys got some balls it's like a high ran
your copy I don't know if I would take
disagreement and you know so I'm like I
tell ya an experiment is the experiment
for them is signing that deal with John
Shannon blackberry like that is a huge
freakin risk and and I think it's you
know I just look at the way this year is
unfolded and and obviously you know
they're still plugging away they're
building momentum it seems you know they
started out saying they're gonna launch
in five countries with the key one and I
think by the end of this year it's gonna
be 30 plus so what started off as a very
small team that's I think pretty modest
ambitions they're seeing the traction
and the response from carriers and you
know countries around the world to keep
you know to literally bring this thing
back and you know blackberry blackberry
they pretty much lost all that right
like once once be be tended to take
everything condensed down and they went
to like Direct Selling only online and
carrier relationships gone it's like
everything this year with VB mobile has
been from scratch rebuilding I mean even
if you look at the things like their
social channels you know blackberry has
25 million Facebook Likes but you know
blackberry mobile have to start brand
new and I guess you know BlackBerry's
telling this story of where a software
company so BB Mobile has to rebuild
everything around phones again and it's
gonna take time but I don't know it's
it's coming and that story's there and
it's gonna be happen it's in motion it's
literally in motion oh look at that
tying it all up I can't think of any any
better way to send off this conversation
I think you nailed it gonna point people
to you guys for blackberry motion
coverage over at CrackBerry at
crackberry.com check them out on Twitter
and YouTube and our pretty Kevin on
Instagram yeah just crack for examine on
it's my own crack breeze photos a motion
now that we outed it here I feel like I
can start post
Marx I literally I think this is the
first that people have seen one in my
hand I love it well and then also I mean
like it's got to feel good again against
all the other like mobile nations guys
that you guys have something exciting I
think excited yeah it's fun I look I
don't I'm not competitive like that
these days I mean we went from a foot I
just rode wined 10 years I'm like people
saying oh I don't know these smartphones
aren't gonna take off right it's you
know who needs a phone in the pocket I'm
like two billion and Counting so I feel
like we've all wanted and there's plenty
of space eclis but it's very exciting
I've had just that the most crazy fun
year you know I was kind of in
CrackBerry retirement the last couple of
years and you know that community was in
maintenance mode via for the reasons we
talked about earlier that's in the show
and all of a sudden this year it's been
crazy we've done I've done 18 in-person
meetups to date you know traveling
around Canada you ask a couple in Europe
and we I have another I think nine
before the end of the year we're gonna
be hitting up this is this is exclusive
news also we'll be hitting up doing
Europe next in in Nova early November
it's gonna be London Paris Frankfurt
Prague
we're gonna have Canada again probably
second we could December into Vancouver
Calgary Toronto Montreal and Kitchener
Waterloo blackberries old hometown as a
wrap up to it so I mean just like I
think by I don't know if there's a phone
company manufacture has done this kind
of craziness of the community ever like
it's just very grassroots fun this year
kind of rebuilding things but yeah I
mean this is stuff I would love to do
ten years ago with blackberry but you
know but they didn't need us back then I
guess I don't know this now it's so much
more fun and much more exciting you're
talking about that and I can remember
the dying days of palm like with webOS
and how we were we were all having these
sort of last end of the phone meetups
when like the touchpad went on fire sale
you could get a tablet for like $99 you
would line up at 4:00 in the morning at
a Best Buy
with 200 other people all showing off
like palms I mean like there was a sense
that Blackberry could have been heading
down that path yeah I'm like like these
diehard fan communities just having
nowhere else to go
and it's been really exciting watching
that story flip in a crazy short period
of time I think it's gonna build now you
know the biggest for the big thing this
year was they were slow to get the
phones to market from you know MWC and
you know it just they I think they
didn't realize I don't think they built
enough soon enough right and then they
were playing catch of catch-up and now I
think the channels are filling up and
you know now you're starting to see them
and that's that's huge right because
once you get them into people's hands
that that's the next step to it and you
know key ones got a lot of big
supporters to it so and that's been
that's the best part right if people
bought it and didn't like it that'd be a
problem but what I love is people are
buying it and loving the frickin phone
and that's all I need to know like
that's that's a strong you know they got
a future again which is great well and I
have options that I can legitimately
point family to again like I can tell my
days I used to work in the government
you know there's a blackberry again like
you used to live your life out of one
and you're on a little you're on a
little Samsung right now that you don't
necessarily love I'm just saying there's
an option Kevin I really want to thank
