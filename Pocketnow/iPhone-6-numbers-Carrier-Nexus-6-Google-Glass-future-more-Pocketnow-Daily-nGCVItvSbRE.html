six-plus by a staggering amount in the
United States Sony is already playing
around with some parts for the Xperia z4
and if you didn't want carrier branding
on your Nexus 6 think again I'm Jaime
Rivera and yeah I will admit that I
missed the funny jokes about my name in
the comments as well
this is bargain out daily there are a
lot of official news today and let's
start with Apple the company has just
launched iOS 8.1 point 1 to its current
iOS lineup and the interesting even
though it does bring some bug fixes to
the existing top-of-the-line devices
like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus this
was actually intended for the iPhone 4s
and iPad 2 mainly because of all the
complaints of sluggishness and
everything that goes on with a planned
obsolescence but you know these
companies due to their old products so
look subscription or full details on
what you're getting and hopefully the
update does give you a better time
and speaking of flagships which device
do you think sells more the iPhone 6 or
iPhone 6 plus I've seen so many iPhone 6
plus is on the street that I thought
that was the best selling one since
Apple doesn't provide any official data
but it turns out that's just because the
iPhone 6 plus is just so hard to not see
it is huge we've got some official
analysis that claimed that Apple is
apparently selling 68% of its iPhones
being iPhone 6
28% iPhone 6 plus and then the rest are
actually legacy iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c
devices which is really interesting in
the past that used to be that the newer
iPhones would only make up 86% of sales
right now it's 92 percent but yeah three
to one when it comes to the iPhone 6
iPhone six plus we wonder why now a
company that hasn't even launched its
products in the United States is Sony or
at least not all of them and as it turns
out we already get leaks at the Sony
Xperia z4 you know the z3 is still not
official everywhere yet and as it turns
out what are we getting number one a 2k
display according to the reports number
two it seems that there is a new speaker
design that makes it even more
interesting because the current one is
actually a little arcade but regardless
of that we should expect to see the
Xperia z4 at M the
you see so if you just got a z3 sorry
about that
now what product that's launched but
hard to get is the current to Motorola
Nexus 6 it's so hard to get the phone
right now a lot of us are even
struggling to find it even on eBay
everywhere even resellers are having a
tough time trying to get this phone and
carriers are going to be an option very
soon AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon but the question
is were you wondering if we you would
get those Nexus devices without branding
because uh we were expecting to see that
as we currently see with iPhones for
example but we see that on the AT&amp;amp;T
website the Nexus 6 will have scarier
branding and yeah that's probably not a
big deal for many of you it could be for
others leave us a comment down below
tell us what you think and finally for
the expected news of the day raise your
hands how many of you are waiting for
Google glass and don't fight I know that
not many of you do because uh regardless
of the hype and the fifteen hundred
dollar price tag on this product that
even makes me stutter when I say it it
seems that there is this really
interesting analysis by Reuters that
claims that even the developers have
lost interest in boom glass and that's
apparently the reason why some credible
source of Sirois ters claim that we
won't be seeing the product until 2015
and there are no dates as within what
time within 2015 that will happen but
that leads you to the question of the
day is Google glass a product that you
would buy let's just say that Google
priced at at $200 would you buy Google
glass in my case honestly I don't think
I would I feel that it's not something
that people like people don't like
talking to you with class and honestly
to get cards Google now cards I'd rather
use Android wear but leave us a comment
down below what is your case friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video was
filmed shoot follow us on out
