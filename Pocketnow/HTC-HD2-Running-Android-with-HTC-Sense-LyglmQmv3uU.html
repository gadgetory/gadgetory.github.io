pocketnow.com so here's the HTC hd2
typically a Windows Mobile Device but in
this case it's running Android with HTC
Sense right from the HTC Desire we'll
show you how and walk through it right
now so in a previous video and I'll put
that up we showed a nexus 1 rom running
on the HTC hd2 actually quite smoothly
and this takes it to another level now
the desire arm is smoother it looks
better and a lot more functionality is
here than we had in the previous ROM so
let's walk through this let's start off
the Internet does work I'm over Wi-Fi
right now cellular data is something
that does not work in this particular
ROM the Internet experience is actually
pretty good considering that it's
running an operating system not intended
for the device so we can flick to scroll
down we can use multi-touch to zoom in
and by the way if you have an HD 2 and
you want to try this there's no ill
effects when you want to get back to
Windows Mobile to see all of your
contacts and everything you just reset
the device take out the battery put it
back in and turn it on it's just running
off of the storage card right now it's
not actually running Android sort of as
its primary operating system so let's go
back to the home screen so we have the
HTC Sense widgets we can do the pinch to
zoom leap the feature which lets you
zoom out you saw this on the HTC Desire
the HTC legend we've got the live
wallpaper in the background with the
grass moving what they've done is
they've mapped this start key to the
standard Android menu system so we can
change the wallpaper for example let's
say we want to change to galaxy which is
kind of the spinning background all
right and we can swipe to the left we've
got a widget here for bookmarks swipe to
the left this is for SMS let's jump back
to the other widget or the other
homescreen here and we've got one for
news we can tap to select subscription a
lot of stuff works very well here not a
hundred percent of the things but most
things are very very functional so here
is the HTC music widget and swipe back
to the center the camera is even working
on this which is one of the hardest
things
to get working so if I put my hand out
you can see that it is indeed working
and I should be able to take a picture
here so and here's one of the problems
that says press the optical trackball to
take the picture it's possible that one
of these buttons over here will take the
picture but I don't want to get out of
Android so let's assume that the camera
doesn't work because it doesn't have the
optical trackball that the desire does
have so we can go into the programs we
can move around as I said a lot of
things do work what doesn't work them
the major disadvantage is that the phone
doesn't work which of course is kind of
key so if you make a call it will dial
out but you won't be able to hear the
person on the other end this was the
problem with the previous version of
Android on 8 the HD 2 that we saw it
just the speaker does not work but the
internet works as far as I can tell the
GPS works all of the widgets work you
get full HTC Sense here which is just
pretty awesome to see on a device that
was never intended to run Android so
I'll put a link up on pocketnow.com on
how to get this running on your HTC hd2
again if you have an HD - this is
something really fun - just try out even
if you don't intend to use it very much
it's really cool to see your your HD -
running Android please thumbs up the
video if you liked it and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
