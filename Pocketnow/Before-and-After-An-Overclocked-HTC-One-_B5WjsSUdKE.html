phone but do you wish it were just a
little faster I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is a before and after
with an overclocked HTC one powered by
1.7 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 600
chipset the HTC One is already one of
the fastest and most powerful
smartphones ever today we have reviewed
the HTC One twice in both reviews it
scored an impressive nine point two and
eight point eight out of ten performance
ratings were great as well the global
version consistently scored over 12,000
and quadrant standard as did the Sprint
model it averaged 2640 in Geekbench and
959 milliseconds in the SunSpider
JavaScript test it maintains solid
performance through just about anything
you throw at it
it cuts through both lightweight
everyday tasks and intensive
multitasking or gaming without skipping
a beat its performance was off the
charts at least in comparison to
existing smartphones but for some that
just isn't enough one of the few ways
you can make your Android smart phone
faster than it is out of the box is by
overclocking the processor this is done
by flashing a custom kernel which
enables the user to set the clock speed
of the CPU to a faster speed than it was
originally intended take a phone that
has a 1.5 gigahertz processor - 1.6 or
1.7 gigahertz take a phone like the HTC
One with a 1.7 gigahertz processor - 2
gigahertz and beyond it's a way to push
your phone to its absolute limit for
better everyday performance better
benchmark scores and of course bragging
rights if that's your sort of thing for
a high-profile device like the HTC One
there are plenty of custom kernels to
choose from the kernel we chose for this
video is called elemental X by floor
tube and it's linked in the description
below and installation is quite simple
download the zip file move it to the
phone's internal storage boot to
recovery and flash the zip just like you
would for any other custom ROM or mod
then reboot twice not every kernel flash
is the same elemental X uses the aroma
installer which lets you customize the
flash process and tweak the kernel to
your specs the first time through we
felt bold and flash the maximum clock
speed 2.16 gigahertz but we quickly ran
into trouble we
and just one full benchmark which wasn't
all that great just over 22,000 and n22
so we started another the foam got no
more than 10 seconds into the test
before it reached a temperature of over
110 degrees Fahrenheit and shut down it
wouldn't take a charge and no amount of
pressing the power button helped it
finally turned back on after two
nail-biting hours we strongly advised
caution when dealing with low-level
system files take some precautions make
backups of everything make sure you know
what you're doing and read into the
files you're downloading check what
others are saying about it in the forum
thread and follow instructions to a tee
the second time around we chose a clock
speed just shy of two gigahertz and
overclocked the GPU as well at first the
differences aren't all that noticeable
the phone was fast to begin with so
noticing a difference takes a keen eye
and even side-by-side it's not easy to
tell which is faster applications open
almost instantly and jumping between
recent apps happens in a blur it's
difficult to discern but we can't help
but feel the overclocked one just felt a
half step faster than the stock one in
every little action it just felt a tad
more zippy where you see the biggest
improvement is in synthetic benchmark
tests the stock one had a quadrant
standard average of 12,000 compared to
the 13,000 average after overclocking
and when the stock clock speed the one
scored an average of 25,000 in the
antutu test versus the 26,000 average
after overclocking - just shy of two
gigahertz most will never notice the
difference which is why overclocking
isn't for everyone and remember we
didn't choose the highest clock speed
for this video if you take the time to
tinker with the settings in different
configurations the benefits will be much
more notable but it's not always worth
having the fastest phone when it gets
hot enough to fry eggs or worse turns
itself into a very expensive paperweight
that's going to do it for this video so
