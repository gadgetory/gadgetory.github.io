what we should expect for the future
generation iPhone rumors claim that you
should start preparing for the Galaxy
Note 8 shipments and Huawei proves that
it won't drop the guard on its processor
race I'm home Italy that and while all
of you are getting drunk and partying on
your Labor Day guess what I have to do
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals if you want
to get yourself a Galaxy Note 8 and
there are a ton of reasons why you
should and believe it or not even though
buy one get one free deals happen after
a product's launch t-mobile continues to
be aggressive we actually saw some leaks
recently where the company was gonna get
us buy one get one free deals as it
turns out there and now officially
you're gonna get a 930 dollar MasterCard
after you buy a Galaxy Note 8 for you to
buy another one so yeah you should
definitely do that and speaking of the
Galaxy Note 8 there are some trusted
sources that claim that you should
expect your phone early as it sounds
gnarly Samsung is shipping out units
already up to the point where people
that pre-order the device should be
getting the phone early and that's
actually good I love the fact that the
company would worry about having
loyalists be able to unbox the phone
early obviously we cannot wait for ours
and how about if we discuss Xiaomi in
the mimics to the company continues to
tease what we should expect from the
smartphone we saw some probable leaks
recently this showed us the possible
display that follows the same design
language from the me mix and the
essential phone and the probable iPhone
XR iPhone 8 or whatever it's gonna be
called now it turns out that we hear
that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 is
going to be powering this phone that is
great we know the power of the 835 and
we just wonder if that's a segue into
the United States says usually we see
these Qualcomm Snapdragon processors
being the ones that power devices that
come to the United States for all their
capabilities as well as the spotlight
over the Huawei as the company's major
announcement for Aoife 2017 is probably
one of the hottest things of the show
the Karen 970 processor for those of you
that don't know we are big fans of the
960 that's powering the Mait 9 and the P
10 mainly because well it's a competitor
is pretty much nearly a year 2
had shipped to the speeds that are
provided by that processor and obviously
now we get the new generation you can
learn more about the specifications of
the description what's most important is
this new AI technology for image
recognition and other things which we
can't wait to test on the may 10
whenever that happens and finally very
hot
rumors today have to do with the next
generation iPhones and we're actually
going to swap names here we've got a
very trusted source claiming that the
names are actually not the ones we've
been discussing for months apparently
whatever we thought was the iPhone 7s
and iPhone 7s plus is going to be the
iPhone 8 and iPhone s plus iPhone 8 plus
I hate how I get confused here but even
more confusing or even more logical is
the name of that final iPhone that's
going to be crazy expensive which is
apparently going to be called the iPhone
Edition not iPhone 8 or iPhone X iPhone
edition and if you think about it if you
follow the naming scheme of the Apple
watch it makes a lot of sense you've got
the sports the regular Apple watch and
then you've got the Apple watch Edition
which is the crazy expensive one even
though the other ones are also a little
crazy expensive so it turns out that
yeah iPhone Edition for the 10 year
edition of the iPhone makes a lot of
sense it leads me to the question of the
day what do you think do you like the
name iPhone Edition do you think it
should be iPhone X or iPhone 10 in my
case I think that iPhone Edition brings
a lot more logic to the whole idea here
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion we're very
close to the event brands you know the
way it goes if you want to get the news
