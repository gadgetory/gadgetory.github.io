and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview next up let's look at the
calendar I think you're really going to
like this so kind of the same as before
but look at this to do's it now syncs
tasks with exchange yep we've been
missing that feature and what else look
at this one this is a task that I put on
windows live now if you're used to
hotmail you might know that the two days
in the calendar on hotmail don't sync
with anything you can't get them into
outlook can't get them into Windows Live
email the windows live mail desktop
program they don't sync with anything
but they will sync with mango and I can
edit it we can add reminders for tasks
priority notes there's nothing like
assigning it to people it can't do that
kind of thing but that is very cool so
here's our time task from exchange let's
go back today because we have debut we
have in Chetan to view and we have a
month view same as usual but let's look
at our calendars holy cow multiple
calendars there's my default Windows
Live calendar plant that is magenta and
we have a birthday calendar in what is
live that's all the same account and
here look at this New York windows phone
user group that's not even a counter
that I created that's a windows live
group calendar and that's shown up here
so got windows live for holidays and oh
look at that that's a Facebook calendar
and now sings
your vents and here's to office 365
calendars so if you're on exchange
remold pounders they'll all show up here
there's two days you can shut those off
you want to but why you would only show
Facebook events I've responded to that's
another good option to have so if i look
at genda we got a bunch of facebook
events let's see if i can find a good
one so there's all the details and look
at this wall there's all the wall posts
on that facebook event I can make my own
I can comment on other people's wall
posts I can see who's going it doesn't
show anybody if there's more than 250
people invited that's unfortunate if it
was a smaller event you'd see who was
attending who maybe would be attending
that kind of thing would show up here
and down here you can respond so you can
say for knowing you're not doing
let's see if I can find another one here
we go there's some guests so that's
who's going to that one that's what's
new with the calendar on windows phone
mango love the disaster back love the
Facebook calendar integration really
awesome features be sure to check out
park and Hakam for more of our windows
phone mango preview more text and
pictures and more videos that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
