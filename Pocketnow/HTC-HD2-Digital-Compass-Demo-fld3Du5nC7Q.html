pocket now calm and this is a look at
the digital compass application on the
HTC hd2 this is especially helpful if
you're in the woods or if you're in a
city and you're trying to get in a
certain direction and you want your
device to sort of help you position
yourself so that you're walking in the
right direction so the way that it works
and that you can see right now that it's
active so I can turn my body and it will
adjust the heading you press set
destination and it will bring up a map
it will actually be using google maps
and from here you can pinch to zoom to
get closer in on this particular area
and you tap and hold wherever you want
to go and I want to go right here and it
says gps locating so we're going to go
outside and see how this will all sort
of come together ok so maybe difficult
to see but there is a green dot on the
screen and I need to walk in the
direction of the green dot and if it's
windy out here sorry about that and I'm
just going to keep walking and walking
until I get to my destination and I know
it's hard to see out here but as you get
closer to your destination you get a
little countdown so right now I am point
01 kilometers away so I'm gonna keep
walking and after following the green
dot I've made it 2-0 which means i am at
my destination so pretty cool and quite
helpful if you're trying to find your
way that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
