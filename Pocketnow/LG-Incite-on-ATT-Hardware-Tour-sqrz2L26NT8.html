pocket now
calm and this is the hardware tour of
the new LG incite on the AT&amp;amp;T network
now the first thing you probably notice
about the insight is this what is this
while this is the stylist and so the
idea is that you pull it out like this
and this is what you get because the
insight doesn't have a stylist attached
to the body of the device kind of like
the samsung omnia if you remember that
and we really don't like this at all
because when you're on a call it looks
like you have something dangling from
your ear and it's also kind of ugly
looking to have a extremity on your
device so I'm going to take that off and
then proceed with the hardware tour okay
there we go so the whole front of the
insight is kind of like the LG shine
it's got this mirror coating that covers
the entire device it's literally a
mirror and you can just see how it
reflects everything in its path now the
screen is three inches diagonal which is
actually a little bit smaller than the
omnia the omnia is 3.2 inches but they
have the same resolution so that's 400
down by 240 cross which is more than a
qvga device but it's not that much more
let's go around the device starting up
here at the top what we have up here at
the top is actually a proximity sensor
and that's the first windows mobile
device to have a proximity sensor what
this does is it turns off the screen
when you're on a call when you bring it
close to your face much like the iphone
does so that's a big battery saver to
the right of that we have the speaker to
the right of that we have a LED
indicator going down to the bottom we
don't have that many hardware buttons we
only have a call start and call end key
and no d-pad but as you'll see in a
second we have a kind of replacement for
the d-pad and right here we have a
little microphone going over to the side
we have a little flat that's covering up
the microSD port there it is for syncing
and charging here's a volume rocker and
to the right of that is a soft reset
hole now notice how the the sides are
covered with a different material then
is the flush front it has kind of a
interesting silver metallic and it's
very very reflective as you can see here
it's almost as if the whole entire thing
is like a chrome finish on the bottom
there is nothing
on this side we have a dual action
camera button and then we have a lock
button to lock the phone and then you
can take it out us out of standby with
that to the right of that we have the
slot for the micro SD card which is on
the outside of the device which is good
we don't have to reach under the battery
cover and then we have this selector
which is a good supplement for not
having a d-pad so it's a nochi like
selector so you can notch it up notch it
down press it in were to select so it's
good to see that on on a device could
helps you scroll through emails and such
and on the top we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which is always welcome
let's turn over to the back on the back
we have a 3 megapixel autofocus camera
with no flash unfortunately and you can
see the entire back is kind of covered
in that same interesting metallic finish
and I want to point out something about
the camera it's it may be hard to tell
on the video but it's actually not
perfectly flat and perpendicular to the
horizontal lines it's tilted a little
bit this way and this is actually a
problem with build quality I think and
you'll find little problems like that
all over the LG incite like the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it just looks
cheap and some of these buttons rock a
lot back and forth and they just feel
very very plasticky like they could fall
off and that I'm not not a lot of
tension to detail was put into this
device that said if you look at it on a
tabletop you'll never know that there
are some build quality issues because it
really looks pretty darn nice and it
feels good in hand ok so next up we're
going to talk about the software on the
LG incite it does a lot of interesting
things has some good software included
we'll talk about typing on the keyboard
and what it looks like when we do that
so a lot more to come on the LG incite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
