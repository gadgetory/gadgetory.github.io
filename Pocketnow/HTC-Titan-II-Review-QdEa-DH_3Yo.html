calm and this is our review of the new
HTC Titan too let's check it out the HTC
Titan two came out on the same day as
the Nokia Lumia 900 but I hasn't seen
much press coverage or sales for that
matter however it still got some great
features that are worth check it out
especially that 16 megapixel camera the
HTC Titan 2 is the successor to HTC's
previous Titan Windows Phone that was
released last year it's got the same 4.7
inch super LCD screen with a 40 x 800
pixels screen resolution along with
similar specs for most of our other
aspects you'll find a familiar 1.5 baker
snapdragon processor 512 megabytes of
ram 16 gigs of storage along with Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS and an FM radio comes with
Windows Phone 7.5 build 8112 and a
non-removable 1730 milliamp for our
battery the two big new features the
Titan too has over the previous Titan is
the 16 megapixel camera on the back
along with the ATT LTE high-speed
Internet support the design of the HTC
Titan two is very similar to every other
HTC phone we now have a bit of a curve
to the bottom row of capacitive buttons
the many refer to as a chin this is
useful one place on the phone face down
on a table since it gives a bit of lift
to keep the glass from rubbing against
its service at the top you've got the
handset speaker along with some sensors
and a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
on the right side there's the usual
volume toggle switch and a dedicated
camera button camera button is well
designed and includes a slightly
different texture so that you can feel
for it without looking at the phone it
also has a good feel for the half press
and full press shutter releases on the
bottom you'll see the microphone hole is
a bit larger so that people can hear you
better on a phone calls now on the top
is a 3.5 millimeter headset jack and the
power button power button is actually
quite flush with the device
so you might find it difficult feel for
on the back you'll see the large 16
megapixel camera with dual-led flash and
a speaker the material is a soft touch
matte plastic and the coloring fades to
a lighter shade at the bottom around the
windows phone logo then you've got a
textured panel at the bottom which you
can remove to reveal this SIM card slot
unfortunately there's no way to replace
the battery while on the road and of
course there's no expandable storage
here either when we look at the
benchmarks the Titan 2 is the fastest
Windows Phone around blacks in the
screen are not as black as some of the
fellows however the whites are excellent
if you're not familiar with all the
features in Windows Phone 7.5 be sure to
search packing.com for our full windows
phone 7.5 reviews for the sake of this
review will mainly look at what apps ATT
and HTC have included in the titan to
AT&amp;amp;T has bundled all of their usual
windows phone applications with the HTC
titan to you get 18 key code scanner
navigator radio and u verse mobile as
well as the might ATT account manager
some of these apps require additional
paid subscriptions but if you don't want
to use them tap and hold in the program
listing will give you an easy way to
remove them next let's look at the
settings HTC has actually added some
great functionality to their windows
phone 7 devices and you'll find their
options at the bottom of the settings
listing the attempted phone options are
my favorites you can set the phone to
mute by turn face down while ring or
while you're on a call you can switch to
speakerphone mode just by setting the
phone facedown and also has options for
louder ring when the phone is in your
pocket and a quieter ring when you pick
the phone up to look at the caller ID
there's also a hearing aid mode
increases in call volume as well as some
sound enhancement options by default you
get the HTC hub on the home screen and
once you open it you'll activate the
live wetter tile which can be useful the
hub also allows you to pin live tiles
for multiple weather cities stock quotes
and news feeds to your Start screen
and the windows phone marketplace to
find a special section for HTC apps that
are exclusive for HTC branded windows
phones a couple of my favorites are the
flashlight and apps as well as HTC
locations which gives you gps navigation
features offline map data is available
for free for 30 days but after that you
can subscribe or purchase map data out
right HTC watch is another good one that
lets you rent or buy movies to watch on
your device and image answer is fun if
you like silly effects filters next
let's look at the camera HTC has
includes some significant customizations
to the camera app you'll see quite a few
more options in the settings area than
you'll find on other windows phones my
favorite feature is the panorama mode
which relives the viewfinder with a
panoramic you I first shot mode is also
useful but sometimes takes too long to
get to when i'm going to capture a quick
series of photos you've also got a lot
of effects options in the scene loads if
you're using tap to capture be sure to
check your metering mode first by
default it exposes around the focus
point so if you're focusing on something
in a shadow area you'll likely clip the
highlights the 16 megapixel photos look
great when you take nice bright outdoor
shots however there is some definite no
zoom in on these photos the noise is
much more prevalent on lower light
photos and it's important to note some
focusing issues in low-light scenarios
considering the camera does not use the
LED lights for auto focus assist be sure
to check out our full review on
packing.com for more sample photos
before we get to our final toss we
should talk a little bit more about the
LTE support battery life and the pricing
LT is all the rage right now and you're
going to get some very high speed
downloads out of it the battery on the
time to seems to handle the added stress
of LT arrows quite well and you should
get a good day and a half of battery
life depending on your usage now the
price on ATT is 199 with a 2-year
contract that's about right for high end
LTE android phones of similar specs but
now that the Nokia Lumia 900 is
available for only ninety-nine dollars
the time to seems a bit expensive for
what it is if you're a huge fan of HTC
large 4.7 inch screens with lower pixel
densities LTE the windows phone
operating system and want bragging
rights with a 16 megapixel camera then
the Titan two might be worth the extra
money if it was the same price as the
Lumia 900 then the Titan two would be
much more competitive our final rating
is 4 out of 5 stars the time to is still
a great phone with some great features
