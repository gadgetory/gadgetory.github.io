comparison we pitted the mate nine
against the iPhone 7 plus now it's time
for the real challenge Android seven to
Android seven manual modes to manual
modes truly bigger screens to truly
bigger screens for you specs junkies you
can pause the video here to see what
these two powerhouses are packing and
with that out of the way looking at
build quality and design we have a split
decision we'd likely side with the mate
9 is the more attractive device subtle
seems don't distract as much in the
shiny sides with tiny jewel like faucets
are appealing the V 20 on the other hand
is well charmingly ugly like the love
child of a blackberry and an IBM
ThinkPad the LG is the more practical of
the two though enhanced drop protection
and a user replaceable battery when out
and about both phones live in some kind
of cover because both are too large to
be this slippery but for folks who like
to use their phones naked the V 20 will
do a better job of surviving daily abuse
these displays also compete well the
mate will allow the user to control a
higher brightness but under Auto
conditions doesn't seem to get any
brighter the LG limits the manual
brightness but in auto mode conversed
around 15% brighter than the mate will
give this win to the LG though for
having the higher resolution about one
and a half million more pixels on the
v20 on a slightly smaller diagonal in
the hand we'll call this a tie for
ergonomics both featuring rear mounted
fingerprint sensors and side mounted
volume rockers though the LG could do
with slightly larger volume keys as for
software and performance Huawei is
skinning and tweaking more than LG the
v20 allows more of stock nougat to poke
through and LG is toned down the amount
of UI customizations while way on the
other hand is still messing around quite
a bit with emui while the layout is more
Android light than previous Huawei's we
reviewed it's still a unique experience
emui is Huawei's custom skin but it goes
more than skin-deep it's supposedly able
to take advantage of machine learning
this improves system performance and
resource allocation is the phone ages
but we'll have to test those assertions
at a later date as for the hardware
huawei's Kirin 960 chipset easily
outperforms the Qualcomm
20 in the LG for CPU dependent tasks and
a daily operation we would anecdotally
agree the mate feels snappier though the
mate falls about 10 percent behind in
graphics benchmarks both phones feel
about the same in daily gaming
performance the audio game is also a
split the huawei wins for speaker
playback stereo speakers are always
appreciated when gaming or watching
videos but the v20 headphone jack is
second to none while the may 9 is tied
for last in our testing if you cable up
some good headphones it's no contest the
LG wins against all comers a quick look
at battery life and the mate walks away
with a substantial victory here the
larger battery lasts longer and the
maintenance arge is significantly faster
the counter-argument for the LG is that
you can swap batteries but both devices
out of the box Huawei solution is
formidable and that brings us to the
real showdown
these cameras dual sensors but very
different philosophies the mate 9 uses
two cameras in tandem to improve light
color and contrast the LG uses one
camera for a standard view and the
second for an ultra wide-angle look at
the world looking at photos while the V
20s wide-angle is flexible we have to
give the overall win here to the mate
detail clarity lens quality and fun
features the main tonight just edges out
the v20 neither camera is a top-tier
performer when shooting full auto but
both deliver well stocked manual modes
which take these respective shooters to
another level there's an undefinable
quality to mate 9 photos which is highly
subjective but something we really enjoy
when shooting on huawei Hardware the way
the camera paints in detail that might
have been lost to a bright exposure or
the way you can eke out a bit more
dynamic range and a finish JPEG the
mates wide aperture mode is amazing for
software blurring another benefit of
using two cameras with the same field of
view to aid in depth analysis the V 20
has a fun pop out mode but the results
just look more like a collage and aren't
nearly as dramatic when we switch the
video though the V 20 absolutely crushes
the mate 9 delivers optical image
stabilization in UHD video but it just
can't compete against how well refined
LG's camera panned out
are smoother better detailed and true
full manual controls over every aspect
of video production from shutter speed
to bit rate and aspect ratio to full
audio controls the may 9 is a
respectable video shooter the V 20 is a
nearly production grade monster
performer there honestly isn't a clear
winner here for camera performance if
you shoot more stills than video we'd
lean towards the mate 9 if you mix up
some video there's just no beating the V
20 happily either camera would likely do
well in the hands of a mobile
photography enthusiast so let's wrap
this up where does that leave us between
the huawei mate 9 and the LG v 20 this
is my Sophie's Choice of the year -
monster phablets precious few premium
large screen options this year and these
two phones represent the category
exceedingly well a potential customer
really couldn't go wrong with either as
a daily driver
but chocking up personal experiences I'd
be inclined to side with the LG v 20
it's an exceedingly close fight but the
enhanced drop resistance incredible
headphone jack and more complete video
options just barely tip the scales for
me over the mates battery life still
photo and CPU performance wins as I've
been wrapping up the reviews and
comparisons for these two devices though
this is maybe the happiest I've been all
year carrying both phones around with me
as daily drivers and of course we want

win vote in our viewer poll by hitting
