color as well new reports emerged on
Nokia's Windows RT tablet and Samsung is
bringing optical civilization to their
cameras just not now I'm high never
leave it up and if I look at a blurry
trust me it's not the camera should
probably just stop drinking on a Monday
this is out daily today is all
about League so let's start off with the
evident ones if he thought that Sony was
only bringing in their Sony Honami
smartphone to Aoife in Berlin we'll
think again we've got some league
photographs of a Sony Honami mini or at
least it looks a lot smaller than the
Honami that's coming because it's being
compared to a blackberry q10 so that has
to be small and well Lex is the
description for full details on this
phone most likely we will be getting a
lineup of phones and let's see if we get
a 20 megapixel camera on this phone as
well now let's talk about Nokia's we've
got some more reports of their project
serious yes that's the way their project
is being called for their 10.1 inch
tablet as it turns out spec sirs been
bad first of all we do get a snapdragon
800 on this tablet which is great but
then once we look at the 1080p display
in this day and age that's really not
going to be good but still again Nokia
does prove to be good when it comes to
hardware and this tablet looks great and
everything but pink links in the
description for full details and let's
hope we get some more colors and
speaking of Nokia those of you wondering
which is a probable successor to Steve
Ballmer it's microsoft CEO well recent
reports have it that stephen elop is
being considered for the role and yeah
we gotta head into the guy he's
single-handedly turning around nokia
from almost being lost to not being that
lost yes he is doing a good job and
turning the company around so far we
just don't know if he'd do a good match
for Microsoft even though we do know he
used to be a Microsoft employee so stay
tuned for that but see how that goes now
let's talk about Samson one of the
biggest reports were waiting for an
ephah and Berlin is a 16 megapixel
camera with optical image stabilization
for their galaxy note 3 and well some
credible reports are now stating
apparently the company has landed in
some delays that are so significant that
it won't have to wait for the rest of
this year actually it'll have to wait
until next year probably galaxy s5 I
guess it would be so
anyway stay tuned let's hope they figure
something out at least for the galaxy
note 3 i'd rather put up with a delay on
this phone and get the optical image
stabilization then just get another
camera and finally for the hot news of
the day if you thought that golden
iphone that we've been seeing in leaks
is the only project that apple's testing
right now well think again we've got a
gray iphone 5s with black rims all over
looks a lot like the black bone actually
only that it's lighter when it comes to
the aluminium it's kind of hard to know
if it's going to happen though because
we know that apple loves prototyping
they love testing everything out before
they choose something so it could just
be that they're testing new waters and
not necessarily bringing new variants
but that leads me to the question of the
day would you like the iPhone 5s in
different other colors and if so which
colors would you like and my particular
case out of my experience with anodized
aluminum honestly I'd rather prefer to
stick to the white and silver iphone 5
just because you know it doesn't scratch
that much and I know this is a terrible
reason to say that but leave us a
comment down below what would you prefer
of course it's always for an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone its outdoor make sure you
