as big as Samsung releases a new
flagship smartphone because it often has
to release different versions of the
device for different global markets well
today we're putting two of those
versions head-to-head the quad-core
Qualcomm powered galaxy s4 for sprint up
against the Samsung Exynos powered
octa-core Galaxy s4 the GTI 9500 for
other global markets I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow this is octa quad
let's get to it
okay so as we learned in our octa
unboxing video there are almost no
aesthetic differences between these
devices save for some branding down low
on the battery door almost all the
changes between the SP HL 7 24 sprint
and the GTI 9500 are under the hood and
the changes are significant we'll get
hardware first followed by benchmarks
and performance and we'll end with a
little camera testing follow us on
social media by the way so you don't
miss the rest of our extensive galaxy s4
coverage at pocket now Sprint's device
is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
a quad-core processor running at 1.9
gigahertz the IEEE 9500 takes its
processing power from an Exynos 5 octa
CPU which is actually two quad-core
clusters a big 1.6 gigahertz cortex a15
and a little 1.2 gigahertz cortex a7
working together
according to arm only one set is active
at any given time depending on what kind
of processing load is being asked of the
device with the switch overtaking 20
microseconds to accomplish the CPU
emulates a single quad-core processor to
Android and its apps and that becomes
evident in certain benchmarking
applications which you'll see in a
second
the different CPUs also mean different
GPUs as well with the octa carrying a
power VR SGX 544 mp3 unit while the
american variant offers energy no 320
from Qualcomm both devices carry 2 gigs
of ram and usual 16 32 or 64 gigs of
on-board storage upgradeable via microsd
to an additional 64 gigs from a
forward-looking perspective these are
both very capable and cool platforms but
some speculate that the Snapdragon
variants will see a larger share of
developer attention or at least will
detract from the attention given to the
X and O's version because all US
variants feature the Snapdragon
that's speculation but it's something
that's important to consider if your app
or game tastes are exotic or
cutting-edge and you're planning on
investing in either of these devices for
the long haul us buyers will face an
important choice when selecting between
these devices in the form of LTE while
the Exynos 5 octa cpu itself does
support all LTE bands the GTR 9500
device as produced does not there's no
official support for LTE in this model
so any American wanting to take
advantage of LTE had better go with one
of the u.s. carrier variants there is
HSPA+ of course in the 9500 before those
in markets with a strong AT&amp;amp;T presence
in terms of synthetic benchmarks the
difference in cpu power between these
devices is easily seen the octa
outscores the snapdragon in every metric
in our benchmark battery with the
exception of the new 3d mark gaming test
we ran the test multiple times just to
be sure but the Snapdragon powered unit
outperformed the GTI 9500 both times
whether that's a result of crate versus
cortex or the different GPUs we won't go
into but it was interesting to see the
Qualcomm powered American variant
outpacing its Exynos sibling in this one
benchmark in terms of software
performance the benchmark differences
don't equate to much variance in
responsiveness we were slightly
disappointed in the occasional lag or
stutter we saw in our sprint unit in our
full review but those rare hiccups were
solved by and large by turning off some
of Samsung's new processor intensive
features both of these devices are quite
responsive as long as you're not running
the entire feature set that Samsung is
added and of course you're not going to
get as much carrier bloat with the
International unlocked I 9500 but
Samsung has provided s health and the
other s apps which we've covered in
other videos at pocket now at launch
times were very close for low impact
apps like Twitter and Facebook with the
American version lagging by fractions of
a second behind the eye 9500 and apps
like the camera and browser Samsung's
dialer is the classic style on the
international version not the
whitewashed easy mode look-alike on the
Sprint variant but it comes up just as
quickly performance on webpages is
substantially identical as well with
text zoom and re-render about as quick
as you could ask for on each Netflix
movies loaded in less than three seconds
on each with a fast Wi-Fi connection
games like temple run Angry Birds Star
Wars and ripped
GP ran identically in our testing on
each but the flight simulator sky
defenders ran with significantly more
jumpiness and stuttering on our American
device the bottom line for gaming seems
to be that most popular titles will play
comparably on each device but certain
high demand niche games may run
differently many folks are anxious to
learn how well the octa s4 does against
the Snapdragon s4 in terms of battery
life each device offers a 2600 milliamp
hour power pack but how do the radically
different processor architectures affect
power consumption well in terms of
static testing the antutu battery tester
sees a winner in the octa-core variant
the GTI 9500 scored a 503 in the stress
test while the SP HL 720 sprint variant
scored a 470 we wanted to test these
results under real-world conditions
though so we brought the two devices out
side by side for a two-hour long reality
test we matched up settings installed
apps display brightness even home
screens and wallpapers as best we could
and turn to LTE off on our Sprint device
to keep each device on as equal a
footing as possible we left Wi-Fi
enabled though so we could hop on and
off our home network in both units
started at 100% charge during our
journey we put each device through a
condensed version of our typical day
firing a few emails off jumping into and
out of Twitter and Facebook checking in
on Foursquare taking in a few tracks on
Spotify engaging in a bunch of text
message an IM conversations watching a
youtube or a netflix video here and
there taking notes in Evernote browsing
the web GPS navigating squeezing in a
quick game or two taking some photos and
video and even making a handful of phone
calls that would be eye 9501
the call quality competition but we
remind you these phones are on two
different networks we did a lot of stuff
remember though anything we did on one
phone we did concurrently or immediately
afterward on the other at the end of our
two-hour test the results were as
follows the International GTI 9500
boasted a 73% charge remaining while the
Sprint L 720 set at 68% total time off
charger was 2 hours 15 minutes and
screen on time was just over 1 hour on
each device
we describe battery life as good to
great on both devices
under even moderate to heavy loads and
even considering we jumped into and out
of coverage areas a few times on the
subway after the video you're seeing now
we'll run the devices to depletion using
looped video on each results from the
test to exhaustion will be available
down in the description and in our post
at pocketnow.com in the interim that 5%
difference
roughly reflects the disparity we
recognized from our extended testing and
it verifies the antutu result as well
the international version beats the
sprint variant in battery life but not
by much we can't tear down the hardware
on our review units but according to
chip works the primary camera sensor on
the I 9500 is the Sony I MX 135 and many
sources seem to agree the American
versions pack the same hardware well
firmware almost certainly varies across
these devices results are quite similar
as you can see the only difference we
could discern was a greener tint on the
i-90 500 in our low-light test but
otherwise results looked identical to us
even in video
with the Galaxy s4 samsung has admirably
dealt with the problem of delivering the
same product experience across many
different markets with very different
internal hardware because these phones
are very very similar unless you're a
hardcore gamer or another user with very
specialized needs you won't notice much
difference in performance between the I
9500 and the American variant and even
then the differences may surprise you
remember the Qualcomm device 1 the 3d
gaming benchmark yes the more globally
friendly version offers better battery
life and better overall benchmarks but
is that worth the loss of LTE support
and the much higher price tag of an
unsubsidized model if you're an American
buyer we don't think so we think most
folks will be better off buying the
regionally appropriate version of the
galaxy s4 which honestly shouldn't come
as much of a surprise the octa-core
variant is cool but it's not necessarily
worth the reputation the spec heads are
giving it like I said in the video folks
we have a whole lot more galaxy s4
