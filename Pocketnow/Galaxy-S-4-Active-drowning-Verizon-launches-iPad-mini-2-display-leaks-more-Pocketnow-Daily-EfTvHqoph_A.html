drowning lately Verizon leagues talk
about an HTC One and a moto x and
everything points to the next iPad Mini
without a Retina display I'm hi meri
behna and can somebody please explain to
Apple why the ipad mini doesn't sell
that well this is out daily
let's are they off talking about those
product releases that I wish I didn't
have to mention because for those of you
that we're waiting to get microsoft
office on your android device well it
just got released but as with everything
microsoft there's always a catch since
if you don't have an office 365 account
which you have to pay for sadly the
application is kind of useless there's a
30-day trial and that is just about it
anyways you know iOS 7 beta for keeps
bringing more information on apple's
future product lineup and one of the
products that we're waiting for the most
is the next generation I've had many but
you're not gonna like the news as well
apparently there are going to be three
models of the ipad mini again just like
now and sadly they will be limited to a
non retina display according to the
links there is no high resolution
display on this tablet and then you get
to wonder what is Apple thinking I mean
that's pretty much the only reason why
nobody's liking the mini now it's got
some verizon leagues that i know a lot
of you are waiting for first of all
those of you looking forward to an HTC
one on big red while august fifteenth is
apparently the launch date and then for
those will be waiting for the Moto X or
the droid ultra line of apparently that
is happening on the week of the 20th
obviously these are just reports nothing
confirm stay tuned and hopefully it
happens that way and speaking of the
Moto X we've got the first leaked
photographs of their magical display as
it's being dug which is supposed to wrap
around the phone in a way that's
completely unique but don't let me bore
you with the Moto X news for 30 p.m.
tomorrow remember stay tuned for our
pocket now live round table where we're
going to be talking about the stone
after michael fisher leaves the event
and has some hands-on experience with
the phone hopefully we will have a
review unit right there you can ask us
all the questions that you want so again
stay tuned for 30 p.m. eastern standard
time and finally for the sad news of the
day apparently a lot of customers are
having problems with their galaxy s4
active as a turn
out their phones are drowning and dying
and if you watch Michael Fisher's review
there are some specific features and
specific procedures that you have to
follow in order for the phone to really
become waterproof which is kind of an
irony because apparently if you don't
follow these procedures which AT&amp;amp;T
cannot verify our samsung the warranty
does not cover the phone being
waterproof which is an irony I mean why
are you going to sell me a phone that's
waterproof if you're not going to cover
that specific feature on the warranty so
that leads me to the question today do
you think that's fair do you think it's
fair for a company to sell you a
ruggedized waterproof phone and then not
cover every single one of its features
on the warranty in my particular case
there's no point of being for this
ruggedized product that the company is
not gonna you know walk the talk with
their product so leave us a comment down
below what do you think of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening and the
smartphone the top rope if you follow us
on parting out our comment subscribe my
youtube channel as well you'll also
follow me on twitter and hina underscore
iveta please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am high
metal ravenna thank you very much for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
