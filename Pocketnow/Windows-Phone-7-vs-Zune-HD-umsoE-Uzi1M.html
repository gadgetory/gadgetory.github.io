accom we're going to give you a
comparison between the Zune HD and
Windows Phone 7 let's check it out first
up here we are in the home screens and
obviously when this phone seven has a
lot more going on but the Zune HD has a
slightly different design and it's all
music and videos and only a couple apps
if I press the home button it toggles
between a list and my pins that doesn't
happen here but let's go into music and
videos and we get a really nice panorama
here with a background image of one of
the artists who might have been
listening to recently we got a new you
got history yeah now playing and here's
your menu so there's music videos
podcasts radio marketplace we're just
pretty similar to over here and over
here are the pins and your history and
your new so slightly different interface
there so let's go to music again
slightly different and let's go to how
about let's see who we've got on here
Kolbe &amp;amp; Kolbe there's another difference
we see a bright background image here
and we see the background image here is
really faded back so it's less
distracting you also notice you have a
play button for all the album's and a
plus to add it to the NAP plane and a
smart DJ button which will go out to the
zoom pass and kind of create its own
little mix of music
they may not have heard of before in the
comm in combination with music on your
device that you know kind of goes with
Colbie Caillat so we're missing that
here on Windows Phone 7 which is a shame
because it's an awesome feature one
warning if I I don't have 1 zoom pass
assigned to both of these devices so if
I stream anything and it doesn't work on
the other it's probably because of that
okay so there's albums I can go swipe
like that and get songs again we have
smart DJ button this one you can only
play individual songs whereas this one I
can play them all and we swipe again
here's an here's another difference the
Zune HD has pictures this one goes to
the bio and so it's an HD pictures
artists pictures pretty great and so we
swipe again and there's a bio and it's
the same bio but look at the Zune HD
some of those are underlined so see
we're talking about Billy Idol there I
can click on that and go straight to
Billy Idol well it's gonna connect to
the Wi-Fi there we go so that's really
cool we're missing that on the Windows
Phone 7 and we swipe again we get
related artists we swipe over here we're
back to albums already
there's only album's songs and bio for
artists on Windows Phone 7 so in the
Zune HD we got related artists so if you
want to explore and discover some new
music that it's kind of like Kobe we can
go over here and see some
recommendations so that's really awesome
on the Zune HD and we have our back
is top tapping the top Tech's were I'm
one who's supposed to seven we gotta
press the back button okay you get the
album view
you got the songs view and this is where
you can play all the songs you got
playlists you guys genres and then
you're back to artists the difference I
was in HD
we got whoops that was miss touch we got
channels which are really cool
those get periodically updated
automatically and then you got platelets
and you got songs somewhere here and
guys jhanas I'm gonna back to albums so
slight difference there that album is
throwing in more a grid view over here
and they're still lists not sure if
that's because of the number of albums I
have anyway let's get back up here so
the videos pretty similar
I only have one video here okay let me
play one here and play we hear
difference here Zune HD has a 50 screen
option nothing like that here but I am
50 screen and I can tap and drag to skip
ahead
this one no can do alright let's go back
okay
picture is something else let's go to
marketplace
okay we got we had a search bar there
let's go to music so this will be the
music marketplace on Windows Phone 7 we
got a nice big panorama here again and
we got the artists of the week is
featured there you had a couple featured
albums got some new releases shown up
you got the top albums got a genre x'
and the search is right here so you're
gonna type the search button now on the
Zune HD we got something really awesome
got pics what that does is it looks at
your music listening habits and says you
know you might like Joe Nichols as well
so we're gonna recommend that so you can
see a few of their recommendations here
and you can really easily tap on one and
right away you can download any of these
albums with your zoom pass let's go back
and swipe you give you new releases so
let's go there where we have the same
new releases kind of different layout
you have top songs you can choose the
top rock songs that's pretty nice we
don't really have a choice over here I'm
gonna just one-seventh top albums again
we only have you know you can choose the
genres for top albums over there and
then we're back to picks so let's search
for somebody this should we go for
I'll search for mmm
so here's our search results and I am
going to pick the artist you can see the
difference there and here we are in the
artist marketplace window you can see I
already have a song in the collection on
the Zune HD whereas this one doesn't
have anything in collection yet I can
tap the play button with my zoom paths
hooked up and just listen to it right
away
same on the Zune HD here I've got the
plus button to add to new plane and the
smart DJ button which is awesome so the
songs
there's by others pictures
we already saw this before okay so let's
go I want to download the whole album so
let's get books here we go
we're gonna go to this one so here's
where there's a difference big
difference over here we got by album
$12.99 I can buy you Sonic if I press
the play button it's gonna stream the
whole song because I have a zoom pass
over here same deal well similar I press
the play button it's going to stream the
wholesome whole album because I was in
fast but if I want to buy it it's gonna
say confirm purchase and this is how
much you're gonna get a charged and it's
going to get charged to the mobile phone
account it's not going to use my zoom
past credits over here that's something
you got to pay attention to
I do the cart over here it's going to
check out if I have a zoom pass and
because I do it says download and step
by so now I can just press download and
it's going to download the DRM protected
version of that album
she says downloading
on Windows Phone 7 it's a little bit
different and it's hidden if you want to
download it as your zoom pass you got to
tap and hold and that brings up a menu
add to napaloni plane by download or
share so if I choose download now that's
gonna download the DRM protected music
see it says pending so that's how you're
gonna get zoom Pass downloads on Windows
Phone 7 that's a little tricky so here
we're downloading that over there oh and
here's your review of the album that's
nice we don't have a review over here
next let's look at the radio so here we
go for both devices you need the
headphones plugged in in order to use
the antenna over here we've got HD
support let's see if we can get to the
same channel over here and we've got the
name of our station you can add it to
favorites using that button and here we
are it's working over here too you can
add to favorites you can pause let's see
if we can get some music we got the name
of the show and okay here we go cook it
cook it of Montreal and look at this
button we got an Add to Cart button so
when this is recognizing the name of the
song you can add it to current and then
when you go to your cart you can
download that song off of zoom this is a
really awesome feature you see it's not
here on Windows Phone 7 and lastly next
rather we got the social on the Zune HD
but you can really easily listen to some
of the music your friends like so we can
see what's recent my favorites okay
there's nothing like that on Windows
Phone 7 however if you get to the
Marketplace on Windows Phone 7 you can
tap and hold the name and then choose
share and then you can email it to a
friend and that'll give them a zoom link
you can also do it for individual songs
so that's pretty much it for the
differences between Windows Phone 7 zoom
and the Zune HD of course you also have
you know the phone that's gonna have
speakers this one has to have headphones
this one doesn't have a removal battery
so there's lots of hardware differences
but that's a quick overview of the
software differences between the Zune HD
and the Windows Phone 7 that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
