new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it
let's take a look at a smartphone whose
genetics have drifted a little from
they're supposed perfection of just a
few months ago I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow this is the HTC Droid DNA
and this is episode 14 of after the buzz
Verizon said it wanted to return to the
roots of the droid brand when it dropped
the smartphone on us in November hence
the name DNA HTC said the DNA was the
ultimate Droid and it's hardware did
embody Verizon's droid brand to a tee
with muscle car inspired styling and a
red and black theme and with an
aggressive marketing push and wider
availability DNA could have been a
superstar but instead just four months
later HTC is releasing another flagship
super phone the new and improved HTC one
so no matter how good the DNA is it's
still automatically now an older device
so let's see just how well this newly
minted
old-timer has held up aesthetically the
DNA's styling is held up nicely both
because it hasn't been that long since
launch and because HTC went minimalistic
on the design the soft touch finish on
the back and the Gorilla Glass 2 on the
front are good armor against impacts but
as always the latter isn't infallible
we've seen at least one shattered droid
DNA screen on the street since launch
HTC future proved some elements very
nicely the 1080p display was the first
of its kind to hit the US market and
it's just as beautiful now as it wasn't
launched other aspects aren't aging so
gracefully using the same underwhelming
camera optics as the One X of 2012 prob
wasn't the best choice from a longevity
standpoint especially considering how
hard HTC will market the new ultrapixel
and Zoe functionality of its new camera
and speaking of longevity the embedded
2020 milliamp hour battery continues to
deliver performance just below average
and the more often the screen stays on
the worse it gets
obviously now that high res display is
worth the power cost it's gorgeous but
batteries don't improve over time they
degrade and not being able to swap the
battery in the field means we've made
good use of our portable power packs you
still have to be ok with this if you're
gonna invest in the DNA on the subject
of degradation over time it's incredible
how quickly HTC's Sense skin has aged in
the past few months with stock Android
looking better and better with each OT a
update and samsung's touchwiz making up
for its ugliness with responsiveness and
its sheer added functionality since has
stagnated it's less laggy on the DNA
than on other devices but the visual
style we used to think of as refined now
seems somewhat archaic especially in the
face of sense 5 on the new HTC One since
for Plus now just seems old with its
insistence on tainting every action with
this mechanical click sound and it's
large but inaccurate stock keyboard
their minor annoyances but they great on
the nerves quickly Plus this version of
sense doesn't take advantage of the
added resolution of the display
so you're still faced with the same
amount of information you'd get on any
other jumbo screen smartphone it's
wonderful for some functions don't get
us wrong but the skin inhibits the
beautiful display more than it sets it
free you're still left with the need to
root the phone to get the most out of
its capabilities which is a shame
ultimately this build of sense was
crafted for a time when Android was ugly
and needed to be covered up that's not
the case anymore and unless and until an
OTA update comes along bringing the new
sense 5 the DNA will remain a beautiful
car driven by a rapidly aging chauffeur
none of this should detract from the
Droid DNA as a capable reliable and in
many ways a beautiful smartphone it's
gorge
display and the timeless beauty of its
minimalistic build will serve it well in
2013 and if you're on Verizon and
considering one you could definitely do
much worse especially considering the
carrier hasn't yet announced plans to
pick up the new HTC one for reasons that
might be obvious but with the arrival of
that beautiful successor it now seems
clear that the DNA is forever doomed to
be the also-ran the smartphone that was
almost a flagship the short burst of
royal treatment
it did get is most assuredly over and
for a device that had as much potential
as the Droid DNA and which actually does
deliver a solidly good overall
experience that's sad folks that's gonna
do it for episode 14 of after the buzz
