current flagship is almost six months
old and it now faces a surge of
brand-new Android competitors for many
consumers the battle between Apple and
Samsung will define the year as folks
look to part with their hard-earned
money so it's time for a good
old-fashioned grudge match between two
phone Titans I'm Juan Carlos bag now for
PocketNow and here's our smartphone
showdown between the galaxy s7 and the
iPhone 6s brought to you by D brain the
snarky side of this conversation might
point out that Samsung is moving towards
the familiar tick-tock strategy that
Apple is used since the iPhone 3G and
that the galaxy s7 in some ways might be
viewed as an S 6s and looking at these
two phones there are zero surprises in
terms of design sure we've gotten new
color options over last year but at
arm's length the respective styles will
look similar to last year's devices it's
on closer inspection we see that Samsung
has tweaked the galaxy s7 more than
Apple ever has for an iPhone S series
the s6 flat edges and ever so subtle
corner dimples are gone in favor of the
scooped back and curved rear glass found
on the note height and width have also
been reduced bringing the overall
footprint of the galaxy s7 with a 5.1
inch screen surprisingly close to the
form factor of the iPhone success with a
4.7 inch screen
this gives the gs-7 a noticeable
advantage in screen to bezel ratio and
in my tiny Hobbit hands both devices are
fairly easy to use one-handed though I
still have a slightly easier time
reaching the home button on the success
than I do on the galaxy all buttons on
both devices are cliquey offering
terrific feel and feedback and happily
this tactile feel doesn't come with
buttons protruding too far from the
respective foam bodies we should be able
to back off Samsung for design
similarities to the iPhone by now
especially now that the HTC One a9
exists though the bottom edge could
still almost be mistaken for Cupertino
x' work if it weren't for the microUSB
port
sorry Samsung fans maybe we'll get USBC
next year for the similarities we find
on the front face and sides the rear
designs couldn't be more different and
each phone brings somewhat unique
challenges to the table Samsung's rear
Glide
is striking if still more prone to
fingerprints and it showcases the large
12 megapixel camera module the iPhone 6s
maintains the wraparound aluminum shell
which has only grown a tiny bit thicker
from the iPhone 6 and includes the same
protruding camera lens cover Samsung has
done a fantastic job of syncing that
module and lens into the body of the
gs-7 these phones in daily use are
almost opposites in terms of hand feel
when my hands are cold and dry aluminum
feels more slippery when my hands are
sweaty glass is super slick compared to
phones with textured back plates made of
grippy materials investing in a case or
maybe a skin probably isn't a bad idea
for either device for folks using
fingerprint identification apple's
implementation still seems to do a more
consistent job of unlocking the iPhone
though I purposely trained my thumb from
the position I hold the phone a side
thumb scan can still throw the galaxy s7
and the iPhone 6's seems to do a better
job of recognizing different angles from
how the print was trained
neither device will compare to the
ridiculously quick unlocking action
found on Huawei phones though there's
not much competition between LCD and
AMOLED screen tech these days Samsung's
AMOLED panel produces a brighter image
in daylight the higher contrast ratio
also improves clarity of on-screen items
in bright conditions happily Samsung has
backed off the candy-colored
oversaturated look for the UI but to my
eye the iPhone screen is still more
accurate with warmer colors like yellows
and reds switching the screen mode to
basic will bring the galaxy closer to
the look of an LCD what also hasn't
changed since last year is screen
resolution the galaxy s7 continues to
use a quad HD display of 2560 by 1440
and Apple's Retina display on the 6s is
still 1334 by 750 even with the smaller
screen size it's difficult to dismiss
the advantage of having three and a half
times more pixels on the galaxy
the iPhones resolution is the bare
minimum you can use for a crisp image
and arms-length but people who like to
get their noses into their phone or who
want to start playing with VR gear
Samsung offers a significant advantage
in debating Android versus iOS last year
with the iPhone 6 in the galaxy s6 we
credited iOS with having this
blur interface out-of-the-box Android
still requires a bit more customization
for a user to really tailor their phone
to how they want to use it whether
someone enjoys having a separation
between app drawer and home screens or
the ability to theme a phone more than
just changing the wallpaper can only be
answered by that individual and what
metaphor they prefer for interacting
with that phone touch square get app is
pretty easy to understand and remains
popular with many smartphone consumers
but it doesn't offer the at a glance
convenience of user organized widgets of
course those widgets don't come set up
for you out of the box in the past where
we might have credited iOS with smoother
UI performance Samsung has significantly
minimized that performance gap when the
galaxy s7 takes an extra second to bring
up multitasking it does so with a fluid
menu animation scrolling performance in
chrome is slicker than what we currently
see in Safari and the RAM management
gremlins which plagued the galaxy s6
early on seem to have been sorted out
here though we do see some difference in
gaming performance checking out Marvel
future fight the Qualcomm 820 powered
galaxy s7 doesn't play as smooth as the
Exynos powered note 5 and is noticeably
choppier than the iPhone though we don't
know exactly what kind of scaling might
be employed considering the resolution
differences the Android and iOS app
ecosystems are well mature and while
developers still might favor iOS 4
bleeding edge services no one can build
a winning app strategy these days if
they ignore Android for too long
you really can't pick a winner between
Android or iOS if you're just looking at
the number of apps in the store now the
galaxy s7 might frustrate some Android
fans though as there still doesn't seem
to be any option in the app drawer to
automatically alphabetize your apps for
less commonly used services it's nice to
know where to look based on spelling but
Samsung requires users re-alphabetize
manually with each new app installation
and I'm still going to be a cranky old
man about the fact that we can't get a
single column settings menu anymore
what's interesting coming from last
year's comparison is watching Apple
expand how you can interact with the
iPhone by incorporating pressure
gestures we can't rightfully
Claire that the iPhone offers simpler
navigation through the UI anymore
Android remains consistent with
dedicated home back and multitasking
keys but to fully use the iPhone 6s a
user has to rote memorize which apps can
interact with 3d touch and whether those
options are even worth interacting with
it's nice that we can take some of the
pressure off of the home button by
multitasking through a gesture but this
prescient slide doesn't work as
consistently as a home button DoubleTap
it's tough to reach when holding the
phone right-handed and just isn't as
easy to trigger as having a dedicated
multitasking key Samsung also offers the
superior one handed mode pulling the
screen down on the 6s won't always help
when you have to reach across the screen
to hit a back button this mini screen on
the Galaxy s7 can help those with even
the most petite hands access the full
device with a minimum of repositioning
it in your hand the two company
philosophies remain unchanged
customization versus consistency but the
early transition of adding more controls
to iOS without adding more buttons
hasn't been particularly graceful moving
to cameras it's exciting watching Apple
increase sensor resolution and Samsung
reduce sensor resolution to meet at 12
megapixels 40 32 by 30 24 while those
resolutions match the sensor size
advantage and inclusion of optical image
stabilization provides for noticeably
better low-light sensitivity and a
softer blur to background elements in
the photos taken with the galaxy s7
Samsung still exposes brighter than
Apple in most situations brighter than
they need to but the difference is
narrower than in previous years and
Samsung sensor exhibits fantastic
dynamic range not surprisingly the
iPhone now uses a more aggressive noise
reduction profile for indoor lighting
situations fine details will be splotchy
err this is a byproduct of not having as
much surface area for larger pixels to
soak up light both phones shoot natively
in a four by three aspect ratio but
Samsung uses a slightly wider lens a 27
millimeter equivalent over Apple's 29
millimeter equivalent delivering a wider
field of view Samsung's dual pixel
focusing tech does seem to provide
faster responses than Apple's system
Apple's animation for focus lock is a
bit more pleasant
but react juez ition is noticeably
quicker on the galaxy samsung also
scores a victory for front-facing camera
performance the wider lens is easier to
nail that selfie which also shows off
the location behind you it's surprising
to see Apple implement the more
aggressive color on indoor lighting
situations exaggerating the pigment of
my skin and if you ever want to shoot
video or do some vlogging Apple will
only let you shoot 720p video while
Samsung can deliver four times that
resolution from the front camera quad HD
to match the phone screen resolution for
actually controlling the camera Apple
has been extremely conservative and
adding features to the iPhone camera app
this creates a somewhat bizarre
situation where you have to completely
leave the app to change settings like
video resolution also in maintaining
this sliding action to move between
photos and videos we still have a square
crop option but there's no widescreen
crop option we can add filters to photos
but this area is deactivated for any
controls or filters and video and
toggling HDR and flash settings the app
moves the control target on you tap here
to get options then move over to your
composition window to find tiny yellow
texts to change the setting if you miss
that tiny text the camera thinks you're
trying to focus this app really hasn't
aged very gracefully and is in need of
an overhaul as consumers rely more and
more on their phones for content
creation Samsung on the other hand is
managed to maintain a fairly simple to
use auto mode while including a pro mode
with full manual controls for those who
want them resolution and aspect ratio
are easy to alter from your composition
window HDR and flash settings toggle in
place they don't move the target on you
filters work for both Stills and 1080p
video and while it's frustrating that
video options block your composition
window at least altering these settings
don't require you to completely leave
the camera app overall Samsung maintains
a healthy lead over Apple for camera
prowess even with the two producing the
same resolution images will have a
separate video reviewing the galaxy s7
camera in excruciating detail but early
usage is pointing to this being a
formidable performer taking a listen to
audio the fight is fairly close for
speaker playback the iPhone is about 2
decibels louder on average but it
produces a thinner duller sound the
Galaxy s7
isn't quite as loud but the audio
produced is fuller with better
separation between instruments in a
little more bass
you
the iPhone 6s will likely perform better
for ringtones alerts and speakerphone
situations the galaxy s7 wins when
listening to music watching films and
playing games
however the iPhone scores a decisive
victory for headphone playback in
producing a substantially louder signal
with the same noise floor the
signal-to-noise ratio means your music
will be louder and noise created by the
iPhone will be quieter than what the
galaxy s7 can produce it's a shame we
don't have a more powerful amp in this
phone as it falls behind what the note 5
can produce for headphone playback more
subjectively I prefer the flatter EQ of
the Samsung as Apple subtly boosts the
bass and treble on the iPhone
occasionally higher pitched instruments
will sound shrill or brittle the bass
can overpower audio in the mid-range but
the differences between these two out of
the box are not extreme depending on
what headphones you use the more
powerful amp on the iPhone will likely
impress more than the conservative EQ on
the galaxy both of these phones were
testing here are 18 t versions and both
seem to perform well on big blues
network around my neck of the woods the
Galaxy would report a four to six
decibel reception advantage over the
iPhone these tiny bands on the galaxy
rim don't have as much surface area as
the iPhone antenna bands but we're
possibly seeing the aluminium shell
Blackmore signal than Samsung's glass
back early battery testing on the galaxy
s7 is proving positive this phone is
only starting its third full recharge so
you'll have to check out our full review
for more in depth stats but our video
playback test 30 minutes of HD video
streaming over Wi-Fi at 50% brightness
resulted in 5% battery drop making it a
top performer in this benchmark my
iPhone 6s at launch sipped 7% battery
but almost 6 months later it now drains
8% on the same test it's clear that the
iPhone is still more efficient per tamp
but the galaxy s7 combats this by
including a 40% larger battery using the
chargers which came in the box the
galaxy s7 managed a 25% recharge after
20 minutes plugged in while the iPhone
topped off around 22% over the same
period of time a smaller battery not
delivering any advantage for charging
the phone faster Samsung also built
wireless charging into the galaxy s7 for
more flexibility in how you
recharge your phone so let's wrap this
up first of all it's always tough
comparing the iPhone launched towards
the end of one year against the galaxy
which comes out the beginning of the
next year they'll always be leapfrogging
each other but his apple doesn't stage
their releases between flagship and
phablet Apple and Samsung intend for
these two phones to compete against each
other here and now whether you think a
phone needs it samsung devices just come
with more stuff 40% more battery twice
as much storage with the ability to add
more twice as much RAM three and a half
times more resolution on a brighter
screen a bigger camera sensor a heart
rate monitor water resistance wireless
charging and even this nifty little USB
OTG adapter in the box now that Samsung
has refined the build quality and
aesthetics for their phones
the pricing tables have turned the base
model galaxy s7 sells between $20 and
$50 more than the iPhone 6s depending on
carrier Apple has the louder headphone
jack a hardware mute switch a reversible
cable and 3d touch iOS is a familiar
operating system but we see some of the
challenges in adding new features to the
simpler UI making it not as simple as it
used to be for the last couple
generations of phones it's been getting
more difficult to point to an area where
Apple really truly excels for most
consumers people will likely stay with
whatever ecosystem they started using in
the first place and we're not likely to
recommend people switch sides over one
phone but as a consumer where is your
money actually going here we're sure you
have thoughts and we want to hear them
can Samsung sway iOS users over to
Android with more features and better
Hardware can Apple bring increasingly
complicated new technology to iOS
without disrupting the ease of use and
is the flagship battle even worth
fighting anymore as lower cost mid
rangers are becoming more attractive
