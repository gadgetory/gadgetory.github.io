being the best Windows Phone out there
is it really the case let's check it out
in our full review right now
when Nokia announced the Lumia 925 at
its special event in London the buzzword
of the day was aluminum
however the Lumia 925 is not made
completely out of this material and is
not a unibody phone the back panel which
is not only user removable is made out
of polycarbonate this time a very soft
touch version of it Nokia also slightly
tweaked the design of the Lumia 925
while one can still instantly recognize
it as a Nokia phone it is somewhat
different from the Lumia 920 and Lumia
928 it is no longer the tank its
predecessor was instead we're looking at
a thinner more elegant slicker version
of the film in addition to some design
tweaks Nokia also improved its PureView
camera over the unit on the Lumia 920 by
throwing in an additional six plans for
better overall sharpness colour
reproduction and image quality for a
detailed look at all the aspects of the
phone make sure to check out our full
review over at PocketNow and subscribe
to our social media channels so you
don't miss anything going around the
device you will see a nice piece of
Gorilla Glass 2 taking up the entire
front slightly curved blending in with
the aluminum on the sides behind the
glass is worthy 4.5 inch pure motion HD
plus ClearBlack AMOLED screen resides
with a resolution of 768 by 1280 for a
PPI rating of 334 the your piece is at
the top alongside the sensors a 1.2
megapixel wide-angle webcam and the
Nokia branding while the bottom is
specific to any Windows Phone with the
back home and search buttons nicely
backlit and glowing in white the
aluminum goes all the way around the
phone on the edges and while there's
nothing for us to show you on the left
and the bottom part the right edge is
also specific to Nokia windows phones
with buttons for volume up and volume
down power and camera these two are made
out of aluminum and have a nice click to
them up top there's a micro SIM tray a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack a
secondary microphone for noise
cancellation as well as the micro USB
port for syncing and charging the camera
is what instantly pops out when you look
at the back of the Lumia night
five the second-generation peer review
unit with the optical image
stabilization improved the light
performance carl zeiss lens and a system
containing an additional six lens for
improved picture quality above the
construction there's a dual LED flash
rather powerful and the bottom holds the
speaker grill just below the three
connectors which provide wireless
charging once a special accessory back
cover is slapped on or what you can see
is the same dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 processor from the Lumia
920 and 928 clocked at 1.5 gigahertz one
gig of ram 16 gigabytes of
non-expandable storage there will be
some 32 gigabyte exclusive versions plus
all the usual suspects Wi-Fi Bluetooth
and IC sensors and a two thousand
milliamp hour battery needless to say
that the phone feels exceptional in the
hand and the materials used are premium
we only have two things to complain
about the flimsy squeaky back cover
which sounds like this and the slight
gap on the bottom but Nokia told us it
is by design we believe them but don't
necessarily accept it a premium device
should comes quick and gap free Windows
Phone is just that Windows Phone fluid
as it ever was with no noticeable lags
or stutters the ecosystem has improved a
lot but you still won't find that
YouTube app Google apps
Instagram Facebook pages manager and
some other applications which are there
on competing platforms there are
third-party solutions though as far as
the OS itself is concerned that still
needs some more features to close the
gap between Windows Phone and Android as
well as iOS then update is expected soon
and we hope for the best
nokia went all-in to deliver a good user
experience bundling applications which
come in very handy like the entire here
shoot for free voice-guided
online and offline navigation location
discovery and traffic where available
nokia music is a nice alternative to
Xbox music and additional titles like
app highlights or photo Beamer all add
to the experience as far as imaging is
concerned the fins bundled their own
Nokia smart cam app which enables you to
unleash your creativity and take the
windows from camera to the next
level action shots motion blurs best
faces unwanted object removal and more
are all featured that plus the creative
studio for easily adding defects
distills we have spent five solid days
with the Nokia Lumia 925 and have used
it mainly in the city of Florida
reception was solid oftentimes one bar
better than any other phone and call
quality was just as good we sounded good
to people on the other end of the line
and that's how they sounded to us the
noise cancellation is doing a great job
speakerphone performance is also good
though the loudspeaker and the back
oftentimes requires a hand cup gesture
to direct the sound towards us data was
also reliable which be just as good as
on any other phone depending on the
carrier's limitation and signal strength
when it comes to camera performance we
have no doubt that the Lumia 925 is the
best shooter on Windows Phone at the
moment that until Nakia makes it
obsolete with its iOS announcement soon
until then pictures come out clear
bright and crisp though sometimes we
wish we could have captured more detail
thanks to peer review stage two the
Lumia 925 is a king when it comes to the
light performance we are yet to find a
phone which can come close to it the one
third of an inch backside illuminated
sensor coupled with optical image
stabilization does an exceptional job
battery life was also good for eighty
two thousand milliamp our unit our
typical uses scenario included five to
ten short voice calls initiated and
received same amount of text messages
some Facebook AIIMS about ten emails
received and just as many sent moderate
web browsing about fifteen minutes of
gameplay some music streaming a short 15
minute session of GPS navigation as well
as taking 10 to 20 pictures we started
our day off at 6 a.m. in the morning and
at midnight we were still good to go for
three more hours on our next attempt the
second day we almost doubled our usage
and the battery died on us shortly
before 11 p.m. there is no doubt that
the Lumia 925 is the best Windows Phone
on the market today
of course we'll understand if you don't
order one right now after seeing this
review knowing that one this unlock unit
set us back about 750 dollars and to the
Nokia iOS is just around the corner if
you don't care about any of those that
by all means go for the best even if
you're not a fan of the platform
if Android doesn't appeal to you and you
prefer not to have an iphone the Lumia
925 is the right choice we rate the
Nokia Lumia 925 and 8.3 mainly because
of the flimsy backplate which just
doesn't feel right when it's flakes else
all our complaints are more towards
windows film than nakiye and it's Lumia
925 everyone that's gonna do it for
