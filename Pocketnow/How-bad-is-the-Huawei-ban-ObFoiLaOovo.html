frustrations on me by threatening by
threatening to buy something inexpensive
it's like a weekly think now oh my god
but have it but have you seen the prices
of those new MacBook Pros Apple is
insane oh yeah they are absolute $6,000
I was like what off
hello everybody and welcome to the
weekly brought to you by Pocky now next
day developers recorded on this day May
23rd that is a Thursday we're trying to
get it so that we record a little bit
early that way I can actually do the
YouTube premiere on Friday so you get
that old-school feel of the weekly every
single Friday I thank you so much for
joining us we are back in our studios
and honestly I feel like I brought the
bad London weather back with me because
it is raining in LA and it is the most
depressing thing anybody out there who
knows Angelenos Los Angelenos we hate it
when it rains but let's check in with
our crew today we are back with our
original crew we were going to have an
arrive Gandia on but he has a few family
things going on so shuts out to an Arab
hopefully we'll have you on two casts
soon so what was going to be a
four-person podcast is now three as
usual we have of course hi made a vet I
hear oh you're back in your New York
studio not pretty much if you could call
this you and I just saw each other in
London it was a good time but of course
we're gonna talk about all the stuff
that went down while we were there it
was crazy that it was happening during
the Honor Lodge but anyways
quick quick check-in with you hi Mei how
are things I was a travel back home
travel was bad I was not supposed to
sleep on the flight but the seat was so
good I I couldn't I couldn't avoid I'm
gonna on this thought I start turning
down upgrades next time oh nice so it's
gonna be a little bit of jet lag on your
end then huh I'm good I'm good I was
able to sleep a good five hours last and
that helps also okay I feel like
especially on the podcast associate when
we have I'm gonna I'm gonna turn the
camera over the high me real quick take
a look at this shirt he's wearing I feel
like you need to start putting links in
descriptions of shirts that you are cuz
that's so cool
I know I know the Red Ranger the Red
Ranger in the next wing well practically
in an exercise that's so cold the thing
is I can't there are certain shirts that
I can use for the daily because of the
green screen so these are the shirts
that I use on the podcast hilarious not
like elements popping on your shirt so
it's hilarious cuz one of my favorite
YouTube channels is WatchMojo and the
day that they select to to select us is
one of the best tech channels and Thank
You WatchMojo for that they you
of file where I am having I'm using this
shirt that had green and you could see
everything transparent behind me it was
hilarious that's awesome
all right let's pop it over to Brendan
minimun who is back once again so how
are you have been witnessed to a couple
of things going on over the last couple
of weeks so your perspective is gonna be
really fun to get but I just want to
check in with you first before we get
started yeah it's been a while and I'm
in one of these offices it's super green
and so the all the light switches are on
like a timer that shut off every like
interval and if it has a motion sensor
built up to the light switch so I can
like wave my hands at it but I'm
slightly out of like its line of sight
so at some point the lights gonna turn
off and I'm gonna have to get up and
turn it back on
get rid of get rid of that light when
I'm there if that's gonna be the studio
get rid of that light alright so our
money daily yeah exactly
okay so Brandon let's go ahead and start
off with you for this week's show
because since the two of you were not on
last week which was basically our big 1
plus 7 pro extravaganza we had a TK Bay
and David Amell on last week and we had
a lot of differing opinions about just
sort of opinions over the phone itself I
came in with a hot take that the phone
is too big it's I just think it's too
big and I want to start off with that
Brandon some thoughts from you starting
about design you can talk about whatever
you'd like
Jaime's already got his oh you got the
t-mobile one I forgot about that yes and
I wanted this color so badly and yeah so
let's start off with you Brandon because
we haven't heard from you in a bit and I
know you were really excited to talk
about the phone when we were not allowed
to talk about the phone which is why I
want to start with you yeah I've got the
the the blue and like can we just admire
how this blue is actually a matte blue
like like they don't even you know more
of those doesn't even talk about how
it's a matte blue but it is and that's
just a it's a gangster color but but I
will agree with you Josh that it's too
big and I think something that nobody is
really talking about is that the 1 + 7
is a heck of a sleeper phone that has
more upgrades than most people realize
it's got yeah
dual stereo speakers which we've been
asking on asking for for a very long
time for one postpones of course the 7
pro has it but now the 7 has it it's got
the upgraded sony 48 megapixel camera
plus some other improved optics and it's
got UF s3 storage and snapdragon 855 so
for the 1 plus 60 fans the people that
like you know that one plus experience
at a slightly smaller form factor the 1
plus 7 is where it's at
the 7 pro is amazing it's it's like it's
like a Bentley you know it's got
everything it's just so beautiful it's
so fast it's so sexy but like from a
practical standpoint from a from a
utilitarian standpoint in my opinion
it's a little too much it's a little too
fragile it's a little too big and I
can't wait for the 1 plus 7 regularly ma
am I the only person that didn't like
the 1 plus 60 yes I did not like the 60
I was I was so disappointed when it
launched even though I love the woman
because I love the 1 plus 6 that was my
power ok
but what about my car division that's
the one that I adored so so here's the
thing the 60 is thinner significantly
thinner than the 6 re the 6 is
significantly thinner than the 60 and so
if they brought the display of the 60 on
the 6 gave me that fingerprint scanner
at the back of the front I don't care I
just I would be even willing to put up
with a smaller battery if they gave me
that phone because I felt that that was
the easier phone to handle yeah that's
true that was the easier photo handle
like right now for example I'm working
on a comparison with the best n+ dude
you like you'll be shocked at how much
larger the 60 is compared to even the
s10 plus which is already the size of an
iPhone Tenace max hmm think about it the
s10 plus is the exact same sizes of
tennis max so imagine the 6 the 7 pro is
larger than both of these phones yes
after I do agree with you it's a curved
phone that's large it's a little bit
difficult to handle I wish that the
gestures were a bit different
oh the gesture so you're talking about
the how you can go back on so yeah so
you can go backwards from the bf to
reach all the way yeah we have to reach
all the way to that it can get pretty
bad
the
the thing that gets me is okay so
obviously have my 1 plus 7 Pro gear I've
been using this in conjunction with the
pixel 3a those have been my two daily
drivers and my final reviews on them are
going to be coming out fairly soon but
the thing that strikes me this is this
is the number one example of why
usability is underrated in flagship
phones to be able to wake up in the
morning and comfortably I want to be use
the word comfortably swipe type to you
to to anybody on whatsapp or any of
those other messaging applications
without fear of dropping the phone while
brushing my teeth like that just doesn't
happen on the 1 plus 7 Pro I could drink
tea in one hand and then swipe type easy
right here smaller phones are incredibly
underrated and I'm so glad we finally
have one that's actually like showing us
that it um I have the pixel 3 out here -
oh I want that case that case looks
really good
the that's the felt one on the back
right yeah but I this color in
particulars really yeah
ok so speaking of speaking of device
like other devices that we have I do
have one thing I want to say I'm not
gonna talk about it at length I'm just
gonna let everybody know that right now
I'm gonna go ahead and unbox this is the
Opel Reno this is the - it this is the
10x zoom version by the way this is the
one everyone's clamoring for so I'm
gonna go ahead and unbox this while I
asked our two other hosts today so other
hot takes on the oneplus 7 pro screen is
great 1990 Hertz refresh rate games may
not be supporting 90 hurts a whole lot
yet so there's some that do some that
don't but the high tech that I want to
put out there is I want to hear what you
guys actually thought about the camera
because it is the most conflicting part
of this phone for me I actually
personally would not use this phone as a
daily vlogging slash photography fun if
I do I'm keeping that phone at 1x that's
what I was gonna say so some thoughts
from you guys about the cameras on the
oneplus ever Pro I was gonna say Josh
one I am a heavy swipe user like you and
something that has made a huge
difference for me and I noticed you're
using your phone naked but if you use a
case it just helps tremendously with the
grip and I know you're probably muted
right now as you unbox with the oh no
I'm sorry
like I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay what
case is on the phone and it kind of
helps but it's not necessarily the grip
of the phone it's the fact that I'm
reaching all the way over if I'm
starting a word if I have a word
starting with the letter A I'm screwed
all the way over there that's just well
and you know what we've already created
the joke two weeks ago that okay maybe
Josh have small hands you know what fine
I probably do but whatever it's still it
still changes usability no dude I have
large hands and I have a problem
reaching reaching the fence don't get me
wrong it's it's not a bad thing it's
just um there's a reason why one of my
favorite phones as a foreign factor not
functionality is the iPhone 10s not the
tennis oh I'm sorry grateful that I've
had two 10s I've been saying that a lot
lately
Brandon you got the 10s max and you
didn't like it you sent it back and you
ended up getting the 10s because you
know it's literally the same phone only
that's it's easy to handle
yeah the tennis is where it's at I mean
it's just like it's a great one-handed
phone which is crazy to say for a phone
that has such a large screen like if you
go back a few years what is it like six
six point is it five point eight six
point five point eight which is which is
actually relatively large still and yet
the proportions just make it like it's a
really good one-handed phone it really
is yeah it is a really good one-handed
phone the same thing I feel about the
pixel 3a I am this close to reaching out
to Google and asking them to send me the
pixel three and I can send Mac and send
back my three excel hmm I don't mind I
think that the pixel three is where it's
at you have the pixel three Brandon and
you do the same thing you got the three
excel and then you sent it back as well
I still have both but the pixel three is
amazing for one-handed you can maybe
borrow it when you come next week all
right let's do that let's do that right
now what do you mean maybe you're gonna
do that no I I really really like it's
not that I like small phones like there
are benefits to large phones don't get
me wrong but when companies are as a
pair efficient as one plus because
that's just the way it is their phones
are really really good when it comes to
power efficiency I wonder why this phone
is so large is there a purpose for it
being this largest there's that one
pleasant slowly waiting into tablet
territory that's that's really what it
honestly if the if the screen oh I
almost picked up the Reno if the screen
wasn't curved here on the sides it would
basically be a 6.5 internet with yeah
that's the thing
Oh coming back to the by the way real
quick just open Reno look at this like
sort of backless dress type case that
that they give with the Opel Reno whoa
that's awesome weird
I like that okay so any thoughts on
cameras because I would that was what I
already heard had originally asked
wide-angle zoom that Sony IMX
48 megapixel sensor which obviously is a
great performer I think it's a good
sensor I think the rest of the camera is
not as good as it should be personally
but thoughts from you you you're asking
who particularly because I lost you uh
let's start with Brandon that yeah let's
let's see what Rendon says about you
were so excited about the one plus seven
Perot did the cameras live up to that
hype of yours yeah you know I'm gonna
say something that you guys are gonna
disagree with um I I really like the
cameras on the seven Pro a lot of the
time you know I've spent so much time
taking pictures and a lot of the time
when you really get into like a hundred
percent crop there's they're soft but
like if I take the same shots with like
an s10 plus in my opinion they're even
softer I think that the camera on the
seven pro and the sixty cuz there are
similarities is better I think the seven
Pro is a fantastic camera it's obviously
not good as a pixel but I I think that
they're fantastic if I think go ahead
sorry
yeah just can see they're they're a
little soft at times and the video focus
isn't that great but Jaime you know more
about cameras what do you think okay so
I like the wide angle on the seven Pro
more than I do on the galaxy again I'm
working on a video why there is less
Barry there is significantly less barrel
distortion significantly yeah but the
but the edges are so soft and like the
photos are so soft there's no detail in
this wide angle okay no I'm not saying
you so okay so here's the thing again
we're talking about photos right now I
it's just wow it's we're gonna move into
wall way territory very soon
the problem is once you use something
like the p30 pro or the made 20 pro it's
really hard to grab any other phone and
be like yeah this cameras good it's very
hard I have to agree with you Brandon I
mean the photos on the s10 plus are good
I like the dynamic range I find that
like I don't really find much of a
difference with the 1 + 7 Pro I just
find less barrel distortion on the 7 Pro
I don't know if it's the thing about
your unit because I don't notice much
darkness it's just lets we're gonna move
into Iowa territory soon in and that's
where everything gets spoiled it like if
you've never tried a p30 pro or a made
20 pro you guys are fine you guys don't
know any better but once you do it's
like oh god it's like alright fine let's
move on
oh my god I don't know I just I just
personally was really disappointed by it
because I oh you know me I always look
for white angles on my phones I love
white angle lenses I think that they
associate when it comes a video they're
really awesome for just getting as much
in the frame as possible because a lot
of the times the focal lengths for
lenses on smartphones tend to be just a
little bit too narrow especially on the
front-facing camera which is another
disappointment of mine because it is a
very tight frame and there's nothing
that I can do to fix that because it's a
pop-up camera so I can't clip my moment
lenses on there or my serially lenses on
so it's it's doubly a problem and I get
it the the pop-up camera and the same
thing will go for this by the way I just
took the plastic off of it so the same
goes for this that shark-fin or whatever
they want to call it
pop-up I can't put a clip-on lens on
that either so like that's it's kind of
a pitfall when it comes to these so I
would say companies if you're going to
go to hiding your front-facing cameras
please make them a little bit wider
please that's all I ask
as far as the wide angle is concerned on
the main camera of the oneplus 7 pro I
just think it's a soft camera there is I
still think there's enough to sort on
the sides to bother me but that wouldn't
bother me so much if the picture was
sharp and it is just not so that's my
main issue along with the fact that you
can't use it on in the video mode the
zoom is fine I kind of get it I get it
that zoom lenses on all of these phones
are usually there for portrait mode so I
can give that a pass usually
and the 3x I actually think 3x is a
perfect focal length I think that 2x is
mostly useless 5 to 10 X zoom for
something like this that has
applications but it's not the most
practical thing to use 3 not bad
I actually think 3x is not bad from a
practical standpoint ok so let you see
here what else can we
oh yeah just some thoughts real quick on
the 1 + 7 Pro the price that's the thing
because we had very spirited
conversations back in New York about
whether or not the price actually
actually adhered to not only the whole
well I mean 1 + doesn't really use the
flagship killer motto anymore it's
always never settled but $669 699 up to
$7.99 for the most effective version x'
any thoughts from you about if the price
actually meets what this phone provides
i feel it does i there's nothing to
complain about when it comes to the
price tag
it is still an entry-level 1 + 7 pro is
still at the price tag of an iphone 5
years ago mmm five years ago and it
wasn't like that iphone back then was
what 32 gigs of storage not expandable I
mean there's simply no room for
comparison it's very difficult I just
the problem of the price tag is the
timing the timing of the launch is at
the time when you can get a Galaxy S 10
plus for like very little money as
employee s 10s 10 plus I mean you like
right now you could get a dual-sim S 10
plus for $700 on eBay oh I don't know
that right now yeah and so but here's
the thing if you wanted to get a 12
gigabytes of RAM 256 gigs of storage
galaxy s 10 you're looking at the
ceramic variant which is 1400 bucks so I
don't I don't think that the price tag
is bag.i I feel that you're getting a
ton of value for that amount of money
okay Brendon I think it's incredibly
obvious I do think that the closest
competitor to this phone is the S 10
plus and even even though they've come
down in price even if they're like in
the mid 7os
you know the 8gig of ram version which
is what i would probably get I think
twelve I don't think we really see a
performance difference is $6.99 it's
less expensive and in my opinion it's
superior in every way I much rather live
with this phone than an s10 plus so I
think the price is fantastic and to be
able to get into this phone at 669
that's great
I mean it's just I think it's really
great pricing it's not like old one plus
pricing that was like I can't believe
they did that but it's like the value
prop is just like I think very obvious
and very good yeah I'm I have to say I
think I'm somewhere in the middle
because again it's just it's just the
cameras didn't it really do it for me
like I still think that the Sony IMX 40
a megapixel sensor is amazing so if you
stick with that one you're gonna have an
amazing time even with video it's very
sharp video it's very it's very
beautiful looking video had plenty of
some of the fellas had plenty of
examples of good looking video from
Google i/o and yeah using just the 1x if
you keep it on 1x you're gonna have a
great great time as far as everything
else is concerned about 656 69 for
performance a great gaming mode a great
display good audio I'm not gonna say
it's amazing audio but well this is the
other thing the box did not come with a
headphone adapter right no it doesn't
come with it that's weird I don't know
why that's the case unless they're
looking to bundle the bullet's Wireless
which I'm using and I adore which but
but if you think about it I mean I did I
did that you know declaration in my
hands on video I mean if you're getting
a 6 69 1 + 7 Pro with $100 on the
bullets Wireless - you're still paying
less money than a lot of phones out
there mmm yeah that don't even come with
headphones in the box yeah you know
speaking of headphones there is actually
a kind of cool looking hair in this
ocarina box
these look like bullets but they're
green because oh no nevermind they don't
look like bullets they have different
they have a different redact redact not
bullets alright so moving from the 1 + 7
Pro we do have another phone that we can
talk about actually only really Jaime
can talk about because he's the only one
who's actually holding one unfortunately
because which I which
have to send it back oh that's true yeah
so we were I was actually quite excited
for this because I have always been a
fan of what honor does they put out good
price points for phones that have really
good specifications generally back in
the day honor used to like dominate
Amazon with like the 7x and that did
they have a tech song I know the 7x was
on Amazon for sure and I know people
actually bought it there because it was
at the top of the list of like smart
phone lists on Amazon because it was
like $400 for some pretty good
specifications and like dual cameras on
the back back when dual cameras were
starting to become a thing in any case
what we have now is the honor 20 and the
honor 20 Pro the honor 20 series if
you're looking for the hashtag that is
what Jaime and I were in London for and
we were only there for a few days
unfortunately because of news we'll talk
about later we were unable to walk away
with final retail review units
technically because and again I'm
alluding to all we're gonna talk about
later they are actually not fully final
in any case as far as the phone is
concerned another phone with the Sony 48
megapixel IO makes sense where we have a
six point two six inch tall view display
the yeah six point two yeah six point
two Kirin 980 good performance and their
GPU turbo 3.0 so if you're a gamer this
phone will will support you in a number
of different games I think it's up to
like 40 different games that it supports
right now to actually boost everything
but yeah the the phone itself kind of an
exciting device Jaime has had the most
time with it so I was I know I may you
might be having some spotty connection
connection right now but how how has the
honor 20 been treating you over the last
couple of weeks I can't say man I I wish
I could say that I've tried it enough
it's just we were all supposed to return
it they were gonna provide review units
right at the show they did not up I
don't think I think we should actually
start with the huawei topic before this
topic because obviously honor is being
affected honor is part of the I think
it's one of 68 companies in the Huawei
group and it's the whole Huawei group
that's getting banned okay
and so I feel bad because you know honor
is trying to get give us a good
one-handed phone a good alternative and
camera
and I don't know man I don't know what
to tell you I feel that I haven't been
able to use it much because again I mean
what is gonna be the future of this
field there's so much uncertainty yeah
that's true and you know what I think I
think we can go ahead and do that then I
we can definitely start with the the
hallway stuff because I wanted to keep
it on device talk and then I figure we
would have a lot to say about like the
the different aspects to this band that
is happening right now but I also do
realize that Brandon you're gonna have
to duck out in about 15 minutes but yeah
we can definitely talk about that
Brandon since you do have to duck out in
a little bit I actually want to let's go
and ask you about this whole hallway ban
and all of that stuff so obviously last
week we don't have to recount too much
of the details but basically the u.s.
just basically put wahwee on the list of
companies that US companies should not
be working with and subsequently what
happened is that Google in compliance
with this executive order had to pull
the licenses for Huawei devices and
Huawei group is the is the company that
they put on the list which includes
people like honor so right now there's a
lot of uncertainty over whether or not
these phones especially moving forward
or even current phones are going to
remain with Google Play services coming
from I mean we were in London Jaime and
I were while this whole band was
happening we all had our reactions to a
Brandon I want to hear what you think
yeah before I talk about Huawei I just
want to mention something I had an honor
20 Pro passed through this office this
morning for a very brief period of time
and I took it out of the box of course
to play with it a bit it was the it was
the black version which of course is
like this beautiful stunning dark purple
with a black black gradient it's amazing
and I was playing with this phone and
I'm like damn this feels like this
reminds me so much of a p30 Pro but it's
significantly less expensive and it's
just it's sad that I I don't I don't
know it I don't know this for certain
but I just get the feeling that because
of the political situation it's possible
that the that the honor 20 and honor 20
pronoun or 20 light will be either at
worst discontinued or
not at worst be put off indefinitely
that's just a feeling I get I haven't
heard anything but that's just a feeling
I get and it's sad because it's such a
good phone for what I've seen the Holly
situation really bums me out because one
of the reasons 2019 is shaping up to be
such a cool phone year is because you
have a strong Samsung a strong apple a
strong huawei strong Oppo Xiaomi is
doing big things there's so much
competition
you know Samsung comes out with a
folding phone so what is why we do they
spend a lot of R&amp;amp;D dollars and time
making a similar device that does it in
a different way and competitions amazing
so if if Huawei can't be Huawei because
they have their licenses pulled from
Google for the Android operating system
and if United States companies are not
allowed to do business with Huawei and
we can't sell Huawei devices here it's
just really unfortunate for the consumer
and I'm really bummed because it was
gonna be a good year in phones and I
think now there's a slightly less chance
that that's going to be now I'm gonna
add I'm gonna add another layer to all
of this but Jaime you can respond to
what Brendan just said mostly about
because I what I notice about a lot of
our tech friends is that we focus on the
devices we focus on device news we focus
on the releases that are happening this
year but there's obviously a lot more to
this whole thing right I'm gonna put in
the whole layer of 5g like all of the
main news outlets are talking about 5g
as the reason why all of these bands are
happening because Huawei actually
creates a lot of infrastructure that
will lead to 5g becoming a realization
obviously we know people from Qualcomm
who and Qualcomm are always working on
5g they are all about that 5g right now
but basically it's like I was watching
Trevor Noah the other day and he
basically said that it's this is the new
arms race not arms race space race is 5g
I also noticed that Jaime's hi Mary
there yeah he's frozen
okay well Brendan I wanted to go ahead
and keep you on the keep you on here
then 5g adding in the layer of 5g you're
talking about devices and I think we all
agree that it's not it's not an ideal
situation that Huawei who make
really great devices don't don't get to
have those devices with Android anymore
like this whole war between the US and
China is affecting millions of people
who don't even live in these two
countries which is the biggest bummer
but adding in the whole 5g discussion
how does that change the whole
perspective for you if at all you know I
I hear some headlines and I read some
news that relate to national security
and and wireless infrastructure and
competitiveness with other countries and
as a consumer I kind of don't want to
care about that I want to just like take
out my 5g phone and be like wow this is
fast but I realized there are some
sensitivities relating to national
security I don't think I'm enough on the
topic to to really speak on it well
coming for coming coming from the just
sort of the headline by the way I have
one thing that I need a rant on that I
think I'll do and after the after the
mid break but basically a lot of
headlines are coming out basically
saying that don't have me still frozen
basically they're saying that because
Huawei has become so good at creating
the infrastructure for mobile networks
that there 5g is actually closer to
being realized than any of the 5g in the
u.s. whether or not that is the case you
know coming from people like us that's
that's kind of that's not yet to be seen
I actually personally think that
Qualcomm has been making huge strides we
just saw some of that in Chicago with
like people bringing out their Samsung
devices and why not to check out 5g in
Chicago and they're able to like
download down an entire season of shows
in like a few seconds it's nuts so it's
not to say that 5g in the u.s. is like
behind or anything like that but of
course Huawei I mean they're able to
focus their R&amp;amp;D and all of their
resources on something a little bit
easier and they're also the company
that's so easy to vilify which I think
it's the part that's so unfair here is
that like if you want to talk about the
the overarching issues of let's say
China and some of the stuff that they do
as a government as a country and whatnot
I mean sure I mean that anyone could
probably say a number of things about
China has a
but to vilify a company that has done
nothing but just create really good
products that have helped consumers that
have allowed consumers to have
connectivity and to have a good time on
Android or anything like that and
basically cripple them when there's been
no no evidence of actual spying via the
devices now via the infrastructure IQ I
get that people are skittish about that
but via the devices there really hasn't
been any substantiative proof staying
that the devices are actually spying on
consumers and there are millions of
people who are enjoying those those
devices right now who might get affected
by all of this even in London Brendan we
had a bunch of people we saw a bunch of
people running around with huawei phones
of all different types of price points
it wasn't even just flagships people
were still using like them a10 and they
were really they were really happy with
them it seems and and no one really had
any answers to to what's going on I'm
Brendan did the lights go out and you're
in your office you got a little bit it
it might not work yeah I'll just die
it's fine I'll save the electricity I'm
doing it for the what is it the
generation Generation Z yeah I'm doing
it for you guys I'm safe I'm saving the
planet here on this podcast by not
turning the way exactly I have figured
out why people use an iPad or other
tablet as a photo-taking device I think
I figured it out and and I figured it
out at the 1 plus 7 Pro launch jaime and
i were sitting in are you gonna make fun
of dan Seifert yes i yeah that's going
to make I listen listen listen
so Dan Seifert you know fantastic tech
writer I respect him tremendously the
sitting two rows in front of us and at
first I see a beardy a beardy guy
handsome beardy guy looks very smart
taking pictures or video with his iPad
pro and I'm like no not here not here I
mean I mean the week the weekend before
I had seen someone at the zoo I saw
grandma at the zoo and I'm like okay
that makes sense she she wants a big
viewfinder or something but I'm like
this guy at the wolf 11 Pro Lodge
obviously
has a better capturing device on him
whether a DSLR or a a new iPhone or a
pixel or something why the bleep is this
guy
oh it's dan Seifert why is Dan using an
iPad to take pictures and I just you
know I've been thinking about it I think
I know why why because the camera on the
iPad pro is fantastic and it's possible
that you know I'm sure Dan has access to
every phone that he could ever possibly
want but it's possible that just on that
day he didn't have his pixel three on
him or his iPhone 10s and thus the
device on him that could take the best
possible picture in video was the iPad
pro I know that might seem very basic
but it made me feel a little bit better
do you guys have any idea why he was he
was doing news coverage on Twitter and
so the iPad camera is good enough I mean
that's the thing I can't say the same
thing about every other iPad camera but
the iPad pro the current model that
camera is good enough I think that's the
reason why I like I find myself like if
I go to events I end up using an iPhone
for absolutely all our pictures right um
and it's because the 2x is close enough
it's a 3 X is too much and then when you
go to low-light for some reason I
noticed that the iPhone defaults
optically more often than every other
Android phone that I've used and then
because I'm using a Mac to do the
coverage it's easier for me to just
airdrop everything to the Mac whereas if
he's using an iPad and the iPad is the
only device is using he doesn't really
need to airdrop anything it's just there
it's right there so you're saying it
like it's the ultimate connected camera
like it's got you know it's it's a big
canvas it's fast and it's connected to
all of your social media whereas to take
out his DSLR really would have to
transfer it process it post it you know
upload it things like that I was gonna
say he's a right exactly I was wondering
why it wasn't using his Fuji well but
that's the thing it's a do to have you
notice like there are a lot of great
things about Fuji from a cinematography
standpoint not a lot of great things
about it from an auto perspective like
if you want to transfer files from the
camera to your computer it's kind of a
night
yeah it's like Panasonic is well
Panasonic is not bad but it's not good
Sony's actually a little better at it
and so I'm dude iPhones are good enough
lately a lot of our event coverage are
simply iPhone photos
mmm yeah for sure okay so Brandon you
are alright so you are on your way out I
do want to make sure that we get this
question out to you and our recurring
segment from every show before you get
out of here Brandon I want to know what
is in your pocket now I'm still on the 1
+ 7 Pro I'm still not tired of it I
still really like it and gosh every time
I use a different phone I I know what
phone is on deck what I'm gonna use next
and you know I don't I think I'm gonna
stick with the 1 + 7 Pro until I can get
my hands on the 1 + 7 ok fair enough and
then it and then who knows after that
well here's to hoping that 1 + actually
sells the 7 because isn't that supposed
to be like for the other markets like it
their launch was in India yeah it's not
gonna launch here yeah it's not a
launcher it's on the other markets it's
coming in June you can import it thanks
to the power of the internet from
anywhere which I which I will do as soon
as you can buy it from one of many
places online and I can't wait but it's
not June yet so I gotta keep wait all
right cool well a quick farewell to
Brandon thank you so much for being on
this week and we will continue on after
Brandon makes his exit see you guys
thanks quick shout out to the sponsor of
this episode Netgear to get the kind of
blinding speed you know you want in your
home Netgear now has the nighthawk Wi-Fi
6 router it is capable of four times the
capacity compared to today's current
Wi-Fi standards which means more devices
working simultaneously without impacts
to speed and reliability and smartphones
and laptops and TVs are getting more and
more advanced the data that powers them
will need to be as high performance as
possible make sure your internet is
future-proof for services like Netflix
Hulu and even gaming you can turn your
Wi-Fi up to 6 with a nighthawk Wi-Fi 6
router add Netgear comm / Wi-Fi 6 that's
net gear.com / Wi-Fi and the number 6
it's the biggest revolution of Wi-Fi
ever
after that tiny little rant from Jaime
about a Wi-Fi router also don't forget
our mid-roll today we actually had a bit
of a router thing so maybe we're gonna
send that over because Brandon's been
using it so we're gonna send it over to
Jaime because it hopefully it'll help
the podcast alright are you kidding send
me that router now I would I made it we
will definitely tell Brandon about that
for sure but Jaime is back it seems the
connection is a bit more stable so let's
go ahead and ask you Brendan gave a few
of his thoughts
I did talk a little bit about the 5g
layer of the Huawei and the us-china
problems right now I do want to add that
in a little bit cuz I feel like a lot of
people are focusing on the device angle
and that's totally fine I get it
devices are very important to all of the
consumers and if Huawei can't put
Android on them things are going to
change but 5g seems to be also the other
crux of this argument so I don't know
where you kind of land on that whole
thing oh man I actually have more of an
opinion on I have more of an opinion on
the topic of devices but sure in the
case of 5g here's the thing the problem
is what happens when you have a company
that owns most well not most but a lot
of not a good half of the 5g patents
that are currently needed for the system
to work and so this is not me being pro
Huawei or anything this is me being pro
commerce this is a very difficult
situation where we have a country like
the United States that comes up with the
whole idea of free Commerce and any
company could come to make money here
and now out of the blue they come up
with these rules where they've been
enabling the Chinese market since the
1980s and now they've realized that the
China that there is a certain Chinese
company that has superior technology in
certain cases so and here's the thing
and I again this is not me trying to
defend because I don't have the
technical expertise the right judge for
it all I know is that right now certain
Huawei motives for 5g are faster than
competitors we have cases where you know
a lot of their technology is
significantly less expensive and so I do
understand the concern as to why but if
the if the argument is that this company
copied other companies in order to be
able to get where they are then why are
they superior hmm okay that's the
question that's the question I you know
how is it that they have so many patents
how is it they own the patents for so
many things if they copied other
companies in order to be able to ever
and I'm again I can't defend them I'm
not an expert in this I'm just trying to
understand all the information that's
being thrown and most of the information
is Huawei copied okay cool then why is
it that their modem is twice as fast why
is it that they own all these patents
that's the part that nobody's been able
to explain and so again this is not a
defense standpoint it's just what we're
hindering right now is progress why yeah
why is it that US companies can't why is
it that US companies can't come up with
something better if if you know the
whole concern is espionage fine I
totally understand that why don't we
start blocking Amazon and Google and all
these other companies from being able to
use the things that I say with this a
speaker that I have in front of me that
well you know I've been beat I've been
being served ads for everything like
just travel pants the other day I said
that I wanted travel pants I I get off
the I get off the plane and Kogan's with
me and I'm like look at this this pisses
me off the fact that I I'm being
targeted for ads of over the things that
I say so you're telling me that that's
okay and that other things are not why
do we allow this - yeah well because
it's a US company doing it to our own
citizens that was it's a joke in a way
but it's also true because I do think
that there's just so little little to no
evidence that hallway as a company on
the consumer level has actually been
spying on its on its consumers no matter
where they are in the world including
our lives are they but are they
potential to it yes that is one thing
where the United States is right the
fact that there is a law in China that
obligates these companies to provide
information to the government that is
true that is totally true and
I do its again I'm not trying to side in
favor of anyone I'm gonna play both ends
the United States is right and being
concerned about that by just you know
wow we put a company in the blacklist
here's the question have you thought
about the repercussions over yes Huawei
is going to lose a lot right now true
fine that's that's cool
how much is Google gonna lose right now
is the question think about it yeah they
have been in partnership with Huawei in
the past even got hardware level yeah
and think about it how much is Google
going tools we're talking about the
second largest smartphone maker in the
world where all they make is Android
phones so what happens with when a
company like Huawei decides to stop
using Android and what happens when a
company like Huawei if a company like
Huawei has decided to come up with 5g
technology and they came up with
superior technology in certain cases and
they own so many pens what limits them
to make a better operating system that's
true yeah isn't that isn't that the
recent piece of news that Huawei is
actually saying we will have an OS not
only will it not not only will it
support Android apps but you know we're
gonna have our own operating system that
could come out as early as the end at
the end of this year or early 2020 okay
so yeah that's I don't know that kind of
but the thing is even if while we make
their own OS just to to replace
quote-unquote Android but still support
Android apps doesn't learn a lot of the
core functions still going to be
crippled by the lack of a license like
Google Play games Google Gmail yes
that's that that's one thing that's one
thing but then 50% of their market is in
China where none of that is even
relevant yeah that's that's true but
that's but that's 50% they're still
50/50 percent of the rest of the world
is still a huge amount of people though
yeah well but here's the thing the thing
does get complicated as to what happened
yesterday which will be the day after
yesterday whenever people listen to this
and it would be arm the problem is once
you involve arm so my argument over the
last couple of days has been what
limits huawei to be able to come up with
something superior that's all you know
it's a possibility without arm they
cannot they can't arm is the creator of
the architecture and even though arm is
a UK company their technology is us
patented and based and so arm now has
declare that they're not going to be
working with Huawei anymore so this
doesn't just mean that the this pretty
much dooms the Kiran 980 and so without
the without the the the instruction set
for the chips they can't make phones
period like period this like this
totally flips everything on wall way wow
I didn't catch that yeah yeah this
totally flips everything on Huawei if
they can't make ARM chips and they can't
work with Qualcomm they can't use
Qualcomm chips they can't use so what
what's next the arm dubs so the arm code
is also being used for Exynos processors
every single mobile chip runs on arm and
so what are they gonna do they're gonna
move to six processors which is until
know because intel is a US company and
they are they are also forced to put
them in the blacklist and so now this is
a problem what happens when you can no
longer create chips or buy them what
happens now that is the things like as
of yesterday things have done like
really weird very difficult for Huawei
now yeah because now it's on the
hardware side that things are being yeah
well if they can't buy the hardware and
they can't create it then they're then
they are I don't even know if I can say
the word I'm not a boner podcast yeah
now now things get difficult now things
get really difficult because they're
gonna have to pretty much create their
own chip architecture yeah
I'm not I'm not saying they can't mmm
the question is how Android will not be
able to run on this there is another
chip architecture which Android runs on
I think it's MIPS
but it's nowhere even close to the
current status of arm yeah
so it would be like taking so many steps
back and so Wow like this is I had no
idea like falling in the blacklist
really really like really destroys
companies I I hope that that's not the
case because Huawei is probably the
company that invests the most amount of
our money on R&amp;amp;D that I've ever heard of
I think it was like 17 billion last year
Wow
where your average company is spending 3
to 4 billion in Rd 17 billion that's an
insane amount of money but because
they're a private company they could do
whatever they want with their money
while we were at the Honor thing did did
you get approached by any traditional
media to comment on all of this no but I
know you were how did that go okay I
just want to call out like you know we
are obviously quote-unquote the new
media we are the quote-unquote YouTube /
tech blogging press and whatnot so I
can't believe that I have to say this
right now I need to fact-check
the people who actually interviewed me
because I said that I love how honor
always tries to put like high-end
specifications for affordable price
points but because these guys are
actually I'm not gonna say who it's not
hard to find though the but because
these guys are obviously trying to focus
on the whole Huawei political angle bla
bla bla they changed that quote in
writing to honor makes affordable
handsets with high-end specifications
I said honor not Huawei I said honor and
on top of that as far as fact-checking
is concerned I am NOT a UK blogger they
called me a UK blogger so I was like how
do you expect anybody to be educated
about anything that's going on right now
when you can't even write down the stuff
properly in your copy so I was just oh
yeah that you're it's like if you were
talking about Fox News I know right I'd
you know it happens every country has
got their their trash media man every
country has them and I'm sorry if Fox
News Gaza gets offended over me calling
them that but whenever you manipulate
facts in order to give it a pull
litical angle I'm sorry that's trash
that is trash media you should be
ashamed of yourselves
yeah these articles that I saw from from
from various people who are at the event
we're slanting their articles always to
say hua hua Li hua Mei hua way and any
mention of honor honor is part of the
Huawei group but they are their own
company they create a good amount of
good products the honor Tony Pro is an
example of that product so it's just a
little it's very annoying when honor
gets you know they went to an event that
is honor but the word honor is uttered
far less in those articles than the word
Huawei is like it's an afterthought to
them it's like oh by the way we're at
the honor thing but but Huawei is bla
bla bla bla bla it's crazy like I I'm
happy to talk to anybody about any of
these things whether it's on TV or
anything like that one of our friends
Michael Josh was actually on the BBC
talking about this whole thing too which
was cool for him but yeah but yeah I
mean you have to like I don't know you
have to show you have to show justice
not only to the story itself but also to
the people who you bring on like and you
know you know here's the thing I mean I
don't think I have the preparation of
most of these journalists so I have a
lot of respect for those that remain
objective it's a very difficult topic
what's going on is concerning for me
because I am concerned over being
tracked and being followed the problem
is we've been living in a world where
we've been tracked and followed we
didn't create this thing I want you to
think about this who created the
possibility for you to be tracked in
maps Google who created the possibility
for ads to target you through voice
Amazon who created there are there are a
lot of services out there that what
they're white had it's services and
therefore we should allow them to track
us
there is nothing right about having a
company take advantage of my speech and
using that to try to sell me something
there's nothing correct about that and
so I think that this is a broader topic
that obviously so what should we be less
concerned because a us you because the
United States is doing it and not a
common
country I don't know man I mean sure it
could be used for espionage but my god
man I I mean like I don't know what I'm
more concerned about there is no type of
espionage where whether it be having a
company try to sell me something or
another company trying to use it for
other means none of it is correct so if
we're gonna attack the problem let's
please attack it you know fully I feel
that Apple is probably the company that
quote-on-quote is doing the best job at
avoiding this I'm gonna have to use
Apple as an example they encrypt
everything they were approached by
different government entities to try to
unlock a phone and it was clear that
they couldn't unlock it uh you know so
the question is who is trying to protect
the consumer what is trying so if the
United States is trying to protect the
consumer through this action that's
great I have to agree with it that is
awesome but it does leave it this leave
two challenges can we please do it for
every company one and number two can
companies please just act up and try to
work on making better phones because the
only reason why huawei has become so
popular is because they've started
making better phones so if US companies
are concerned over competition good I
challenge you guys come on
try to learn what this camera can do and
put it on this yeah or be less
compromising about other products and
actually make a thin but a powerful
laptop like yeah I mean look at this
thing yes this I wait wait why can that
have a GPU
inside and work and I can't have that in
a 13-inch MacBook Pro that cost a
thousand dollars more than that thing
yeah absolutely
and so and so we we have a big we have a
couple of challenges and again I I can't
sit down and defend anybody because I
don't know the facts the and there's no
such thing as alternative facts Fox News
there are only facts and that's in facts
are lies that's that
it's black or white facts or lies and so
I don't have all the facts I don't know
the information over national security
I'm not gonna talk about that what I am
gonna talk about is the reason why
Huawei has become so popular over the
last three to four years and it's
because they've been pushing out
superior products why is it that they
can if they have all the money right
they put all the R&amp;amp;D in they put all the
money in their R&amp;amp;D and they've come up
with superior products so why can't we
stop worrying about putting the new
putting more money in the pockets of
CEOs through the stock market and start
using that money into actually creating
companies that make us product superior
which is something let me ask you this
give me one u.s. smartphone company
that's not Apple that's actually popular
give me water that's zero
it's absolutely zero because because I
can't I can't even say it's Google
because their products are an
afterthought yeah and we had this
discussion over dinner one time where I
was saying like what did this be one I
don't think they have the gall to do
this but what if this was an opportunity
for Google to actually push pixel and to
push all of their devices you know but I
don't think they would have the gall to
do it honestly it would be great I'm am
I'm not saying that what they're listen
I mean here's the thing not absolutely
everything that's happening here is
necessarily bad think about the fact
that Google services don't work in China
and so US software has been banned into
China for 10 years 15 years so to a
certain degree what's happening with the
United States banning Chinese products
here is kind of fair of you think about
it
why is it that the Chinese can ban us
software but the u.s. can't bend Chinese
products why not yeah that's that's a
fair point um so I'm trying to be fair
here I you know I I think that US
companies need to work on their hardware
I think that China needs to work on not
banning US companies I mean hey because
what's the thing I think it's the
smartest strategy that China could have
ever done this is what has made Chinese
companies such monsters because their
market is so big the more the more they
control it the more they only allow
Chinese companies like WeChat and so
many others be the only ones that
operate in China is the way we'd like
they have enough of a market they have
more pie they have a larger population
than most countries in the world
combined yeah very true
so I guess kind of the final question
that I want to pose here is and this is
the question that these traditional
these traditional media journalists are
asking me like so what advice do you
have to anybody who might be buying a
Huawei group device right now
so Huawei - honored 22 an honor 20 Pro
is there anything that we can give
because I told them the exact same thing
that you were saying earlier like we
don't have all of the facts when they
asked me they told me we're gonna talk
about the device and then when they
brought me aside the first thing they
said was how do you feel about all this
Huawei Google stuff and I was like guys
I don't have I have no more information
than you do right now what are you
expecting from you right now you're
expecting a sound byte that's your sound
boy I don't know anything yeah I can
only give you what I hope to happen
which is I hope the consumer gets
transparency I hope that if Google and
Huawei actually come to an agreement
that allows Android to be on Huawei
devices I want there to be some sort of
in paper agreement on paper that says
Huawei phones will have support for the
next X years that will help the consumer
actually know whether or not to get
their devices but as far as right now is
concerned I don't know do you have any
thoughts to give our our listeners and
consumers who might be interested let me
ask you I haven't done my p30 Pro review
and I was gearing up to have it I should
do it or not I know I mean what should I
do it should I not do it I don't know
the answer and so okay if it were my
money if I were a consumer and this was
happening I would not buy a Huawei
product right now I would not because we
don't know what the feature oh yes the
thing about this is just like in the
case of ziti because Huawei is not the
first company ZTE was first my opinion
back then we started giving a lot of
coverage on that and then I asked Jules
not to continue
into the into the topic because see
here's the thing every single legal
entity has rights every single legal
entity has rights every single person in
this in every country has rights
technically or at least in paper and so
sure they can be blacklisted but they
can also sue and they can also defend
themselves and so the question is
they're definitely gonna sue the quitz
only a matter of time as to when and
it's only a matter of time as to seeing
what the results will be because to a
certain degree the United States is
putting themselves in a very difficult
position they're blocking Commerce which
is literally what enables this country
and so there should be to a certain
degree that the you know Huawei deserves
a fair trial they deserve my mic might
you know what the funny part is the
funny part is that nobody has been able
to prove any of the claims yet and so
you know Huawei can be like okay prove
it are you kidding are you saying that
this country does not have the
technology to be able to prove is if we
do spy or not mmm you know or it could
just be that the United that it could
just be that the United States is gonna
be like you know what okay fine why
don't you talk to your government and
have your government remove those
policies where they're allowed to use
your technology as a way to spy on us
you know it could be so many things it's
not in China's convenience to lose us
manufacturing it's not like if Apple
moves all if Foxconn which is a
Taiwanese company they're not Chinese
tech mainland China
if Foxconn moves all their factories out
of China dude
that is gonna be the collapse of Qin gen
yeah that's true because they
manufacture all of those products right
yeah so think about this this is a huge
deal and if Apple and if companies like
Apple are going to be taxed and they're
gonna have to throw that tax into
consumers what limits them to move
manufacturing to India where you can
also find an expensive labor Latin
America you can also find an expensive
labor and so I mean Foxconn
can move factories to wherever they want
the iPhone success is already being
produced in India it started being fully
mass-produced as of last month last week
sorry and so again this is a very
difficult topic and you know what the
problem is that there is no such win-win
scenario in this problem in whichever
and let's assume that Huawei does come
up with an operating system and they do
come up with a chip dude they have such
a large market that they have the scale
to be able to survive on their own how
many Chinese companies remain in China
they never leave China and we've never
heard of those companies here but
they're massive OPOs one of them Oppo
only lives in a pack asia-pacific that's
all they do and they're currently like
what they're the fourth largest company
in the world and they only sell an APEC
for the most part yeah they're starting
to sell the negative there's a reason
why this launch was in Europe because
they're starting to trickle in but
clearly not in the US that's that's
that's the thing do think about Xiaomi
Xiaomi is a monster and most of what
they sell is only China so these Chinese
companies they don't need they don't
need to work outside of China they don't
they can survive just with China and so
I feel that obviously this affects the
United States when it comes to
manufacturing and affects the United
States when it comes to the fact that
now that Huawei owns all those IPS for
5g how exactly does the United States
plan to deploy 5g without the Huawei
patents mmm yeah I mean is that so okay
I don't want to get in too deeply into
this topic cuz we already hit our one
hour mark but yeah I mean we're gonna
have to rely on I mean we have faith in
Qualcomm that there 5g is actually going
to be good but yes but some of these
patents belong to let's say which is so
they're drew which add so many wrinkles
to this whole thing because it's not
just us versus China in a lot of ways
there's a lot of conjoining details that
the two cannot live without one another
in a way and it's crazy that you know
we're drawing lines in the sand and it's
affecting more people that it should
yeah it is affecting more people
intentions it's a difficult topic and
and
you know what I have to say I don't know
all the facts you don't know all the
facts right now this is a very
complicated topic it's only gonna
continue unwinding into more and more
consequences out of everything that's
happening and if the United States
believes that there is that they're
going to protect themselves no it's it's
a lose-lose scenario everything that's
happening right now is a lose-lose you
know it certainly feels that way okay
cool well we hit our one hour mark even
with a few technical difficulties which
is perfectly fine I'm just that's a
reason why we record these now so we can
actually edit them together in a way and
I will make sure to provide a little bit
of b-roll of these products that we were
talking about on camera but yeah with
that said I'm gonna go ahead and get
into our outro Jaime and Brandon I will
make sure to talk about their social
media handles in those but for now we're
just gonna go ahead and we'll roll it
out to the outro and on that no that is
