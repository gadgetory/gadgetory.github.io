won't lead you to the question of the
day and that leads me to a very
interesting other question you said
Boehner who did bring back the old music
that's what this video's for that's
right it's that time of the week I am hi
mera mera this is pocket now and this is
the parking out daily recap for last
week so on Monday ask you if you would
like a galaxy s6 like galaxy note5 as
the rumors are that that's the way the
design is going to be like we have 566
comments out of which max do says yeah
going LG no thank you no expandable
storage no removable battery then what's
the advantages the effing stylist and
yeah I kind of agree that was the whole
purpose of the note lineup ever since
the change with the galaxy lineup so sad
yeah another commenter says I like the
design of the x6 so I don't care the
note 5 will get the same design but the
please Samson don't take the SD card
away and I had to agree with you i wish
that that would be the case that there
would be a way for expandable storage to
still be part of the note lineup techno
flick says looks like i'll be going with
a note for i'm really disappointed hell
I might even veer off the note track and
see what else is out there with
expandable storage at a great camera ooh
that's gonna be a tough one when it
comes to the great camera but yeah the
LG g4 is out there then on Wednesday we
were making fun of Matt Bonner from the
NBA because uh well he blames an iphone
6 plus for his recent injury on the
elbow we have 749 comments out of which
tech 1 TV says well Matt if it was the
galaxy mega you would be in trouble and
he imagined that then Hayden says I
think Apple should definitely shrink the
bezels on an explicit series of iphones
and i do agree with you there's nothing
wrong with 5.5 inches on the display but
Apple does terrible bezels when it comes
to the iphones at plus then alex says
elbow issues ken stretches hand around a
phablet looks like if he's only used to
handling small things cough cough that's
what she said on wednesday asked you how
do you feel about satya nadella's
microsoft after letting go of 7800
people mostly from the Lumia lineup we
have
518 comments out of which Morgan
Crawford says I was one of those Lumia
employees that were cut definitely sucks
to say the least maybe I'll go back to
working at apple like I used to and
Morgan I am really sorry you would be
the second person i know that was let go
with this whole recent restriction which
is extremely stupid and hopefully
Microsoft figures it out and hopefully
Nokia wants to start back with the old
employees because you guys did an
amazing job in the past another commoner
says why buy out Nokia if you're not
going to maintain the hardwood
department wasteful and selfish you
bought a company just to take it down in
the people that work there and I do
agree with you definitely Nokia wasn't
really fine but they didn't need
Microsoft to pull themselves back
together they're doing it again an urban
says I feel like medela is really
getting Microsoft's s together focusing
on what who matters the most then
sticking the company's strategy or
stitching the company strategy yes I do
agree with your point in the fact that
Microsoft is focusing on key areas I
just wish they would have sold back
nokia or I don't know started a new
company with their funding or something
like that that would have been a smart
move they've got the money on Thursday
asks you if you think that a rose gold
iPhone with force touch technology would
be enough for Apple to sell 90 million
units as those are the rumors we have
661 comments out of which Nathan Jones
says well if Apple sells that many I
guess it's good news for samsung as well
sips tea and I trying to get your
cognitive and Shane tom says 12
megapixel camera that is true
competition for the g4 and s6 first
touch iOS 9 32 gig base model and the
improved battery life would get me to
buy my first iPhone and yeah I think
that these are the things that Apple
would need to do not necessarily just
give us another color option and Camilla
Santiago says yeah I'm after the iphone
success I'm tired of android been with
Android since 2007 time to give an apple
a taste of my teeth question of the day
for you to comment on below what do you
think the iphone is better than android
you'll help me choose if i should buy an
iphone success thank you i don't feel
that the iphone is better than android
particularly the newer models like the
LG g4 in galaxy s6 the thing is the
iphone is just more popular people like
it more
are because it's easier to use or should
i say more simplistic not easier to use
but yeah more simplistic and for most of
the market that is important so it
depends on your needs really i like the
iphone 6 a lot but then again that's
just because i've been using iphones for
years and finally yes on friday asks you
if you would wait for the iphone 6s plus
or with an early launch of the note 5
make you want to go for the note 5 we
have 682 comments out of which michael
jimenez says Apple fans will not buy a
samsung product even if it was better
than Sammy they are Sammy haters no not
necessarily and we've seen that happen
in the past people went crazy over the
new galaxy problem as they went back the
iphones and another commoner says i
would pick the note 5 over any phone it
is just perfect and how do you know you
haven't even seen it yet then Jack Road
says I wait for both phones to release
see the reviews and pick one I prefer
and that is exactly what I am going to
do as well I have been both a note user
and an iphone user and yeah I think that
the best approach is to wait for reviews
particularly because uh well both phones
are great that's it for the pocket out
