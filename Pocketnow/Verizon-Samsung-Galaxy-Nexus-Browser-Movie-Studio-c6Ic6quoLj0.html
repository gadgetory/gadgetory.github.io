com we got a request to see a couple
more features in the Galaxy Nexus so in
this video we are going to take a look
at the browser and the movie studio for
video editing let's take a look first
off let's look at the movie studio now
this is a free video editor that is
included with the Galaxy Nexus and we
can combine clips you can trim them you
can add transitions and effects so here
i have three clips are added you can
press the + button to add more clips to
that end or more clips to this end and
we can drag along the timeline to see a
different video update up there and if i
tap one of the videos here i can trim it
a little bit there's your check mark to
apply that when i have a clip selected
there's an effects button up there and i
can choose a couple different effects as
gradient sepia a negative and get its
tiny little dot right there that's your
progress bar so you have to wait for
that to apply it's very hard to see so
we're waiting and it's going to apply
that now the dot is over here still
rendering we can also add titles and
here's your menu up there we can export
the movie okay now we can also add
transitions so I already transition
there I can transition out there's
usually a transition in and transition
out so will fade black
and there's your progress bar dot I'm
going to wait for that and now it should
be playable and that should fade out
there we go and you can add a soundtrack
as well so lots of cool features for a
video editor this is a free one bundled
with the device similar to iMovie it's
not the first time a smartphone has come
with a video editor the nokia n8 also
had one which was pretty similar you
just kind of put the video clips in a
row and add transitions or titles the
usual kind of thing so that's on the
nokia n8 so that's a very cool program
with current is slow rotating there we
go all right next up let's look at the
browser so this has been redesigned a
bit for ice cream sandwich we have your
dot dot little menu up there instead of
on a hardware button and we have a
really nice little feature request
desktop site so really quickly you can
go to the desktop version of a website
and it works pretty good pretty quick
sometimes I got to wait for other things
to reload and show up
but works pretty well up here your tabs
so you can switch between those the tabs
do not show up in the recent programs
listing you only have one entry show up
there will do a speed comparison with
the low-end radar 4g both of these are
on 4G network this one's on verizon LTE
this one's on t-mobile's
so here we have html5 rendering speeds
the bandwidth doesn't seem to matter
much processing power we have 39 frames
per second over here in nineteen over
there their speed reading tests
again by the specs this one should be
much faster we have dual-core 1.2 k
Garrett's we have just a single
gigahertz over here with maybe 512 megs
of ram we have a gig of ram over here
and we have a much faster LTE 4g
internet connection over here but you
can see this one was gaining 32 frames
per second words this is at eight there
you have the new browser and video
editor for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus now
on verizon do some thumbs up you like
this video and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
