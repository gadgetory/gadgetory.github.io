we decided on reviewing this fund from
the perspective of price how it might
compare against other $400 devices still
a number of our viewers have left
comments wondering whether this phone
can deliver enough of the proper
flagship experience they're hoping to
score a great deal or are there too many
compromises when looking for a top
performer so it's time for a showdown
and we have selected the top-selling
Android flagship from the first half of
2016
the galaxy s7 starting with build
quality and design beauty is in the eye
of the beholder but many would probably
point to Samsung and taking the more
significant style step the metal and
glass combo is subtly refined from last
year's galaxy and is a huge departure
from the galaxy s5 the oneplus 3 marks a
large step from previous opiez but the
result here is an all-metal body which
looks like the lovechild of an honor 5x
and an HTC One m9 it's attractive but
somewhat derivative the glass body on
the s7 and antenna arrangement
internally seems to deliver better
network reception and also means we get
the benefit of wireless charging is a
fun additional lifestyle feature and
Samsung saw fit to return ip68 water
resistance for a little extra
survivability the 1+3 is a well-built
and thin device but I honestly use both
phones with cases I don't like slippery
glass in sweaty hands and I miss the
sandstone back from the oneplus 2
overall we'll still give the design and
build nod to the galaxy for folks
looking to future-proof they'll be happy
to see USB type-c
on the oneplus 3 it's the cable standard
of the future and you'll wonder in the
ability to plug the cable in which ever
way you want though from a performance
standpoint we don't see much difference
for file transfers connecting the galaxy
to a USB 3 port and the oneplus 3 to a
Thunderbolt 3 port and transferring a 1
gigabyte file on and off each phone the
times for each file transfer were nearly
identical though we'll still give the
oneplus the not here is these are the
cables we will be investing in for our
future gadgets we also prefer the
always-on fingerprint sensor on the
oneplus over the hardware home button
scanner on the galaxy s7 it's a nice
feel when all of the
passage of hardware responds to a touch
without having to apply pressure we are
kind of lazy like that
so the op3 scores another win
performance is solid for both phones
they benchmark similarly no surprise
given they both use the same Qualcomm
820 chipset even with a 1.6 million
pixel advantage on the screen the galaxy
largely feels just a snappy the one area
we see a small difference is in gaming
and only with the most demanding
graphics intense games implosion plays
about the same but Marvel future fight
is ever so slightly less choppy on the
oneplus 3 outside of the one or two
games which might demonstrate some
differences we're inclined to call this
a tie speaking of that resolution though
there's simply no contest for best
display Samsung has been evolving its
AMOLED expertise since the original
galaxy s the display is not only
brighter but features a more
sophisticated contrast shifting mode for
better outdoor readability a both phones
use a pentile matrix but again having
way more pixels produces sharper and
clearer text and fine photo detail this
is an easy win for Samsung will also
give the galaxy the win for camera
performance as sure if you pull both
phones out in bright light shooting full
auto you'll probably end up with similar
looking photos but Samsung gives users
more control over photo processing and
significantly more options to alter for
video the experiment and backing off
resolution with a 12 megapixel sensor
does produce significantly better photos
in low-light situations without having
to resort to different processing modes
and the optical image stabilization
achieves noticeably smoother video when
holding still focus accuracy between
both phones is similar but the Samsung
is much faster at locking on a subject
macro performance is better on the
Galaxy thanks to a closer minimum
focusing distance and audio captures
radically better thanks to how
disappointing the noise reduction is on
the oneplus
to be sure the oneplus camera is good
maybe very good but it's competing
against an excellent phone camera on the
galaxy the tables turn however when
comparing headphone audio surprisingly
oneplus has opted for a higher quality
DAC and a punchier amp the oneplus three
does a better job of driving nice
headphones and that extra volume will
serve up a higher quality audio signal
with less noise wider dynamic range and
less distortion very well done indeed as
companies can often overlook those of us
who enjoy higher quality headphone
playback a battery life is something
tricky to directly compare but while
we've seen numerous synthetic benchmarks
which would point to a Samsung win in
our daily use these two phones deliver
similar runtime in hour movie tests
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 50% brightness both phones
drained about 5% of their batteries what
is a more interesting fight is recharge
time the galaxy s7 only uses Qualcomm
second generation fast charging standard
and when plugged in for 30 minutes only
tops off about a third of the battery
oneplus uses a proprietary standard
called - which charged almost twice as
fast while remaining fairly cool to the
touch the issue though is the
proprietary hardware needed to use -
charging the charger and cables need to
be oneplus approved otherwise the
charging speed is much slower yet even
when charging slower the oneplus manages
to charge almost as quickly as the
galaxy can at its fastest we're inclined
to give the overall power management nod
to the oneplus this comparison is long
enough so let's wrap this up
never settle is a feel-good marketing
term but there are plenty of reasons why
someone might opt to spend more for a
phone this comparison really reinforced
why we wanted to focus on the price of
the oneplus 3 for our reviews still it's
not a runaway victory for the galaxy
where the oneplus screen is somewhat
disappointing and the camera is mid-pack
the galaxy loses out on headphone audio
and battery charging performance for
some folks there will be diminishing
returns and spending more on a smart
phone but there are still returns to be
found it's now just up to the individual
user as to whether the premium is
for them as always thanks so much for

future comparisons and hit that thumbs
up button for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
