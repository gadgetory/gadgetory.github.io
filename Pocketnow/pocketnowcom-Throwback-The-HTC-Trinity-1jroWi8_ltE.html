pocketnow.com and today we're gonna
continue our flowback series I'm gonna
show you my first Windows mobile device
which was the HTC B 3600 aka the HTC
Trinity of course at the time of its
release and later on HTC Trinity was
considered to be one of HTC's best
devices it had everything a business
user might need from productivity tools
to Windows Mobile 5.0 if you still
remember that it was fast it was robust
so it was a great device we're gonna
compare it to the HTC hd2 which is
currently HTC's best-selling device
we're gonna do lots of tests and
comparisons so stay tuned for more and
enjoy the video
the HTC P 3600 was a gorgeous device it
was released in September 2006 and it
came with Windows Mobile 5.0 it was
powered by a Samsung processor running
at 400 megahertz and the tech check it
out 64 megabytes of RAM and 128
megabytes of ROM it had a two point
eight inch resistive touchscreen QVGA
resolution 240 by 320 which at the time
due to Windows Mobile 5.0 was operated
by a stylus finger friendliness came
later on with Windows Mobile 6.0 and 6.1
it had integrated GPS Bluetooth infrared
port and Wireless for connecting to B
and G standard networks
it came with a front-facing camera which
was 0.3 megapixels and a 1.9 megapixel
camera at the back as for expansion
slots it supported mini SD cards and if
you had the chance to own a micro SD you
had to use it in a micro to mini
converter one of his best features was
the battery life it lasted me at least
three days and that was due to the
battery which was 1500 milliamps let's
take a closer look at the device on the
front we had the screen which was 2.8
inch in diagonals on top of it we had
the VGA camera which was front-facing
the speaker and on either side of the
speaker we had
an LED light the right one was
constantly blinking to show connection
to cell tower and the other one was used
for notifications of text messages email
messages reminders bluetooth on and so
on at the bottom we had a button plate
two soft buttons which corresponded to
the soft buttons on the screen a four
directional deep end with an enter
button at the middle call start : a
dedicated start button and an OK button
on the left side we had a volume rocker
which could be used for volume settings
and navigation with the function of
scrolling up scrolling down and pushing
it inside below that was a push to talk
button which I personally never used
because my carrier doesn't support it on
the other side there was a power button
which activated the device below that
was a voice command button then the
small door for the mini SD card a button
for activating the camera and the
shutter at the button we had the USB
port a soft reset hole and the infrared
port comparing the two makes the 3600
look ridiculous the hd2 has a screen
which is almost as big as the 3600 the
hd2 is much wider and taller and of
course it is much thinner comparing the
specs of the two devices makes again the
trinity look ridiculous because the hd2
features a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor while the 3600 features a 400
megahertz Samsung the memory on the hd2
is huge it's close to half a gigabyte of
RAM and ROM while there are 64 megabytes
of RAM and 128 megabytes are from on the
Trinity one thing you'll notice is that
the HD 2 does not have a front-facing
video camera like the Trinity has and
it's been debated at the time some say
it's useless some can't live without it
personally I have never used video
calling and I don't think I ever will as
for the buttons as opposed to the for
directional d-pad on the Trinity the HD
2 only has 5 button button
which you already know by now so there's
no d-pad on the hd2 there's a d-pad
which is sort of a virtual d-pad on the
SI p just below the keyboard now even
though the hd2 has windows mobile 6.5
and the Trinity has Windows Mobile 5.0
let's do a first productivity test which
means starting the device I will try to
start them at the same time and see
which one gets to the home screen faster
here we go
standard HD - vibration you can see the
old-style logo on the boot screen which
was the HTC's first logo before they got
to the new one the information is
displayed on the HD - almost the same as
it was with other devices here's the HD
- splash screen here's the Windows
Mobile 5.0 splash screen and then again
the windows mobile 6.5 flat splash
screen the HD - started but it's not
ready to be used yet while the P 3,600
finished and it's ready to be used so I
guess in productivity the Trinity wins
let's say by a margin of 10 to 15
seconds on to the standard Internet web
page loading test we will start to load
at the same time pocketnow.com and we'll
see which one makes it there faster I
will try to push the Go buttons at the
same time like no notice internet
explorer in the old version and opera by
default on the HD - which almost already
loaded the page so I guess there's no
need for comparisons here obviously the
HD 2 wins let's see by how much it's not
fully loaded yet Trinity is catching up
so it actually finished at the same time
with the hd2 scrolling and display is a
little bit difficult on the small screen
you I'll have to use the stylus to
scroll down but it's usable it
definitely was usable at the time while
uh flick scrolling and multi-touch on
the hd2 are top of state of the art
technology nowadays okay here's another
one
launching word and starting a new
document and I've done this before so I
know the outcome
maybe it's the difference in the
different versions of word mobile but
actually the Trinity wins here because
while the hd2 will start to load the
default template the p30 600 makes it
instantly let's see there so it's close
to a two-second margin and here's a
benchmark last but not least of what I
used to do to compare devices and
different SD cards I will try to start
my personal favorite navigational system
which is I go and we will see which one
of them starts it's faster I'll prepare
them both ready set go
I don't think there's room for debate on
this the hd2 clearly wins because of the
Snapdragon processor and the huge RAM
while the p30 600 almost started so this
was my video throwback presenting to you
my first windows mobile device the HDCP
3600 I hope you enjoyed the video it's
still a great device it's still a great
windows mobile device I hope you liked
it this was anton from pocketnow.com
