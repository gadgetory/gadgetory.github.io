significant if not a blockbuster
smartphone and we're on the eve of its
launch we'll talk about that along with
another android flagship from LG in the
hour ahead plus we'll cover samsung
gaming the system will chat on the new
Nexus 7 setting the world on fire maybe
and we'll do some fretting about
everyone's favorite fins on episode 05
five of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocket now
where we discuss smartphones tablets and
the state of mobile technology in 2013
I'm your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and today I'm
joined by everyone's favorite instagram
jogger multimedia manager Jaime Rivera
good morning to you in Honduras
Instagram jogger is that my category is
that it that's your new title enough
good morning to everybody how are you
I'm sure they're very well now that the
weekly has begun and we also have on the
air the man who keeps our front page
humming with new hotness all the way
from the pocket now headquarters bunker
somewhere beneath media Pennsylvania
chief news editor Stephen shank good
morning to you good morning Michael yay
we have a great team assembled as we
were just talking about on the other
side of the podcast before we hit the
record button Taylor Martin has some
kind of BS excuse as to why he can't be
on the air today so whatever whatever
he's doing those are three comparisons
he's shooting at once I don't know what
he's up to but it is great to have you
guys here and we've got a ton to talk
about don't we boy howdy yeah we do
let's make some announcements real
quickly I want to say that there will be
some listener mail at the end of this
show we are not going to get to all of
it but we have a tentative and then this
is news to you guys we have a tentative
arrangement set up to do this to have a
special listener male-only episode of
the pocket now weekly hopefully next
week is not exciting letters from you
yeah donnelly and in addition what we
might do is we might have
as many podcasts excuse me as many
PocketNow editors on board as possible
so what might actually happen is instead
of just three people from pocket now on
the show we'd have I don't know five six
whoever can make it so it might be a
giant circus it might be a complete it
is going to end up like two others of
the way into an episode of always sunny
in philadelphia where's the entire cast
is shouting over each other for exactly
90 seconds straight right it'll be like
it'll be like I don't know what
eighty-five percent of the other
podcasts on the internet and yet you
know the cool thing about listener mail
is you can sense her whatever you want
so all those Jaime or Windows Phone
hater mail you know you just know just
right throw them off yeah all the other
don't cover Jackson with the spam filter
that's right I'm gonna do what else is
just another couple brief announcements
the the you review the pocket now you
review will also be coming back next
week prim may be on the same day if we
do both these on Friday there has been
an unplanned hiatus of the pocket on you
review but we have so many cool devices
particularly in my office I'm the
spoiled brat this month so I've got so
many cool phones want to share them so
that'll be coming back and this month
come on well well we can't all live in
Honduras seriously you sent me a photo
no maybe you posted an Instagram of like
where you live where you live next to
that amazing vegetation covered mountain
and the fog was covering in the Sun was
come he was just so idyllic and I was
like well now I don't feel bad about
getting this sweet sounds like Michael
lives next to like a train paddock in
the high voltage switching station
exactly exactly that's exactly the first
of all this is pocketnow.com this is not
like mountain and calm so let's just
switch by and now do let me bring you
over to my world of vegetation and I
could take over your mountain of phone
guys deal with that listen I'm number
number one no we need to negotiate
further on that exchange number two
mountain now calm is available you can
buy it so why don't you go ahead and do
that let's uh let's start a sister site
seriously it'll be about hiking will it
be about mountain mountain bikes just
just your Mountain a phone
just Mattoon that's all right well you
too can experience my mountain of phones
next pocket though you review anyway all
that cool stuff is coming up and blah
blah blah blah blah but of course the
most exciting announcement because it is
the most the one that's coming up most
recently is that tomorrow is the Moto X
event yes yes the motorola event in new
york city announcing the motorola x
officially and i will be getting my
hands on it i'll be heading down to New
York City for that tomorrow morning at
an absurdly early hour from from a
Boston train and I believe our
appointment is somewhere in the mid day
this is they're doing it kind of
differently this time around i'll be
telling you all about it and then what
are we doing immediately after hi May
we're to have this special round table
as we always do but this gonna be
interesting and unique on its own
because usually we do the round table
while the event is happening live and we
get your feedback while you're at the
event but this time it's like you know I
still find it weird that Motorola's not
having you know they they've made us
really weird yeah yeah I mean they've
created so much expectation for this
phone and now they're not gonna have a
press event for it they're just gonna
have a hands-on so that's kind of
interesting well you know I mean it's I
wouldn't go so far as to say it's not a
press event like it's it's an invitation
only thing it's a you know it there is
no stage is what you're talking about
right they don't everybody into an
auditorium and say here's a big show you
know what I appreciate that the first
event I ever attended was for the HTC
One X last year and it was an ATT event
they invited us into a hotel room and
like that's basically what it was but it
was it was a nice hotel room no get me
wrong but it was nice and intimate and
you just got to sit and chill with
people well yeah it was the quest Oh
what but the 1x had already been
announced in Barcelona yeah that's a
good point what they did when I did get
the galaxy note it was just a little you
know three or four people in the room
looking at it but this was the US law
after two already been available for you
know three or four months
internationally Moto X should be a way
bigger deal exactly right and but I
think that probably Motorola is very
aware that this phone is not going to
capture the the hearts and minds
necessarily of a large swath of the tech
sector you know I think they have a very
concrete consumer plan in place for this
but you know
I don't think they're I don't know maybe
I agree with you gentlemen it is unusual
I don't think it says anything that I
don't think it says that they're doing
anything wrong right out the gate I mean
we'll see you tomorrow no and listeners
I guess the point we're trying to make
here is where the the good thing is
Michael's gonna have his hands on during
midday and then he's gonna be joining
our our round table so I guess the
closest you can get to a live keynote of
what really went on with this phone is
if you join our special roundtable
happening he had at four-thirty p.m.
eastern and if you haven't joined one of
those before it's a it's a google
hangout based discussion and just the
parkin out team on the air but you can
leave comments you can ask questions you
can do a lot of stuff and i'll be doing
it from i guess from a sidewalk gents i
don't want to be doing the hangout from
the venue because i'm sure i'll be
thrown out by then ever before 30 before
hours later but by that point i should
also have some comparison videos up a
hands-on video a few videos posted if i
can get if i can get coverage wherever
i'm gonna be in new york city so i might
be joining you from a bench at a bus
stop near 10 square but i will be
joining you and it'll be fun aisle three
in a Duane Reade yes exactly in the in
the vitamin supplements aisle next to
the 5-hour energy yeah for sure so but
while we're talking about that so yes
join us for that but let's talk about
what we can expect from the motorola x
from the Moto X tomorrow we have a lot
of links in the podcast post here
there's just you know people call the
Lumia 1020 the most leaked phone in
recent memory but you know I don't think
Motorola is that all interested in
keeping the ex terribly secret you know
we know a lot of the features here we're
seeing a lot of leaked photos we're
seeing photos of the devices in the wild
you know google execs have had it out
there and we've just got so much
information can we just can we just like
run down the highlights guys I mean what
isn't on my mind is that this is going
to be a highly customizable phone right
it's going to be one that not only can
you customize the base color but
probably also the bezel and trim like
there's going to be maybe some
interesting materials used in the
construction I don't know we haven't
seen any pics of that alternate bezel
color action we see white and black but
not you know the green
we've seen for backplates I'm not sure
how that's really gonna play out you
think we would have seen something given
all the leaks there been exactly and
honestly I think it's just gonna be a
back plate thing it's not really gonna
be a well what else can you customize
from the phone I mean well so they've
got that what is that that magic glass
which wraps around the sides of the
phone which would make customization
more difficult right if the glass
obscures the bezel well and that's the
thing I mean magic glass we've seen it
on the One X we've seen it on the witch
Lumia was it that had this like rounded
edges i think it's the 920 in the 900
well this it's supposed to be something
weird about how the where the edge of
the glass blends into the plastic i know
the first leak about it mentioned like a
special epoxy and it wasn't really
described in the manner of detail like
like so i have this you know fuzzy
picture of my head even after seeing the
images of the the faceplate but i don't
think it's something we've seen before
exactly like in these other phones but i
still i'm not sure what to expect yeah i
also have no idea what's going on here i
mean the tonys news post for it just
says it's what Motorola calls the front
glass of the phone which according to
reports will wrap around the sides of
the device and it's like all right well
if that's the case then we've sort of
seen that before but we haven't though
right we've seen the glass blend in like
kind of pool at the edges and meet up
with a plastic or a metal bezel right we
haven't seen it like actually go all the
way around the sides of the phone so
boot and there's a good reason for that
because if you drop it yeah I was about
I was about to say that's not really
code for something smart but I will see
you guys let's see will well as far as
things we haven't seen before either i
guess wanted to note those new pictures
at Tony posted at the glass I think is
the first time we've seen the upper
right corner of the phone it's always
been blurred out in previous leaks and
now we can see a couple numbers and a
little 2d barcode i don't know people
guess cuz we're getting so close to
release date they no longer care about
being the one identified as leaking this
or what but oh yeah it's something
interesting right yeah that's
interesting right below the cut out for
the front-facing camera there yeah yeah
i'm still don't know if I'm sold on that
new motorola logo in the upper left
either that's you know we talked about
this a couple weeks ago on the show and
like I don't know if we don't have to go
over it again but that well what new
then it's not gonna look like that on
the finished one is it where's yeah yeah
because because it's the pits a motorola
batwing in the center but it's
surrounded by the Dozen batwing I'm
pretty I'm pretty sure that the broken
up ring is another identity thing
because it's been different on different
leaks we've seen oh and there is a
company that does little it's a QR code
would rip off but it does a company's
logo and it has a circle around it and
you scan it in a magazine or something
and it's some pretty sure it's that
identifying mark okay and that's not a
brandy well we'll see tomorrow we will
yeah what else now this is going to be
made in the u.s. we're pretty sure right
it is gonna be well assembled in the US
all right yeah so components imported
and then assembled in the US yeah and
you know it's kind of interesting that
they're able to so I guess one of the
one of the points that's been happening
with his phone is that apparently it's
gonna be an affordable phone it's not
gonna be a flagship expensive phone so
it's interesting that Motorola has
figured out a way to build a phone in
the United States and keep the cost to
the point where they can sell it as a
mid tiered phone mm-hmm well yeah and
but in a mid-tier phone instantly
conjures up images of these like kind of
forgettable designs but with some of the
posts that we some of the pictures we
saw on Steven your post from the 26th
with the Moto X hardware rumors delving
further into Andres design like this
kind of it looks almost curved I mean
not almost it looks completely curved on
the browser back yeah people are worried
it's gonna be wobbling around but then
other week say no no it's just flat
enough that it'll stay put it's so funny
because I mean if it wobbles around
it'll be no different than the HTC One
the motorola the nokia lumia 1020 a
bunch of phones i have here and an
iphone with a case yeah because nobody
nobody uses bear now how may you carried
a Galaxy Nexus I actually have your old
Galaxy Nexus right here yes you do what
it was like to carry a curved phone it
feel it feels great it feels great to
talk on it feels great to use in the
hand I'm very excited about this and
when samsung released the galaxy s3 with
the suggestion of a curve on the bezel
but no actual curve in the hardware I
was like get out of my face for example
one phone that I love the
curve on is the Xperia ZL it's it's very
very easy it feels really good in the
hand because of that and because of a of
the choice of the the pattern texture at
the back it just feels really good in
the hand and I think that I noticed that
there's this sort of a pattern in the
Moto X as well what a texture on the
zacks a little bit of one yeah yeah well
and that'll change right because we some
of those more outlandish rumors we saw
early on what the Moto X was that it was
gonna have like you could have not yet
denim back on it or something bring is I
first I was willing to dismiss those as
he has mild speculation but then
recently Taylor Wimberly has been all
over the place with these really spot-on
Moto X rowers he nailed that are GBC
camera before we heard about it on the
the droid ultra stuff uh-huh and he
reiterated this multiple materials
things like you know wood or ceramic
everything else he said has come to pass
so I'm really curious to see if he
nailed that one too I am too because I
mean this now that would be compelling
right if it's not just colors it's not
it's not just like here's a different
colored polycarbonate you can slap on
there like if it was legit you know
bamboo or yeah or yeah denim or whatever
you know if we don't like people and
paper right now rhinoceros skin yeah
yeah exactly seal tusk you see us in
tusk's did I get that wrong I don't know
i guess i guess um let's just hope these
are not let's just hope these are not
cases because if they're just gonna you
know they're replaceable back plates
then it's gonna be cool yeah yeah i'm
backing up a second i think it's really
interesting that you two are so gung-ho
by this idea of a curved back because
everything i've seen in commentary
online has been people hating on this
idea I it's so funny because I will
never understand the sum of the eddies
and currents in in comments and then
commenters like we're in this technology
field right and we're all good really
excited about new stuff this whole
industry runs on novelty but it seems
like the minute somebody breaks away
from the traditional like slab form
factor that's got all the rest of us
falling asleep everyone's like know why
isn't it just like the last one I don't
know it's very very curious to me
love curved stuff yeah I love curve
backs I mean if you asked me if I prefer
you know the iphone 4s or five design in
comparison to the 3gs i prefer the 3gs
oh don't look at you boldly go home
that's interesting I i love the curve
back for me it was it was extremely easy
to handle it didn't slip off my hand I
don't know I just felt comfortable it
felt really comfortable should we should
we touch on that camera real quickly
that our gbg twittered vote what is it
yeah our 10 megapixel RGB see and I saw
something yesterday apparently is going
to have pretty large not super large
relatively large pixel size i'm not sure
the actual sensor size but the pixels
are supposed to be are smaller than the
one but larger than the gs4 is our
friend like that yeah friend of the show
of stefan constant constant and SQ at
android bead posted something really
cool last night with a very very click
worthy headline Moto X to have a bit of
nokia pureview magic where he was
reporting on I think he was reporting on
a Taylor Wimberly yeah he was reporting
on each other when Billy rumor that you
were just talking about Steven I'm
talking about how this device will have
a 10 megapixel sensor but we'll use
pixel doubling like the oh yeah yeah
repeat slow video to 1080p 60 frames
that's awesome which is awesome it's
great frame in the still category though
the important difference being that the
Lumia 1020 uses 7 pixels the data from
up to 7 pixels to make one super pixel
and because this is a smaller sensor
rumored on the Moto X they'll be using
for 2 1 pixel enhancement sorry but that
was about 12 1 which is better than 11
but it also would result in a two point
five megapixel photo unfortunately yeah
so that's it's a Facebook photo man I
mean look at the banners look at the ads
they're trying to focus his phone on
teenagers apparently so no I get it but
I mean do you remember how much heat the
HTC One caught for having a 4 megapixel
camera and I was still deserve and I'm
still gonna give it some heat now the
question is the question is does this
camera have optical image stabilization
I real don't think so yeah because it
you know that would completely explain
the reason
for the curvature at the back for that
hardware to fit in there and that you
know it happens in the one it happens in
the line 20 and I would totally accept
it on this phone you know if you get
good low-light photography and if you
get all the all the bells and whistles I
mean 2013 is not a year for you to just
bring out any camera that I think I
think we're looking at exactly the same
component on the droid ultra Maxx mini
and if we didn't hear anything about
image stabilization when those were
launched I wouldn't expect to hear it
for this guy I would agree especially
considering that this is still you know
google-owned or not this is still
motorola we're talking about and
motorola has never ever been one to lead
the pack on cameras you know and that's
such an irony because in the old days I
really loved photos from from any water
Olaf own meaning from the feet from the
v6 35 and from the q 9h I had really
awesome photographs from that phone
actually yeah go ahead no I guess back
in the day of the v710 of the v8 800 on
verizon had they had some of the first 2
megapixel cameras you could get on a
phone the image quality image quality
was great the color reproduction was
awesome I you know bad been for the four
phones that old you know I I remember
that Motorola used to lead that pack
back in the day so hey it's great that
they're coming back maybe well yeah
we'll have to see i once again we'll see
you tomorrow I don't know but since
they've started with the modern
smartphone iterations it like that
everything from the razor on to the razr
m to the Atrix 2 i've just never been
really overwhelmed with a modern
motorola camera so a lot of noise in
those photos definitely yeah yeah yeah
and same kind of wild swings and
exposure and oh yeah and the video stuff
yeah so anyway we'll see go ahead and
see so you are you optimistic this is
finally going to reverse course for them
you know it is so hard to say if if if
we were seeing tomorrow as a huge event
like you guys were saying before I think
it would be really interesting I think I
would be a little more confident that
the camera is going to be something but
no not let me let me let me just
backtrack there yeah I don't know with
this rumor of this this pixel doubling
and I think they're going to bring
something interesting
whether it's going to be buds
buzz-worthy crap or actual improvement I
don't know but it'll be interesting to
see what they bring and I have more Hope
than I have had before for their
products thanks to the Google centric
nature of this thing you know if all
that software you know that whole turn
your phone on calling it okay processor
you know honestly as gimmicky as it may
sound you know I think of that feature
and I'm like what's the point of google
glass if I'm able to talk to my phone
right there on the table and will tell
me whatever I want without the need of
having something stupid on my face so
that I thank you for making awesome on
your face exactly right jerk no I you
are absolutely right hi man that's
something that I want to touch on before
we move on we've talked about this time
and time again with voice commands and a
device that can intelligently listen to
you all the time wait for that cue and
just let you talk to it without hitting
a button is definitely the next thing
that's going to drive voice interface
forward is it creepy yes my destroy
battery life yes but god it's the it's
the future it's it is the future of
sitting in a room and saying computer
and then there's something like that
well apparently that processor you know
we're talking about the specs of the
phone apparently the processor was
designed to be able to do that so this
is a dual core processor but the point
being is you know quad core processors
aren't really that create anyways and
apparently apparently this processor has
the specialty of allowing you to have
tremendous standby time in order to be
able to do that it's like what we'll be
seeing the Snapdragon 800 but without
being as expensive or as otherwise
powerful as the 800 what kind of chip is
inside this thing this is that weird
when they made is like 8x five say yeah
yeah it's got a quad-core GPU dual core
application processor okay and then to
specialty cores one of them's this voice
one one of them's something else wow I
actually I did not know that so I have
once again I have a four hour train ride
into the city tomorrow during Katrina
during which i will i will be prepared
for the for the experience but i have
been immersed in other phones for the
past few days so let's move on speaking
of other phone
unless you guys have a closing thought
on the Moto X because we're gonna talk a
whole lotta better tomorrow so yeah
let's go let's go yeah yeah the LG g2 as
Stephen shank says in an hilarious
headline is destined to disappoint and i
don't mean hilarious because it's
inaccurate I just mean it's it's quite
it's quite on the nose and I i find
myself sad that i can't immediately
disagree with you Steven it's
unfortunate i'm getting some flak for it
in the comments there but i think it's
ultimately going to be true I mean LG
important LG phone not to disappoint
would have been a huge accomplishment
they always seem to find some way to
just Ana build quality or the software
lacks the polish of something Samsung
comes up with it needs to have this huge
selling point I'm just not seeing that
for the g2 it looks like the phone that
anyone would make in this current
smartphone climate this is a phone you
make with the pic opponents available at
the moment there's nothing nice and I
think the timing of what LG has been
doing recently has been just bad i mean
if you remember when the Galaxy Nexus
was launched um and I'm going back a
couple of years here you know it was it
was it was not a groundbreaking phone
but that 720p display was unique and so
it was still an innovation happening but
then when you get the nexus for the
nexus 4 is pretty much late first time
in just about everything so that small
opportunity that LG had to live some top
of mine on their on their quality just
totally went berserk with this phone and
so I feel that they lost a good
opportunity with that nexus 4 which is
not going to push that g2 into into a
higher top of mine sadly let's uh let's
make the point right now that the g2 has
not yet been revealed officials is true
now that will happen on August seventh
and once again I will be in New York
City this time joined by our very own
Adam Lane it'll be wonderful to cover an
event with that I'm I haven't done that
before and that's when we're actually
going to see the g2 for ourselves we'll
definitely hopefully get some hands-on
time but we'll definitely see it and
that's when LG is going to either blow
us away or disappoint us but I think the
point is that everything
we're seeing coming out now and LG has
not been shy about sharing it's just
like the motorola it's ridiculous this
summer it is it's like well you know
yeah we're officially gonna announce it
you know sometime the future but hey
here's all the information in a link
wink nudge nudge dress and the in
addition that includes accessories and I
think that's one of the annoying things
about this to me this halo accessory
that LG has started at putting rip wall
yeah exactly what do we always criticize
LG for ripping off samsung and this
isn't the same thing as Samsung ripping
off Apple it's completely different
because at least Samsung tends to tends
to put their own spin on their ripoffs
but LG boy and I mean they're not subtle
about it I snow and the results I want
to make clear the results are not always
bad I will say for probably the 55th
time on this podcast I really really
liked the optimus G I still like the
optimus G we just gave one away not only
because Brandon was bored with it but
because it's a really great phone it got
a really solid score on the review and
it's it's it's beautiful and it runs
well and it does a great job so for that
reason yes I'm excited about the g2 but
man this flip cover that they are
pushing it's like you took a galaxy s4
flip cover turned the window on its side
and release it in like two more colors
and I've gotta give them credit that the
the touch response do is I'm asleep
that's because that's an 800 thing I
assume what's that again what does it do
is that you can just touch that window
without you know pressing the wake
button and the phone's gonna start
responding to you okay so there's a
window cut out on the flip cover and
right you if the displays off you touch
the you touch it in the window and the
display wakes up but with the samsung's
if I'm not mistaken you had to you know
press a hardware button to wake the
phone didn't you you do or you can just
open the flip cover in or open okay yeah
so this is it so it's you know better
but it's still like you said it's a
shameless ripoff of this yeah yeah and
listen I will probably love this flip
cover because as we determined with the
s4 I'm a flip cover fanboy for some
reason when they have windows in them so
yeah but it's just actually it's
especially in that price tag right
oh yeah actually at a very affordable
7999 that samsung was trying to charge
that you know you know it's interesting
about that whole concept of that window
it's like in the old days of the flip
phone where you can somehow you could
read your messages from the small
display out so that's probably why I
like it that's probably because I hang
out in the nostalgia section of our
forums all day long thinking about the
past that's probably where I like flip
covers yeah I haven't even had a chance
to be at our forums forums pocketnow.com
visit us shameless blizzard us and and
and if you asked nicely i have this
video of a guy named Fisher snoring down
to it it's snoring like an animal in
Vegas you know if you're nice enough i
could probably upload it mr. Rivera have
you ever heard of the concept of
mutually assured destruction it's called
blackmail yeah it may be but you know
III uh I have a similar video of a man
named jaime rivera snoring his face off
in that same city coincidentally in that
same hotel room so you know i am never
falling asleep around any of you guys
don't do it it's suicide anyway this LG
device is going to have a snapdragon 800
that's awesome a 1080p screen also
awesome and a flip cover that's a ripoff
but might also be awesome so we were
gonna check it out it's going to be it's
going to be interesting to be what it's
going to be Thank You Stephen for
reporting on it my pleasure and we'll be
sure to cover that exhaustively and yeah
and see if these rear volume buttons
actually worked or they're gonna be
completely unusable as I'm worried about
yes you know if the phone were smaller
those rear buttons would make sense but
how well can you reach the back now with
your fingers I it's like oh god I don't
know i mean like i don't know i don't
see that being a problem i actually
don't have a problem with the back
matter volume keys that that some people
do but we'll we'll have to see i think
it's a cool idea it's definitely not one
of those blockbuster things that sells
millions of phones but it's one of those
things that makes you take a second look
at it unfortunately it won't do that in
the retail store because all phones look
the same in the retail stores are all
positioned exactly the same you know and
probably my biggest concern with that
with those button is for example in my
case I really care about not smudging
the cam
the camera lens with my fingers because
you know i'd like to take candid photos
and i don't want my back I don't want
the camera to be smudgy and this is just
gonna be impossible with this phone yeah
also you know in some of the stores
they're gonna put the the big old
anti-theft bracket right I was just
Steven I was just gonna say that like
can you imagine all the epoxy that's
gonna get into those boys units you're
gonna pick up a g2 in the store and it's
gonna be just randomly throwing volume
windows on the screen because it doesn't
know what to do uh that's sad didn't
that happen with like ah with the Galaxy
Nexus or something when it launched
there was a software bug that made the
volume keep changing randomly it didn't
nobody wasn't there yeah there was a
crazy bug I just don't remember what it
was but there was it took a second third
version for them to figure out how to
fix that oh well yeah fun fun with bugs
III think you'll win the bugs that were
in the optimist view that had like so
many typos in it that it couldn't even
be described English and some of those
dialog box come on Michael that whole
phone was a bug I didn't post about it
but did you guys see yesterday rumors
about the view 3 no no no no I mean
serious they're saying one it's gonna
exist to it means gonna have a hi-def
screen but it's gonna keep that damn 423
aspect ratio 1280 x 960 and I just want
to say it here I find that absolutely
ridiculous and we have a worst gadgets
ever episode on this phone and blah blah
blah but um in certain markets as a
commenter helpfully pointed out on that
worst gadgets ever episode in certain
markets like South Korea that aspect
ratio is is actually favored what yeah
for mobile TV viewing because that's the
aspect ratio they still use yeah so
that's that's why it was pushed so
heavily over there or maybe misquoting
that I know LG is is a South Korean
company the commenter may have said
something about Japan as well in terms
of that i'm not sure but at any rate you
know maybe that's a justification for a
third version of this of the nato
stervie river very skeptical of that and
if my keyboard wasn't super loud I'd be
looking it up to dispute at this moment
google in that ish yeah well let's let's
move on from from LG
and let's talk about the other big news
of the week which was actually you know
scandal rocks the tech world oh yeah the
first indication i had that this story
was coming up was brian klug or i don't
know how to pronounce his last name klug
over at a non-tech who is a very
intelligent guy right some some
excellent stuff tweeted something along
the lines of how much further down this
rabbit hole can i go it was like what
are you talking about Ryan and then I
looked at his feet and I was like oh
because I non-tech was the one who first
broke this story I believe that Samsung
has been maybe or maybe not but probably
yes opta optimizing its galaxy s4 and
other devices to perform better on
benchmarks then then in normal operating
circumstances they do this by
overclocking right I'm looking at your
stories yes you yeah yeah nothing being
overclocking but you know extra masks
yeah at a higher speed and everything
else seems to be yeah so the GPU
normally runs up at what 480 and there
it due to something called what is it
called benchmark booster or something I
don't that's the formal name but there
were some files on the device that have
that text string and also have the names
of all these apps where the boosting
happens quadrant and linpack and all
yeah yeah and the boosting up to its max
it's rated max and 532 megahertz and it
also swaps over to what would you say to
its a15 cores when such an app is
running it's always going to be
adjusting which cores it uses but when
it starts one of those benchmark ones no
matter what the actual load is like even
if you're just sitting on the menu
screen not actually using the processor
it's still going to activate all for the
f-15s and clock them as high as I go
right right and now Samsung after I made
the rundown but before the show started
Samsung actually officially responded to
this didn't they did they did and what
did Samsung say yeah nothing that leaves
me feeling much better about the
situation the response was posted in
Korean and the google translate was a
little hard to read but some much more
legible translations make the case that
Samsung saying that no no this is
absolutely a
533 megahertz GPU it's just we have to
dial it down to 480 because some of
these you know games that are really
pushing limits of the system are gonna
overload the GPU which makes I know some
about how these sort of things work but
enough to know that if you run the chip
faster it's usually going to have higher
throughput and give you better
performance so i'm confused why slowing
it down would avoid overloading it if
they're worried about burning more
people's houses down or I find the
scandal to be interesting I mean I
benchmarks have never been like reliable
ever since the you know ever since the
dual core processor made it back in the
day of the single core processors
benchmarks were reliable but as it's
known I mean every time that we get a
new dual core quad core or eight core
phone usually benchmarks never really
hit the spot on the the real ability of
these phones and uh you know I I don't
know they're making such a scandal over
this and it's I mean it's not like this
just because one thing between at the
benchmarks not accurately reflecting
phone performance and going out of your
way to single out these apps as ones for
which you will artificially boost phone
performance right the thing is I'm a was
making a broader point that I will
shamelessly hijacked for a second Taylor
Martin wrote a piece for us the other
day called why benchmark scores don't
matter and this was a piece that I
suggested based on something else I was
reading elsewhere on the web but also
based on the fact that I hate guys when
we're reviewing phones I hate running
benchmarks I hate running them not
because it's particularly stressful it's
not it actually provides some really
interesting animations on my phone
screen and it gives me a nice
opportunity to film something
interesting happening on the phone for
the review video but because it does not
affect anything that I routinely do with
a phone because I'm not often pushing
phones to their absolute limit as a
personal user and most people aren't
either and and with good reason because
when you do push your phone to the limit
that's when your battery's not going to
last you through the day that's when
it's gonna get super hot
we don't want to be doing that right
actually right and and you know more and
more are you more and more consistently
people of note and not just people who
are you know tech bloggers are there
there are millions of us now right but
you know reputable established writers
in the tech space are more and more
frequently saying no benchmarks Nolan no
longer makes sense to derive any
meaningful performance data from
benchmarks on mobile devices because of
some of the burials we've talked about
on the show and it's even you know some
of how this stuff works hi may I don't
know where you stand I am I know very
little about this all I know is a
benchmark score has never governed
whether or not i personally invest money
in a device and I don't really think it
ever will because to me it doesn't
correlate at all to real life experience
for me benchmarks have always been an
after-the-fact purchasing thing so I get
the phone then I'm gonna install the
benchmark software I'm gonna convince
myself that I no use my money properly
callback phones look it sound all those
last year models I feels I'm I'm just
gonna give you as we say in in my
country I'm gonna give you the change
right now out of all the investment um
man every time that I would test that
Tegra 3 it would look beautiful on
benchmarks and then once you started
using that thing I would just die you
know whether it was like whether it was
the nexus 7 or the HTC One X I don't
care I mean I don't care about
benchmarks I don't even bother to run
them because you know honestly it's
pointless at what's the point about a
processor like the Tegra 3 that look
beautiful on numbers and it performs so
badly mmhmm yeah it was the same thing
with me with the u.s. versions of I
think the 1x yeah Brandon had brought
the 1x to lunch with him the
international 1x when we first met and
he learnt play with it I was like wow
this thing kind of lags huh and then I
got the AT&amp;amp;T one with the dual core s4
in it and yeah like wow this is inferior
in most benchmarks and most specs but it
runs better and i think that's when the
disconnect really started making itself
evident to me now that's you know that's
crate versus cortex or whatever but i
don't know
well no not it might was I right on that
I don't know yeah you were okay yeah the
original s4 was great was the first it
was the second iteration which was the
version that go to the crate
architecture yeah so anyway this is
exactly the kind of conversations like
that like what this conversation has
become are exactly what I hope to avoid
by never using benchmarks again
unfortunately we still have to run him I
think I don't think we've changed our
policy on that but I'm gonna hate it I
thought it was interesting in that an
antec right up on the Samsung thing they
noted that they've moved on to other
benchmarks didn't even use the quadrant
or the mainstream ones so yeah maybe
there is something to be gained by
analyzing non-traditional aspects of
performance but like you said in general
I can definitely appreciate your desire
to just wash your hands of the whole
thing jump um ok yeah you know and you
know what's even funnier is better they
are important for gaming sorry Jaime but
yeah they are important for gaming ok
like ice storm and I storm extreme I
understand those are the 3dmark tests
they're pretty ok try to benchmark try
to benchmark an iphone yeah no no but
still but still which phone runs me you
know we we've been talking about this
with Brandon for the longest time his
favorite game is asphalt 7 and so is
mine yeah we've tested it on every
station vinkel phone yeah I'm sorry
sorry Steven it wasn't a point game
sorry sorry to disappoint you asphalt 7
that's but the point being is it's just
funny try to benchmark an iphone it's
still asphalt 7 runs best on the iphone
5 then I'm pretty much every phone I've
tested it on and that's just the reality
so where's thing right yeah exactly I
don't know you know I'm I I hope that
some some intelligent conversation comes
of this not just in the comments or in
our forums but from an industry
perspective and we're gonna you know
we'll have a look at our benchmark
policy moving forward and hopefully we
can we can find a nice middle ground
because yeah throwing the baby out with
the bathwater is never a good idea but
you know well we'll see it was just
interesting to see a manufacturer get
get beat up for it in the press and and
rightfully so I think but it is also our
fault as a as a body as an industry 44 I
think you're not leaning too heavily on
these benchmarks from time where the
waters encouraging them to me exact that
decisions exactly yeah and they're the
end this is by no means the first time
it's happened we many and other
manufacturers have done it before but
yeah I think we should take a look at
this and realize it for the wake-up call
that it is but let's move on and close
out Android if that's all right with you
gents and we'll talk just briefly a
better device I think none of us is
carrying right the one day it was not as
care that I think the one guy who could
answer some questions about this is the
guy was too good to join us on the air
today for due to his heavy workload
Taylor Martin's nexus 7 the new one
according to jaime rivera is finally an
ipad mini competitor why I deny that no
iPad competitor Oh an iPad Camaro oh
yeah well then well why I'm a you you
should tell us why see up to the for
example and probably the point that I
was making in the editorial is the top
of mind right now is that the ipad is
the best tablet and you know it i think
it android has a lot of fault in that
because of the problem there is in the
ecosystem and the fact that you know
honeycomb was terrible the fact that
applications still are not scaling well
you know it's just taking android so
long the people just don't want the
drama and they just end up buying ipads
and i remember when the first Nexus 7
was launched I mean they you know even
even if even if Google criticized the
form factor of a 7-inch tablet you know
that was really the smartest solution
for the whole app problem the fact that
you look for a tablet that has a
portrait orientation and the end that
scales those smartphone applications and
in less of a horrible way and that's
even I don't mean to interrupt your bed
can just say that was that's my favorite
move ever they're like well we can't fix
this ecosystem these are just still
going to be phone apps scaling up to a
tablet screen so let's make the screen
as small as possible yeah i mean that's
awesome i I remember picking up my Nexus
7 and that's one of the main reasons I
wrote that editorial almost a year ago
about the nexus 7 being my new best
friend because
man yeah it solves that problem it's
like wow least resistance yeah exactly
it did it did but the problem with the
nexus 7 was we remember the Tegra 3 we
remember the display it was it was just
an affordable tablet right um so it did
solve the a problem the problem is it
wasn't really a high-end tablet it was
just an affordable tablet um that it had
a pretty design and everything but it
wasn't a groundbreaking high-end product
and we can't deny the fact that the ipad
is high-end I mean whether it's the
retina display or the hardware
construction just everything about the
ipad is high-end from the applications
to everything including an ass yes
including the mass sadly for now yeah um
but I guess the point that I'm trying to
make is that for the first time ever um
I mean Samsung still comes out with
these with this terrible resolution on
these on these on these landscape
tablets and yes we've got the nexus 10
but we still have the app problem so
well and the tabs and the notes no
you're right about the resolution
problem I my girlfriend of the tab ate
last night 38 last night she's like
she's the resolution on this thing is
low oh my god is exactly and so the
Nexus 7 is like the first high-end
Android tablet because it's got its got
better than retina display resolution
it's got better resolution than the ipad
it solves the app problem the
constructions good the display is
finally up to speed they're not using a
Tegra 3 anymore and they're keeping that
price mm-hmm to 29 99 is all right bosta
not exactly either they're they're
keeping that price so I'm like okay I
have no excuse to buy an ipad anymore
that's fascinating that's you know I I
can't argue with you i would love to get
my hands on it i will say this Taylor
Martin is hard at work on the review and
that'll be out soon I'm not going to
give any spoilers on on what his
thoughts are but I don't think he's
thrown it out the window I'll say that
yeah that's a good thing what about you
Stephen notes here and I know you're not
necessarily the biggest tablet guy in
existing I love tablets um I mostly
think it's it's a big improvement I'm a
little confused about the choice of soc
but if it no like the Moto X we're
seeing now doesn't have to necessarily
be the bleeding edge to be a worthwhile
a ship to power and modern
mmm device I am a little upset about the
Google Wallet thing though now what will
fill us in on the Google Wallet story
well it has NFC still you can use you
know Android Beam to send files and
other device but they removed the secure
element it's the hardware component that
when Google wallet's talking to a you
know credit card terminal it's the part
that you know does the encryption it's
what stores your card details so you
don't have to have an active internet
connection to use google wallet and it
was there in the first Nexus 7 and it's
not there on the new one and this is
like and I'm like a 50-cent chip a tiny
little you know surface mounted
component just why it's yet uh you're
gonna hate me for saying this but I you
know I think that Google what Google did
was just grab the nexus 7 pattern and
check on all the historical data of how
many people actually use the tablet to
make a payment and understood that
nobody did and therefore they remove the
feature that's a would have said it's a
chance yep with nexus 7 the first one
they looked at will how many people take
pictures with their their tab well so
sheltered thank you well that's that's
the thing i mean the the the camera of
the original Nexus 7 was not bad it was
terrible um front-facing camera was just
horrendous so they couldn't get any data
from the camera because there wasn't a
back-end right i think one was terrible
but it feels like they already did that
you know the trimming of the fat when
designing the first one they said well
this is a product it's not going to need
a rear-facing camera then they're
changing course with the the new one
it's just weird how they're adding some
things taking away others it is weird
and I do wonder you you also wrote a
piece to even called is the lack of
google wallet on the nexus 7 evidence
that google's abandoning the project and
it's a solid question to ask I part of
me says what you were saying no one
makes payments with tablets and it was
may be dumb to have it on the Nexus 7 in
the first place right yeah but part of
me is like well we also haven't heard
google talk a lot about wallet recently
and maybe this is gonna go the way of
you know google reader and yeah wave and
nylon stand now oh it's a new one Oh
googled a log catalogs right what that
was that any
way who knows by the end of the year I
think we'll have a better sense of where
while what is heading if it you know
doesn't show up on if the Moto X can't
do it if the whatever this next Nexus
phone is then I'd say we're in trouble
agreed the Moto X is definitely the
canary a coal mine for a google wallet
now the quite the question is does this
a droid ultra lineup include the factor
or is it gone as well cuz that's pretty
much like the first phone that we should
yeah as I I wouldn't judge based on that
though because verizon's always blocked
access to wallet so I don't know if we
enter this room bro the droid ultra
phones are I consider the more more
verizon phones than motorola phones if
that makes sense like there's so much
carrier interference there there's so
much carrier dictation on features and
specs and i think verizon just announced
recently that the that motorola will be
the only makers of droid branded
equipped yes yes so that's crazy so yeah
i wouldn't use those as a as a measuring
stick at all we'll know if the ex has it
now I'll ask you one question Michael
because I remember that one of your
first videos in pocket now was actually
an experiment over google wallet yes I
was gonna mention that it was a CVS was
it yeah there's a CVS the haircutting
place the bowling alley the dunkin
donuts yeah it was great and i loved
actually that was my first video I ever
edited myself for pocket now and I used
it I edited it on an iMovie on my older
macbook air but no I had a blast and
that's what i was thinking of what we
were talking about her because listen
using google wallet is a lot of fun
you're paying with your phone is fun as
hell or giant tablet as the case may be
yeah right exactly how angry the tablet
it's probably just like taking pictures
with your tablet okay let me go take my
tablet out of the backpack and i'll be
back to make this payment exactly right
now like that stupid but but man paying
with your phone as a blast so i really
hope just for the sake of living and a
geekier as geeky a future as possible
that Google Wallet sticks around I
really wanted knows what happened Isis
this was supposed to be the big like
carrier and financial institution backed
alternative that was being promoted to
push google wallet out of the way it's
no wild too because everyone wants their
cut as I understand it the big thing
that's stalling all these initiatives
that this was the card companies wonder
but Isis was the cabal of all the credit
card companies and the carriers these
are the ones who should have been
succeeding right I'm sure they can't
even agree amongst themselves that
couldn't be I don't know it's just for
you to be able to hack a physical credit
card you know to duplicate the credit
card you physically need the card um the
problem with phones especially android
phones is if you have a rooted phone I
mean what are your guarantees that
remotely your phone is not gonna be
compromised I still I still feel
skeptical about making payments with my
secure element yeah yeah that keeps any
hacker from make it you know if they
knew your PIN they could still make
purchases but they can't read your
credit card number off the phone or
anything like that right but I know I'm
I think it's I guess it's a cultural
thing is what I'm trying to say I I
still see it for example I particularly
if I had the feature enabled I remember
I was with Brandon in philly and that
was like you remember Steven when i was
there and that was like the first time
we went to bestbuy and that was the
first time that i had actually ever seen
somebody pay something with the phone
right I found it cool I was just like
man there are more probabilities that I
could lose my phone than lose my wallet
nah so I don't know I still debated I
still think that it's a gimmick it's a
cool feature to have but it's still at
the gimmicky point well absolutely yeah
there's no arguing with you on that it's
still a gimmick at this point but but at
some point either the you know the
industry the financial industry and the
technological side of things are going
to get behind this or they're going to
get behind another form of it and I I do
hope it's google wallet because I think
Google stands the best chance of
implementing it properly but given their
current trend of canceling anything they
do they get bored with yeah that's true
that's that's a big problem yeah or
can't monetize it's going to be making
any money off of wallet besides knowing
what you're spending on right right put
in you know but that's value that's way
valuable to them it's yeah oh yeah well
if if people would use it actually right
yeah there's the rub well let's let's
move on on that closing note of Google
stuff and talk a little bit about
Windows Phone we just have two things
talkin Windows Phone two things iOS then
we can get to listener may land and
cruise hi mate how are you on time you
got ten minutes for us uh yeah yeah
alright cool do I want to let everyone
know that the strangest comparison I've
ever done the HTC 8xt vs HTC One is up
actually that's probably not true i've
done stranger comparisons but this one
was just particularly in apt but it just
hit me in the middle of the head I was
like the 8xt it's Sprint's first windows
phone 8 device ever it's HTC's newest
windows phone 8 device it's the first
the only Windows Phone device with boom
sound and it's out and i wanted to cover
it a little bit before the full review
came out so it's compared to the one and
guess who wins it's the high-end device
it's a video that i recommend you watch
yeah the other colorful chassis didn't
win you over yeah so here's the thing
very quickly this is not a dig on HTC
because this has happened with every
almost every manufacturer I've reviewed
but it's really unfortunate when the
first review device you get is defective
oh no that's what happened to me yeah so
I thankfully HTC was awesome they sent
me a new one is like immediately and I
just got it today so I've moved
everything over but for the comparison i
just used everything that was not
effective so you know with our
comparisons we can tweak them a little
bit you know if we don't have enough
battery information yet we can say we
don't have this yet but check the review
you know blah blah blah blah blah so we
did the camera we did the hardware that
a little bit of the software and blah
blah blah what didn't work the it was is
it was like the phone was possessed the
the yeah like apps would apps would
crash it would it was the latest Windows
Phone experience I ever had ever and
that's why I knew it was broken because
I'm emailing other people at other sites
like our friends at other sites and I'm
like guys you're a texty how is it is it
like he or whatever and a lot of them
are like well it's a little laggy but
it's not like a big disaster like what's
your problem I'm like did this thing is
well oh my god and I couldn't listen to
music for more than five seconds without
the sound just exploding in my ears it
was horrible it was that's wrong but it
because it's a defective unit I want to
make it clear once again listeners this
is not because the 8xt is that way it's
because I had a crappy defective unit
but it's
it robs a lot of time from your review
process obviously when that happens so I
have my new one I am getting used to it
today I'm testing all the features that
were broken on the defective one and the
review will be up very soon but the 8xt
is beautiful California blue as you say
Steven and guys having boom sound on a
Windows Phone device is really really
cool it is nice having forward firing
speakers with a lot of bass and a lot of
amplitude on a windows phone so i will
psych in in action yeah it's really
crowd other other than that is there
anything other than that yeah there is
actually because um you know how Windows
Phone we outside the Lumia 1020 we've
always complained that windows phones
have the same stock camera viewfinder
and that doesn't let you really do a lot
and it sucks at letting you know what
shooting mode you're in well HTC has
ported their excellent view finder app
from the one basically to the 8xt so
while you can use the original windows
phone shooter you also can use the HTC
camera and it is heavy software it's
it's not terribly responsive but it's
got the same you know persistent shutter
and record buttons on the screen all the
time it's got little filters it's got
HDR it's got a bunch of contrast
saturation stuff and in video you can
shoot at 60fps you can do a bunch of
cool stuff so that's pretty cool that's
worthwhile mil yeah but this phone
probably could should have been called
the eighth st not the others no I was
about to say I mean that the phone is
not really an 8x what's really just it's
not really I mean lukien yeah yeah hmm
was it wvga yeah yeah yeah it's pretty
pretty rough on the screen but uh
there's a high-end device that deserves
maybe a little bit of our talk before we
move on and that's everyone's favorite
yellow pocket now sidearm the Lumia 1020
which Taylor I've been using a lot and
shadow Oh where's my review unit I don't
you let you will have to yeah actually
we got our review unit from the good
people at AT&amp;amp;T so I cannot having some
communication issues with with other
people but listen here's the
should we be concerned about the Lumia
1020 yeah because of its sales figures
on one particular site Stephen shank
your thoughts oh man I got so much flak
for that post basically given read this
it's that you know we're trying to get
an early assessment of how the 1020 is
doing because everyone's putting so much
on its success or failure so an early
way to get a look is to check out
Amazon's sales rankings so Amazon will
show you like a TNT all of the the best
selling phones currently and so at the
top we have models like the one galaxy
s3 is actually higher than the galaxy s4
surprisingly it's chi pricing yeah yeah
900 windows phone yeah uh and the 1020
it was at number 13 on Monday but then
you would expect a new phone do you know
you know build a little momentum over
the first couple days but instead it
dropped back to like 20 25 I checked a
little later in the day after posting
that and moved back up it was at 24 I
think it was up to 20 then so it's
showing some momentum but it's a lot
lower than you would hope a phone that's
as hyped as this that has so much you
know running on it so what I'm which
lists are you looking at because there
are many best sellers list on the amazon
thing maybe you said this is a second
ago but this was just AT&amp;amp;T oh just 18
because cell phones and accessories
updated hourly so this is what its at
right now the Nokia Lumia 920 ok so the
Nokia Lumia 1020 is back up to 13 right
now okay that's promising and that's
good is I followed immediately by the
920 at number 14 go ahead i was the 900
still higher no the nine huh Thank guy I
guess I guess I you know following
Stevens concern if you all remember this
listeners I mean the Lumia 920 sold out
uh I don't know how long it took me I
could not okay so I was in the US when
the phone launched then I couldn't buy
it it was sold out everywhere well it
was sold out everywhere and it was just
like stir Sunday oh no that was the 900
yeah yeah that was the 900 this was in
the fall of last year right and I I went
to bestbuy I went to AT&amp;amp;T I went
everywhere I tried buying it online
mean it was sold out everywhere just a
couple of days after the launch so okay
what is it what is it phone supposed to
be hot it's supposed to be hot in the
first days when it's launched that's
when the hype is built that's when the
ads are there that's when all the
investment is happening and oh so our
should we be concerned I'm sorry but I
am concerned I am I I do feel a sad that
this is not gonna be the haven for nokia
because this phone really is worth the
money one fair criticism had heard of
these complaints is that a lot of people
might be preferring to get the phone in
a brick-and-mortar store or from
somewhere like microsoft where they can
get the the camera grip accessory for
free yeah yes which is I did but I went
through the Amazon ordering thing and it
has a pretty good discount on the phone
you can get it for it was offering it to
me for 270 which is as far as i know the
cheapest i've seen for just the 300 but
30 bucks less than the on contract price
so i'm not so sure that's why people are
staying away from amazon but it might be
just too early I don't know right and
it's also a single point of reference
but you know it's interesting when I
look back on my history looking at the
Amazon bestseller list and like that was
what the that was our Haven and the
underdog sectors for like webos was like
what's the VR doing right now is it on
you where's oh it's really high on
Amazon that's awesome and like the Lumia
900 was way ahead yes it's that's number
25 it's really high no the veer was high
for a bit how high did in here ever
guide oh no no no guys hit triple digits
25 oh whatever maybe wasn't a very Merry
was the pre it wasn't a pre too because
i never saw sale in the US anyway it
doesn't matter the point is it's a tough
it's tricky thing as you say Stephen to
forecast total sales it's just an
indication and anyway we'll we'll see
but i think the phones high price and
its kind of nature as a one-trick pony a
very awesome one-trick pony but a
one-trick pony will keep it from will
keep it from wide adoption over let me
just revisit that phrase for a second a
one-trick pony could be a very good
thing what if that one trick is like I
don't know it can poop out
hundred-dollar bills that's a pretty
good job some trick right or you know or
amazing photographs you know that's a
great thing to I want to be clear I am
NOT regretting my purchase at all but
yeah I love my one trick pony or my wart
hog is it as it were I was all ready to
yell at you about that headline I guess
when I was a capitalization I was
watching you like write that in draft
like is this gonna be about the animal
or about the plane animal right so you
were only gonna yell at me if it was
about the animals i didn't know i didn't
want to get ahead of myself okay all
right yeah yeah I don't know if I've
announced that or not the Lumia 1020
review is up that was up last Friday at
midnight so if you missed it go check it
out I did enjoy that analogy that might
be my favorite analogy i've ever used
guess upset you didn't use the picture
of the the VW Bug next to the the a-10s
giant cannon or scale it's ridiculous in
the guns large entire car I nobody but
that's well man that they just left to
my mind that I love that plane and I
love the phone so moving out I OS before
hi May has to depart really latest
budget iPhone photo is just one of the
ugliest things I've ever seen and I hope
it's fake what do we think what which
photo are you you talking about photo in
the of the boxes cuz that was in
boston's me they're chasing photo from
your store in july 26 with the FCC label
we're seeing yes hey it kind of looks
like you took the wafers off an ice
cream sandwich but the ice cream inside
stayed in the same form and selection
act it so it's nice and shiny right all
right it's like if a klondike bar was
white instead of black and and
lengthened okay so that looks like it
looks like a cheap case I don't know
doesn't it it's it's it's tough okay so
for the record everybody Apple has never
submitted the iphone to FCC approval
before it gets approved I mean before
they announced it they always we haven't
seen the paperwork well okay so AB
nobody you know Apple is supposed to go
through the process just like every
other company meaning you know they have
to submit the phone to the FCC and it
has to go through the same process where
everything is public you know it's its
parts
legal it has to be public so you know we
we would already be getting the
documentation that's why I call us fake
yeah and it actually has been called out
fake by by a bunch of people in the
comments some of whom are now
blacklisted because they couldn't
refrain from calling us in foul names so
yeah but the thing is like the I'm glad
that this is most certainly not real
what about the other one what about the
one that's more interesting with me but
wait this is only the FCC bit was new
here we've seen the same Hardware in
previous pics even if the FCC bit is
fake the actual phone they're very much
could be real well but look at the look
at the the one that look at the link
that the first commenter is talking
about their it links to the images of
the I mean look at those letters that
looks so cheesy it does it look like an
iPhone come on yeah it really doesn't
like it's I don't know I don't know I
mean that this is why I Jaime this is
why I wanted to throw you a bone or two
because as our resident Apple expert you
know it's it's it's not gonna happen
especially with this phone specifically
with this phone it's not that's not it
it's too early within the process by the
way um Apple is definitely not gonna
launch phones until October in their
music event said late-september early
October and usually what they do they
announced it they immediately send it to
the FCC that that same day when they
announced it it gets approved in a week
and that's the reason why it takes 10
days for Apple to start selling their
new generation iphone okay all right so
what's the story on the on the packaging
on the on the other 1i cuz okay so it's
not interesting to me ok so the packets
so the packaging is awake go ahead you
know what's even everyone thinks asked
me to yeah okay sure a lot of this is
not right the packaging is clearly fake
but remember that Apple does a lot of
prototyping so they most likely did a
prototype of the box and you never know
I guess I guess probably it's funny
because I I asked this question of the
day on the pocket out daily yesterday
the day before yesterday when this is
this news broke and I am not kidding you
I have a thousand 157 comments on
YouTube
overly over what the iphone what the sea
of iphone 5c stands for because you know
digit times digit times is reporting
that the the 5c that the name is real
and you know digit times is rarely ever
wrong um so it's is rolling all the time
well yeah but they're right all right
most of the time so I guess the point
being is you know and we'll leave this
as a question for everybody what does
the C stand for Steven what do you think
it stands for so for example the iphone
that you know ever since the bead and
yeah and that's been the face ever since
yeah ever doesn't get it that's been the
thing ever since the mag the apple to
their there came an apple to s that
there was no apple to mess there was a
Jessie to see and to GS and the two plus
well which was the apple product that
had an S before there was one they were
that's where the moniker was born and
that's the reason why we got the iphone
3gs which was speed and you know Steve
Jobs actually even mentioned that on the
keynote so we got the iphone 4s you know
we're expecting the iphone 5s which
should be more speed but the question is
what the heck does the C stand for
everybody everybody was like it stands
for cheap it stands for crappy yes
that's for kk are we centered here yeah
we are that you would rate you would
read these comments and youjizz you know
whatever it listeners whenever you're
having a bad day just go to our YouTube
comments please yeah oh that's like the
best wait that's like the best way to
unstress yourself I've been surprised
actually at how civil the YouTube
comments have been overall but yeah we
will have to see what what this is I
think see I think if this is legit this
name iphone 5c it has to be for the
budget one I you know it can't be
associated with a high-end device if all
we see for this next Apple hardware
iteration is iphone 5c I don't know guys
am I alone in this see just sounds like
such a lame letter it's cuz it sounds
like it's giving it a grade it's the
iphone app
he died phone try harder next time
iphone 5 copyright so whatever i guess i
don't know but I'm gonna get excited
about it I will say once again this is
going to be the first phone I iphone I
wait in line to get really yeah well
assuming Brandon approves it i think i
think he was down with my idea on this
but i haven't owned an iphone since the
3gs in 2008 and i think it's going to be
worthwhile now that the OS has seen such
a thorough revamp or is in the midst of
one I think it's worthwhile to explore
what's changed since then and what might
bring people back to the iphone now that
you know not that everyone's leaving
iphone but scores of people really have
left the iphone ecosystem for the
Android one I mean we see it in the
number and and still their numbers or
keep growing year-over-year it's just
it's just drizzling but the thing is
back when the I back in the last time I
owned an iphone it was the thing to have
there wasn't this iphone backlash of
like oh it's boring oh it's lame oh it's
too small like it was hot the only
people complaining about it where the
windows mobile dorks okay so for the
record for the record when I when you
know when I made the announcement that I
was gonna be our resident apple guy Ike
week I think it was like four hundred I
think that's like a record like 450 or
500 comments that where everybody was
like oh kool aid right no right that was
our audience but yeah we're pocket now
the Microsoft fan site right exactly and
that's you know that's just I guess the
point that I'm trying to make is there's
always been the iphone haters that was
back in the day of the 3gs when I
wouldn't when that happened and that's
just the way it is uh yeah in our sector
yes what do what do we think about the
idea that this 5c might replace the ipod
touch and apples lineup oh okay so so
here's you know and that's that's a
really interesting question that is um
so for the longest time you remember
when we we had the rumors of the iphone
5 back of the day when the 4s was
launched and it turned out that the
design that was used and that was being
leaked of the phone was ended up being
the IPI the ipod touch 5th generation
you know so the design was real the
prototype that exists but it ended up
falling into the ipod touch 5 um so
honestly I feel that there there's a
market I mean you know right now they're
doing this whole facetime voice thing on
iOS 7 you know it just seems like of
Apple is trying to figure out a way to
you know like disconnect their
dependency on carriers um so hey I mean
if I got a voice over IP phone or I
could just buy a data only plan and an
apple figure that one out why not I mean
I stick a hell of a leap for them it
does it does and the technology is not
there by the way listeners I mean if you
try to make a voice over IP call driving
it just won't go through it will it'll
go through but eventually that the speed
of the vehicle will disconnect you yeah
from your image from your daily handoffs
are not as elegant as they are yeah yeah
they are there they're not as elegant on
data as they are in voice even on LTE
and we're still not an LTE advanced
where apparently that's gonna change so
I I do feel that there is a there is a
point for that I mean the ipod touch
keeps its the best selling ipod yes it
is uh but it there it keeps losing a
reason for existence as the iphone you
know it especially if they drop the
price on this phone so now it's just
gonna it's gonna have to be crazy cheap
to pick up where the the ipod touch left
off because always been the you know the
budget way to get involved with iOS
exactly exactly so you know right now
the ipod touch i think it said I think
it's 300 bucks you know with taxes and
everything but the lowest ipod touch 5
and if you get a cheap iPhone that's
gonna be closer to that price what are
you gonna pick the thing is the ipod
touch used to be my like at home tablet
look back before tablets before the
first ipad consumer eyes tablets the
ipod touch was what i used at home and i
wanted an iOS app experience and wife I
just wanted to browse around the house
right now that the ipod itself as a
music player has been largely you know
made irrelevant buy iPhones and other
smartphones and as a tablet it's just
way too small compared to what else is
out there including the iPad Mini which
is very affordable and the Nexus
evolution even more affordable yeah I
don't see that it has a reason to exist
anymore
yeah I wonder what its sales figures are
like but I don't have that data so
anyway yeah Stephen I man who was that
yeah I don't know I think I think that
their it there is a compelling reason
for that thought to be true there is a
compelling reason for that to happen I
just think that the technology is not
there yet for an ipod touch or a
disconnected phone from carriers that
you know that you could pretty much just
use for voice over IP the technology is
being built into iOS 7 with facetime
voice which I was I was it's funny don't
laugh I was in the shower thinking last
time I was like FaceTime voice where do
they come up with that name why did they
call it voice time or call time was like
FaceTime where is the face looks like
chat heads I'm like where is the face in
the voice call seriously I'm like swap
the knave evil come on boys you're
getting face time with someone right uh
like having a meeting you're getting
like some one-on-one FaceTime exactly
but you're not really being you know a
FaceTime voice you're not being able to
actually see the person yeah yeah it's
pretty it's pretty wack there's too much
going on with that let's stop talking
about it oh yeah Oh what I want to do is
actually move on to listener melon one
ask auntie Rivera if he has to go or if
he's gonna join us i feeI let's say I
think I could still stretch that ah
that's lovely so what's your hearts it's
wonderful isn't it a brief note on
listener mail for this week we already
made the announcement about the special
edition episode earlier on I have since
gotten an email indicating that I'm not
the only one or things that's a good
idea so that's probably gonna happen but
the three we're gonna read are not the
oldest on this episode they're just the
ones that fit this group of people as it
always is and guys really appreciate you
writing in but we do have to get two new
people over people who have already
written in it's not to say FU to our old
followers or to our loyal listeners but
it is to say that new people deserve the
air time as well so with no further ado
let's jump into listener mail
hello PocketNow podcast crew says John
Blake a first one to say thank you for
the opportunity to participate in the LG
optimus G giveaway contest John thank
you for participating and listeners
thank you again everyone for
participating by leaving us reviews on
iTunes which helped us out do appreciate
it my question says John is now that the
galaxy note 3 is rumored to have an LCD
screen along with the usual AMOLED do
you think that Samsung is going to make
a galaxy note 3 active in an attempt to
make another branch in the galaxy lineup
also do you believe Sam side will profit
by having the two options or should they
just combine the active build into their
flagship models from now on I look
forward to hearing from you sincerely
John Blake John this is a cool question
man one the answer is yes that's what
that's what's gonna happen well which
one uh well there are like I how much
was it Stephen like five different
variants of the galaxy note 3 you know
different device models being rumored
and so yeah they're talking about i
think it was for um different one like a
super premium and then exactly i'll seed
exactly right exactly and one of them
had an LCD and the other ones were
AMOLED and one had and one of these
devices had a smaller camera than the
other one so this is pretty much an
active just that's just the way it's
gonna be and do you think that it's it's
smart for samsung to profit from these
phones yeah I just you know I I feel
that all phones should be active but
then again yeah yeah but technology is
still not at the point where there's
this new news post as they were you know
galaxy s4 actives are already drowning
for users because they you know it's it
requires for it to be active it requires
special procedures for you to ensure
that it doesn't drown and you should
watch Michael Fisher's review video for
all the specifics on those procedures so
yes I want that to happen but I don't
think the technology is there yet I am a
little confused about this question
basically why the LCD versus AMOLED
issue factors into it being waterproof
or not because the the galaxy s4 active
has an LCD whereas the game is but
that's not a factor that waterproofing
knows any it's a but it might be it
might be a clue is the only oh
they tended to her with cost-saving
measures on the active versions exactly
actually exact so what do you think
Steve I mean do you do you think that
it's likely and is it exciting them I
wouldn't bet on it at all I think that
the waterproofing is a picture we're
just gonna see on smaller devices I
don't think that we're gonna see there's
probably water group tablets haven't
there yeah they're the Xperia tablet Z
is water physios okay but I don't think
it's something that's going to take on
nearly as passionately as user
responding to these waterproof phones
because you don't want to damage your
phone you carry it with you everywhere
tablet it's going to be exposed to a lot
less and even though the note is closer
to phone than tablet I don't see it
getting into these same situations I
guess don't think is gonna be a demand
for it so i don't know i don't know i
would say they think about this Michael
think about the scenario think about the
s-pen being able to work when the
display is way so that's that's that's X
of the pointer was gonna make so the
note 3 first of all is going to be
Steven you said it a little bit it's
going to be a phone that somebody buys
on contract and they're going to carry
as their smartphone they're not going to
use it as a tablet I would normally
agree with you that maybe there is not
much overlap between phablet users the
phablet market demographic and people
who need an active phone I'd probably
say that there's there's very little
overlap there actually but then Samsung
has never been one to two to exhibit any
kind of restraint No exactly yeah it's a
samsung we're talking about that's not
Apple that's the second and the third
point is time a very very good good one
there people were saying on the galaxy
s4 active review in the comments when
I'm complaining about the lack of wet
finger tracking making that screen
useless when it's even the slightest bit
wet it just doesn't respond someone very
very intelligently suggested well what
if it had an S Pen it was like oh my god
yes that would be amazing because he
would that work underwater I wonder not
probably not in its current iteration
because you know it uses a mixture of
induction along with that the Wacom
digitizer and something else but so it
would need a modification but wouldn't
that be great that way they wouldn't
have to implement wet finger tracking if
they didn't want to but you could just
use the S Pen if you were underwater
with the thing and it would work great
but i'm saying i'm not sure
could even work at all because i don't
think the induction is gonna work
underwater cheering oh I'm sure it'll
require special s-pen yeah well that's
the thing just remember that the the
actually it's the s-pen that generates
the the touch meaning it's the software
that text the pen you can't just use
anything it has to be a sapphic s-pen
absolutely like for example and do this
do this do this test get the s-pen close
to the display and push the tip of the
pen the tip of the pen and the phone
will respond to pushing to the tip
without at even touching the display oh
right right right yeah no I mean it's it
would require a special take on the
thing but listen I I think that s been
theory is probably the most far-fetched
bit of it I I you know I don't see
Samsung put in the effort into making a
special s-pen for this kind of weirdo
thing I imagine it'll be a lot like the
galaxy s4 active just in a larger size
and i'll tell you what guys i would buy
the hell out of that okay just just
think about this Michael just think
about an ad where you have this actor in
his in his helmet and boots in a
construction site under the rain yeah
and he's just supervising what's going
on and then he pulls out his note 3 with
the S Pen the phone completely wet and
the guy is able to use the phone within
you know that scenario that is gonna be
the ad that's gonna sell that damn phone
I mean if they figure that out that's
gonna be they're gonna make waterproof
use honkers and and also you know I made
it be completely accurate you should
impose some out of place string music
over that and put like a gray filter on
it and also put in some unfunny snark
and that would be a real Samsung
commercial yeah exactly so what would ya
well we're talking about waterproof
devices for a moment I guess want to
mention because it was too minor to
cover in news but I thought it was
interesting someone over on XDA came up
with a neat hack for the Xperia Z to let
you take pictures underwater by using
the phone's proximity sensor as I
shudder know so you can sort of proper
you cuz you tap it with your finger it
detects a duration of the how long has
been covered up for registers it as a
button press oh that is very cool very
in Anna I mean it's like that as like a
commute and evidence of how the
community can be awesome sometimes
I really like shit and I are playing
ahead yeah we're on the galaxy s4 active
we just use the volume rocker and that
makes a lot of yeah yeah you know the
problem the next thing they have to
solve though is underwater photos now
need to be better because whenever you
put these lenses underwater everything's
out of focus underwater so one thing at
a time you can't and you can't have to
focus right yeah it's true so John thank
you for that I'm just writing down that
a little something there John thank you
for your question that is gonna be
awesome I really look forward to seeing
what comes of the galaxy note the new
Galaxy Note family if there is to be a
family which we're pretty sure there is
and really cool question thanks a lot
John next one is from Jamie Somerville
High paka no team thank you for
answering my previous reader mail
question and Jamie thank you for blowing
away my justification for not answering
the other repeat writers in sorry guys I
live in the UK so don't don't know much
about us mobile networks so my question
is about carrier branding on phones most
of the flagship phones from the big
companies like Samsung HTC and nokia all
have carrier branding on them and also
carrier splash screens if you get them
on contract from the respective carrier
the only exception is Apple they never
have branding of any kind on their
phones are in the software I wondered
how they manage this and other companies
have not big fan you know the great work
they have videos of all the carrier
executives snoring and blackmail them ok
so i guess i guess that was done in this
world I guess Apple did something that
no company had done before and all these
companies followed I mean they they
would not launch a phone until they
found a carrier that was willing to do
what they wanted um meanings and said no
at first horizon said no you know they
first approached verizon and they
completely denied and if you remember
there was this motorola itunes phone
that i believe was launched exclusively
on verizon yeah the rocker no yeah
auntie ok but because that phone became
a flop that's the reason why Apple a bit
why Verizon pretty much turned them down
so it's really interesting that you know
Apple all Apple did was create a
business model and
sell it to AT&amp;amp;T and they sold it so well
that AT&amp;amp;T was willing to invest on the
iPhone you know they invested money on
that project up to the point where they
kept exclusivity on that phone for three
generations pretty much for generations
and I guess the point being is Apple
just proved that the system works that
people don't care about the carrier
branding that people want a product
because of you know other reasons and
you know other companies follow the
trail with the galaxy s3 for example
which was the first one and I guess it's
just know how was Apple able to pull it
off well they just showed that it worked
that was the condition and I'd you're
making a good point there like Jamie you
should know that in the States it is
becoming somewhat more common not to
have carrier branding on some devices
sprint didn't do it i wrote a small
piece about how sprint didn't have any
carrier branding on the HTC one right
they also didn't have any on the s4 but
Sprint's official comment on that was
that yeah we're not we don't brand it so
that if we want to make it a prepaid
phone if we want to give it to one of
our other brands you know dispatch some
of our inventory elsewhere we don't have
to then remove the silk screening and do
a whole bunch of stuff so sometimes it's
a practical decision on the carrier's
part these days yeah and I think that
carriers are understanding more and more
that you know they should just focus on
their network like Apple said at some
point do you focus on your network I'll
focus on the hardware yeah in the end
it's a power play I think it is if you
look at those like a bell curve we're
the really really low end phones carries
already interested in you once you have
to buy on your own and bring to the
carrier doesn't have any branding and
then let ya pick the middle of the
phones they're all gonna have the
branding and then when you get as
powerful as Apple or you know HTC is
becoming a sprint once again you see no
branding know and then let's remember
let's remember something very important
Apple wasn't not even the shadow of the
company that they are now before the
iphone it was the iphone that pretty
much made the company what it is you
know if you look at apple's stock when
the iphone was announced I think the
price of the stock was like twenty seven
dollars it's currently at 411 but it's
already skyrocket to 730 um and this was
you know this graze all happened after
the iphone so Apple did not have the
power that they have right now I guess
that what they did was fine found the
really nice CEO
that was willing to sit down with steve
jobs and have Steve Jobs plays magic and
you know just completely you know just
grab the guy and put him in his pocket
but let's not remember let's not forget
the fact that you know the iphone was
kind of groundbreaking I mean when you
pull that phone you started using it you
know I'm sure I'm sure that the CEO you
know it was just off his blackberry back
with his / his role most likely was
rough delavega the CEO saying no no no
it was it was this other guy a Texan I
mean the guy had a really deep Texan
accent I forget who the guy was but you
know I I can just imagine the guy just
putting his blackberry on the table and
grabbing that iphone for the first time
and just flick scrolling because it was
the first phone that did those things it
was so stupid but it was III just
imagine the guy being so blown away that
he was like okay let's do it let's do it
your way I trust you yeah i wish i could
find that i wish i could do some google
magic and find that CEOs name but I
can't but anyway while we're talking
about splash grains singular CEO Stan
Sigmund that was this okay yeah sounds
like a superhero I was just gonna say
that's a lot of alliteration for one
phrase yeah I don't want to miss it out
on this but we do have to move on but
just finally in with regard to carrier
splash screens I've told this tale
before but I was floored to find out
that when i got my unlocked from the
factory blackberry z10 at the blackberry
event it had a normal black berry splash
screen but the minute I put my AT&amp;amp;T sim
in it displayed an AT&amp;amp;T splash screen
and you know it does that here and i'll
do it us your know yeah i'm wrong i
brought it is it why i brought it here i
put in a GLaDOS sim card immediately it
gave me the GLaDOS splash screen nice
wander right like unit is yet is the
data for the splash screen stored
locally on the sim or is it stored on
the device and advise displays it it's a
missing I mean think about it I mean
it's I'm in on dudas man what is
blackberry gonna be adding splash
screens from a carrier that's all the
way down maybe it maybe I had splash
pins for every carrier yeah I I'm kind
of leaning to them being already on a
device there yeah because it like that
seems like a pretty big file to store
locally on a sim descanse illuminated
and it's not like the device is talking
to the network to go get it like I put
the sim in I power it on it's right
there well that's the thing I mean when
I when I activated the phone actually
hard reset it and I activated on the on
the network here and uh you know it just
worked immediately I just don't you know
and and it gave me all the network
connections and everything just like an
iphone work so we should find it out oh
yeah it's it's cool i find it go i want
it i'm gonna spend a whole day doing a
deep dive investigative piece on this
and have fly and already googling a
carrier splash screen all right look
final piece of listener mail let's hit
it guys Jamie thank you for writing in
this one is from mark Hilton mr. Fisher
hey pocket now geniuses hey normally
when we read something like that it's in
the comments and it's sarcastic but i
think i was about to say it's a positive
genius there are a couple of no name
OEMs out there that as of late are
planning on putting out some well spec
devices as far as internal hardware for
about a fourth of the price of the
well-known OEMs my question is simply
this what is your opinion on unknown
OEMs versus a giant like google running
stock jelly bean is it tomato tomahto or
do giants deliver a better product also
would you recommend me purchasing these
knockoffs as some fanboys would say much
love from jamaica your pupil mark hilton
mark thank you for writing it from
jamaica our first piece of listener mail
from jamaica yeah make me want to take a
vacation um so guys I think we're all
probably gonna be as one on our answer
here no are we my a Michael you remember
our experience at the cesspool sorry CES
and cool yes I decision being of the
fringes of the CES trade floor where not
much is there but cheap cases and okay
so mark we're gonna tell you we're gonna
tell you a little story we were at CES
with a with a mission we had a mission
of a certain amount of videos that we
wanted to film and there came a point
where we just ran out of
yeah it wasn't much to see it see yes if
there wasn't much to see and so then our
say that in our sites that in our sector
i guess and so Michael and Brandon are
like what are we doing okay let's go up
to the South Hall where all the cs pool
is and you know there are a lot of
promising concepts and by the way mark
if you didn't know some of these unnamed
OEMs actually build for the high
companies these are like what's the name
of them Stephen they were Oh dm's like
HTC that's the way hcc began as a
company you like white boxing is that
yeah yeah yeah yeah well what's odm i
think immediately it's okay so for
example hcc was an odm that's the way
they started they were note like the i
build stuff for utstarcom under
utstarcom and exact rocks and for compaq
yeah and and then they started with
their brands like qtek you remember the
brand qtek right yeah the HTC Star Trek
was branded eq tech for a while exactly
and so will for different markets and so
i guess i guess there is a lot of
promise but just to give you an idea if
no real OEM and vests and actually using
these companies as an odm just to give
you an idea their android implementation
is terrible well I've actually be in my
country here in on notice it's very
common to see these knockoff phones and
they're bad I mean they're bad it's not
the cheesy displays and you know they're
just cheap for a reason they don't last
and so I don't I wouldn't recommend it
personally because I have seen them I
have not necessarily used them but I
have come in contact to a lot of people
that do have them you know the fake
galaxy s3's that look identical and
their software implementation is
terrible Steven I am hesitant to
completely dismiss these guys guess
because I really loved feeling like I'm
getting a bargain on something but I
have i completely understand i wouldn't
buy one myself let's put it that way I
understand these concerns about you
don't know if you're gonna be getting
software updates and you know like I'm a
was saying they're just not well
optimized on the software side they're
not going to perform like kick the same
sort of hardware would from a more
respectable manufacturer
I think the bigger problem now though is
that the good stuff has been getting so
cheap that there's less of an excuse to
ya to spend your money in one of these
pieces again I don't know about this
four times less expensive that that's
about right for someone no no Liz okay
no but just remember me just remembering
a seventy dollar tablet I guess okay
Marcus in Jamaica iphones their cost a
thousand dollars for a 16 gig right I
know I had I had a lot of Jamaica
friends in ups and that's you know they
would go ballistic buying phones in the
United States because phones were
extremely expensive in their country as
I don't know to see like the three
hundred dollar Nexus 4 for sale in every
market no you're not you're not no
you're not gonna sit instead right you
know I guess I guess mark bottom line if
LG can't figure software out the cheap
ones won't either they see me truly and
then you know i'm gonna go with you guys
on this so yeah we are all as one here
Steve and I I appreciate that you still
have some hope for some of these guys
and you know we shouldn't paint with a
broad brush all the time mark I think
some of these some of these knockoff
manufacturers probably do make a pretty
good product but due to the factors we
already mentioned and this old truism
that saving up your money for something
of quality is almost a hundred percent
of the time much better than blowing a
little bit of money on a cheaper product
yeah you know all of this militates
against throwing your money at these at
these knockoff devices because I think
you'll just be happier if you can maybe
wait I don't know even if it's as much
as six months to get off money to get
the device you really want rather than
the knockoff I think you'll be you'll be
better off and I'm gonna give you an
example I mean if the price difference
was disproportionally insane then you
could buy a phone every six months and
not care like for example here you know
the price for appliances like a
refrigerator are skyrocket they're crazy
and then there are these stores that
will sell you probably an irregular
refrigerator or an irregular stove and
they'll charge you so I'll give you an
idea not quite right angle a regular
refrigerator is going to be my new band
name but
okay sweetheart and irregular
android-powered refrigerator I'll give
you an idea i'll give you an idea so a
refrigerator in my country stainless
steel two doors and everything will cost
you anywhere close to two hundred fifty
to two thousand five hundred dollars but
does it tweet no so that's the problem
okay that's like your typical price for
a refrigerator here if you want to buy
the high-end models but you could go to
the store and and see the same
refrigerator for 250 this is 10 * a
price difference so when you have
something so disproportionate I'm like
damn I could buy a refrigerator every
year because these people only give you
one year of a warranty for the full
high-end 2500 dollar fridge I'd rather
buy a fridge every year and save all
that money and so that's what makes
sense for you to buy something that's a
knockoff or cheaper if the price point
is 10 times the difference then go crazy
over it but the problem Oh buying a new
fridge rater every year for even if it's
for tentative takes you 10 years to make
to spend the same amount of money you
would spend on a high-end one do you
really wanted like change out your
refrigerator every then it you bike tryn
refrigerators all at one you step island
right in the basement yeah yeah okay so
i guess the point that I'm trying to
make is for example in the case of bones
um the price difference is not
significant so that's the reason why I
never recommend the cheap Android
tablets or now the cheekbones and the
second point is listen your experience
with the phone is really not necessarily
the hardware is month if you know phones
are not anymore to make phone calls you
know if you want if you really want the
experience you need the display you need
the quality it's just not the same it's
sadly isn't that that's the problem it's
like what's wrong with the Nexus 7 oh
the viewing angles and they're like all
the viewing angles are not bad and the
color reproduction is not bad and I'm
like wait a second the only thing that's
really the only thing you really
interact with that on tablet is a
display so the display is bad the
tablets bad that's just the Pope that's
just the point it is that's the problem
that's the way I see it yeah I don't
know you know I think we can go back and
forth in this a whole lot but they're
their priorities there are things that
militate either direction one thing I
think that is probably something we can
all agree on is that
mark if you were to buy one of these
really cheap devices I think after less
than a week you would understand why
they're so cheap and what you need to do
is save your ten thousand dollars for a
virtue Android it will be worth ever
your head yes yes I think that is
exactly right jewel-encrusted virtue
running symbian got running android 3.2
yeah exactly yeah running some sweet
gingerbread action honeycomb honeycomb
on a handset so that's those are some
excellent pieces of listener may I want
to reiterate that now that the podcast

separate replies to my suggestion and
the listener mail only special edition
