pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at the new version
of skyfire version 1.5 let's zoom in on
the screen a little bit skyfire like
opera mini uses server-side rendering to
pull down pages more quickly than you
would get with say opera mobile that
said the rendering fidelity isn't always
as good but as sky fire continues to
mature the the rendering fidelity is
getting better and better so it says do
you want to be the default browser I'm
going to say no and let's get right to
it we see a cleaned-up interface that
we're going to cover in more depth in a
minute let's just go to a website let's
go to pocketnow.com see how long that
takes two to load up on the screen and
here we go
ok so that was about seven seconds or so
I remember opera mobile on this device
the hd2 took about nine or ten seconds
so still significantly faster and we
should be able to rotate to go into
landscape here yep there we go and we
can move around on the screen although
with skyfire 1.5 we can remove these top
and bottom bars if we go into the
settings here and go into full screen
mode and then you get a very opera
mobile like view so we have just one
button in the bottom right corner that
will open up everything else very
similar interface now and it's a good
interface so we can move around on the
screen by tapping and dragging we can
double tap on a particular column by
double tapping and it reflows the column
quite nicely and quickly we can move
down the page seems to have stopped
loading here oddly we'll have to test
that out with another page and see if
it's just an issue with this site or if
it's common to other sites let's go into
this permalink alright so that was about
six seconds pretty darn fast and we
should have some flash video on this
page of course skyfire supports flash
video which is one of its claims to fame
so let's press play and see what the
video playback will be like Oh up there
comes I muted it on you ok it's trying
to come through that time is also very
functional Roger I got it fine ok so
it's a it's reason it was it's pretty
smooth let's stop it will try going to
hulu in a minute first let's try another
website let's go to engadget a nice long
website all right here it goes for this
I think we go back into portrait fast
screen rotations
ok here it is that was a little bit
longer at about 11 seconds let's move
down the page and sort of see how the
content looks looks like we need to zoom
out a little bit we can tap on the zoom
button down here to have more precise
zoom controls though oddly it seems to
be stuck in the zoomed in position and
it may look better if we go into
landscape and it does it probably didn't
actually switch internally to to
portrait when I did it so we can go down
the list we can see all the content
let's see what happens when we go really
fast we get the checkerboard of course
so it's really trying to catch up and
there it goes opera mobile 10 in
particular has done a really good job
it's sort of eliminating or reducing the
amount of times that you see the
checkerboard which really helps because
you want to be able to move around a
webpage fast with the content just being
there without having to wait for it to
load so very nice the rendering fidelity
is great as mentioned we can zoom in on
a column and it will reflow the column
to make it more clear or we can actually
use these more precise zoom controls
although it seems to make sense to
actually double tap on the column so
let's go to another website let's go to
youtube and here we go
alright that came up very fast about
five seconds so we have a big old
advertisement there at the top let's
just tap on any of these videos and
bring it up and see what the quality is
like playing youtube video directly from
youtube com rather from the embedded
player all right here is the video and
it should be loading it's on mute let me
take off
trying to go fulfill string that I don't
think start to work on this browser so
you so you get the idea of video is
quite smooth let's try fulu which i
don't think is going to work in fact it
hasn't worked in sky fire at least for
for me for a while now and sky fire 1.5
is a bit buggy i've been typing in hulu
and trying to get the page to load and
it's just not going for some reason let
me try again we get this little swirl
and this is the third attempt to load
the site and it just keeps spinning and
spinning and stand then it stops so
obviously there are few bugs still
skyfire 1.5 and i just loaded up amazon
again so you can get a sense for how a
common page looks when you're using
skyfire very smooth it's a very simple
front page and of course we can go into
landscape and that makes it look even
better double tap to zoom in refocus is
quite nicely let's go back into porch
and take a look at some of these menu
items to see what we have here of course
we can go into full screen mode which
hides to the top and bottom bar we can
click on history which will actually
pull the history from the skyfire server
and present it to you an actually a
little kind of website so here we are in
all my browsing history and there was a
link to hulu maybe it will work now
okay so here we are on hulu and there
should be some video showing up here
this is loading video and see what it
says unfortunately this video is not
available on your platform so it can't
play who a video let's go back into the
settings here the menu we can mute the
audio we can share the page send it via
SMS and so forth leave a few settings
here we can show page drag controls we
can set sky fires the default browser
and we can search at a search bar on the
home screen if you use the standard
default windows mobile today screen I
just tapped on advanced settings let's
see what's in there and being clear
cookies is clear history and hint for a
mobile version of pages so nothing too
extensive in there we can go to help get
some information and that's really it
overall skyfire has nice interface
changes but it's still a little bit
buggy it does some weird things
sometimes it doesn't load a webpage
sometimes tapping on history doesn't get
you history but overall it's a step in
the right direction and hopefully a few
bug fixes will make this skyfire version
as bug free as previous versions plus
this new awesome interface that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
