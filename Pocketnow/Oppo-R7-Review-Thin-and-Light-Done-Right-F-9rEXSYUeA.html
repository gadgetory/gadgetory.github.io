light mentality of most smartphones
today because feeling the hand isn't
everything compromises in battery life
and expandable storage are enough to
frustrate anyone no matter how beautiful
the phone is now when a company figures
out a way to solve most of these basic
needs and your thin and light chassis it
deserves an extensive look I'm happy to
be led out with pocket now here with our
full review of the Oppo r7 have you ever
heard the phrase if the shoe fits many
companies struggle to strike the right
balance with this mainly because my
needs are different to everybody else's
for example I value an elegant
smartphone that can last a full day on a
charge gives me expandability options
and takes good pictures the Oppo r7 is
by no means the perfect phone but it
does do a lot of things right elegance
is definitely one of them with its
metallic chassis and slim profile the
slight curves on the back chamfered
edges on the sides and 2.5 the glass at
the front give it a very pleasant feel
both in your hand and inside the pocket
the look and feel extends to the clicky
hardware keys on the sides but fall
short with the unlit capacitive keys
that are too easy to press exid enchi
lee at times it's a hair thicker than
its predecessor at 6.3 millimeters but
at the benefit of the return of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack most of the
elegance comes with its 5-inch 1080p
AMOLED display which provides great
viewing angles and color saturation it's
right enough to provide decent
visibility in direct sunlight and even
offers eye protection modes for those of
you that prefer warmer colors internals
make this sound like more of an average
user phone though with its 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 615 three gigs of ram and 16
gigs of expandable storage missing our
essentials I can have c4 reasons I don't
understand and this particular unit
lacks US LTE bands even though the u.s.
variant that's on sale does include
now the cool tricks under the hood or
anything but average particularly with
its expandability options since you can
swap this microSD card for a dual SIM
card which is definitely a benefit and
another cool trick is the fact that the
23 20 milliamp hour battery can charge
fully in under 30 minutes through oboes
blook rapid charger the rest of the cool
tricks come with its software which I'll
admit has been a pleasant surprise I've
always been a color West attractor
because of its cue morphic user
interface and laggy operation but
version 2.1 improves things dramatically
it still lacks the app tray like before
and it still also includes an extensive
list of UI customizations the changes
are mainly in the combination of a tone
down icon pack and the three gigs of ram
which allow it to handle transition
smoothly and multitask without stutter
one of my favorite features is how it
handles notifications even if it still
runs on KitKat as opposed to lollipop
here you can control which notifications
you want on the lock screen and on the
ticker saving you of a lot of annoyances
the Edit applications are mostly useful
than bloat with things like a backup
assistant for your microSD card a voice
recorder and even an encryption service
that allows you to lock applications
with a code in a very reliable way other
cool tricks included are being able to
launch the camera with a gesture
returning the phone on and off with a
double tap on the display or on the home
button honestly if it wasn't for oboes
horrible widgets this is probably one of
my favorite Android experiences to date
which says a lot the best way to
describe using this phone over the last
few weeks is with the word balanced
graphics intensive games do work over
the Snapdragon 615 but it does overheat
after a few minutes meaning yes you can
play with it but it's not what it was
designed for battery life isn't a
compromise though you'll notice that
it'll drop from 100% to 80 in the first
hour of use but but it levels out after
that it manages to give you a full day
of moderate to heavy use on a full
charge
and if you overdid it Moog rapid
charging will take you to 50% in under
15 minutes something which competitors
haven't been able to beat yet phone
calls are also surprisingly good with
one of the loudest earpieces that I've
tested and a very loud back mounted
speaker as well colors also praised the
sound quality and I didn't even notice
it the heating after 30 minute phone
calls which was great sadly we weren't
able to test the LTE speeds in our
review unit here but it does provide
decent HSPA+ speeds the camera combo is
also good in my opinion even for 2015
standards Oppo includes the same bevy of
shooting modes that we saw with the Opel
n 3 but I do notice that the 13
megapixel ISO cell shooter provides
better color saturation and it also
provides better light exposure when
compared to its predecessor now this is
no LG g4 by any means mainly because of
the F 2.2 aperture on the lens but it
does give the iPhone 6 camera run for
its money the 8 megapixel wide-angle
selfie camera is also a plus an addition
that provides good enough photos but I'd
recommend that you stay away from the
beautifying modes overall I guess the
best way to describe the Oppo r7 is as
one of the most balanced experiences
I've ever personally had with Android it
sports a great design without
compromised internals that are not too
shabby a software experience that
actually fixes some of the annoyances of
Android it's camera combo is above
average and it's battery performance is
good enough for most of us I guess this
phone would be perfect for the business
user out there that is in search of a
reliable experience or the average user
that doesn't want an overbearing
experience it definitely is not
something that I would recommend to the
most demanding of power users but at
$399 unlocked it's really hard for the
shoe not to fit especially because
you're getting a $250 discount when
compared to the nearest flagship that
does it for our overview of the Oppo r7
folks but there is a lot more where that
came from so make sure you follow us on
