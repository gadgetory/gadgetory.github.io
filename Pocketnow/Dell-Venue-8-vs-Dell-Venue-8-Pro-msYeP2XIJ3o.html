now and we're here with a comparison
between the Dell Venue 8 with Android
and the Dell Venue 8 Pro with Windows
8.1 so let's check them out
so first off we have some slight
differences front-facing cameras in the
middle over there on the Left I mean the
right
and let's look at the sides
we have some differences here as well
you got volume we got a microphone we
got the power plant and we got a USB
port micro USB port micro SD both those
are the same and a micro SIM card slot
right there both of them on the bottom
we have speakers
there and over here we have some
differences as well
oh that's the volume for the this is a
volume for the venue Hey
I thought it was over there but it's not
there we go William was on the other
side we have the microUSB port on this
side for the venue age and at the top is
a slight difference as well the
headphone jack here over there and this
is the power button for the Android one
but this is the Start menu buttons for
the windows
so there's difference there
on the back we both have cameras this
one has a little bit of a lift
and the Android one is smooth plastic
where's the Windows 8 we have a rich
around the back here
now oddly the windows venue grow
feels a little bit thinner we're upside
down
whereas the Android one is a little
thicker and little heavier however that
might be due due to the price difference
the Android one is a bit cheaper less
expensive rather
let's just do a little tilting speed
comparison
that doesn't work enough
Android switches a lot faster
oh now they're pretty even
just needed more gravity
nope there we go
all right that's our quick comparison
between the Dell Venue 8 Pro and the
Dell Venue caves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
