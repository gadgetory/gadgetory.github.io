effectively building its own electric
vehicle we have more details on what to
expect from the HTC one and nine and LG
takes a stab at yet another Android wear
product I'm hi Natalie Vanna and why is
it that Monday's feel slower than the
rest of the days of the week this is
pocket out daily brought to you by
Squarespace let's begin today with
what's official as LG has just unwrapped
the SmartWatch right before mwc 2015
we're talking about the LG watch urbane
vervain or I was debating if it was
called urban but it's for bein and as it
turns out notice there is no more g at
the beginning we're talking about a very
very elegant watch here made of metal
fully and we've got some very nice
leather straps in addition to other
options got a Snapdragon 400 processor
in addition to a 400 million power
battery here the design looks really
cool and we are waiting to see it event
WC will keep you posted as to how cool
this product is and why caught announced
so early and speaking of smartwatches
one big player here is a sous and the
company's then watch really numbers out
it was really cool we're waiting for a
successor and the company CEO just came
on record to state that yes the company
is working on more android wear products
to come with the same beautiful design
and everything but apparently they're
working on another SmartWatch and we've
actually been talking about this for a
couple of weeks they are bringing the
SmartWatch that brings you a week of
battery life but as it turns out the CEO
of the sooz is just confirmed that this
is not an android wear SmartWatch and go
figure that's the sacrifice that had to
be made let's see what we get now talk
about HTC and its future flagship we've
been debating of this product is called
the one and nine and we've got some
internal sources to claim that within
HTC's website is pretty much confirmed
this product will be called the 19 but
in some very interesting news that are
not necessarily disappointing before its
claim that the wallpapers for this phone
are 1080p not quad HD and you know to be
honest with you I don't think that's
necessarily bad the PPI on 1080p is good
enough why do we need two K's displays
of these are really undercooked lately
except for the Samsung ones of course
let's see what we get Alice move the
spotlight over to apple and that's
Johnny I've he was extensively
interviewed by The New Yorker recently
and within the profile even though the
guy has not said anything it seems that
Jony ive is planning to retire after the
apple watch and no this is not confirmed
again he hasn't said anything but the
report claims that Jony ive is burned
out that 2014 was his toughest year that
he had to battle with pneumonia plus the
design of the iphone 6 the Apple watch
the apple campus to end that the guy is
really burned out up to the point where
he's already started showing us his team
and the guys that were behind the apple
watch designs so really interesting as
Johnny I've has a lot of power right now
an apple after Steve Jobs of step and we
wonder what will happen to the company
after that as the whole takeover and
boom of Apple happened with Jonny I've
being working alongside Steve Jobs and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day let's talk about the Apple car
as yeah we've been talking about a
couple of rumors regarding this but the
Wall Street Journal just chimed in today
saying that apparently gave the order
for this product to begin a year ago
apparently Apple has been working on
this for a full year in secrecy it's
hired as many as 50 employees from Tesla
it's hired some new guys from
mercedes-benz and yeah apparently Tim
Cook approve this to be a 1000 employee
team and apparently it's going to look a
little like the minivan which is the
hard part to believe here is Apple is
apparently the cool company not the
family company but it leads me to the
question of the day what exactly do you
think Apple could innovate with a smart
car because in my particular case I
don't know unless that thing self drives
itself and does it well I think we're
years away from an apple car but leave
