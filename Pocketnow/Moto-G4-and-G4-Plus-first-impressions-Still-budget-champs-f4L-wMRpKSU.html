the pocket now offices we've got a pair
of moto G fours to check out tearing
open some packaging the Moto G 4 box has
a phone and a charger and a cable and
some papers and the G 4 plus box
likewise has a phone a charger cable and
more papers as these are both unlocked
devices Motorola Oso sent along this
handy little passport wallet with slots
for SIM cards truly world traveler
devices on first glance many folks would
be hard-pressed to tell much difference
between the two the design is nearly
identical as are the specs both feature
5.5 inch 1080p LCDs and internally they
have the same Qualcomm six one seven
chipsets the main visual difference is
the fingerprint sensor on the chin of
the g4 Plus though both phones have the
same dimensions we just have a bigger
empty bezel space on the regular G for
our review units here also differ in
storage and RAM where the g4 has 32
gigabytes of storage in two gigabytes of
RAM the g4 Plus has 64 gigabytes of
storage and 4 gigabytes of RAM and the
plus has a higher resolution camera with
laser focus assistance you can see these
little sensors above the camera on the +
which are missing on the regular g4
popping the back cover we've got sim and
micro SD card slots including a nano SIM
2 micro sim adapter was a really nice
touch this section houses a 3000
milliamp hour battery though this
doesn't seem to be user replaceable it
should deliver solid runtime considering
the lower power CPU and both phones have
micro USB ports on the bottom supporting
motos turbo charge technology now first
boot was nice and quick the welcome 617
is well understood at this point does a
respectable job powering phones like
these the software is nearly stocked so
the setup process is also very well
known no weird surprises or additional
user accounts to create though on both
phones the Wi-Fi and update scanning
took longer than I was expecting those
just the second screens played out more
like just a couple minutes screens these
are some clean looking phones it's
really nice returning to those familiar
moto curves and tapers a combination of
sleek sides soft rounded corners and a
grippy backplate maybe one of my
favorite all-time
material combinations for any phone on
initial impression these phones seem
like worthy successors to the Moto G
lineage it's a rich tradition delivering
inexpensive devices which don't punish
the consumer for spending less on a
phone but since the launch of the
original moto G this smartphone tier has
grown increasingly competitive a prices
here start at $1.99 for the 16 gigabyte
g4 and creep up to $2.99 for the 64
gigabyte g4 plus with the fingerprint
sensor double the RAM higher resolution
camera and four times more storage it's
actually a pretty nice value ID
considering $100 often only increases
your storage on other phones out of
these moto G fours stack up to the
competition do we still get a great bang
for buck well you're just gonna have to
stay tuned for our future reviews in
comparisons as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full moto G for review

little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some
gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram and
I will catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
