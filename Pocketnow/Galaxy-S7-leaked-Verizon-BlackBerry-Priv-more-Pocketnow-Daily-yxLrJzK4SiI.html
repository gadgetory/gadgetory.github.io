time by case makers a verizon branded
blackberry probe seems to be just around
the corner and it seems the retailers
are already putting a stop to the many
issues of the Lumia 950 XL I'm high
metal iveta wishing you all a Merry
Christmas full of all the things that I
usually celebrate with this is bargain
out daily the official news today begin
with HTC as the company has just
unveiled the 1x9 that we've been waiting
for the only problem is two things
number one it's only for China right now
and number two well it sort of spells
mid-ranger when you look at the mini
attic processor but then everything else
is actually not bad it's design is cool
it's got stereo speakers and in addition
to that we've got a 5.5 inch 1080p
display three gigs of ram 32 gigs of
expandable storage it's actually not a
bad phone at all let's just see if it
leaves China at some point and speaking
of official news those of you that are
on big red waiting for the latest and
greatest blackberry running Android it
seems that it just crossed the FCC it
was approved it's only a matter of time
before this product reaches verizon
we're not exactly sure if it'll expand
to other carriers after that as you know
the way things are with AT&amp;amp;T but then
again hey stay tuned for that and if
you're wondering of LG's super premium
phone strategy with the v10 paid off it
seems it actually did we know that the
g4 didn't really sell as well as the
company wanted to up to the point where
they had to come out with the v10 and
well as it turns out we've got
statistics from the Korean times already
claiming that they're as many as 150,000
units sold which is far better than what
the g4 did in that same period of time
and apparently the people that are most
interested in this phone are teenagers
which is rather interesting giving all
the professional features you get for a
recording video and taking photos from a
mobile phone obviously that's a little
spotlight over to Amazon in Germany
believe it or not the company has just
decided to halt sales for the Lumia 950
XL according to amazon it is due to the
fact that the phone doesn't comply to
its description which is just a very
polite way of saying there's something
wrong with the phone we know there are
at anything
wrong with the phone and i highly
suggest you watch Michael Fisher's
review as the way he starts the video is
rather iconic this is the Lumia 950 XL
and I can't recommend this phone yeah
and finally the hot news today have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy s7 Lina the
case makers if you want to see what a
phone looks like before it launches case
makers most likely figure that one out
through their leaks and well it seems
that the phone isn't really changing
much except for two things one is the
placement of the selfie camera and the
other is a squared off home button
that's not necessarily squirt off it
could just be that the case makers
pretty much invented this and it's the
same home button wouldn't make any sense
for that to be square and then the rest
of the phone to be curved but then again
yeah it seems that the galaxy s7 will
not change much when it comes to its
comparison with the galaxy s6 so it
leads me to the question of today do you
have a problem of the fact that the
future samsung galaxy is not going to
change its design in my case no I feel
that I like it's the scientist toy it is
but then again because of the fact of
the galaxy s6 did not sell well I know a
lot of you were skeptical leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the nose
earlier before this video was filming

trapped idea channel as well and follow
me on Twitter Jaime underscore to be
better on instagram at high Meadow be
