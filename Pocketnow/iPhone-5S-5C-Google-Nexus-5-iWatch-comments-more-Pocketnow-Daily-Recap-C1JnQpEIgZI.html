I don't know how pluck my feathers any
better this guy really hates mondays
really so let me get this straight his
name is high Meadow Yvette hmm so let me
get this straight I could call you lyin
if I translate your name in English
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hi Mary there this is it now
and welcome to our pocket now daily
recap for last week so that's when they
ask you what were your predictions for
apple's iphone event was happening the
next day and we had 298 kind of crazy
comments most of them nothing to do with
the topic but after a lot of censoring
we found for example the RX 894 saying
guys calm down let the Apple people have
their phone and let the Android people
have their phones at the end of the day
they're still just phones and there's no
need to be upset and man 39 likes
there's a purpose for that Oh Sarah 16
says I'm waiting for the iphone i'm done
with android no matter how many cores
they put on the damn phone that still
lags and for some of the android phones
in the market that is kind of true but
that doesn't mean that Apple phones are
perfect and then Andrew Hoffman says I'm
a seven will mean much more than the
hardware end you are definitely right a
lot of people a lot of my friends have
kept their old iPhones and they use iOS
7 and they tell me they feel like if
they have a new phone so that's kind of
a consensus and then on Tuesday I asked
you if you wanted the iphone 5s for the
iphone 5c the event had just finished
then we wanted to know which phone would
you pick we had 959 comments and almost
every single one of them looked like
this iphone 5s iPhone 5s iPhone 5s
iPhone 5s and that was kind of the
reality in the stores for every 10
iPhone 5s is that were picked up only
one iphone 5c was bought which is really
interesting then Mohamed daniel says I
love the look of the 5c though the a7
64-bit chip is revolutionary and the
graphics on the new Infinity Blade are
awesome and yeah it's been benchmarked
against everything absolutely everything
and the iphone 5s pretty much blows
everything out of the water then Bionic
tonic says 5s is sweet no more phone
theft and that's kind of not right look
at the news thing you'll notice that
people have already figured out how to
crack the system and figure out how to
unlock that 5s so nothing
my friend then on Wednesday I asked you
if you were getting a galaxy gear or an
iWatch because the news were that
apparently the iWatch was going to be
delayed until 2014 because jony ive's
design was too difficult to build 252
comments out of which for example white
and nerdy tula says the galaxy gear
missed the mark and it seems a little
rushed if Apple does come out with a
watch no matter what your viewpoint is
of the company I expect it to be better
through and through with more features
that you care about not just more
features if that's what you were trying
to say and you know uh you're kind of
right that another youtuber says waiting
for the iWatch have nothing it'll push
technology forward in a billion clothes
will come out later that has been the
story with the iphone it's been the
story with the iPad but it probably
won't necessarily be the story with the
iWatch so let's stay tuned for that and
then Jimmy laramidia says Nexus watch
and you know after apple crack the code
with the chromecast and pretty much blew
the apple TV out of the water I do
expect for some DARPA try to come out
with something compelling and honestly
in my personal opinion the problem of
the galaxy gear is seriously the camera
is something you'll never use and then
the watch is just so expensive that I'm
just not gonna fail to buy when compared
to a pebble and then on Thursday I asked
you if you're waiting for the nexus 5
since we have a ton of more leaks of
what to expect from this phone
especially some high-end specifications
and a very cool design and we have 731
comments out of which for example
conspire 43 says I've been waiting for
the nexus 5 since I got the nexus 4 and
yes I stuck to the Galaxy Nexus
precisely because of that because the
Nexus 4 was cool but it was more of a
price thing than anything else and then
DoubleTap production says yes I'm
excited about the Nexus 5 if it comes to
verizon come on Google and no no I mean
ask Michael Fisher watch her after the
buzz of the Galaxy Nexus man that
Verizon Galaxy Nexus was everything but
a Nexus device precisely because you
didn't get any software updates or well
you did but very late and then sony TV
says Nexus 5 equals Christmas present
2013 and yes think about it if these
guys figure out a way to add the
specifications of the LG g2 and then
figure out a way to keep the price tag
as the rumors are pointing out to this
is gonna be the perfect gift for
Christmas I mean this is going to be
cheaper than any of the mid-tier phones
in the market
without a contract I mean it's gonna be
pointless to buy any other thing and I
mean any other thing and finally on
Friday I asked you if you pre-order the
iphone 5c or if you were waiting for the
5s because well for some reason the 5s
was not available for pre-order in the
pre-orders for the 5c happened that day
and we have 720 comments out of for
example we got Jason sallisaw saying if
you buy the 5c you're done you're buying
a year old smartphone turned plastic for
the same price stupid apple and well I
don't like to call anybody dumb or
stupid but you do have a very important
point this is pretty much an iphone 5
and if you do have an iphone 5 it is
pointless to pre-order the 5c or to get
a five-seat right now then pixel says
I'll wait for the iphone 6 the five is
doing fine for me and you know you've
got a really good point if the
fingerprint scanner is not important to
you if the camera is not important to
you why would you upgrade from a 5
seriously then froggy joe says i'm
waiting for a frickin bigger screen not
freaking colors and yes half the planet
is waiting for a bigger display on the
next iPhone but I don't think it's gonna
happen unless Apple figures out how to
make that thing thinner and then hence a
99 says check out Nokia's UK Twitter
feed they made fun of Apple they always
make fun of Apple and that's the sad
story I wish that their sales would be
on par with the amount of times they
make fun of Apple but then again apple
also did it to Microsoft years ago so
you know what goes around comes around
that's it for last week's PocketNow
