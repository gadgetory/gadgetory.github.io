pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
video of the verizon XV 6900 which is a
CDMA variant of the HTC touch let's get
started comes in white quite a petite
box surprise the device isn't showing on
the top I really don't like this
presentation do we have here we have
some we have a case here's the device
I'll put that over here for now piece of
cardboard it looks like a sync cable
which uses mini USB excellent looks like
a mini USB 2 2.5 millimeter headphone
jack with a mini USB pass-through so you
don't block that port we have a charger
and an extra stylus and it doesn't look
collapsible feels good right so let's
take a look at the touch you know it
always surprises me how small this this
device is very very petite see how it
compares to other devices very light too
I didn't see a battery so I'm assuming
there's already one in here but I'll
have to check on that compared to the
iphone much smaller a little bit thicker
compared to the AT&amp;amp;T tilt and I'm
noticing now that this white color is
actually a flat white it's not like a
white pearl or anything like that
unfortunately but it does look pretty
slick compared to a phone like the
pantech duo significantly thinner of
course and the eaten Blowfish x800 same
size screen both have 2.8 inch screens
but again because of the lack of
hardware buttons the touch is much
smaller much shorter because it can be
something I really like about the touch
is the flush touch screen there's no
there's no divot as you would find on
you know the X 800 where dust can get
trapped in it's just a piece of still
plastic it's not glass but it looks much
more slick when you don't have that
extra divot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
