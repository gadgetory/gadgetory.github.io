pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look at the hardware for the LG
revolution from Verizon Wireless so sit
back relax and enjoy the show now the LG
revolution does have a nice big 4.3 inch
screen and I hate to say this but it's
one of the only things it has going for
it at this point since I've used it for
a couple of days the edges here around
the casing while it makes it feel really
solid after it's been resting in your
hands for a few minutes starts to cut
into your palms and up here on the upper
edge where you would normally place this
against your ear it's really actually
quite sharp there as you can see and
that was a little exaggerated but
holding it up to your head does but some
doesn't do some damage on our own your
earlobes there um the smooth edge here
makes it you know nice to hold in the
hand but it as a I can't say that it's
really comfortable in even my largest
hands compared to other phones that I've
used other things I've noticed is that
this door is a little bit of a pain to
get open although once it's open it
works just fine but it's ready just come
on there in my opinion it doesn't slide
on very well and here's this side I
haven't really had a chance to use the
hdmi out because I don't really have the
cable and I don't really use that phones
for that purpose but again it's one of
those slider doors or pop open doors the
volume buttons up and down work just
fine but I since I've used to using
samsung devices I find myself going over
here for the power button and turning
the volume up and down speaking of
volume the volume levels are are pretty
good I found that the speaker phone
levels are a little quiet compared to
other devices on the market today the
camera is so far so good we'll talk
about more in the actual software review
so we'll come back to that later
headphone
jack is nice and solid no problems there
although I did run into an issue where I
had bluetooth enabled and then try to
attempted to plug in the headset here
and it tried to still send the audio
through the Bluetooth even though that I
had turned bluetooth off and disabled
the headset that required a complete
reset to work again internal memory a
it's really hard to tell in the software
but it does have the 16 gig micro SD
card and it does have an additional 16
gigs of internal memory for storage
which is really nice that's that's a
good chunk of storage battery life is
been about average I'm getting about
seven hours with about you know three to
four hours of phone calls before it's
asking me to charge the device again
that's without any 4g enabled at all no
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and the brightness set
to auto speaking of brightness let's
talk about that for a moment I'll just
jump into here does something black now
this is on full bright right now and as
you can see the blacks aren't really
black at all and it's still difficult
with a device like this but if we
compare it against another device say
the nexus s 4g from sprint you can
really see the difference is there
between the LG and the Nexus and the
black here versus the kind of grayish
black here which causes all of the other
images and videos and everything else on
the device to be look really washed out
even if it's on auto brightness this
grayness doesn't disappear when you
increase the brightness it doesn't
increase the brightness of the texts as
much as it just increases the brightness
of the screen in addition the up here in
the ball
the text looks really sharp and and easy
to read here in in this section up with
the smaller text like the clock and it's
difficult to see in this view and it's
not good it's not really going to make
much sense without actually seeing it
this is seems a little fuzzy a little
blurry not as easy to read once again
compared to other devices the the
crispness of this screen is not as good
as others other things I've noticed is
that the one I'm touching the screen and
try to navigate through it oftentimes
I'm finding that I have to tap things
twice all that time was just fine I'm
finding that I'm trying to scroll across
pages and nothing will happen or I'll
try to tap a button and have to tap the
button again in order for it to work
perhaps I've got a faulty unit but with
the screen brightness being odd it
doesn't really make you know that much
sense at this point it still got some
some major flaws that I can't I wouldn't
live with in a device power button on
the top is just is really small it is
easy to hit once you you know recognize
where it is and it turns off on and off
without any problems I've heard or read
some other complaints about folks having
issues with lockups again I haven't had
anything like that happen with this
particular device other functionality
and features of this phone I it seems to
work just fine but again it's mostly the
awkwardness of the device compared to
the Nexus S widthwise they're almost the
same with the curved glass wait why's
this the LG revolution actually weighs
more than the sprint epic 4g dozen it's
got a removable keyboard a removable can
pop out keyboard pardon me speed on the
LG revolution is about what you would
expect I mean things flip back and forth
when the screen works if you know if you
don't run into a problem with it a lot
you know locking up as you page through
items
it well we'll come back to more software
bits and pieces things load fairly
quickly the 3g service from verizon is
very stable we'll cover more of the
software side the speeds of the LTE and
3g when I get into a NLT air area later
this week will cover that in the
software review but otherwise I'm pretty
pleased with the performance of it but
it is just a Snapdragon processor that
wraps up our hardware review of the LG
revolution from verizon if you have any
comments or questions leave them below
otherwise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
