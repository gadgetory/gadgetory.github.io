pocketnow.com you ever noticed when
you're reading or watching a movie or a
YouTube video on your Android power
tablet or smartphone it works great like
this works great like this but somewhere
in between there's this magic trigger
point when all of a sudden it says I
want to switch rotation on you make you
lose your place I hate it and a couple
other developers did too and they went
about creating an app to try and solve
that problem
it's called GMD smart rotate uses your
front-facing camera to be a little bit
smarter about how to rotate how does it
work
let's go find out very often my screen
will rotate to landscape or portrait
when it shouldn't then I have to rotate
it back all in all I have lost only a
few seconds of my life to this errant
screen rotation movies may pause and
need to be restarted my place on a web
page or in a social media app may be
lost or I may have to go back and reread
that previous paragraph of whatever
ebook I was devouring it sure is
annoying and I'm not alone XD a stupid
idea and vital Jay had the same problem
and what about developing an app to use
your front facing camera to assist in
rotation the app is called GMD smart
rotate the app promises to rotate your
screen based not on the sensors in your
phone but on the tilt of your head some
drawbacks to the app include the
inability for it to work in low-light
scenarios GMD smart rotate is a great
idea that probably isn't quite ready for
primetime but the developers know it
they're calling in a development version
that quote may contain bugs we'd love to
know your experiences with this apps so
make sure you leave a comment over at
pocketnow.com tell us how it worked for
you and don't forget to include the make
and model of your device so what did you
think
have you tried it out yet please do
we've got a link for you to download the
app over in the article at pocketnow.com
let us know how it went for you if you
liked what you saw here make sure you
give the video a big thumbs up if you'd
like to stay up
date on all things having to do with
mobile technology subscribe to our video
channel I'll have a link for you at the
