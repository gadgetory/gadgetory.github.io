new Qualcomm processor we see another
Samsung Galaxy s8 active leaked and will
Google finally merge Google Play Music
and YouTube red but the big news of the
week Motorola publicly unveiled its
newest flagship the z2 force to sysm
to some somewhat mixed reactions Julian
from Digital Trends is gonna drop by to
chat about this new moto and modular
phones so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode two six three of the
pocket now weekly recorded July 28th at
noon pacific time this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and a modular phone meant
a phone made out of Legos and I still
want a phone made out of Legos I'm Juan
Carlos bag now senior editor
pocketnow.com blasting the signal from
sunny Southern California joined as
always by plucky podcast producer mr.
Jules Wong out on the East Coast how's
it going sir hello and I'm doing great I
have this new yellow waiting thing it's
it's it's basically the only light bulb
I can throw on top of me because
everyone's complaining about the
lighting it's only taken 50 episodes to
fix so I very much enjoy actually being
able to see your face instead of like
sort of the backlit you know it's it's
like when you sign up as a profile on
like a new gaming account and all you
are is this silhouette and I can just
pull it even more so then the lighting
is even harsher and look at that warm
glow I'm sorry podcast listeners that
can't look at this right now but when
we're off the show let me um I'll send
you a link because there's like a really
cheap work lamp that I use that is way
too bright to point at your face so I
reflect it off of the wall behind my
monitors and even that usually blows out
like like for for how bright this shot
is right now all of this is from like a
thirty dollar work lamp that well it's
not gonna make much of a difference
anyways because hangouts likes to squish
me whatever way I can
into the stupid not pillar-box them
what's the word for it
that's that's absolutely accurate no
pillarboxing is where the crops are like
this letterboxing letterbox it's super
wide so you're you are being color boxed
right now and again in owing to our
weekly complaints about Google Hangouts
we have no idea why I swear I can't
leave Julien choke audio on this podcast
though because he is uh he he was at the
Moto event with me and we were all in
the same environs talking about the moto
z2 force so can me for that in the
meantime tell those questions in on to
Twitter with the hashtag P and weekly
and we shall look those up and we didn't
get any listener mail this week so also
spam us almost spam us with questions
podcast at pocketnow.com is where you
should send your questions in and we'll
get to them on our next show or whatever
you will you send them in so do that
yeah I mean I'm in the hash tag now
we've got a number of people asking
about the moto z2 force we've got a
question from Dennis about a so many s7
edges with pink lines of the s8 screen
and and well we'll try and get a few of
these at the end of the show just
because I think that's a great question
when we're talking about durability Plus
to me Oh chefs s7 edges yeah well in
literally the edges on the s7 edges
you're starting to describe that I think
we're using the word edges too much
infinity pool the infinity display
before we get into more tech tomfoolery
though we would like to take a moment
just to quickly plug a new series on
pocket now some ideas need a proper
debate and so what we're creating is a
new show called the tech debate to tech
fans on opposing sides of a topic hash
out the pros and cons and we're
developing the series to bring on guests
and dick
little deeper into controversial
questions the pilot episode is already
live on the PocketNow YouTube channel
where Jaime and I try to analyze the
value of premium flagship phones against
mid cost competition and it's up to the
viewers to vote on the conclusion to
vote on who was more persuasive in their
arguments future debate topics are gonna
dig into batteries and politics and
headphone jacks iOS vs. Android we've
got a bunch of things planned a
gentlemanly discussion about
controversial topics we hope you'll
check out the tech debate and if you
liked it give it a share if you don't
like it also give it a share cuz you
know helping us out with some pitchforks
and torches isn't necessarily terrible
either but that first video is already
live definitely go check it out and it's
something that we hope will bring some
value to the discussion of technology
and technology topics yeah value-added
discussion it's one of those things
that's you know taxable in Europe I love
that phrase value-added discussion like
indeed you know what we can add value
the news the news it's loading so slowly
why is it doing that yet is that these
things are live so things in the middle
of a show but you know what let's get to
it
before the wheel of July 24th 2017 this
is all the news that's fit to podcast
and we start with Chinese manufacturer
meizu and has two new phones each with
two camera systems and two screens the
pro 7 and pro 7 plus run on mediatek
helio x10 processors use high-end 12
megapixel Sony sensors with a color
monochrome setup and behind the large
screen upfront 5.2 inches on the main in
fact went seven inches quad HD on the
plus is a small screen below the cameras
with shortcuts notifications and perhaps
a little bit more sales begin in China
August 5th
that's portents kind of hoping for us
thing going on there there is word of
Qualcomm putting
out a minor in duration of its
Snapdragon e35 chipset for the pixel 2
from Google much like that 8:21 was to
the 820 the snap Derek and 836 could
both the next pixel and pixel XL phones
now the realm that we could still see a
snap 8:40 8:45 that's supposedly what
we're talking about here but there is no
real turnover time right now so I'll
have to see about that galaxy I say it
active leaked out onto YouTube with a
little I don't know it's a shaky cam
she's a little treatment like that
vibrance and wide and infinity display
we also have some specs that we can dig
into from an earlier post this morning
actually so we can check that out but
the key figure to take away is a four
thousand milliamp hour battery so
endurance is the key word no sign of a
release plan by the way so coming up to
that August 23rd event
I'm packed for the Galaxy Note 8 let's
hope that's these things don't Clyde
very sketchy details on this story all
we know is that HTC will have a 5
standalone VR headset running the
Snapdragon III 5 faxes to the vive port
at platform this was announced it was in
China and that all we know is that's
gonna be out later this year but it's a
step in the right direction I suppose
next is 5x and 6p owners are suffering
from boot Lu problems they might want to
check if they can deactivate the power
cores the big cores on their SOC S on
the 808 and 810 snapdragons
xda-developers came across this barge of
a fix recently and found that while
performance was inhibited from before
when they had the issue it works you can
get past the boot screen so there you go
there's an ongoing class-action lawsuit
for the next six 6p by the way and now
your very own chance to win and one plus
five if you own a one plus five the
company pushin about this giveaway to
existing owners of the very phone it's
giving away people are also very married
about
oneplus nudging people to give feedback
through added notifications these toast
notifications they're just intrusive
unwell and wah I can't I can't tell if
it's unwelcomed
unwarranted it's both bozo on to aut
bread and Google play music the
development team for the two programs
were already combined for a long time
now but now the two services themselves
will merge at some point and go under a
different name record label see this as
a move to provide a more complete
package for a licensing of music and
videos together we shall see about that
and then as they attach the iPod Touch
is the only iPod left on offer from
Apple and two other two of the many
options actually have been taken away
prices cut and those are the 16 64
gigabyte discs that we've seen drop out
of existence basically the iPod shuffle
is gone after six generations and so is
the iPod Nano after seven both debuted
in 2005 with the first video playing
iPod which I owned by the way so um
thoughts memory is our IP yeah I you
know I was one of those you know I'm
gonna be a counterculture nerd geek boys
that you know I had a creative player
and then I had a Zune but I don't think
I I don't think it's it's unwarranted to
use your word there to really
congratulate Apple for an incredible run
of democratizing digital consumer media
that these products revolutionized truly
revolutionized not only just I can put
an mp3 on a mobile device but the entire
chain that we've come to understand for
how music is acquired how music is
consumed how music is stored really did
come from this entire ecosystem approach
that Apple that Apple pioneered so it is
kind of sad what's funny is this is
coming right on internally here a pocket
now I just reached out to the folks at
Pheo cuz vo they make some standalone
music players and I was getting ready to
do like some showdowns like you know
Pheo versus iPod you know here like this
well I guess it's not not gonna be as
important for me to do as many of the
cross comparisons for a standalone music
player if apples even walking away from
from the market
if there's like another ipod touch
generation coming up maybe they should
just call it iPod and like there's no
other iPod anymore it's just it's just
or maybe maybe even better they they
revive for old times sake like the Nokia
3310 the original click wheel kind of
thing that would be a cool thing to have
long and what's maybe five years from
now that's like wasn't it like thousand
one that they introduced the original
iPod I would have to look that up I'm
terrible at trying to remember time like
I can't even remember what I had for
dinner last night but you know III
wonder if there isn't gonna be some
future market for again you know vinyl
is making a comeback maybe a standalone
media player could also make a similar
come back in a couple years this I don't
want to put everything on my phone my
phone battery is already taxed enough as
it is I think there would be an
opportunity for Apple to like do an
anniversary edition or something like
that sometime in the future but you know
in the meantime we'll have iPod Touches
still as long as they're in stock you
probably still roll up on like a Costco
because they usually had iPod nanos and
iPod classics and stuff they had the
iPod Classic for a while after it was
sort of ended so I don't know it could
be a could be kind of kind of
interesting missed LG coming your way
it's today they have it active it that's
also a powerful thing and we I didn't
get a chance to look at the this
morning's piece but it sounds like it's
gonna be a fun fun thing I mean we have
the same like infinity display as we
said the same old hard shell so it's a
polymer with metal inside problem it's
one of your favorite phones ever oh
really I actually like while you were
doing the news I ran over to the to the
Shelf of of phones to pull out the
active line of phones has has always
been my favorite line of phones from
Samsung especially as Samsung has
started with the galaxy s6 moving over
to glass
the Essex active is just one of my
all-time favorite
just devices in general let alone rugged
phones
I'm the s7 did get kind of weird and I'm
sort of chunky but it's also what is
Jules kind of frustrating to me is is
this um you know when people are talking
about a phone like the active and
they're like oh well it's gonna be
thicker you're like well no duh like the
whole point of the active is that plated
and that it's got a huge battery like to
be complaining it's gonna be made out of
Newton's gonna be made of neo giving him
it's like it's gonna cover all the
outside everything from I want a totally
rugged phone that's indestructible but
it has to be completely made out of
glass and be thinner than like pencil
lead man you know like thing that exists
you've got it like move some pieces
around so if you tell me I can have a
Galaxy s8 which is more rugged for drops
I don't have to worry about the black at
the back glass shattering and it's got a
bigger battery than the si plus I'm on
board I am on board that phone give me
that phone
I want that phone but but you better
before we jumped into the show that now
the concern is we did a Twitter video
where I was talking about this because
the actives are my favorite I was out on
a hike I was covering the LG X venture
another rugged phone but you brought
this up before the show the big concern
is now were weeks away from the note
eight launch every galaxy active that
has been launched is has been launched
at end of May beginning of June and
we're still seeing leaks and teasers not
teasers not even just like leaks and
photos on stuff we're almost done with
the summer this is a summer phone this
is a phone you launched in the summer
it's a travel phone it's an adventure
phone it's an outdoor rugged phone I do
you think we're too late it's gotta be
summer somewhere I guess I mean it well
it doesn't work like that but you know
what how about the southern hemisphere
how about springtime that's always fun
what about the fall we're all between no
even even even then no like I I think an
s8 active just gets eclipsed by no date
coverage
I think it I think it's it maybe it's
too late maybe they especially you know
with the AT&amp;amp;T exclusivity because this
has always been that case where it's
just that niche so I'm I guess you know
if it was gonna appeal to that niche
anyways they're not really they're
betting are not really getting any
interference from the no date so untrue
I mean you know as you got a match your
audience to what you suppose they want
that's why I would say maybe it's just a
good idea to skip it this year like if
you can't get it out the door and there
are problems with 18t certifying it and
I mean I'm sure there's contracts and
stuff too you can't just walk away from
delivering a phone but whatever impact
that 18t might have had with a phone
like this I think is waning fast are you
going to say that they should take the L
I don't know that I'd go so far but
maybe maybe take the f4 forfeit you know
because it's like they're not even
playing like they haven't even shown up
for the game yet you know they're
technically not losing they're just
forfeiting technically it's a two to
zero a victory for whoever the
competitor is I don't this better for is
going into hey I mean I've been I've
been reading up I don't know too much
job Boise lately so that that came thank
you SP nation for for having him on
anyways uh snapdragon 836 I think I
think it's it's a likely case it's just
it's just gonna happen well and
especially with what we saw last year
you know a 2021 it makes sense to me
that Google would be looking at some
kind of material advantage for the next
generation pixel it's just I don't know
that it's that significant to draw right
the 835 is already not really being
taxed by current software current
services I don't see anything in this
phone that makes me think that Google's
gonna be delivering on their own AR
platform I you know the no one's been
saying anything about tango which is
really taxing to a device and do I want
a phone that's clocked higher than the
8:35
when he 8:35 brings power advantages and
you know one of the things about
daydream for VR is that it runs the
phone really hot so really I'm just
hoping to get more than 15 minutes of
use before the phone starts throttling I
don't need a faster chipset to do that
than the 835 I mean it's if anything we
hope that there's some efficiencies that
they can find well getting that little 5
to 10% speed bump but you know would
mind if they just went up the 8:35
altogether it's just it's just the
top-end this is 2017 and that's the
plane that we lie on so there you go
YouTube read google play music that
about time yeah yeah I mean like just to
sum up our thoughts like that this
should have been in the works this I'm
sure it's been in the works for a while
I'm shocked it took them this long the
YouTube has way too many products Google
has way too many products that are
confusing and simplifying what yeah yeah
exactly so my wife thought YouTube TV
came with YouTube red because of all the
different like YouTube shenanigans going
on but you know I see we've got a guest
we've got Julian from Digital Trends
we've got a question here from Andrew
Wallace on twitter using the pn weekly
hashtag julian are you using youtube
bread or google play music or anything
like that
oh sorry what was the question
so from Andrew Wallace on on Twitter
using our hashtag do do you use YouTube
red or Google play music that would it
matter that these two are finally
merging yeah actually I have Google Play
unlimited I have the family plan because
it's super cheap then when you split
with six people and I get YouTube red I
particularly don't watch a lot of
YouTube my girlfriend does and she loves
that you know no ads thing I think
that's something they should have done a
long time ago it doesn't make sense
especially cuz there's YouTube music and
then there's YouTube TV and then you
would think these things would have like
an option to just bottle them all end
and like they basically have to music
streaming services - so it's alright
everything should have been combined in
the first place but you know what it
took them all I don't
it took them a little swerving path to
get there so you know what I mean what's
hilarious is that they probably had to
work out different licensing deals just
because one company was called YouTube
and another company was called Google
and when you're dealing with like an
hour guys record label exact stuff like
that like they're they probably had to
jump through every single legal loophole
to try and get one size fits all
streaming up on the platform and it
probably took them this long to deal
with the lawyers well the problem is
Google or YouTube have never been
synonymous necessarily with music even
though you know YouTube has been you
know hosting so many music videos and
everything for so long but suddenly you
have Google making a music service and
everyone's like okay but to be honest no
one really knows I think still doesn't
say that Google thing is it really
exists and when you people hear YouTube
music they're like what the hell is that
I just listens go to YouTube and listen
to music and now they're putting it
together and so people are like I'm now
learning of a thing that's combined that
I didn't know before so it's just for
the press release this was a good idea
we have plenty more to talk about
especially on our website pocketnow.com
is where you can find details on these
stories and more you can hit pocket now
look for the podcast section to get to
this episode's rundown and you can also
chat with us about what you've been
reading up on with the hashtag P and
weekly also be sure to check out Jaime
Rivera and the pocket nailed daily on
our youtube channel and now it is my
pleasure to welcome in Julian show
cartoon of a digital as he is the
multiple editor that outlets and a mic I
he was at the moto world events where
motorola lenovo moto novo Lenovo moto I
liked like that which one do you prefer
Julia
well I think we're starting to actually
now call them just motorola because
we'll know it's kind of made it clear
now that they're just going to do a lazy
a fair approach and not touch motorola
and let them do their own thing there's
a whole thing where they were doing moto
by Lenovo yeah and then and then and
then they cut and cut like 1,500 staff
yeah you know so it's like perfect this
is the great plan you guys I haven't
even held the phone yet you guys are
starting off with like Downers you
remember that time thousand jobs held it
and I only have my experiences from
looking at your review Julian or Mei
your hands on obviously we're all still
sort of producing reviews on these on
these phones but I read your your hands
on and I saw Jules's video and I I think
I walked away from both of your
experiences with more questions than
answers as to where it's supposed to
compete and who it's designed for and so
I kind of wanted to jump in just sort of
your general thoughts some of your first
impressions from using the phone from
being at the event I guess I should say
first of all like does it feel like
lenovo is working well with North
American audiences because Motorola has
been struggling through Google ownership
and now Lenovo ownership Lenovo's a
Chinese company is advertising going to
be a problem for this phone can they
express to consumers what makes it
special
I know go ahead please Julian like I
like I think Motorola is a brand as you
know you know brand awareness that
they're fine in terms of marketing a
phone it's just that whether this phone
is worth that's such a high price is a
different question because I really like
the idea of moto mods I think that's
something unique and really cool that
someone's doing and not a lot of other
manufacturers are really exploring or
well LG tried it sort of
but like I said so I like the moto mods
but I just continuously thing everything
every time I see the motor mod I see you
know the phone I just don't think the
Moto mods are priced right at all you
either have to cut the price of the
phone down and then sell the Moto mods a
little higher or whatever or you cut
down the price of the Moto months so
that people you know are like sure I
will spend another 50 or 70 dollars on
this thing after I just paid $800 for my
phone so I just think motor pods are a
cool idea and I think people would
actually use them especially if people
are willing and I've seen so many people
using battery cases on their phones you
know the idea of just you slapping on a
mod like that instead of carrying a case
that's a battery all the time
makes way more sense to me so I think
people would be interested in doing that
kind of stuff but I just think for what
you're getting and for that high high
price tag it's might not just be worth
it for people I do want to build on that
because like yeah I mean they're
obviously all those analogs those non
moto mod analogs for battery packs and
gamepad the one that we saw at the at
the event and there's also that 360 mod
too and I mean I think it's the
privilege of getting to just slap it on
and then take it off like that but
they're charging the premium for that's
not the way to go with this I mean it's
you know there's a lot of design behind
it and all that but I think it's if it's
not gonna be more economical as part of
your package as part of your deal with
the Moto ecosystem that's not gonna
happen that's not gonna happen since
sumers yeah definitely because this has
been I think one of the things I've been
most critical about the idea of a
modular phone not motos implementation
Moto's implementation is spot-on they
work really well but I don't know and
this is why I take it back to consumers
if I'm gonna charge this premium I have
to explain a concept to a consumer in an
emotional way where they're going to
understand why they should pay a premium
for a product or service and I still
don't see where a modular
phone you can slap on a battery you can
pop in a 360 degree camera you can use a
game game controller style rig how that
differentiates itself from just being
able to plug something into a USB port I
can have a standalone battery which
charges every gadget I can have a 360
degree camera that communicates with any
phone I can have a game can buy a ps4
controller and connected over bluetooth
well your your sub gadget guy your moto
not that your that doesn't withstand
from the rest of us or the rest of the
no but I'm serious like Julian kind of
back to your point like you know you you
were saying like you felt like Motorola
still had enough brand awareness like I
think there's a sense memory in this
country for the Motorola brand but how
do you get that message out there to say
you know like well there's a reason why
this is priced higher there's a reason
why this batteries more expensive or
this game controllers more expensive for
the people who are really interested in
those solutions
I think they've found those solutions
and it's not going to come from buying
into a system like a camera like if I
buy a canon camera i buy Canon lenses
and Canon speedlights and all that stuff
and it it all ties together if I buy a
moto in the next year I want to buy a
Samsung you know I should only buy USB
accessories not moto mod accessories I
don't think the average consumer really
thinks of it like that necessarily I
feel like a lot more people in general
are way more tied to a brand than to an
accessory so I completely agree so you
know obviously so if someone's gonna buy
a Motorola phone I think they're more
inclined to purchase the next Motorola
phone which is why they're probably more
inclined to buy a moto mod and then say
a well and I'm gonna be able to use it
the next one so that's fine but another
concern is the fact that I think they're
they only said that they're gonna keep
that same moto my design for the Z
series for another year at this point I
think no once you buy that like even if
you buy a motor mount today that
probably means you know in two years
probably that things
useless unless you're still rocking your
motives you to force you know but which
well may be the case but you know I
think also the average consumer doesn't
really hold on to phones as long as we
think we like I think a lot of the tech
community especially likes to you know
switch up phones all the time and uh a
lot of people I know hold on to the
phones definitely for two years but
there's also a lot of people have
definitely upgraded every two years and
follow that cycle mostly because is sort
of in grow the averages we're looking up
numbers right now is between 26 and 28
months so in in the United States so
people are starting to break from that
two-year contract cycle right so after
you paid the phone off in 20 months or
20 24 months oh your bill just got cut
30 bucks you know I'm gonna hold onto
this phone for a couple months before I
run out and buy something new and that
may be true but there are you know
sprint might be the leading edge I see
in terms of all the wait I'm still I'm
still talking screen there we go
spread might be the leading edge in
terms of promoting leases and just
recycling more devices so that they can
keep that thing going with the 24 months
or even 18 months in that case in any
case I think what we're missing out on
here is the design at well the device
itself because yeah we might as well say
like what's in the phone actually
backing yeah no it's I mean it's the
typical kind of 2017 thing that you
would expect snapchatting 35 4 gigs of
ram but you know it's all all this stuff
in a very you know slabby kind of thing
it's I mean so it's lights it's like 140
grams or so and it has a 5.5 inch oh you
know display and so that inflates
everything comparing that to an iPhone 7
the regular 4.7 inch thing you're
talking about a third more surface area
and just about the same
kind of massiveness I guess you could
say or the grams wise and for me you
know the aluminum unibody felt nice and
I make mention this pan on video but it
felt like you know I was one of those
weirdos that was able to run with the
the freakin device in hand you know
running from one demo station to that
there and it felt weird this this whole
you know it was like a wing it was like
you know cutting through the air with a
sword or something like that
and it made it made me feel a little
less secure about it now the like the
county reaction to that would be the
shadow shield screen that they you know
it was on the droid turbo to you on
Verizon and between all that you know
that's supposed to save you some some
grief although it's scratches pretty
darn easily I saw Android police as a
David Reddick share picture of his motor
z2 force are ready I wasn't if I was a
lot to sort of say something about that
because I know I'm still under like a
full review embargo but yeah there's a
lot of edges on my screen already yeah
I'm doing that from you know I never
added so don't blame me that we haven't
even gone to like let the shipping
is supposed to take like a practical
week for us because FedEx is like oh you
have to it's from review right now but
our RC rz2 forces is um but you know I
like I had experiences with the the
first Z Force and I think the shatter
shield tech is again it's all gonna be a
series of compromises we could make a
screen that's virtually impervious to
scratches but it would be probably too
brittle to survive a drop so they've
made a choice to flip that over but I
kind of want to get just to circle back
real quickly Julianne because you you
were talking about this feeling like it
was going to be too expensive
immediately and and I actually have too
many tweets to actually sum up all the
people who have tweeted this question to
us that a lot of people are taking the
battery capacity reduction as a cynical
move to try and encourage more moto mod
purchasing on a phone that's already
priced higher than like au 11 you would
already sort of indicated that you felt
that this was going to be an expensive
purchase I was hoping that you could
maybe sort of expand that thought just a
little bit I mean if you just look at
the back of the phone it's like clearly
meant to have something on it like it
looks weird in a way you might have
people like oh what's wrong with your
phone or it looks like your back came
off or something like that and so I
think they're sort of using that to
their advantage to have people put stuff
on it and that's why they're making it
Oh where's our phone is so thin now
well yeah you shaved off all the battery
and now you're left to the smaller
battery and but but you can buy our Moto
mod so it clearly I think is a money
grab I don't think that's necessarily a
bad idea like sure I would like a bigger
battery but they do sell the Moto Zi Qi
play which is a pretty darn good phone
for by with $500 still yeah but there
are a lot of other options out there if
you really want a bigger battery and the
ability to have a modem on that it maybe
expands your battery capacity to a lot
more than you would have done if they
didn't reduce the battery is also kind
of cool so I'm not terribly offended by
it but I just think the base price of
the phone is still way too high so I'm
of a different mind here because I'm
viewing this yeah yeah it's it's big so
this is the first time under Lenovo
ownership that motorola has had a phone
make it to all the major US carrier so
we've even got US Cellular in that so
and all there are all these deals about
you know we're gonna give you a free
modem out here we're gonna give we're
gonna give you to boner mods if you buy
it from Best Buy and you get it on on
the network and it's just crazy and you
know great for them for that kind of
subsidiary kind of thing going on there
what I'm trying to say is is that they
had to produce a product that's you know
if they had one shot that was going to
be it and
it was they don't have a regular moto z2
out there so then that to me we felt
like you know that they were they were
blending the two phones and so yeah it's
more of an upgrade to the Moto original
moto Z and not the Moto Z 2 for this is
something that has consistently been a
part of Lenovo design is AI with their
think pads for example is that they
would make a concerted effort to deliver
the most portable the smallest the
slimmest the sleekest and often at the
expense of things like internal battery
capacity but then champion something
like really fast charging laptop battery
tech yeah that was a Lenovo influence
over Motorola this was a case of
branding and you know market access
realities and you know trying to bring
that over to a phone which was you know
it could have been just the Moto z2 but
I guess now the taking of market
realities I don't have a good just I
really liked your phrasing there um I
wanted to get your guys thoughts on the
360 degree camera moto mod because 360
video is something I've personally been
having a lot of fun with we're still
trying to figure out what to do with it
but your thoughts on that implementation
if you had a chance to check it out it
seems I mean it's like it's one of those
things that it's like fine it's cool
that's awesome that I can take it and
I've seen the stuff that I've out put it
and it's actually pretty neat I tried to
share it on Twitter and it didn't really
come out as a 360 photo like it was just
a super stretched photo and that was
like yeah but then I shared it on
Facebook and apparently that's just like
the only place I can share it with the
360 or you could actually what you're
not you're not rocking all this stuff on
Google+ what well you know I'll have you
know that I am the moderator of the most
popular 360 degree photo and video
community plus we have tens of you
later on everyone wants to do the whole
365 day and it's great for VR but yeah I
mean if I'm just sharing it to Facebook
once in a while I'm not gonna spend $70
to buy it right and if then then I would
do what like what you said and buy
something I could just connect to a USB
C port or something that I can bring
over to multiple phones in the future is
that something that I don't really care
if it's tied to a particular phone I'd
rather it be working on anything so even
if I had to share it look like a
girlfriend or a friend but then I could
do that so I 360 is just a kind of a
thing for me is if you like it you like
it if you don't don't work with whatever
the only thing that I'm looking forward
to is a 360 live-streaming which is
already hard enough from the consumer
side I think it and it has some valid
uses especially when if you can get
things if we get the hardware down to
something manageable I think that's the
Moto 360 camera mod is barely it but in
that case like there could be a whole
bunch of citizen journalism or
experiential kind of things going on
that you know you can have life and I
I'm not sure exactly what they are I
think better minds than mine we'll find
that out but um feel like that's an
untapped potential and 300 part of the
thing like when you mentioned citizen
journalism for example like a common
complaint I see you in 360 content is
that people actually don't like the fact
that they have to go search for what the
hell is going on right and they don't
want to turn around and oh the story is
here
look this way not that way but then I'm
like well why am i watching in 360 then
right because so that seemed like a lot
of people complain about how you have to
make VR stories in a good way that sort
of encompasses that 360 environment
because otherwise you're forcing people
to try and search for it and that works
with certain mediums and certain types
of stories but you know for the average
consumer I think that's one thing sort
of like showing off breathtaking views
yeah like for basically every single
like here's a video of me at the beach
here's a video of a car driving like
we've got a lot of those it's what we've
really struggled with is I feel that
there is an interactive element to 360
video that if you have something where
the viewer can discover something in the
frame then it makes sense so we did a
factory to her smartphone manufacturing
Factory and you know three-quarters of
the video frame one quarter of the video
frame is me holding a camera looking mer
you know like he's looking like a doofus
but 3/4 of the frame you're allowed to
sort of look where you want it wasn't
about me trying to guide the narrative
it was about you exploring what it would
be like to be on this factory floor
something like that totally makes sense
to me but what's disappointing
especially from listening to both of you
talk about this is it doesn't sound like
Motorola has done anything to improve
upon the experience of taking a phone
and taking a camera and plugging it in
and being able to shoot upside down and
you know the the the output is all weird
and like oh the app flips the screen on
in you're fine you know like I don't
think there's anything other than the
fact that you're not plugging it into
your your CLO and you're just slapping
it on so I'm not really sure what else
they could do I mean I'm sure in the
grand scope of all things 360-degree
camera innovation there's stuff you can
do but I think it's just a more of like
a guess us to you know we're doing
through the cameras my hours please
though I mean they for all the talk that
they say you know innovation and
everything apart like moto mod was cool
last year when they first introduced it
but there's not really anything
innovative now like a year on with the
phone it's just a phone with all the
flagship specs you'd expect and what I
was hoping is is you know is was there a
platform that made streaming easier was
there or like a moto mod that maybe gave
you high quality audio recording so you
know like we're all working on
different audio recorders when were out
in the field or you know trying to plug
into a phone to produce high-quality
audio
you mean like something like that again
with a limited scope it's a niche
product but that would turn my phone
into something unique that would turn my
phone into something useful for what I
need to do so I would pay a premium for
that like that that makes sense to me I
don't know you you audio nerds just I
don't think that would ever really care
or want to buy these things well
so speaking of mainstream um you know
one of the things that I think was was
more successful on Twitter when I was
watching this sort of unpack
I was watching people respond to this
announcement was the the gamepad you
dock your phone and you've got like you
know a proper if it reminds me of like
the old atari lynx remember it was like
really long it had like controls that
were sort of bordering this big screen
or even the switch or even in attendence
which is is this maybe the opportunity
to to inspire some more daring design
with consumers what with moto mods and
then also like again I really feel like
because your point there you know I
don't really you're saying you don't
really feel like consumers are are
considering this with their phone
purchases we've got to do something
motorola has to do something to strike
up the imagination or the interest or
something to generate some good feels
about these products and gaming I think
is a perfect opportunity while we're
looking at companies like Razer trying
to you know produce a gaming centric
phone Nvidia with their shield line is
this maybe the opportunity to find a
market that they can that they can build
up a fan base with I mean it would be
great if gaming could oval game you
could get a boost from this game pad
that Motorola is making but I have very
sour feelings about mobile gaming for
the most part I think there's great
potential especially making like a lot
of those indeed
you find on steam for example making
their way to Android and iOS but right
now I feel like current state of mobile
gaming is just so terrible just terrible
terrible games sure there are some gems
out there but most of it is like you
know you know eight away or pay to
microtransactions and all this little
things and and I just don't Mike apart
from you know those short quick games I
don't really am NOT a fan and I'm a
gamer so I'm not totally not really
interested in mobile gaming but there
again I think that there's an
opportunity there and if people were
interested then they could maybe create
some awesome games for mobile gaming but
I don't think Motorola's the gamepad is
gonna do that I mean we've seen
I watched Stuart Ashton's channel from
the UK and he's obsessed a little bit
with like those Android dedicated gaming
tablets shield and you know well even
the cheaper ones from China that you
know you can import and I mean when
everything else is just Bluetooth or
it's an inch or it's just it has to be
that one all in one situation you don't
you don't really get much room for it's
it's bulky it's I mean it's just the
same with this and I just don't know how
to feel about because myself I'm not
really a gamer so when it comes to
having the mod to compete for space with
the laptop I always go I always go there
because my backpacks always full you
know if you're going everywhere with a
battery pack or something like that you
know how much room do you have for a
motor mods like that
I don't know well and that's actually
another question too and I apologize to
the person who tweeted this out of me
because I can't find the tweet now is
the the focus on modular phones maybe
misdirected to that notion of I'm in the
field I'm gonna swap it back and change
part of the function of the phone in
this moment instead of maybe it being
I've got a bass phone which I will then
customize to make the exact perfect
for me not really focusing on what I can
do to switch parts of it when I'm on the
go because I really feel like the Moto
mod idea is in this moment I need a
gamepad I'm gonna slap it on there BAM
I've got my my game pad and then I'm
gonna pop it off and put on a battery
when I need to extend my run time when I
feel most people are gonna leave the
house with a mod attached and then just
kind of leave it there so it doesn't
make any sense for them to leave the
house with a projector mod but they will
leave the house with the battery mod and
then they're good for most of the
situations that they'll need to use
their phone for I mean I mean isn't that
what project RL is sort of all about you
know making that phone for you and
upgrading it over time the parts that
you care about I just think they made
the right decision and closing that
because I just don't think there's a lot
of financial viability there and or the
fact that people care what kind of RAM
or speaker or thing they just want
that's the border so my life Motorola's
approach where you slap on things for
certain events and occasions but the
problem is you know a couple of things
one is costs that we already talked
about into like he mentions like the
ability to carry these things around
like I have a bag full of a bunch of
motor mods and couple of them actually
wouldn't mind using when I go out but
not gonna carry that thing around like
my bag does everyone the tech industry's
bag is probably full and really heavy
already because I carry like might be as
Lauren everything all the time and I
don't really want to carry two more mods
just add some I mean again this really
depends on the person but if we're
talking mainstream I'm not sure if
that's particularly useful for them but
I also don't really know what else would
be useful whether it would be project
Aras method or motapod method but that's
why I think just generally modular
phones were an idea but I just don't
think they're really gonna be going any
further at the moment in the car
landscape and what Motorola hats I mean
if someone wants to prove me wrong and
create this amazing modular film in
short but from what we've seen
especially with LG I just don't think
that's too much interest where they may
dream right it was also a little
concerned listening to Andy Rubin talk
about essential phone you know like
again or III worry about any system I
have to buy into that has proprietary
solutions for problems we've already
solved through USB what a fair point I
mean we got the gradual treatments if
not intended by Apple where you know
there's the iPhone it's an Internet
communicator all right we're going to
put in an app store all right this
already we're gonna do that I loved it
that's for Apple all right I mean it's
just it was just a gradual build-up and
you know you're all starting with a
decent device in the first place which I
still think the this this is the
marusici force is a decent device you
know it's it's vibrant as it needs to be
and it's simple software moto software
has always been well recently always
been a pretty good deal very clean and
everything that they add to it is just
okay here's how we can help you so there
you go chop-chop
oh and you're done 2014 and I think that
still is my favorite phone of all time
because I think that we go bring you as
a client
come on so I did a little pre-show this
is the x2 um but but it was one of the
the Moto maker one so it's got the
bloody leather back the white front face
I wanted the red accents red white and
blue it's kind of my Captain America
phone I like if I could get this with
new mid Ranger specs and a rear-facing
fingerprint sensor I would be so happy I
mean like I would throw money at
Motorola and sing their praises from the
rooftops this was still one of my
all-time favorite phone designs just
gorgeous and it stands out I don't think
is he well
and I think that's the rumor there's
like the Moto X that's supposed to come
out this year
you know one of x-force with me I'm fine
yeah it could be it'd be happening
maybe because magnetic snap Max is just
not doing it for me well that's the
thing too so I feel like they've box
themselves in a corner with the c2
because they are like well we can't
really innovate too much on the design
because we have to hold this same format
this is our runs where the xx4 or
whatever the hell it's gonna be called
is there sort of you know there's black
shipping away their way to provide a
phone that doesn't have to do there now
we know you have to get going soon you
have a heart out in just couple minutes
right so before we land
yeah I just wanted to real quickly if
you could share some of your thoughts on
on the camera tech because I'm the
camera snob at a pocket Cohen I like
dual camera shooters especially this
implementation of color and monochrome
and I read through your review and just
if you could kind of unpack a few of
your thoughts there too I definitely
appreciate it I mean I really would like
to see people just trying different
things other than taking stuff from what
other people have done and everyone's
been doing you know Apple wasn't even
the first one to have dual cameras but
everyone's now copying the whole
portrait mode and now they're taking
from hallways black and white mode which
is great but I think there's more than
maybe could be done there I don't really
know I think what they do the X the
force Z to force offers is is fine
that's possibly mine and it's going to
be it's gonna be way more more frame
than ever in it like the black and white
is is alright I thought I would like it
as much as the p9 but so far it's it's I
like that well the p10 actually I like
the p10 a little more and the portrait
mode is surprisingly actually pretty
good but only specifically on people on
objects I haven't had any luck at all it
looks terrible
but I saw the point took a photo of like
one of the little Android yeah poor
antenna so yeah I mean it's it's fine I
just don't that's like a part of my
reason of why I think the phone is also
priced too high because I think you
could just definitely get a better
experience a camera experience on other
flagships and some of those other
flagships are also waterproof which is
another thing that could also mention
but for me fine is like money take away
from this this whole phone more or less
I'm hearing a lot of it's fine it's fine
it's okay little bits from the p-n
weekly hashtag that we can get to Daniel
Mladenov
so if you saw if you plug a USB see
360-degree camera to one plus five it
would have a normal display right
referencing the recent controversy of
oneplus installing their screens upside
down technically yes Daniel if you used
the insta error 360 app with the
360-degree camera then yes you would
finally have your screen oriented in the
correct direction same winter if you get
penny modems II without emotive odd it
would almost feel like part of your
phone is missing which I think most
people who could agree just by looking
at the pins Laura Fagan what do we think
of Moto's budget mid-tier range geez and
LMNOP s catered to that range how
competitive is that when blue exists I
think it's very competitive when you're
looking at Snapdragon processor Blue has
a phones on Amazon like that's the big
marketplace and they rank very highly on
that but taken my family by store and
storm I don't know Julian do you think
that that's maybe a better strategy just
to keep the the brand alive yeah I think
they're they know they're heavily
investing more I think their budget
phones because there's just so much
rivalry and competition going on there
like they
how many budget phones now the Moto an
awesome on the end powerful but of
g-series you know they're pretty great
and you know they've been continually
focusing I feel like on those phones way
more I feel like they definitely made
more of a splash on those phones earlier
in the year when they were sort of
demoing or showing them off especially
mobile of Congress and then put this e24
it was kind of like this brushed press
event where things just went by really
quickly and it was like if the phone
okay you know go away so I feel like and
at one point you know the Moto G was the
best-selling you know such phone on
Amazon like 2013 so I mean maybe there's
hope still that they can go for another
one well and I just think for Asian
markets you're gonna have way more
traction on a Moto G for many consumers
than you will on a Moto Z I think you're
you're asking for a priced here that for
communities that are maybe just recently
jumping into LTE that's that's a pretty
a pretty big chunk of change for someone
to fork over unless Reliance geo decides
to you know fail on you that day and
everything goes to hell so gonna fail on
you with an $800 phone it spreads
that's worse than if it fails on you
with a $200 or or a free phone or free
phone that's true too yeah well on that
note I would like to thank you Julian
for coming on our show and just you know
having fun talking about moto anything
you'd like to plug socials work whatever
yeah I feel like I can't not plug in our
site but they go take a stroll down to
Digital Trends calm if you guys are
interested in reading and thanks for
having me it was a lot of fun yeah
definitely we were super glad you were
able to join us
especially for helping us to unpack all
of this moto fun stuff I'd highly
recommend people go and check out
Julian's article on the z2 force it's a
really good hands-on it's very complete
lots of great photos after of course
you've watched our video hosted by Jules
on on the exact same phone with
very similar talking points great minds
think alike so on that note let's go
ahead and put a pin in it
folks there you have it another episode
of the pocket now weekly has come and
gone the show is over but the
conversation continues on Twitter where
you can find Julian I am so sorry I'm
gonna butcher your name Julian Chaka to
check out through to Japan we just had I
had the wrong yeah at Julian jakotsu
Jules is at point Jules and I'm humbly
at some gadget guy pocket now is around
the web on Twitter Instagram Facebook
Google+ YouTube and our home site
