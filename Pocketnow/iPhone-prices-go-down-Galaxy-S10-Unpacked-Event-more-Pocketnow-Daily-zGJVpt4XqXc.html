where we will receive the new Galaxy S
10 LG is reportedly gearing up for an
MWC launch tradition with the g8 and
iPhone prices are dropping as strange as
they may sound I'm Jaime Rivera and I
know right I got the worst lighting you
get to bugging out dailies today sorry
about the tech difficulties yesterday
this is PocketNow daily the official
lucid a begin with everything that we're
covering from CES 2019 we already have
our Nubia video alive again we've got
Jabra we're trying to look for a couple
of extra products that have been rumored
out there that apparently are here not
yet being confirmed but we will keep you
posted so again follow the playlist for
more information and also follow us on
Instagram now let's talk about Samsung
and its press invitations for its
unpacked event to happen in San
Francisco on February 20th I mean that
was the date that I was flying to but I
don't know for MWC oh my god this just
completely changed our plans now we're
gonna go to San Fran will definitely be
covering it there live we'll keep you
posted but my god Sammy rumors have it
that we will also be able to see the
galaxy up there to a certain degree
we'll see what we get
now let's talk about the LG G a we don't
have a much detail on this phone but we
do hear that LG will continue its
tradition of launching a product during
MWC and that will be the g8 we were not
expecting this to happen with all the
thing that LG was gonna you know not
launch so many products every year but
it seems that's gonna change we'll keep
you posted about that we will be at MWC
now let's talk about Nokia as we've got
some leaked images of the 8.1 and it
seems that Nokia wants to follow the
trend the design language for those of
you that don't like the concept of punch
holes it's coming here in addition to
the fact that you're getting to keep the
headphone jack so that's a good trend
that at least the company is going to
keep we just don't have any dates and
finally the hottest news that I have to
do with iPhones dropping in price
believe it or not in China devices like
the iPhone 10 are apparently like 66
dollars less expensive devices like the
iPhone 10 as Mac's have dropped in
priced by like $50 this is unprecedented
according to the report Apple is telling
its supply
to drop their prices so that they could
be more competitive as if this was
apples and you know suppliers fall but
anyways in the comments down below what
do you think I mean do you think that
this price drop is good enough would you
buy an iPhone if it were $50 less
expensive because in my case I feel that
they should be a lot less expensive
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what you think
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us I'm talking about
comic strip to both our channels English
and Spanish for more videos like this
one you follow me on twitter Jaime
underscore e there on instagram @ high
memory data please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
high American I think so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
