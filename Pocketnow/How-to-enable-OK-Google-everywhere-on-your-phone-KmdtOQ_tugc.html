lets you search for anything as long as
you're on your home screen a recent
update to Google search open that up to
let you search from virtually anywhere
but sometimes it's not automatically
turned on I'm Joe Levi with pocket now
and if you want to turn on OK Google
everywhere here's how you do it first
off let's start with prerequisites
you're going to need the latest version
of the Google Search app so make sure
you head out to the Play Store and get
all the updates all the patches and
whatnot for all of your apps that's
generally good practice you'll want to
make especially sure that your Google
Search app as well as Play services are
up to date
so if you see updates available for them
make sure you download and install them
both some people are reporting this
trick only works on Android 4.3 devices
and others are reporting it only works
on Android 4.4 devices you don't have
either one of those you'll want to see
if you can't update your Android version
to the latest version out there of
course we know that not everybody is
going to be able to do that but if
you're running into an issue that could
be why the first thing that we need to
do is basically start we simply say ok
Google ok Google everywhere once you do
that tap on any link here's a CNET one
for example some people say you don't
have to open the link some people say
you do once you've done that you've
accomplished the first step next we're
going to go into our settings and we're
going to go down to language and input
and from there all the way down to voice
search from here we want to go into ok
Google detection and it's showing you
that you can search from the search app
and now we can search from any screen we
do have to train this so let's say ok
Google ok Google ok Google
once we've done that say okay you can
even turn it on from the lock screen if
you want and if you need to if things
are being picked up just right you can
retrain your voice model so that it
reacts more to the way that you say it
so from here I shouldn't be able to say
that key word but since we've turned
that on okay google pocketnow.com just
like that okay google is available from
anywhere there you go you should now be
able to search okay Google
from virtually anywhere on your device
make sure you give the video a thumbs-up
