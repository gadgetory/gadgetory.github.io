could say the same about your hearing
buddy what does hi miss daily driver LG
g4 for now buddy wait what's your name
again bond James Bond that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi meri behna
this is pocket now and this is the
bargain out daily recap the last week on
Monday we had some analyst information
claiming that obviously the iphone 6s
sold more than the iphone 6s plus which
has happened with the previous variants
last year as well and I asked you why do
you think the smaller variance sells
more than the bigger one and we have
1,000 14 comments thanks a lot guys we
start with other manufacturers make
better phablets than Apple simple and
you know I have to agree with you bat
use of the bezels humongous bezels on
this phone the phone is just huge
there's really very little added value
except for the battery lights I
surprised ease of handling iphone
success is I assume you meant better
than the iphone 6s plus and that could
be the case particularly for me the
reason why i chose the smaller variant
is because i've run with the phone and i
can't be running with that humongous
played in my arm the answer is simple
limited quantities everywhere I went
they had plenty of successes but sold
out from the success plus you know i
love your comment because it would be
one of like 10 other comments claiming
the same thing it seems that the real
problem here is that people can't really
buy the phone even if they wanted to and
some people just want an iphone when
they can tuesday we have the microsoft
event and i asked you what was the
hottest thing that you like from the
events out of everything that microsoft
announced do we start with 734 comments
the continuum feature might get me to
switch from iOS and you know we are
actually debating this I love the
continuum feature but then Michaels
point is great as to the fact that well
if you already have monitored at a
keyboard you're already going to have a
CPU so it becomes pointless to use
continuum so it really depends i feel
that this is going to be great for
productivity for companies or for your
kid which you don't want to buy a
computer to just private monitor the
keyboard but it's a tough one to see we
will have to see it implemented and see
how great it is when we review it but
excites me the most is that Microsoft
got cool again and
dude I have to agree with you and
everybody at talking now agrees with you
too this is probably one of the best
events we've seen from Microsoft in
years and the products as well again we
will have to review them but
particularly surface pro 4 and the
surface book these products are awesome
this is the most exciting keynote event
of the year by any company surface book
was the coolest product of this keynote
and yeah again I just said it and I'll
say it again the surface book is
probably again one of the coolest
products out there pricing will say
everything about it in the long run but
I feel that every other competitor has
met its match because I do feel that
Microsoft actually figured out a way to
pull this off right on Wednesday we
learned that there are at least three
variants of the galaxy s7 being tested
and the biggest question we have is with
all the cool phones that have been
announced right now are you going to
wait for the galaxy s7 probably in
January 2016 or are you getting
something right now we had 909 comments
we start with actually I'm more excited
about the blackberry prev because i'm
using the six edge plus and wow for
somebody to already be using one of
samsung's coolest flagships of the year
and be considering the blackberry privet
says a lot about the blackberry you know
what dude I agree I can't wait to give
that phone a try I'm personally waiting
for the next year's crop of phones
because snapdragons this year are trash
and you know it's funny we are agreeing
with this with Michael Snapdragon 650
and 675 dragon a 10 with a different
story again it could be software
optimization so many things but I think
you got a good point probably the
smartest thing is to wait for the 820
I'm completely done with Samsung devices
until they fix their horrible memory
management it's a shame too because of
their devices are nice otherwise and you
have 27 likes there is a purpose for
that a lot of people have been
complaining about that and it does
really make a point but remember that's
really a lollipop thing for the most
part I think every lollipop phone has
that problem on Thursday we had a rather
interesting comparison because it was a
nikon camera and an iphone success when
it comes to 4k video recording yes they
have two down sample some of this to be
able to convert it and compare but it's
interesting the iphone one and i asked
you do you rely on
camera for filming video or do you just
use your smartphone whichever smartphone
we had 688 comments we start with I
record all my videos with my samsung
galaxy note 4 now I see no need to carry
multiple devices with the progression of
smartphone quality now and that is my
case too I will admit my favorite camera
for filming as the iphone 6 right now
particularly because of the slo-moes and
timelapses and hyperlapse which i use a
lot i wish would reach android at some
point unfortunately i can't afford a
DSLR so I stick to my lumia for video
recording and people are always shocked
at the quality of my videos still a DSLR
would be nice and I do agree with you a
DSLR would be great but yeah Lumias do a
great fantastic job when it comes to
video i have a panasonic lumix i assumed
camera i bought three years ago since i
bought it i've only use it three to four
times made a mistake buying it expensive
mistake i use my smartphones for videos
and photography nothing else or mobile
phones and tripods sorry about that but
your punctuation is kind of crazy but I
get your point and yeah that's really
the case with everybody right now
smartphone cameras are getting so good
particularly with the g4 that it's
really pointless just move away from
them finally Friday the discussion has
to do with Android 6th auto marshmallow
and Samsung Galaxy devices we learn the
list of phones that are getting it but
we didn't get a date and I asked you
given the fact that for example the LG
g4 is already getting marshmallow will
you jump ship and switch OEMs just
because they address marshmallow quicker
we had 1114 comments thanks a lot guys
we start with at least you get the
latest operating system on iphone oh
yeah that's one of the benefits of
iphone right I would as well that's why
I'm thinking of getting an iphone or a
Lumia 950 Samsung phones AT&amp;amp;T sucks with
updates and yes that combination pretty
much almost every Android phone with
AT&amp;amp;T is a really bad combination with
software updates and that's really sad
why do you think I'm using the nexus 5
one of the best reasons to buy a nexus
timely updates to stock Android and I do
agree with you yes it is great that you
get software updates in a timely manner
lollipop was a bit of a disappointment
because the operating system
itself was a good looking but not well
performing and I've been exposed to
devices from Oppo for example that even
though you don't get timely software
updates with devices like you know the
r7 my god they performed really well so
it makes me wonder would I be really
willing to jump ship with these phones
that perform so well just because I get
a later version of Android if what I
care about is that the phone works well
so it's kind of a big debate and I would
love to know what you think in the
comments think is a comment about that
particularly that's it for the bug and
I'll daily recap thank you very much for
watching a couple of steps of you on
your comments to be featured number one
keep them short number to stick to the
point number three try to get some
thumbs up it helps us spot them a lot
