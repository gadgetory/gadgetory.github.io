pocketnow.com
and this is the look at the new unlock
screen coming in windows mobile 6.5 this
comes from a ROM from XD developers on
the touch HD now your phone is always
trying to tell you things you have new
appointments you have new emails new SMS
new calls a lot of different things that
are going on what are the advantages of
having a windows mobile today screen is
that you can see all of this information
in one glance now when Microsoft is
taking this another step further in the
unlock screen in Windows Mobile 6 point
5 so that you can see in one glance if
you have any kind of notification and
then you can act on them instantly and I
think this is much better than even the
iPhone where you have to first unlock
the screen then you have to look for the
icons with the notifications and then
you have to go into the application and
so on so let me show you how it is in
windows mobile 6.5 so here we are taken
to the unlock screen and something
that's great about this is that we have
our next appointment right here and we
have the time and the date now up here
we know that there's something new going
on because it says tap or slide and if I
want to unlock the device I just bring
it to the right and it'll take me to the
main screen but what if I don't want to
unlock my device what if I quickly want
to get to the areas that I have
notifications in so I'm going to tap or
slide I'm going to slide it down and I
get two icons right now actually now
three icons one is for missed calls so
if I slide to slide this to the right I
will go right to my missed calls the
next one is for SMS so I have a new SMS
let me show you that and it'll go right
into the SMS screen and finally if I
have a new email it will go right into
the new email so I can read it right
from the screen and here it is right on
the screen there so I think for a lot of
people the new unlock screen and windows
mobile 6.5 is going to be a breath of
fresh air oftentimes during the day I'm
sure you find yourself taking out the
phone from your pocket just to check if
you've got a little new icon in the in
the upper part of the screen tell you of
a missed call
if you have an iPhone you're unlocking
and looking for the SMS icon to see if
there is a new SMS but with this it's
just a one glance kind of system where
you see if you have any new
notifications and you can act on them
instantly by sliding the respective
little icon to the right or to the left
to unlock it so that is it for the
unlock screen in windows mobile 6.5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
