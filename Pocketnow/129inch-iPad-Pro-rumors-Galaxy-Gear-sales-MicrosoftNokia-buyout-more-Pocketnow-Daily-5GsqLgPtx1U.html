point nine inch ipad samsung both of the
galaxy Gear's exceeded sales
expectations in the deal is final no
kiss shareholders approved the Microsoft
buyout I'm hi Mary betta and I'm spoiled
after being away for a week I I'm
already counting how many days for the
weekend but this is pocket now daily
let's search day off with some official
and actually awesome news as Motorola
has come official with details on their
android 4.4 kitkat update as a matter of
fact that already rolled out to the
verizon moto x you can get it today
hopefully you know how that rolls out it
takes a little time you can also expect
it on the AT&amp;amp;T variant another carrier
variants very soon they were also
specific about older devices getting
KitKat we're even talking about the
atrix HD on AT&amp;amp;T which is an old phone
which is great news we don't have
specific dates obviously but the links
of the description for the full details
on the list of phones now let's talk
about Samsung as the company is boasting
that they've sold 800 thousand units of
their prototype Galaxy gear which has
definitely exceeded expectations
according to the company now Sally the
company does not boast about their
thirty three percent return rate that we
were talking about just a couple of
weeks ago so out of those eight hundred
thousand units that they supposedly sold
we don't really know how many are
actually in customers hands right now
literally so anyways let's see how that
goes and we've got some more reports of
Apple working on a 12 point nine inch
iPad which is really odd but so did we
feel about the ipad mini and it happened
as it turns out the company's apparently
working ticket this tablet in the market
by early 2014 according to reports so it
could be that since we've got an ipad
air now this could be the ipad pro the
question is if this thing will run OS 10
or what exactly will it be running so
stay tuned for the rumors as it could
happen you never know and speaking of
pro things have you thought that apples
a7 64-bit chip was a big deal it seems
that it won't be very soon as arm is
apparently already working on a protocol
to bring us 128-bit chips for mobile
devices which is really interesting
since we're still stuck in 64-bit
processors for computers and i don't see
that going away any time soon it's
interesting to see on
28 bit processors we just really don't
know what the point will be at 64 bit
has barely just made it to two devices
three actually and finally for the
interesting news of the day nokia
shareholders have just approved the
microsoft by out for around five point
forty four billion arrows once you
include the pads into the mix and this
was kind of unanimous 99.7 % of
shareholders approved i'm sure that they
want to get at least the little money
instead of losing everything if the
stock price would continue dropping so
yes this has happened it's finally a
reality but that leads you to the
question of the day how do you feel
about the microsoft buyout of nokia now
that it's finally happened in my
particular case honestly nokia was the
manufacturer of my first ever cell phone
back in 1998 so I am nostalgic I do hope
that Microsoft figures this out and
brings a better future for the company
hopefully but leave us a comment down
below how do you feel and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is
filming she follows on pocketnow.com it
subscribe to a channel as well and also
follow me on twitter Jaime underscore
