budget smartphones but what is life like
with a hundred dollar smartphone this is
Joel has flipped with pocket now I've
spent about a week with the ZTE Max
Excel what kind of value can you get out
of a $100 smartphone well with the ZTE
Max Excel there's a lot to offer for the
price Snapdragon 435 six inch 1080p
display three thousand nine hundred and
ninety milliamp hour battery 16
gigabytes of storage and two gigs of RAM
as you may know specs don't always tell
the story but even though this phone
doesn't have the latest Snapdragon
chipset with day-to-day tasks this phone
does adjust fine
there isn't noticeable lag or stutters
between switching apps taking pictures
or normal tasks I've noticed a few weird
things though like the screen might go
black occasionally in YouTube and
starting off the display and turning it
back on solves this problem and this
could be a RAM management problem
potentially it is definitely not a speed
demon by any stretch of the imagination
but you're not going to notice the huge
difference when opening and closing and
switching between apps versus a faster
flagship but because of the slower
chipset this really allows the device to
sit battery day-to-day this 3990 million
in battery and only a 1080p display I've
had no issues of getting to work days of
battery life on the ZTE Max
XL the media experience with the max XL
is solid this display looks good and has
good viewing angles my least favorite
part would be this back facing speaker
but it is loud and sound fusili clear
you do start to get some distortion at
the higher ends and it is a little tinny
if you turn it up too loud
you may have noticed the size of the
phone and there's no getting around this
this is a huge phone you'll most likely
have to use a two hands for everyday use
thankfully it has an aluminum body
around the edges here and has a nice
texture back which feels good in the
hand I really enjoyed the build quality
of this and it feels much better than
$100 device I've been a huge fan of the
vanilla Android experience that ZTE
offers and you get Android 7.1.1 right
out of the box you won't find a lot of
bloatware here and that really adds the
overall speed of this device the camera
experience on the Mac sextile can be hit
or miss you really start to see the
limitations of a budget smartphone in
this category I was able to get some
solid shots with good lighting around
town and on some hikes but it really
starts to struggle with their lower
light and low light you start to see the
limits of the sensor and you see grain
in your shots you have to hold it really
still and it does take quite a while to
focus if your selfie fanatic this phone
might not be your best option
it gets the job done here for a selfie
or snapchat from here to here but not
the best I have enjoyed the manual
camera modes that ZTE offers here being
able to adjust your ISO shutter speed
and white balance manually is quite nice
so this will give you an idea of the
front-facing cameras video this is 1080p
and a sample of your back facing shooter
as well overall I've enjoyed my time
with the ZTE Max XL this is a budget
phone for sure with its limits but with
a Salva display and great battery life
it makes up for a slower processor and a
just-okay camera for $100 this could be
a great option for a lot of people this
has been joe has flipped with pocket now
thank you so much for watching if you
enjoyed this feel free to like it and
share it with a friend
