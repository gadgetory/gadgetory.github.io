refining it and some are a larger
departure from their predecessor the
Huawei watch 2 falls into the latter
category
it's our first experience with Android
wear - dotto representing a bolder and
sportier look for hallway and we spent a
full day wearing it opposite my precious
pebble time the first day impressions
not bad not bad at all we'll be saving
our full commentary for wear 2.0 for a
future review looking at the specific
watch it's a thicker shell than I tend
to prefer but recalls bolder watch
bodies I've seen as popular options not
quite a Casio g-shock but it does wear
like a timepiece and less like a bangle
or bracelet Huawei opting for a two
button design top takes you home into
the app drawer bottom lunches a workout
with the sport focus on this hardware
and software that's definitely
appreciated for the reduction of swipes
and taps needed when you're trying to
focus on your activity or your workout
the body construction feels more durable
than when described on paper sitting and
press briefings in hearing words like
thermoplastic doesn't do justice to the
Batman like feel of the material views
Huawei claims the ceramic bezel is
harder than steel we're curious to see
how scratch-resistant this material
really is of course there's a heart rate
monitor on the underside necessary for
any wearable these days and all-day
heart rate monitoring is greatly
appreciated a favorite feature from my
time wearing the hallway said even if
you forget to properly start a workout
routine you'll still have some kind of
activity tracking we were given LTE
enabled watches SIM card slots tucked
away under the band though none of us
had active European Sims 2 demo that
feature speaking of the watch strap I
can't say this is my favorite kind of
band I can say it's one of my least
favorite watched wraps and I'll be
popping on a different sport band as
soon as I get home for the first day
this has been a more positive experience
than what I was expecting following the
press event and looking at the stock
photos online where 2.0 is an excellent
update for the ecosystem this hardware
is feature-rich and it seems durable
enough for the target demographic the
screen is one of the better outdoor
viewable LEDs I've used recently with
the responsive ambient light sensor but
that still introduces a few concerns for
battery life after setup off the charger
for five hours and seeing the battery
down to 70
and introduces a little anxiety after
using a pebble that's on me though an
expectation I'll just need to adjust
it's a significant departure from the
original design change which is proven
controversial in our comments but it's a
product which feels well executed for
the right consumer even if it might not
be quite the right fit for my personal
style I'm really looking forward to
producing our full review as always
