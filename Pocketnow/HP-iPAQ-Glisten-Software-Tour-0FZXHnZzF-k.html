pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to cover the software on the HP
ipaq glisten that runs on the AT&amp;amp;T
network so let's start off by turning on
the device and we're going to zoom in on
the screen we're going to take out the
stylus because the screen is kind of
small and from this angle it's a little
bit difficult to operate the screen with
touch so the screen is an advil LED
display which really means the colors
pop and it should be good on battery
life we still haven't run this through
several days of testing so we're not
sure if that's the case the HP ipaq
glisten comes with the most minimal
install of windows mobile 6.5 that we've
seen meaning there are very very little
added programs almost everything is set
to default the way that Microsoft wants
it to be and this is a good and a bad
thing it's good for the people that like
to tweak and change things it's good for
people that like things fast and minimal
but it's bad for anybody that wants to
have a little bit of fun and wants to
look at some eye candy because there
really is none on this device so take
that for what it's worth so here we have
the standard titanium interface for
windows mobile 6.5 we've seen this
before we can see our music in one
screen we can flick through our pictures
we can go through our text messages if
we have new ones we can check out
Outlook email this is an interface that
we've seen many many times here's a
little bit of a problem I think they
should have gone with the for icon white
grid because right now you only get to
see one two three four five icons on the
screen at one time so you're always
having to flick down and flick down and
flip down and go to the bottom which is
really annoying I understand that they
limited the number of icons because of
the small screen size and the low
resolution but I think they could have
fit for there's definitely a registry
hack for this now I've added opera
mobile 10 beta because the device
doesn't come with a better browser it
only has internet explorer mobile so
I've added opera mobile 10 beta which is
a quite a good way to to browse the web
and it works quite well on the on the
glisten and so if we go to Wikipedia
it's loading and it's right now it's
over a 3g connection not Wi-Fi
should come up relatively fast and here
it is Wikipedia obviously this device is
not made to be an internet browsing
machine but it definitely is capable so
here we have Wikipedia and it's both
desktop glory we can tap in on a column
to zoom in it takes a moment to resize
but here it comes through after the page
is loading their now it's resized and
it's the text is perfectly readable so
if you're checking a quick website you
can definitely do so using opera mobile
10 which is free for windows mobile too
bad the device doesn't come with that so
let's exit out of that and we'll go back
into the start menu to see what else is
in here so leave the basic windows
mobile stuff activesync email phone all
of this is just default let's take a
look at the camera application which is
actually quite good and it's different
than what comes standard on Windows
Mobile so it's hard to see right now but
we've little gear icon down here and we
have this really nice interface we can
change the timer or the frame we can go
to the next panel a very intuitive
finger friendly interface for the camera
we can adjust the brightness and the
contrast we can change the white balance
through various different degrees we can
change the effect and then we can also
change the resolution the camera is 3
megapixels you can also go down to 2
megapixels or even smaller than that and
you can switch modes by actually
pressing the d-pad you can go from you
know taking a photo too let's see if I
can get that back up to 2 taking a video
right now we're in video mode and let's
see what the resolutions are for the
video we're actually an mms video so now
we are in the proper screen and the
maximum resolution unfortunately is only
qvga for the video this is not going to
be a device to replace your video camera
but it will take quick video and we're
going to post samples in the full review
on pocketnow.com coming up soon so let's
go back into the start menu and see what
else we have here so we have a lot of
AT&amp;amp;T proprietary stuff and we see this
on all of the AT&amp;amp;T windows mobile
devices so App Center and AT&amp;amp;T Navigator
stuff that I'm not going to go into
mobile web but this is all AT&amp;amp;T stuff
let's go into apps and take a look at
what we have in here we voice commander
which isn't as good as Microsoft voice
command but it lets you control the
device remotely
with your voice so you'll say call Bob
home and it'll it'll call Bob home we
have some widgets in here the facebook
application for windows mobile and then
we have something called HP photosmart
so HP use the photosmart sort of
branding on an application that i don't
think really deserves to be branded with
HP photosmart photosmart printers are
fantastic their software is good but
this really is so from here you can
launch the camera you can print this if
you're connected to a printer via
bluetooth or other means you can trash
it you can email it basically it's like
a glorified photo management tool that
isn't necessarily better than what's
built into windows mobile by default so
we're going to exit from there let's go
back into the start menu and we justwhen
its apps and then we have the
marketplace of course we have games and
in here we have a lot of trial based
java we're so pac-man and monopoly you
can only play a few times before you
actually have to pay for it 18d does
this a lot going down the list with
Windows Live mobile video which is an
AT&amp;amp;T branded thing we have something
called YP mobile and let's launch that
and YP mobile is just a link to the
Yellow Pages mobile download application
so you can go and download that if you'd
like although my guess is that it has
similar functionality to Google Maps
mobile or even Bing mobile so let's go
back down the list to where we were
before AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi so you can get on AT&amp;amp;T
Wi-Fi hot spots we have Office Mobile
suite which is nice pictures and video
if we go into tools we have some things
we have the standard Windows Mobile
calculator internet sharing a printing
utility remote desktop although you're
definitely not going to want to use
remote desktop on such a low resolution
display proxy manager sort of more
technical things in here windows media
player file explorer everything else
from here on down I've added these two
things is is stock stuff that we we see
in the standard install of windows
mobile 6.5 let's take a look at the
settings to see what things that we can
tweak and what hardware buttons we can
change so here we are in power
and this device has been off the charger
for about three hours and it's down
ninety-three percent which is quite good
we expect this to have good battery life
and we can go into personal to take a
look at what buttons we can change the
function of and there are four buttons
that we can change the function of and
they all reside on the bottom of the
keyboard here which is quite nice that
you have four programmable Hardware keys
so if you want to quickly launch opera
mobile without having to go into the
start menu you can do that and so on and
so forth here's some settings for voice
commander we're going to go back go into
system and we can do a factory restore
we can look at device information let's
see how much memory we have we've been
opening a lot of programs fortunately
the ipaq glisten has ample program RAM
which is fantastic right now several
programs are open and we're still
looking at 130 megabytes of free ram
which is really quite fantastic it's
even better than say the samsung omnia
two which gets well below 100 when you
open up a few programs let's see what
else we have down here again pretty much
everything is is stock down here if we
go into backlight we can change the
backlight setting and have it be set to
automatic backlight which is probably
makes the most sense for to save on
battery power or you can manually switch
the backlight all the way up to 10 gets
really bright and uses a lot of power go
down to one can hardly see the screen
oddly you can turn the backlight off on
the omnia two and the omnia pro which
has at which have AMOLED screens but
with this device it seems to really rely
on the backlight to be able to see
things on the screen go back we can go
finally into connections and we can go
into the wireless manager which as no
surprise is the standard default
wireless manager nothing has been
changed and here we have GPS data for
the a GPS on the device the assisted GPS
and real quick let's go through typing
so you can get it feel for how fast you
can type on this device we're going to
go back into the start menu and launch
word mobile so down here
the performance artist device is quite
good it's running a snappy 533 megahertz
processor it has plenty of program Ram
you may see some delays that's because
I'm missing the screen because I'm
shooting from a strange angle here so
let's give a little bit of a test I
haven't been practicing for too long but
maybe you can get a feel for how how
good the keyboard is quite nice I made
some errors there it says this is a test
of the keyboard with a little practice I
think this is going to be a really
fantastic keyboard be sure to check the
final review to see our final verdict on
the keyboard and how good it actually is
so overall we're really surprised to see
such a bare-bones install of windows
mobile 6.5 on the HP ipaq glisten it
really looks like HP spent no time
customizing this device which could have
been on purpose to make it all about the
hardware the hardware is quite fantastic
and is really productive with great
one-handed usability an excellent
keyboard and the touch screen that looks
great with AMOLED technology that said
the tweakers among us are going to want
to put on spb mobile shell or change the
interface of bid and customize how many
icons are on this screen because out of
the box the device is a little bit bland
I'm just to say the least but again I
think it's going to be a fantastic tool
for people that want to be as productive
as possible so be sure to check
pocketnow.com for the four of you coming
up soon we're going to talk about
battery life and speed photo quality and
a lot more that's it for now on the HP
ipaq glisten</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
