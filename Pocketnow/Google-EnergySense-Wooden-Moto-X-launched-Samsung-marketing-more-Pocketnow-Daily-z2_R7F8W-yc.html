application reveals their future plans
the wooden Moto X finally becomes
available even though in a rough way and
Samsung plans to change their home
marketing strategy which is kind of odd
I'm high memory that I and I must really
love you guys because it is my birthday
and I should be drunk not filming this
video this is PocketNow daily let's say
i'll put some official news as those of
you interested in the Oppo find 7 will
finally get some good news first of all
it is confirmed the device is bringing a
2k display so this innovation is
happening the biggest problem is that we
still don't know anything else about the
phone we don't know how it looks we
don't know what size the display is
going to be we don't even know when
we're getting it and we are expecting it
to happen at mwc 2014 so stay tuned for
that now if you were expecting an 8-inch
tablet from Nokia codename illusionist
hold it right there apparently the
project has gone to a complete halt it
seems in the Lumia 2520 hasn't really
surprised anybody with sales and we were
expecting that with Windows RT and
apparently the company doesn't want to
take any more risks but the interesting
thing is that the tablet that is being
heard of is the 8-inch surface from
Microsoft which is the same company now
so we are expecting this tablet to
apparently bring some air gestures sort
of like the things we get on galaxy
phone so stay tuned for that let's hope
they move away from windows RT now in an
interesting twist Samsung has invested
forty percent less money in ads this
year when compared to last because
apparently the company is now focusing
on rebates and storing senses for both
stores and customers so it seems that
the company is changing things
dramatically and so much so that the
company has just pulled somebody from
Apple and apparently the whole idea is
that Samsung plans to have their own
retail stores not the things that we see
at best buy right now and apparently
this guy was a guru at the retail store
strategy from apples so let's see how
that goes now the company that seems to
be trying everything and kind of
succeeding at it as Google as we've got
some new lease of this new energy since
climate control service from google that
apparently will help you control your
whole thermostat from your phone now
interesting we currently know the nest
we know the services but apparently this
new service is not for new google
hardware apparently what they want to do
is actually allow other thermostats to
work with the ghouls
service which means competition let's
see how that goes and finally for the
interesting news of the day Motorola has
just revealed their new would Moto X but
that's the only cool thing about this
because first of all we were expecting
four colors and we only get bamboo right
now that's the only option you get
number two of you order it now it'll
take around 20 days for it to get to you
and number three it's actually a hundred
dollars of premium over the price not
the fifty dollars that were talked about
a couple of months ago so yeah that is
the wooden Moto X so that leads me to
the question of the day a hundred bucks
more 20 days and obviously in Justin
bamboo are you buying this phone or not
because in my particular case honestly
for 100 extra bucks for a wooden phone I
would rather just get the current Moto X
that's out in the market already in
whatever colors I want and then wait for
the Moto X 2 at a more reasonable price
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
