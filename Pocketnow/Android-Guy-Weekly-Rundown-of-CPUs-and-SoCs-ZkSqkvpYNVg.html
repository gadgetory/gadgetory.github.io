all got them what do they do what are
they for and what kinds are there this
is pocket now I'm Joe Levi that's what
we're going to talk about on today's
episode of the android guy weekly so
buried inside your tablet or your phone
is something called a processor or a
core or a system-on-a-chip one of those
all mean well for that we're going to go
back to computer technology and
terminology way back in the day you know
a long time ago in the 90s we had
computers just like we had today they
weren't as fast but they had all the
same parts kind of those parts while I
had a CPU a central processing unit that
thing did well almost everything except
not all that much what it did was it
processed instructions that's all that
it was meant to do people thought it was
really important and indeed it was but
it wasn't as important as they thought
because they had a whole bunch of other
chips on their motherboard you like that
tech jargon up the wazoo in this episode
huh so they had a whole bunch of other
chips they had an ALU an arithmetic
logic unit they had a memory controller
which ironically controls the memory
they had all this other stuff a North
Bridge chip that controlled the top side
and more important parts of the the
motherboard and a South Bridge that
controlled well the lower side and the
less important parts of the motherboard
and all this stuff the peripherals that
plugged into them there were lots and
lots of chips the nice thing about that
is you could customize if you were a
manufacturer what you wanted on your
motherboard so you could really
differentiate you could make a whole
bunch of different stuff and make your
stuff stand out from your competitors
stuff the CPU on the other hand that was
something they said well let the
end-user have a little
bit of control and flexibility and pick
what they want to a certain extent that
worked and that metaphor carries through
even through today well as things
progressed we started getting more and
more stuff on that cpu for example today
we have a CPU that not only has the CPU
on it it has the ALU for processing
arithmetic it has the memory controller
in most cases and some other stuff there
are even multimedia extensions remember
those Pentiums with MMX yeah that's what
that meant nobody really ever knew at
the time but that's what it was for so
we got all this stuff and it's building
it all into one chip well that means
there's less flexibility on the
motherboard side to customize and to add
different features and benefits based on
you know what the Southbridge is and
does or how powerful the ALU is or what
the Northbridge is ah but we kind of
kept the Northbridge in the Southbridge
separate on desktop computers come back
to that in just a minute the advantage
is one chip did a whole bunch of stuff
and it did it faster especially when
you're talking about the memory
controller because you're really pumping
memory in or stuff from the memory into
the processor processing it and then
spitting it back out to the memory out
to the RAM that's pretty much a day in
the life of a cpu with the memory
controller even right next to the CPU
slows things down put it on the CPU Wow
goes really really fast so you've got
cash you've got memory you've got all
this stuff built in and it's really
really good it makes the chips smaller
they're less chips that makes the
overall system less expensive though it
makes that CPU more expensive okay
enough with desktop PCs all right great
we're going to talk about one more thing
but we're going to compare that to where
we are with our Android tablets and
really most of the other smartphones and
tablets out there today you see these
devices these computers that we sit on
our desks are having our laps they're
what's known as sisk chips they're
complex instruction set computing
sounds really really neat doesn't it
okay what about our phones well phones
are based on risk reduced instruction
set computing now the difference is
between those two are all night and day
one is really really wide open you can
do anything you want with it you write
these really complex instruction sets
you send them to the the processor the
processor processes all these complex
things and well the more complex
something is them longer it takes to
process it but it can do it it's
flexible that way risk r is c it's
reduced it's not as complex because of
that it doesn't have to run as quickly
to accomplish the same things but it
pushes the processing of the complexity
over to the code so you have to take
complex code somehow reduce it send that
reduced set over to the processor the
processor thinks about it does whatever
it spits it back out but you can get a
lot better speed out of it as long as
the software that's pre-processing the
complex instructions to reduced
instructions is really efficient it's a
little bit of extra overhead but it has
some advantages so one of the most
popular architectures of RISC processors
is called arm it used to stand for
something but nobody really cares
anymore because it's just ARM arm makes
a design it's about it yes they make
some reference samples but you can't
just really go out and buy an ARM
processor you can buy somebody else's
processors that's based on arm so there
are a lot of different versions of this
arm architecture we're up to version 7
right now I know it's going to get kind
of confusing arm v7 it's where we're at
it's 32 bit honestly almost everybody
uses arm v7 you'd be surprised let me
review this list TI has their omap4 it's
an arm v7 Exynos that's samsung arm v7
snapdragon arm v7 nvidia's tegra it's an
arm v7
v8 it's going to come out sooner or
later it they're making a lot of
progress it's 64 bit it adds a whole
bunch of more stuff that's going to make
things just tons and tons faster but
where are we today we're at arm v7
that's not bad because arm v7 has lots
and lots of different levels inside of
it in fact you're familiar with the
cortex name so we've got the cortex a8
we've got the cortex a15 these are still
v7 arm v7 chips what do they do well
honestly I could devote hours to that
and i'm sure i would put you all to
sleep i don't want to do that you can go
and research what each one of those does
and why it's different and and the
benefits what we're going to talk about
here is more high-level you CTI makes
their omap4 based on the arm v7 and
depending on which omap you're talking
about it includes a different cortex
version of the arm cortex so they're
just a lot of variables and everyone
would get confused and lost really fast
meet probably first but the difference
is between desktops and mobile
processors we're putting even more stuff
on to the mobile processors instead of
just taking a cpu and an ALU and a
memory controller well over here on
these SOC s these systems on a chip
we're putting not only those ok so we've
got the CPU we've got the ALU we've got
the memory controller we're usually also
putting a GPU a graphics processing unit
a video card right on the chip we're
usually putting the Northbridge on the
chip and the Southbridge on the chip
many many many times we're also putting
our cellular antenna processors those
chips on to the CPU the whole system on
a chip now the advantage there is it's
one chip so you'd think that combining
everything onto one chip would make
things easier and simpler well it makes
things smaller it makes things more
power efficient so you need smaller
batteries or your larger batteries can
last longer to run them we won't get
into that argument we've already
that heavenly but the disadvantage is
now you're differentiating based on that
one chip and unlike desktop PCs you
can't simply pull the chip and replace
it with another one wouldn't that be
cool hey you know what I don't like this
a TI OMAP that I have on my phone I want
to go with the Tegra 3 so I'm just going
to pop it off and pop my new wouldn't
that be cool and I have nothing against
TI OMAP by the way just using that as an
example but we can't do that they're
soldered on the board they're buried
underneath circuitry and you just can't
do it so you have to get a new device
that's kind of the other side of that
coin yes you're saving money up front
yes you're putting a lot of stuff into
one package up front but when you want
to upgrade or when you want to change
you have to change the whole thing it's
a system-on-a-chip you got to replace
the whole thing and that unfortunately
means your phone so where does that
leave us every different manufacturer of
processors and other phones is doing
something different but most of them are
using this arm architecture and they're
usually paying about seven cents for
licensing per unit to be able to license
that architecture they're adding their
own stuff to it again this is a
system-on-a-chip and arm is just the cpu
the cortex that's the other stuff that's
added in okay not to be too terribly
confusing there so TI is doing their own
thing they're putting particularly
signal processors because that's what ti
does best in with their SOC s Samsung
Exynos and before that the hummingbird
they're doing all kinds of cool things
with there's the snap dragons need i say
more I mean come on that's what
everybody uses HTC dell sony wow they're
great and then of course nvidia's tegra
which are powering some of our higher
and tablets and some phones do they have
any phones yet I know they were going to
sorry in bed just had a jab at you a
little bit there but everybody is doing
something different but they're all
starting from the same foundation now
when that foundation improves we're
going to see some new cool stuff come
out from all of these different
manufacturers who are just using
furman as the foundation upon which
their building everything else so really
the discussion is more about arm and how
cool it is but because it's this whole
system on a chip thing with all the
extra additives built into it you know
bluetooth for versus bluetooth 2.1 Wi-Fi
n versus Wi-Fi g all that stuff and of
course what what video processor they're
using for graphics that's the cool part
hopefully I've removed some of the cloud
and mystery around CPUs and haven't
added more to it but once we get this
deep it's hard to get really deep
without you know asking more questions
than we answer so did I get your
questions answered about CPUs and
systems on the chip SOC s how they
related where they came from what they
do for us in some of their drawbacks if
I did great give the video a big thumbs
up if I didn't or if you caught
something that I said wrong or would
like to clarify or add more information
perhaps what you like best about your
SOC that's powering your phone or tablet
head over to pocketnow.com leave a
comment let us know participate in the
discussion and help everybody else who
just got lost by everything I just said
understand the concept a little bit
better because i'm sure you can explain
it in a different way that i can that
others might be able to understand
better complex topics but that's one of
the things we like about the android guy
weekly for pocket now i'm joe levi
