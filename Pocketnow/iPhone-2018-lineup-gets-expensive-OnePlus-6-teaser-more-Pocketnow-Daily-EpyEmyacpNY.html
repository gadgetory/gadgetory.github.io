budget-friendly after all with their
next flagship oneplus keeps teasing the
oneplus six as we get closer to a
suppose of launch date we get a new
affordable gaming phone from Xiaomi it's
called the black shark I'm high metal
Iveta and happy Friday the 13th
tell us your horror stories that go
beyond the typical traffic story of your
city
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals I know that
the Google pixels from the last
generation we're horrible they still are
but they're currently on sale for 229
bucks if you're looking for the small
one you go for the XL for 240 bucks I
continue to state that these phones are
they're horrendous but their
capabilities are so awesome I would
highly suggest you consider now let's
talk about Apple as a well iOS 11.3 is
out and we know people are dealing with
display issues but the other thing is
you can now tell if you need a battery
replacement or not so the company is
actually doing a crazy amount of things
to ensure that they'll able be able to
meet the man because for 29 bucks you
can get a new battery and the company is
actually hiring third parties and people
to help out to be able to replace your
battery on the spot when you go to an
Apple store I would highly suggest you
do so let's see how that goes now let's
talk about Xiaomi as the company has
made its black shark gaming smartphone
available you can now get it at JD com
we've got interesting specifications
this is a gaming phone there's a four
thousand milliamp hour battery there's
you know decent specs like 64 gigs of
ROM etcetera etcetera
yeah I said ROM I haven't used that word
in a while but that's the same thing as
storage price tag 480 bucks and this is
significant I mean I don't know how
Xiaomi does this I mean the controller
is just 29 bucks everything as you use
the word it's just because it's so
affordable I can't wait to get it in the
labs and tell you more about what it's
truly capable of because apparently
there's even a button for performance
mode oh yeah
and for those of you wondering about the
oneplus 6 the company has just posted a
teaser where there's a 1 + 5 t and under
it there's the 6 it seems a little
larger and apparently there's this
curve that shows that there's a glass
instead of the aluminum that we
typically see so I'm expecting this
phone to look a lot like the Opel ar-15
pro which I actually like and I know
that I owe you that video I'll get you
that very soon but yeah let's see
exactly what we get Avengers infinity
war that's the date for us to know more
I think we'll keep you posted and
finally the most interesting news is
they have to do with Apple and its
strategy for pricing with the future
iPhones up well we heard many rumors
weeks ago that the company was going to
drop the price of the next iPhone the
R&amp;amp;D was already done so let's you know
not continue killing the iPhone 10 as it
has with the current price but we've got
some trusted sources that are claiming
that know that there is one of these
variants that's at least going to cost
$1100 and the number is not really crazy
because if you think about it the 256
gigabyte iPhone 10 is costing that
amount if not more but then again I
don't know is this smart or not in
today's question let us know what do you
think you think that Apple can continue
playing with these price tags or do you
think that the company needs to be more
aggressive and I know that you're
sensing the sarcasm Apple I think you
need to drop the price come on it's a
phone why are we charging so much money
cost more than your typical computer
that has a ton more hardware that's just
me leave us a comment down below let us
know what you think
I really somebody just turned on their
Harley Davidson it's going just get out
of here with your damn bike man you want
to laugh I ran out of memory card space
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier photos I'm talking about
common script our channel by hitting
this button up here you can watch
