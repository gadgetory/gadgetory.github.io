logo but Alcatel has also shifted its
strategy a bit taking one more step
towards a position in the top 5
smartphone players according to
statements from executives we are here
at the 2016 MWC taking a look at the
all-new idol 4 and 4s smartphones the
idol free from 2015 was a phone we
gladly recommended to anyone who was
looking for a solid mid-range 'r without
spending a lot of money on it
this year the idol 4 and Korres bring an
even more premium looking pair of
devices where glass and aluminum are the
keywords sandwiched between two layers
of glass dragon trail on the back and
Gorilla Glass 3 on the front is an
aluminum frame that will be available in
four colours to suit everyone's needs
gold rose gold dark grey and metal
silver both devices really look and feel
premium and it's nice to see
manufacturers like Alcatel stepping up
their materials and production games
however both have grown in size this
year with the idol for packing a 5.2
inch 1080p display and the 4s with its
5.5 inch quad HD panel
Alcatel positions both of them as
flagship devices for this year well the
company likes to offer options for those
who don't want the more expensive
future-proof model and would maybe go
for or settle for the cheaper less beefy
504 other specs include snapdragon 617
and 652 processors for the 4 and 4s
respectively 16 and 32 gigabytes of
storage options which are expandable
three gigs of ram on both 13 and 16
megapixel shooters for the idol 4 and 4s
alongside android marshmallow on both
out of the box you can of course find
the rest of the specs on pocketnow.com
we're having a hard time figuring out
the main selling point for the two
phones and it's not because they're
lacking one on the contrary there are
too many it could be the dual 3.6 watt
front firing speakers that also fire to
the back one face down it could be the
JBL integration on software and ear
or the boom me up button that takes
everything you do to the next level
let's not forget about the box that
doubles as a VR goggle and we didn't
even mention crazy fast focus times for
a camera and bucket the picture times of
less than a second there's a lot to talk
about when it comes to these phones and
we can't wait to have them in our labs
for the usual review treatment until
then we're both pleasantly surprised and
happy to see Alcatel stepping it up in
every aspect everyone that's it for now
from MWC 2016 I've been an gen denied
and the videos have just started
uploading so we'll see you soon with a
lot more from Barcelona thank you very
much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
