enhancements coming to the iphone
success Apple music won't be charging
the same money for everyone around the
world an LG and HTC sweeten the pot for
those who buy a new flagship in the u.s.
I'm hanging that ivetta and for those of
you that didn't pick up the Wednesday
joke aren't you happy today's Thursday
this is parking out daily the official
news today start with LG and HTC as both
companies want to sweeten the pot in
case you buy their flagship in the u.s.
given the success of the galaxy s6 LG
was given away a free battery and a
microSD card but now they're giving away
a battery and the free leather cover
back which is great the case of HTC even
though it only applies to verizon for
the HTC case you're getting a hundred
dollars on and will play gift card which
is great which one are you picking key
other official news have Microsoft with
a new offering for the surface pro 3 a
product that's already very old but
interesting the company is now offering
an option which is a core i7 model a
gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage for
1,300 bucks and then when you think
about the fact that you could also get
the core i5 model with eight gigs of RAM
and 256 gigs of storage you wonder which
one is better but hey both options are
available for you to pick them great
news for those of you interested in
watching video in high frame rates as
you too has just confirmed that 60
frames per second has now reached mobile
it was launched than the desktop in
October now it's available for iOS and
Android though there are specific
details on what devices can stream and
obviously you need content at 60 frames
per second and if you're wondering if
the pocket now daily will ever go 60
frames per second you tell me you want
to see me moving any faster how about
the iphone 6s we were disappointed with
the leaks of the chassis showing as an
iphone 6 pretty much but we've got new
details on a new Qualcomm chip that the
iphone will be using to power its LTE
apparently we are getting LTE advanced
cat6 for the iphone 6s and there are a
ton of markets that already support it
which is great news other great news is
that this chip is smaller meaning Apple
could bundle a larger battery and give
it the fact that this chip will be more
power efficient there is a lot of good
that may come to this iphone 6s if it
ever happened and finally for the very
interesting official news of the day if
you thought that everybody around the
wall was paying ten dollars for the
Apple music subscription service
actually that's not the case and this is
weird this is not like Apple Apple
usually charges more across the world
but no you'll be paying two dollars for
the service at india three dollars in
Russia five dollars in Brazil which is
crazy and we're wondering if Spotify has
these same deals we do know that it's a
little bit less expensive in Latin
America but not by a significant margin
so it does lead me to the question of
the day how much do you currently pay
for streaming what service do you use I
currently use Spotify ten dollars leave
us a comment down below can't wait to
hear what you listen to you'll be
getting one hundred dollars in a google
play gift card it took me so long to
record this for that stupid siren to
show up now that micro SD card is no
more your be getting your be getting
fucke model for 265 god card with LG and
HTC as bill companies want to swim the
pot in case you buy their galaxy LG and
HTC has built companies want to swing
the pot if you buy their flagships even
the success of the LG this both
companies want to swim the pot in case
you want to buy their alright this is
