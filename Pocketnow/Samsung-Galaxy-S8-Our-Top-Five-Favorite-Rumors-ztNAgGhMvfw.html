and folks were less than a week away
from the official galaxy s eight
announcement there are going to be four
pocket mount editors on the ground in
New York City to cover the event tell
you all about the new flagship phones
with the galaxy branding on them which
means now's as good a time as any to run
down all the rumors what we know what we
don't know and here are our top five
most anticipated features for the galaxy
s a number five that chipset from twenty
fifteen to twenty sixteen we saw a
Qualcomm that was executing much better
in terms of delivering high-end chipsets
for flagship phones we've been killing
it lately with the huawei mate nine in
the p10 the cure and 960 chipset in this
phone very close to the kind of
performance we're expecting from the
Snapdragon 835 and where the s7 was a
snappy little buggers still one of the
fastest camera launchers we've yet
reviewed and no one's going to complain
about having a little extra horsepower
if that can also come with some
efficiency improvements thanks to the
smaller die the die shrink on that
snapdragon part so much the better
number for the new display I was
definitely skeptical when we heard that
LG was going to be moving to a two by
one aspect ratio display but using this
phone for a couple weeks the form factor
has kind of won me over you have more
screen real estate in an overall smaller
shell you got chocolate in my peanut
butter you got peanut butter in my
chocolate that is pretty shocking when
you see how close the g6 is to the
galaxy s7 and that the g6 has more
screen real estate than an iphone 7 plus
knowing that Samsung is going to go to a
five point eight inch display which
again in form factor is only going to be
slightly larger than a galaxy s7 edge is
really compelling but one of the quieter
rumors we hope hands out is also going
to be the revised sub-pixel arrangement
on this new display improved clarity
detail and Christmas and it should also
look a lot better when you pop that
thing into a VR headset if we can't get
a proper 4k display this will be the
next best thing whereas i'm pretty
confident that both models of the essay
are going to feature curved screens so
we'll be curious to see if at some point
we're able to translate that really
pretty aesthetic into something more
rugged like a future galaxy active and
moving to number three get ready for big
speed this one's not a rumor anymore
because Samsung kind
firmed it but get ready for an
additional intelligent layer of software
on top of Google assistant for all of
the AI buzzword enos surrounding
Samsung's announcement of Bigsby it
sounds like what we're going to be
getting is an intelligent software layer
which isn't completely dissimilar from
what Motorola was trying to do back in
the day on the Moto X the Samsung is
going to have custom software running on
top of their phones that allows for a
greater breadth of interaction with
different services and apps according to
Samsung eventually anything that you
might do through touch on your phone you
should be able to also do through voice
will be really curious to see how bixby
evolves over time if Samsung can
encourage developers to get on board
their vision of what a software
assistant should deliver moving to
number two a super slow motion camera
now Sony got the drop on this feature
during mwc showcasing a 960 frame per
second burst mode while shooting video
crazy slow-motion footage if you've got
good light but of course Sony solution
for this probably won't be dropping
until later in the year Samsung's
looking like they're going to be able to
score a victory here getting this
feature into consumers hands first of
course we're hoping to see some other
improvements to Samsung's camera
hardware but the shooter on the s7 and
the SM an edge are still formidable in
this day and age so that's probably
going to be a bit more iterative this
1,000 frames per second burst mode is
probably going to be one of their
highlight features to really impress
upon people that things are cooking so
if you really want to play with time
samsung cameras are going to be the way
to go and considering the editor who's
putting this list together the number
one feature we're hoping to see on a
galaxy s 8 is improved audio Samsung's
business dealings and trying to acquire
audio manufacturer harman have stalled
just a little bit but that doesn't mean
that we can't see some improvement in
audio on samsung hardware both headphone
and feed her performance on the s7 were
mid-pack at best and the common
knowledge was well waterproofing a phone
is going to degrade the audio quality
that that phone can produce which has
recently been disproven not only by the
iphone but also reinforced by the LG G 6
assuming the ultra premium price point
to these galaxies are expected to land
at
should be no compromise devices and it's
not like listening to some kind of audio
the music movies or games isn't a
primary activity for a lot of people who
are walking around with smart phones
these days folks that's our list of the
top five features were most excited to
see on the upcoming Galaxy S a what are
you looking forward to what rumors have
we not covered that you hope to see on
Samsung's next flagship phone battery
recharge rate facial recognition or an
iris scanner maybe even a dual camera
module on the larger s8 what kind of
features do you think Samsung is going
to deliver next week when this phone is
officially announced and what do you
think the pricing is going to be for
this premium tier drop us a comment down
below this video those are the kinds of
conversations I love getting into as
