we're going to take a look at the Palm
Pre which is shown here on the left hand
side but before we do our Hardware tour
we're going to begin with taking a look
at the history of webos on the palm pre
then we're going to do our Hardware tour
and compare the palm pixi to newer
devices such as the motorola droid
running android 2.0 so when it was
released the summer the palm pre were
seen as a nice multitasking device that
competed with the iphone 3gs or the
iphone 3g fom made a great design that
fits comfortably in the hands has a nice
home button that allows you to multitask
and juggle between cards and has a large
3.2 inch capacitive touchscreen that is
in case in a hard plastic the pixi on
the other hand has a screen that is more
like a resistive touchscreen despite its
capacitive nature in that it doesn't
offer a lot of hard plastic protection
and is covered or the LCD is covered by
a softer plastic that gives some flex to
it the pre when it was released has a
webos engine along with energy to allow
you to maintain your contacts and manage
your social networking needs it has a
sliding portrait oriented keyboard which
offers more like a membrane keys because
the keys in / true too much from the top
although it has good tactile feedback
the keyboard on the pre is slightly more
wide than the pixi keyboard and the
biggest complaint with the palm pre is
the build quality it does feel solid and
nice in your hands but does give a
little bit of wobble or flex between the
two sliding mechanism as you see here
the device is an attractive device in
case and in all black glossy plastic and
the pre on the other hand has a nice
front black glossy appearance to it with
a 3 or 2.6 3 inch 320 x 400 pixel
touchscreen compared to the 3.2 320 x
480 half vga capacitive touchscreen on
the palm pre so the
screen is a little bit smaller as the
first complaint with the device
unfortunately palm doesn't make the pre
with out the shortcoming in this body so
you'll have to choose form or function
and we're going to go ahead and cover
some of that in our video today the
device has a very attractive and modern
device with a black slab finish and keys
that protrude out like little islands in
this black of what pool of water the
keys or raised quite a bit offering a
nice touch screen takta or not a nice
tactile feel underneath this nice touch
screen the keyboard is quite a bit more
narrow than the comparable or competing
blackberry bold 9700 keyboard as you can
see here the keyboards are sup have
individually separated keys unlike on
the bold which has a more continuous
contiguous keyboard layout on the palm
pixi you don't have anything on the left
side of the device it is a very clean
device with very few buttons at the top
here you have the power button and also
eight three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack on the right hand side of
the device at the top you have a toggle
switch for the ringer so you can quickly
put it into silent or vibrate or turn on
the ringer when you head in and out of a
classroom or office conference room you
do have volumes up and down and on the
bottom right you do have a micro USB
charging port which is under a magnetic
flap so it automatically pulls itself in
once you release the device that we have
here has a touchstone capable back cover
and it looks like there are two speakers
here but in reality the device only has
one speaker it has a 2 megapixel camera
along with an LED flash in the center
back the touchstone compatible
compatible that cover attaches the
device and charges the device
magnetically to the touchstone charger
here which you can have the device on
portrait or in landscape mode
the touchstone charger is intelligent
enough to sense that when you have a
phone call in the devices connected to
the touchstone charger the device will
actually automatically turn on its
speakerphone function so the first
negative thing about the palm pixi is
that the screen is a little bit smaller
than the palm pre in reality when you're
using the device you don't really notice
that too much but once you get
notifications in the screen shifts up a
little and you do have any notification
bar here at the bottom which is the
webOS you I method of not having
obtrusive pop-up notifications like on
the iPhone the downside is that once
there are notifications coming in the
screen gets scrunched in smaller and you
do realize that you have less screen
real estate when this happens the second
thing is that unlike the palm pre you
don't have Wi-Fi on the device we didn't
find this to be a problem as we found
that Sprint's now network with evdo rev
a was quite fast and ubiquitous where we
are so coverage isn't really a problem
the pixi also issues the palm pre
slender home button for juggling and
managing task which is a hardware button
for a capacitive touch area that is
integrated with the gesture area here on
the bottom so if you have a card open
and where we're going to open the email
card if you tap on the center here
that's glowing right now it minimizes it
down a little so you can open another
card such as a calendar card here and
this way you can juggle and multitask
between different cards the palm pixi
utilizes Qualcomm's 600 megahertz
processor which is the same speed but
does feel a little bit more laggy and
slow on the palm pixi when you're a palm
pre user for new smartphone users they
shouldn't notice too much of a lag and
the palm pixi does a great job where pom
excels is in its email application here
or you do have a unified inbox for all
your accounts but more so than that
email setup is a breeze all you need to
do to set up emails and that includes
gmail AOL and Yahoo
who accounts including you know other
accounts such as corporate and other
imap and obscure email addresses all you
need is your email address and your
password and palm does a great job so
the email experience is very comparable
to the blackberry on bis email service
where email setup is seamless and
painless so you don't need to know all
your ports and different imap protocols
and passwords and SS l's and other
jargon all you need is really your
password and email address and that's
where the palm pixi and the palm
experience shines however when we're
talking about this energy engine which
is a way for you to manage your contacts
and integrate your contacts with your
social media pom needs to catch up to
more current devices like webos for
instance let's pull up Anton's contact
which is currently synced with my google
contacts as well as my facebook clicking
on the facebook doesn't really do
anything except for it just sinks
Anton's picture to his facebook earth
with that is on his facebook account to
my contacts on the motorola droid if you
pull up Anton's contact it takes you and
you tap on his facebook link it actually
takes you to a Facebook page where you
can view his info photos and write on
anton's wall which is more of an
integrated experience and something that
we would like palm to do with the next
revision of webos moreover palm utilizes
a very capable webkit browser which
renders pages pretty quickly and
accurately you do notice a little bit of
missing screen real estate if you're a
palm pre user and have the larger screen
with the 320 x 480 pixels versus at 320
x 400 so you're missing 80 pixels on the
vertical resolution the palm pre and the
palm pixi are not really successors but
really are closely related devices
unfortunately for those who prefer
the tablet form factor with the front
facing qrd palm didn't really utilize
its strength and the pre and port
everything that the pre did so well with
the faster processor larger screen and
Wi-Fi into the pixi rather this is a
device with a lot of trade-offs you do
trade-off you know some of the more
advanced and higher features of the palm
pre for a gorgeous device that is slim
and has a very narrow profile on the
palm pixi however the device at $99
through sprint and palm com or available
for thirty dollars or twenty five
dollars on amazon and let's talk and
walmart is a great value for beginning
smartphone owners thanks for watching
