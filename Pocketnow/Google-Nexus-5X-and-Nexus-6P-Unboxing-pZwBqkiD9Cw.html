and there's more in this box than just
batteries I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is a double unboxing
join us for a first look at the new
Nexus smartphones Google's blueprints
for a perfect Android folks this is just
a quick unboxing to give you a feel for
what it's like to buy these devices and
unpack them by the time this video goes
to press we'll have spent a full weekend
with the new NEX eye and our first
impressions will be up as well be sure
to look for that in video and text form
both here on YouTube and at
pocketnow.com this is the first time
ever that Google is launching two Nexus
smartphones side-by-side so let's start
with the smaller and more familiar of
the two the Nexus 5x built by LG is
essentially a direct sequel to its very
popular Nexus 5 of 2013 in keeping with
the spirit of its minimalistic
predecessor this one comes in our
no-frills white box and the first thing
you notice when you get inside is the
very basic instruction sheet I love this
this just oozes Google there's almost no
written language on it at all yet it
tells you exactly what you need to know
to get started underneath there are very
few surprises here the Nexus 5x is the
less expensive of the two devices and
that's borne out by the lack of any
accessories beyond the basics besides
the phone which we'll get to in a second
and the usual sim tool and warranty
information you've got a wall board and
USB cable the charge current here is
higher than almost any other charger at
3 amps and the cable is both thicker and
reversible due to its new type-c
connector take note that there's no
adapter here which you'll need to
connect this phone to anything using
standard older USB ports to get such an
adapter you need to spend a little more
moolah 120 dollars more to be precise
the Nexus 6p comes to us from hallway
it's the first time the Chinese
manufacturer has built a device for the
Nexus program and it replaces Motorola's
gargantuan Nexus 6 from last year oddly
even though you're spending more money
here the packaging feels cheaper than
the 5 axis instead of a high-end
cardboard wrap the 6p has lamb
paper and under that the capsule-like
box feels much less substantial open it
up and get ready for the deja vu there's
a Spartan instruction sheet a smartphone
wrapped in a protective jacket the same
SIM tool and warranty materials a
similar three amp reversible USB type-c
charger and connector and here's the
difference this time around you do
indeed get an adapter for plugging the
phone into older USB ports we should
mention that Google's also offering some
free google play music and 90 days of it
and it also sent along some protective
cases and a project five sim card which
we're excited to test but for now let's
get to the phones my first impression
when taking the 5 X from its jacket
hello Lumia I have no evidence that LG
took inspiration from Nokia's old
Windows Phone line when designing this
thing but it sure reminds me of a
lighter less metallic version of the old
Lumia 925 like the Nokia's of old this
injection molded polycarbonate feels
tough and high-quality almost soft to
the touch the Nexus 5x is a little
humdrum from the front but actually
quite sleek on the back the two sides
coming together and a crisp seam that
reminds me of two-thirds of an Oreo at
136 grams it's super lightweight but it
feels somehow lighter and once we've
lays it our ways for the initial setup
process for Android marshmallow and it's
5.2 inch LCD we can confirm that the
fingerprint scanner beneath its 12
megapixel camera is lightning quick
providing a nice anchor point for a
finger as well it's like a Moto X dimple
that actually does something after using
it for 20 minutes the Nexus 5x feels
like it's priced exactly right it
doesn't have the premium ID of a
flagship but neither does it feel at all
chintzy the Nexus 6p is a completely
different bag the extra 120 bucks get
you a lot more than a USB adapter where
the 5x is universally rounded and
friendly this phone is sharp metallic
cold to the touch
topped off with a curious visor of a top
hat its panelized aluminum almost
sparkly in the light at 178 grams at sea
Navigant Lemoore massive and the
graphite color of our review unit makes
it look conventional from some angles
and almost menacing from others despite
the strange window surrounding the 12
megapixel camera it's not as odd-looking
as its initial render suggested and its
5.7 inch quad HD AMOLED display is
absolutely gorgeous
the fingerprint sensor here is the same
as on the 5x and just as fast but the
hardware it unlocks access to is
significantly more powerful taken
together this is quite an interesting
pair two smart phones from two different
companies unified by a common design
intent and built for the same purpose--
to showcase the very best of Android
whether they achieve that goal and
whether their phones you should consider
investing in we'll do our best to answer
in pocket now's full review once again

impressions from a full weekend with
