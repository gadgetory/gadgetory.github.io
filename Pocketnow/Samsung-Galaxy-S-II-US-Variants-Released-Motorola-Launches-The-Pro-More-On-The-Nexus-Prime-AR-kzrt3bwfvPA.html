it's hard to keep track of Motorola
launches their Pro Plus and we go deeper
into what we expect from the google
nexus prime all this and more coming up
right now
hello everyone I'm high Meadow be better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's start this week off with what's
hot okay so there are a lot of android
news this week so bear with me here
let's start off with the smartphone
launches and let's start off with samson
that pretty much killed everybody off
with the largest product launch of
devices that we've seen this year first
of all talking about the galaxy s2
lineup we pretty much see that Samsung
just launched the galaxy s2 LTE and
aside from that they also launched the
spring variant of the galaxy s2 which is
going to be called the epic 4g touch and
i don't know why they call phones touch
anymore but it will be rocking a 4.5
inch screen just like the galaxy s2
variant that's coming to t-mobile now
interesting enough AT&amp;amp;T is not launching
a 4.5 inch display device but instead
it's launching a 4.3 inch display device
and verizon's not getting the galaxy s2
device for some reason but we think it
has to do with the nexus prime now out
of there IFA event and it just pretty
much went out of the ordinary because
first of all they launched the Galaxy
Tab 7.7 yet asked why we're talking
about tabs here but the thing is this
Galaxy Tab 7.7 is actually a honeycomb
tablet that's also a phone a humongous
phone and while they also launched the
galaxy s note which is uh well it's a
device that has a 5-inch screen but it
also brings a stylus something we
weren't really expecting from any
carrier or any device manufacturer from
here on the stylist is back in
apparently it's here to stay aside from
that they also launched this galaxy
Wi-Fi 3.6 which is more or less like an
iPod touch it's only a PDA device it
doesn't have the phone but again if you
want a PDA device that's not a phone
this is pretty much your option and well
out of the motorola launches well we got
the Pro Plus which is pretty much like
the droid pro that you saw for verizon
interesting enough this device brings
gsm bands instead of CDMA and its plan
to be launching in europe instead of the
US first and eventually come to you to
the US with some you know us 3g bands
probably for AT&amp;amp;T and most probably
definitely for verizon
aside from that well finally we do get
the rumors confirmed that ATT will be
launching their thrill 4g ass up
September forth so prepare your wallets
for all these launches because we don't
have specific dates for the galaxy s2
devices we are getting hints on way when
they will be released so that is up on
packing.com for full details on one
you'll get them and well-armed an Evan
Blass expert in all leagues foreign and
domestic has just hooked us up with a
lot of more leagues for this week so sit
back relax in here we go the LG
revolution 2 has hit the FCC as a world
phone though it's probably leaked to
release in verizon october 20th and well
it seems to be nice let's see what they
come up with eventually when they do
launch it another interesting thing from
LG is that they're apparently working on
this sort of engine that will enhance to
the opengl graphic games to work on 3ds
so stay tuned for that that'll mean
something really good for gaming on 3d
devices and well by the way we also
caught some images of Walmart's future
catalog for the end of this week where
we do see the LG and lighting for
verizon costing a buck so stay tuned for
that because that could be really good
and while the HTC holiday retail
branding was exposed recently and it
does seem to bring that massive 4.5 inch
screen the dual-core processor and
everything but it seems to change the
name parently will be called the HTC
raider we're not sure if that's going to
be only for AT&amp;amp;T or for the rest of
carriers not really sure what to expect
there and while we also caught images of
the HTC EVO 3d in purple being exclusive
for Best Buy not sure if anybody's going
to like that color but it's there and
well speaking of Motorola rumors have it
the droid bionic will be launching on
September 8 so cross your fingers
because again these are only rumors not
sure what to make of that we also caught
images of the motorola dying eras first
test images of a 9 megapixel camera it
looks blurry does it look perfect but it
could mean that we will get at least the
specs for the camera not sure what to
make of that device yet and while
finally rumors have it that the samsung
prime will be called a samsung droid
prime and we'll start eventually being
sold in verizon as of october though not
really
how that's going to mix with the galaxy
s2 that's not going to be making it
there the most Samsung's also seems to
be working on this multi-touch shed on
messaging tool that'll work between
Samsung devices multi-platform that will
include windows phone probably and will
Android but it's just interesting to see
that Samsung's working on something like
blackberry messenger and also I message
not sure if it's really going to be a
hit because it's only going to work on
samsung devices and well finally ending
Samsung and moving on to other things
Nick casio has just been planning to
bring their world's thinnest smartphone
which is the seven point seven
millimeter device to be released in
America soon though we don't have any
dates for that so there are a lot of
rumors a lot of leaks of devices that
are coming soon so let's see when they
come and we'll try to hit you up with
more leaks and more time lines on one to
expect them and well on our featured
articles for the week make sure you
catch Joe Levi's recent how-to
instructions on how to watch google
videos on rooted smartphones as we
reported earlier and we'll also catch
Brandon's recent explanation of what we
expect for HTC sense 3.5 update that
everybody's been expecting into tony
posted about recently deke Adams also
began his round of motorola photon 4g
review videos so also make sure you
catch on those because it's looking
really nice and while moving on to the
dark side where we feature all things
that are heck related the motorola droid
3 was recently rooted and our man Joe
Levi was nice enough to prepare a
step-by-step instruction on how to get
it done so make sure you hit up on the
link and get your device route if you
want to and well more unlocked
bootloaders are now official for the
variance of the HTC sensation these are
all available on HTC dev com so make
sure you unlock your bootloader if
you're out for doing that
okay so that does it for what's hot
let's continue on with what's not or at
least we think so we recently caught the
family portrait of samsung galaxy s2
variants that will be released on
t-mobile sprint and AT&amp;amp;T but sadly the
most important carrier was missing
Verizon and we're really not sure why
but our biggest assumption is that since
verizon is apparently getting the droid
Prime before everybody else is it seems
that the device will probably be so
similar to the galaxy s2 lineup that
we're not going to be seeing this device
being released and Verizon because there
was no need of having two devices that
were too close to each other now first
of all what sad news here is that the
droid Prime apparently will be just
another galaxy s2 with probably minor
enhancements not really something big to
expect from it but also is the fact that
we could probably see that it'll be
exclusive to verizon and then we're not
going to be seeing this device being
released in other carriers until
probably eventually and we know how much
the Nexus S took to be released in
carriers like sprint so these are
probably sad news not sure what to make
up but we'll probably have answers for
this very soon so stick around and let's
see what we could dig up in the next
week that's a thursday show thank you
very much for watching i'm high metal
you better remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw that's it
for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
