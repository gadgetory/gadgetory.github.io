about WWDC for example all the HTC you
11 reviews are coming out as well and we
have a little guest here from HTC source
Nick gray has joined us in the pocket
now weekly chat room hello to you sir
good day to you and thank you for having
me again it's been a long time it has
been so we needed to remedy that and I
really wish that hewan was here so that
he could lend me his a casual interview
skills but I think I'm going to have to
be straight-laced and focused for this
because we have so the ongoing narrative
arc that I'm getting from the reviews
I've seen is that it's generally
positive for the U 11 but you know we're
straddling between you know g6 territory
here just below g6 territory in terms of
accolades and positive spots so what I
want to get your take because you've
generally been more positive on this on
our favorite son of the tech industry or
the mobile tech industry right well
you'd have to think it because you know
I do write for a circuit or so I am a
little bit biased just a little bit um
but no I mean as many of you guys know
I've written for a handful of different
sites over the years I've reviewed a lot
of the main flagship devices for this
year as well and I've been really
positive about the U 11 simply because
it's actually been a better device for
me than the other flagships that have
come out this year like I'm actually
finishing up my review for the Galaxy s8
right this week shot video for it today
finishing up my script and I know I'm
late on that way late but it is what it
is and it compared to the s8 compared to
the Huawei p10 compared to the g6 I
think the U 11 is
right up there and has you know a couple
advantages over the competition in
specific areas so you know everyone
likes what they like but I don't think
that you eleven is inferior to any of
the flagship devices in any way so I
want to get to those advantages in just
a second but in terms of reviews
definitely check out HTC sources you did
damn good job on that one with the video
and also check out pocket nails of
course
hello I'm Peter bucket definitely quick
yeah i watch the video the other day
yeah yeah how many rivera did it not too
bad job on that so before we get to
talking about advantages there were a
couple of general notes that I've taken
here and that is well let's start with
sense because HTC has a tendency of
letting things sits to enrich you know
go you know over time we saw that with
sense and it's kind of like first
generation where we have that signature
flood clock and the aesthetic that was
all wrapped up in that and we saw that
go on for years and years until the one
f7 which saw a completely new take fresh
flat muted and over time we've seen it
grow into colors and grow into all these
little features such as sense companion
which is supposed to help you out there
about your day and I think we're sort of
at the point where we're asking
ourselves is this is a start getting
stale now because as we see the
marketplace that's all more trending
towards stock or something more bright
or something more colorful I was
wondering what your take on that was
yeah and that was actually one of my
highlights or one of the lowlights from
my review for the HTC u 11 if you pick
up a phone from last year say you pick
up the HTC 10 and you pick up the HTC u
11 there's some underlying differences
in the software build but if you look at
it the software looks
and I'd beg them for that in my review
they were they were on a good course for
a couple years you know moving closer
and closer to stock they were kind of
toning down the HTC sense look and feel
the heaviness that had if you remember
back to the HTC Sensation with sense for
and how heavy that was on top of Android
and just all the animations and all the
gloss and everything like that kind of
reminds us of TouchWiz a couple years
ago as well and they were doing really
good
getting cutting back the unnecessarily
features coming back in unnecessary
bloat but for some reason this year it
seems like they just stopped and they
didn't do anything more they had
actually added on top of it I mean you
you mentioned sense companion which is
their AI assistant that's built in it's
not as far-reaching as some of the other
AI features that you that Bixby wants to
be it's simply a an extra helper to help
you manage your device a little bit
better with a few other suggestions so
it's not overbearing but some of the
things that I what I don't know one of
the things that bugs me so much about
that one too is they give you other
suggestions and they say the weather is
going to be this and there's a little
button that says click to more instead
of opening the weather app on the phone
it loads up accuweather.com within
Chrome because as everyone did you think
you have all these links it with a blink
feed and all that all these promote I
was thinking what what software engineer
thought that was a good idea like you
know none of the software ideas were
well thought out on this device yeah and
I think software I've had a checkered
track record with HTC and software
because back when stagefright was the
big concern we saw HTC one of the first
to jump on that 15-day software frame
for security updates and they've always
been stretching themselves in different
eyes and Google like they've worked with
Google to reduce the blow
and reduce down on native apps but I
mean there has to be some investment on
differentiating items on their on their
side of things in terms of andly at the
very least aesthetic to you because
everyone else is changing HCC hasn't and
it's like there's always like it seems
half-baked yeah I definitely agree yeah
I mean I've never liked Samsung's
software on their devices and I you know
as I said I'm finishing up my review and
I can tell you I adore the software
build that Samsung is using this year
and just compared to what HTC is doing
it's night and day and for me to say
that I enjoy Samsung software more than
HTC's goes means a lot because I'm not a
Samsung fan whatsoever
and even with the slack that bigsby has
taken up everything else about their UI
seems you know more cohesive or at least
more you know attractive and smartly
done there's a message behind it and
there's there's a direction dieted so I
mean yeah and not very HTC's doesn't
have direction it's just they haven't
progressed any we have a proven where
the stop yeah I mean the software is
good it's not that it's bad it's just
feels exactly the same as I did last
year which means to me someone just kind
of gave up like hey we got here and now
we're going to stop so well in terms of
one thing that they have progressed on
it's hardware UI and let's talk let's
talk about that
squeeze feature because it's like I've
been reading up it's also been a love it
or hate it kind of thing now of course
you can activate any two apps that you
want with a softer hard squeeze but by
default it goes to the camera goes to
the shutter and
some people that that's kind of a issue
with especially with a pincher claws
like if you're trying to do this sort of
thing instead of just squeezing
low-light situations especially in the
case where the motion kind of might have
to deal influence that so I mean it's a
good step but I was wondering if you had
experience of the same problems or if
you were able to work around them I
honestly really enjoy the feature I mean
it goes exactly the way I hold the
device I have three fingers on the
left-hand side one finger on the back
and my thumb on the right hand side just
squeeze and it opens up the camera
you're looking at the back side of my
phone right now but if I long squeeze
then it turns on the flash I've had no
issues I know some people don't like it
and it's one of those features where
it's not in the way if you don't want to
use it you can just go to settings and
turn it completely off I've I probably
had 13 to 15 comments on my video review
of the phone people complaining saying
oh my gosh this feature is going to ruin
my life
I don't want it smartphone I can squeeze
and I'm sitting there thinking it's a
feature you turn it off or you turn it
on it's like NFC if you don't want to
use it you don't use it so I think it's
getting a little bit too much attention
for what it is it's not going to
revolutionize the way that you use a
phone a lot of these features you can
get an app that you know if you long
press the volume rocker you can turn on
the camera or something like that you
can already do some of these things with
other devices with different types of
gestures so it's it's not revolutionary
it's unique but I think people are
giving it way too much attention maybe
because he is trying to market it but I
have to be fair it was one of their
the motifs during the whole run up to
its launch and you know it compares like
they talked about it during their press
event in Taipei where they had they
mentioned the prototype video that was
out showed much more advanced features
having blast putting out there and it
was like you could swipe the size with a
capacitive size and you there was a
feeling of that some that they couldn't
produce that in time for today in time
for this year so I because I was at the
launch event in Taipei and I actually
got to talk to some different people
about it and essentially the the video
that leaked there was actually multiple
videos that leaked one of them was kind
of that concept video just showing the
phone with gestures and then there was a
pseudo commercial that came out which
showed kind of the same functionality
but the one with a UI that was
controlled with gestures from the side
and for what I got the feeling was those
were pitched as concepts for the
higher-ups and the company to say hey
there's this type of technology maybe we
can build this and it was it was never
at the point of saying this is the phone
that we are building but kind of this is
what we're going to try to implement and
obviously we know they weren't able to
do it and what we have now is you
squeeze the phone and it turns on some
apps it's nothing like what the video
showed but I think that's kind of what
they're trying to work towards so I
don't know if the technology is not
there now I don't know if the software
is not there now could be a combination
of the two but I got the feeling from a
couple different people that I talked to
that that's it's something that we might
actually see in the future I don't know
if it's one year two years but it could
become it could become but and so until
that point we're left with this and I
think you get worried
I think I'm gonna get I was like -
seeing those videos it is it is but I
you know I was about to go in to the
point where you know us cognoscenti are
kind of spoil
by insight and like leaks like this and
you know it's not it's not really fair
to you know have that in comparison when
judging when editorializing on you know
this kind of stuff especially when the
end consumer has no interest in
sausage-making for all intents and
purposes so yeah well I will say this
everybody that at non people in the
industry and people who don't follow
smartphone news all the time and knew
about whatever h-he was trying to work
on every time I've shown somebody that I
can squeeze my phone and it launches the
camera app from the device being off and
locked they're like oh my gosh that's
amazing
and you know you let them do it you're
like what do you do are there special
you know the some people thought the
site of the phone was had to be rubber
or something for them to squeeze it so
everyone who's seen it in person likes
the concept I don't know they would buy
a phone because of it but it's something
that kind of resonates with users that's
something that nobody else has which is
a good thing for HTC because there's
really no other unique feature that sets
this device apart from whatever else is
on the market right now indeed indeed
let's I do want to get some thoughts on
boomsound on just the whole audio
situation too because that's kind of
complex mix so gloom sounds does I know
in your video you've said that it does
not compare with previous boom sounds
before the HTC 10 but does this
implementation beat out the HTC 10 at
least yeah it definitely does I think
one talked about it as well in his video
it's it's I would say almost double like
I I don't have the equipment he has to
do all the fancy testing but the output
you put them side-by-side and it's night
and day even though the HTC 10 was
probably one of the best phones for you
know on device audio last year
this this steps it up a notch but the
sad thing is it's not that this is
really good it's that everything else is
really bad again I go back I bet for me
the the best one of all of HTC's was the
one m8 that was my favorite one I still
got into my drawer here and I use it as
a little speaker from time to time just
to listen to music just because it is
that good I mean I've got Bluetooth
speakers all over the house but you know
if I just want to turn something on
quick I don't even worry about it I pull
out my m8 and it was that good this is
not that good I think the difference is
you don't have that stereo audio which
you had on previous versions and for me
that's a key difference indeed and there
was also he also a cutout bar the 24-bit
audio like they've cramped down on the
dynamics on it and also there's also the
USB see we're talking about that you
sonic unique set up with the ear
microphones and then the four
microphones on the sides of the device
itself and all that works together to do
active noise cancellation do you have to
have a other pair of noise cancellation
because hauntin and his his usage it
doesn't or excuse me Jaime sent in his
usage that his Sennheiser's did a little
bit better um I it all the guy I don't
mean to put you on the spot with this
because you know it seem like you're
reviewing what's in the box and not yeah
i mean i i've used this with the v-moda
headphones that i'm using right now and
because of the you sonic profile that
you get within box headphones is unique
to your ear the audio quality that comes
out of it is III don't want to it's hard
to say that it's better it's different
and it's different in a way where when
you're putting in earbuds into your ears
you typically feel that the music is
inside your head versus when you put on
you know something over here here
you feel like you're immersed in the
music and what you get with the you
sonic is more of that feeling like it's
not that the music is just jammed into
your ears and you know it's blasting
loud it feels like you're stepping away
from the music a little bit and you're
getting more I don't want to call it
virtual surround sound but it's
something like that I I had to give it
to a friend of mine who does audio stuff
all the time and he said his words were
you get a wider soundstage and I I don't
know particularly what that means in his
world but it kind of goes to what I was
feeling like it's not in your head it's
there and the profile is different so
that if the audio is coming into your
eardrums just a little bit different to
make it sound bigger okay so you
definitely have more of a proper
atmosphere that it at least gets blocked
out with active noise cancellation as
well and all that like I want to wrap
this up into how HCC treats audio it's
legacy in it because we you know boom
sound was their main main line main
trunk of things before they've
differentiated and played around because
there's there are so many brands out
there that are going to be working with
you know Samsung just picked up a Harman
and Apple has Beats and it is like they
did I'm not sure if the way they wanted
to differentiate was you know like I
thought boom sound was enough I thought
I thought that's what that was going to
be the the thing for them and you know I
didn't I don't think you know it's nice
to have active noise-cancelling right in
the in the box but I don't think it was
necessary for HTC to put that in and you
know things moving forward yeah and
that's one of the things like the the so
HTC said multiple times that these were
the first noise cancelling USBC
headphones
and I was just shaking my head I was
like no guys you did this last year with
the HTC 10 and you sold $200 headphones
on your website I forget who who is in
Bellingham they actually sell him still
I think it was a JBL reflect oh yeah
yeah the JBL once and I'm like you're
not the first
JBL made them for you last year but the
difference is like these are really good
headphones if you buy them separately I
think they're 39 or $49 if you need to
buy a replacement but as far as in box
headphones these are probably the best
in box headphones I've ever used besides
the Beats headphones that HTC gave away
with one of the Verizon phones you know
four or five years ago I forget me and I
it could have been the DNA it I can't
remember but they were a hundred and
thirty dollar Beats headphones that came
in the box so other than that I mean
this is if you want a good in the box or
value for your money I definitely think
it's worth it I can definitely say they
are much better than the in box
headphones that are custom tuned that
come with the Samsung Galaxy s8 it makes
those sound like they're you know five
dollar knockoff headphones I mean you
know they have it
it's good to know then that at least
they're playing at least this game
correctly if they're going to be playing
in it at all
so yeah but I mean I'm kind of just so
the one thing that's disappointing with
this all if you pick up the HTC 10 you
can get the same you Sonic profile that
you get with with the U 11 but you have
to do it manually
what HUC did with the u 11 is that the
manual option is no longer available so
with the HTT 10 I can use these v-moda
headphones I have right here and create
the you sonic profile that I want I
cannot do it with the HTC u 11 with the
USB C to 3.5 millimeter headphone dongle
the option is not there and they simply
turned it off I don't know why I don't
know if it's
with a suit future update I actually
need email a couple people at HDC to see
if you know there was a specific reason
why they did which for me that's kind of
disappointing because that was a main
feature with the HTC 10 that you could
create the profile yourself that indeed
sounds dumb and yeah definitely get on
the response back yeah guys know the
Sham please please so I think you know
in terms of all the bashing that I've
done on HTC u11 I think you know it's
still overall good device and the camera
seems to be doing its job properly but
is there any overlooked aspect you think
that has gone relatively unnoticed by US
reviewers um that's hard to say I mean
if you liked what the pixel did with the
camera its using pretty much the same
post-processing to create every single
image so if you liked images from the
pixel you'll definitely like this the
advantage this has is that it does have
optical image stabilization so your
video is going to be smoother than it is
on the pixel it's got that neat
360 audio with audio zoom when you're
recording video I was actually just at
my daughter's piano recital this
afternoon and used that to record some
video you know sitting three rows back
and being able to zoom in and kind of
isolate the audio from you know the
crowd around me and just get her I'm
kind of disappointed with the
front-facing camera I think it's gotten
a lot of praise and a lot of reviews and
I I gave it high marks but I really
liked the optical image stabilization
that HTC had last year with the 10
everyone was pointing back out everyone
wanted oh is back on the front facing
yeah and when when I was there in Taipei
I mean the day before the launch we got
the tour HCC's facilities and we got you
know 15 minutes with the camera team
that worked on the HTC u 11 and that was
one of the things I asked them about you
know I I said you know I really love
that o is why is
not there and they said it I mean they
didn't have a specific response but it
kind of came down to well no one seemed
to care about it and I understood their
thinking I'm like when I recorded video
with that thing I were walking down the
street and it was as smooth as you could
imagine and now I'm looking at this and
I'm like oh gosh it's going to be shaky
and jittery and you know I need my DJI
Osmo Mobile to hold this thing in order
to get smooth video so I don't know but
personally that's me I'm one of those
people who uses you know the
front-facing camera to do video calls
with my family to do things like that
and it means a lot to me but I don't
know how much it means to other people
so that interaction I want to bounce
that over to what we saw in terms of the
whole elevates dealio going up in their
faces because in that react you know I'm
wondering what their feedback loops are
in terms of gathering information and
just you know doing that at least
externally they're saying that they
didn't get feedback that this was an
important feature and then you know
changing things up for the U 11 um so
elevate its this little community that
HTC has gathered up for influencers of
its brand and um so let's talk about
what happened actually because you and I
actually work in this big Twitter mess
thread together uh and if they're people
tweeted me within night 24 hours is
ridiculous
I don't I don't want to even them and so
it's there after the phone arena is a
article about the thing we're in HTC
wanted its members to combat the
negative press especially they claim you
know you know stuff a lot of it is a
UNH's like unsourced or and you know not
relative to what was being seen in
review they have to held it whatnot and
in exchange for you know going in with
positivity and comments about that
they were they had a chance of getting
swag and some people saw that as
astroturfing
and but all in all like what from all of
this from what I've seen in in our
thread here is that HTC has some pretty
caustic fans and I wanted to know you
know in your experiences dealing with
who you know you write about HTC for a
living part of a living at least how
have you dealt your commenters had they
been alright I've been very weird uh
surprisingly you know you would think me
I I started the first HTC blog I went to
to the to the launch event and they
actually brought a lot of influencers to
the launch event there was probably 10
or so english-speaking and then they
brought some from Europe and Asia as
well I would say maybe 30 to 40
influencers part of elevate to the event
and you know meeting them in person you
know everyone's always nice and cordial
and then there's always some people who
are kind of those fanatics of oh my gosh
I love this brand and I will do
everything in my power to make sure this
brand is known and loved so you always
get the tipping of the scales there you
know you get the people I want to say
kind of like me like I'm I'm an HTC fan
but I I think of myself as well-balanced
you know I I'm I love the Android
community as a whole
I recommend phones to people that are
not HTC phones based on what their needs
are because I know everyone likes
different things but there's always
people that will take things to the
extreme so with with what was happening
I think HTC was seeing some negative
comments and you know you've seen them
all everyone's seen these comments of oh
my gosh I would never buy this phone or
it's so hideous you look at that back
and a lot of these people as we know
have never bought this phone aren't even
considering to buy this phone
and probably have not bought a phone in
over a year and a half because they
don't have enough money to buy a phone
and they're just being trolls on the
internet and what HTC elevate was trying
to do they were trying to get their
community out to kind of dissuade some
of these negative comments that were out
there and they were hoping for positive
comments on negative comments but I
think what happened was the the thing
within elevate got leaked out to the
press and so it got put up and it was
kind of pitched in the wrong light
because the wording of what was out
there was saying combat the negative
comments that are out there and so they
were using forceful words against
something that was forceful and as soon
as you do that it becomes a negative
fest and everyone's like oh my gosh
they're trying to create trolls on the
internet and everything like that but I
don't know like I I've gotten negative
so many negative comments on my videos
and people are like oh my gosh is
Samsung paying you and my response to
everybody is do you not know me like I
would never accept Samsung's money just
because I made a negative comments on an
HTC device doesn't mean someone's paying
me and there's always the extremes I
don't know like you get caught up in
something and people are trying to make
it sound like HTC had this big
conspiracy and you know giving people
stuff to support their conspiracy but
HTC does this for pretty much everything
anytime there's a device launch and I
know other manufacturers do as well they
have communities like this and they give
away stickers or give away hats or give
away mugs based on the community members
involvement I think it was blown out of
proportion yeah yeah and especially you
mentioned Samsung it did some shifty
stuff with PR firms and back in a few
years ago in Taiwan so they actually
were fine for that let's not you know
compare apples
oranges but I can understand HTC in
terms of warning to get that first
impression especially when their
marketing dollars just aren't there in
terms of TV in terms of traditional for
that so they wanted to at least do
something online where you never fight
YouTube comments even in 2017 where the
situation has improved you don't fight
YouTube comments so no it's the best you
can do in fighting YouTube comments is
hitting the delete button and even then
it stays on the internet forever so I am
but no I mean so one of these things
though so what a comparison that a lot
of people forget though is HTC was
trying to promote people to spread the
goodwill about the brand they're
worrying about how they were doing it
was could have been better but I have a
friend who works at a cell phone store
and she just got a new LG g6 for free
from her LG sales rep for the region
because she was promoting LG's phones
and sold more LG phones than her other
people in the area so we have store reps
who are being given a $600 phone to help
sell like actively sell versus community
members who are volunteering their time
to maybe get a sticker and where's the
outrage about a sales rep getting a free
phone to promote a specific brand like
you know what's the difference there I
don't you know I mean you know well part
of that is you know it's their job to
sell you other device especially when
when they they're under pressures from
their company and others all OMS that
actually do participate in providing
skips like that so you know you could
say as opposed to you know I understand
that especially in this alternative
faction universe that there's always a
guys being set up to always a facade
and people just don't like the you know
you dated my fakers so or at least the
notion of being paid to express an
opinion when you wouldn't have you know
you would have stayed quiet otherwise
you would have been still supportive but
you wouldn't have made that comment
otherwise so I think there's all mean
there's sides to that that I I'm trying
to tightrope around but you know it's
it's it's definitely a complex issue and
it definitely doesn't help the discourse
that we have already is
you know it doesn't take us anywhere
else is what I'm saying so I don't know
I'm just like how do you do how we're
just general good rules in terms of
actually dealing with you know the
extremes of this um for me you know
starting out a new YouTube channel and
trying to encourage community on the
channel encouraging comments and you get
those attacking comments saying you know
you got paid to write this or you got
paid to say this in the review for me
it's always to remain positive no matter
what trying to we all know this on the
internet and it's so hard to do it
though if you go the negative route
you'll never get yourself out of the
hole it will keep going and keep going
because the first person to post
negative and you're going to reply to
that he's going to make sure he gets the
last word in no matter what and you're
never going to convince somebody to
change their mind and so you know if I
see negative comments I see people
saying that I've you know sold out my
reply is no I've not sold out you know
if it deems a reply sometimes it does
because they're you know a lot of people
are replying to a specific comment you
know just stating you know every opinion
here is mine if you don't like it I'm
perfectly fine with that
and just leave it open on a positive
note rather than
trying to shut things down on a negative
because I don't think that effort works
and I think that's maybe what some of
the HCC elevate members kind of screwed
up on you know they were seeing negative
comments and they were trying to go HCC
wanted them to go post positive comments
but a lot of what we saw was a lot of
negative comments on top of negative
comments which just takes things in an
incredible downward spiral and when you
get the disproportionate you know
outraged about outrage it doesn't help
either so I do what I do ridiculous yeah
indeed indeed I do want to not leave us
in any sort of negative mood so I want
to ask how are you how are you enjoying
your last days of Italy in your last
days of just just being there because
you've you've lived there for the past
year-plus
and you're trading out nice
Mediterranean dancing yes I think that
my days here are limited July 27th we
are heading back to the states we moved
here in October of 2015 for those who
don't know I actually grew up in Italy
once I graduated high school I moved
back to the States
stayed back in the States for 15 years
before coming back here
Italy is wonderful you can't imagine how
good the food is how good culture is a
good life is but where we're gonna be
packing up and heading back our house is
in shambles right now because we're
trying to sell furniture packing up
everything just a little bit crazy
indeed but I think throughout all this
you've been much like HTC in that you
are quietly brilliant and like to thank
you for lending some of that quiet
brilliance over to our show
really appreciate its first going to
week like this thank you
my pleasure thank raveh me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
