the iphone 5 reaches 50 more countries
and rumors have an HTC Titan 3 in the
works I'm Hyneman ravenna wondering what
android 6.0 Auld and this is pocket out
daily so any bets on what the feature
version of android is going to be called
everybody's calling it key lime pie and
even google developer of a new core net
at some point posted a cartoon
confirming it but as expected he would
through the cartoon and not everybody's
calling it key lime pie anymore but
apparently either Google's running out
of pastry names or give me another name
that starts with a que sadly only key
lime pie is available that I know about
so let's see what happens you know the
biggest irony of having windows phone 8
finally support micro is the expansion
is the fact that there is no flagship
windows phone 8 devices out there that
supports it and while rumors have it
that Microsoft is working on a new
version of SkyDrive that will allow you
to play music on it so let's just say
that this is a new way to have your
music elsewhere not on your device
taking up space aside from Xbox music
really not sure how these things are
going to integrate its very early to
know what's going to happen but
hopefully it will be better than what we
currently have as I told you last week
once the iphone 5 goes on lock that's
all downhill from there when it comes to
demand such as the case of the device
now being available in 50 more countries
that's through the month of December
that even includes my country and now
itunes is available in 56 more countries
including movies music and everything so
let's just hope that apple's able to
meet the demand that they're now
offering because it's still in limited
quantities and their releases in these
countries now recent rumors have HTC
working on a new windows phone 8 device
being dubbed the Titan 3n judging by the
fact that the Titan to was launched at
CES last year let's assume that it could
happen next year on 2013 at CES which
happens on January now think about this
if we have the 1x design and we have the
windows phone 8x design what can we
expect about the time three most of us
assume that this will be the variant of
the droid DNA coming to Windows Phone
and let's hope that happens because that
design is awesomely cool
and finally for the hot news of the day
Samson seems to be hard at work with
their new batch of devices for next year
first of all we've got them testing a
new GT 50 100 tablet that seems to be a
smaller version of the galaxy note 10.1
so think about a 7 inch version of the
galaxy note 2 or whatever they're going
to call this thing hopefully it's going
to be as hot they're also working on a
cheaper version of the galaxy note 2
which is something I'd really love to
see they're also working on the galaxy
s4 which is already assumed and
apparently they are also bringing a 13
inch tablet out of nowhere can't imagine
something so big and also obviously
newer versions of their current lineup
so that leads you to the question of the
day which is the perfect size tablet for
you in my particular case i prefer the
7-inch form factor but leave us a
comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow was on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm high
never be better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
