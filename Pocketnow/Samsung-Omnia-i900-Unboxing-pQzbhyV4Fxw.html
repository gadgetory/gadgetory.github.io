pocket now
and today I'm excited to unbox the
Samsung omnia I 900 it's a high-end
windows mobile phone that has a 5
megapixel camera
aw QVGA screen so that's 400 down and
240 across usually QVGA is 320 down to
40 across it also has 16 gigabytes of
internal memory we haven't seen that yet
in a windows mobile device and oh it's
quad band so it works in the US I'm
really excited about this so let's get
going with the unboxing so you got some
accessories really nice box yeah I can
already see it through the bubble wrap
but truly all-in-one phone
hmm how does this open I see it kind of
separates here just the right side
obviously the right side here we are go
back to the device in a minute so we
have some kind of warranty information
getting started card activation guide
comes with a screen protector so that's
good a hook for the lanyard loop behind
the door we have some software yep some
software looks like some earbuds for the
earphone or for the headphones very nice
this particular unit came with a 1
gigabyte microSD card yours may not
here's a battery let's see how big this
is samsung batteries usually don't list
the capacity on the battery so I'll have
to check on that talk about that later
your European charger with Samsung's
proprietary charging jack also used on
the black jack tube and the i7 20 ok so
here are those headphones they're kind
of high-end for for out windows mobile
device have some Chrome on there looks
like they're in ear headphones a
charging cable and last but not least
while there's actually this thing which
is what is this thing I have no idea
what this is it looks like a stylus I'll
have to come back to that later almost
looks like a makeup holder or something
and then we have a an extension for the
headphones so let's let's take a look at
the device
let me zoom in a little bit here take
off this piece of plastic wow this is
beautiful
there are no buttons on the front except
for the call start and end buttons and
we have this kind of trackpad optical
cursor here it's quite thin Wow and the
back has plastic on it as well very high
quality materials used on this I can I
can feel it already we've got some metal
it's not completely plastic let's take a
look at how this compares in size to the
iPhone really curious about that of
course the screen on the iPhone is is
wider they're similar in terms of width
the omnia is a little bit thicker but
not by too much and other devices like
the HTC touch
it's really interesting to see such a
tall screen on a windows mobile device
certainly thinner than the HTC Touch and
finally the big old kaiser 18 t tilt
which is no longer the flagship windows
mobile device as it has been taken over
by higher-end phones like this one in
the diamond and others great so a lot
more to come on the samsung omnia i 900</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
