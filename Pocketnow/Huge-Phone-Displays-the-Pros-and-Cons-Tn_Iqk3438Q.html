dot com or take a look at some of the
pros and cons with big screens on your
smartphone's vs. really small screens
and somewhere in between so let's check
them out first off let's look at some of
the history back in 2003 we had some
pretty big smartphones I mean this is
this is huge it's just thick this is a
big big big and people hated that so
eventually we started going towards
really small screens and dinner devices
and so that's that's where we started
big and then here we have a really small
device this is touch diamond and you can
see how small it is in my hand and
compared to other devices the advantage
of this is it's so small it really fits
nicely in your pocket so this you can
barely feel it is there and having a
small screen means i can touch every
part of the screen really easily with my
thumb so there's not a whole lot of
movement i only have to move it like a
little bit to to reach these different
parts so that's one advantage for
one-handed use it's a lot easier similar
thing with the zune HD here another very
small device has slightly larger screen
and it's very thin very pocketable now
this keyboard it's pretty small but I
can reach each letter pretty easily not
a whole lot of thumb travel but if
you're bouncing around it's going to be
a little bit hard to find the key that
you want so that's a disadvantage to the
small screen now let's look at this
humongous one here's the infuse 4g with
a four-and-a-half inch screen here's
your size comparison now good things
about this way okay as I was saying
great thing about this large screen
device is we can play movies on this and
share with people and people can really
see what's going on
so everybody can see this you could
share it really nicely same with
pictures lots of area to view now a
couple problems with this huge screen is
it can be difficult to reach things now
you think a larger screen makes the
buttons bigger and that's true so these
buttons are really easy to press but
there's so much distance between these
buns so if I want to reach buttons down
here I'm going to scoot down I can reach
those prints those but if I want to
reach something in the notification
trick I got to kind of scoot up like
this see if I'm down here I can't really
reach up there you gotta scoot scoot
scoot now I can reach those and even if
I want to close it I'm going to scoop
back down so that's knowing if you're
trying to use the device one-handed
obviously other people can you know if
you have both hands-free you can do
whatever you want here with your other
finger so that's option a lot of people
probably will do that and nothing is a
pixel density this one's coming down to
207 well this one's a 217 is a slight
difference but you can with this size
screen if you look close you can you can
see some graininess in the pixels of
course all that depends on the
resolution as well so let's look at a
couple others there's a smaller screen
and this I can really easily reach every
part no problems there that's pretty
good size and with the diamond to now
this has a 800 x 600 screen but it's
smaller so we get a better pixel density
less less noticeable pixels there
and I can still reach everything pretty
easily without having to scoop this
one's pretty good to this is the galaxy
s 4g I can reach that it takes a little
bit of stretch this is kind of
stretching the hand but you got a good
bit of range so there's some differences
small screens versus large screens if
you're normally a two-handed user
probably the large screen is going to be
totally fine but if you're more of a
one-handed user or if you have if you
wear tight pants sometimes a smaller
device is going to be better this one is
really going to be noticeable in your
pants in your pocket you might need
special pants for this one so those are
our pros and cons of large screen
devices versus small screen devices hope
you enjoyed this video let us know which
one you prefer which range of size and
that's it for now
you
