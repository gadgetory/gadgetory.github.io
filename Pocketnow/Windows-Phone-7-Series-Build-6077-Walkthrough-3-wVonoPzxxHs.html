pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at all of the
settings for windows phone 7 series now
with this new image for the emulator we
can see a lot more let's take a look so
I'm going to go over to the program list
and first I want to show you something
kind of interesting called system info
here we get a very windows mobile and
that's the the predecessor to Windows
Phone 7 series like task manager sort of
that shows us sort of the the programs
that are using the most cpu programs
that are using the most memory and we
can kind of slide down and see all the
programs that are open right now it's
very much similar to windows mobile
which may mean some good things about
you know porting windows phone 7 series
to windows mobile devices we can tap
over to the left to the right there and
we can do some other things that I don't
really understand like install shell
chrome exit system info about let's see
what happens when we type miscellaneous
details we get some information about
the device in the disk space and the OS
version and things like that so let's go
back to the start screen and go into the
settings and see all the different
things we can do so I believe it's up
here
okay so here it is so we've got two
different kinds of settings general and
application settings so we're going to
start in general and take a look at all
of these different things let's click on
about and you're we're going to notice
something very interesting it says
software windows mobile seven do you
believe that they're still calling it
windows mobile internally which again
jives well for people hoping to be able
to get this to run on current hardware
so it shows us our total storage
available storage we can click on more
info for information on the firmware and
the radio but of course this has no
radio it's just an emulator and then
contoso is just the name of a fake
carrier so we can erase our phone here
we want to factory reset it let's click
back I mean go to phone update and it
says no updates found hopefully with
Windows Phone 7 series Microsoft will be
getting very serious about pushing down
updates to their phones on a regular
basis you know like you get an android
or webos so let's go back to the
previous screen we can go to back up and
there's actually a built in backup
application that probably isn't set up
right now it'll backup call history text
messages I think this is actually
microsoft myphone sort of rebranded so
you can have all of this information
stored up in the cloud very handy to
have on on device backup built right in
let's go back again find my phone again
this is a microsoft my phone feature
that will be built into Windows Phone 7
series we're really excited to see that
feature they are very handy it will ring
your phone if you don't know where it is
so if it's in your couch cushion you go
on to a web interface you press ring my
phone and it will ring it or
alternatively i think it works with gps
you can show you on a map where your
phone is if you left it at a party last
night feedback settings this will also
have that that feedback process and you
can't do anything with that right now i
just clicked on it speech voice control
parently there will be voice recognition
built right into Windows Phone 7 series
Microsoft voice command has some great
technology so you can have your phone
dial people or tell you your next
calendar appointment it looks like
speech is going to be built right into
useful in seven series scroll down we
can go into date and time not much we
can change here 24 hour clock things
like that regional settings we saw that
you can change where you live so it'll
change you know if you have a dollar
sign next to currency we can change the
color scheme and we talked about this in
a previous video we can have the sort of
dark background like you see here which
is perfect for mo LED displays or we're
going to switch it to the the opposite
which is good for a standard LCD backlit
displays and we can change the accent
color from here ring tones and sounds it
says windows phone theme 6.5 which is
kind of funny from here we can turn the
ringer on and off the vibrate on and off
we can change the ringtone and we're
taken to this screen really basic stuff
a lot of this I don't think is done
visually which is why it looks a little
bit ugly so let's go back sound profiles
let's see if that does anything this
setting page is not yet implemented yet
please look for changes in m6 I wonder
what that means ok let's go down a
little bit more airplane mode quite
simply switch it on or off there's only
one setting for that Wi-Fi radio we've
seen that before what you can do is have
it tell you when they find a new network
which will actually use more battery but
it also be more convenient Bluetooth
cellular data add and manage accounts
really one place to come to manage all
of your different accounts and this
graphic definitely isn't final at least
I hope so we can click there and add new
accounts to our device going down a list
we've brightness can change automatic
brightness but that is not working we
can do touch and keyboard that's a
placeholder and phone lock which will
allow us to change the wallpaper on the
lock screen or turn on a password so
that when you unlock your device you
have to enter something ok let's jump
over to applications and this is really
unique because windows mobile typically
has application settings within the
applications they don't sort of group
them all in one spot like you see on the
iPhone and here in Windows Phone 7
series which I kind of like because you
can go in in one screen make adjustments
and call it a day so here we can drill
into email application settings set up
accounts
we can go into the people area we can
tell it how to sort the different people
that you have on your device and then we
can go down the list pictures and camera
we can enable the camera button to wake
up the phone which is handy we have auto
upload to Windows Live a bunch of other
settings I'm sure a lot of this stuff is
not finalized yet but it's cool to see
where Microsoft is going we can go to
messaging SMS delivery confirmation we
can change the SMS phone number radio
all windows phone 7 series devices will
have a built-in FM radio so you can
switch your region to north america
europe or japan going down to phone see
that didn't do anything so that's not
active internet explorer that didn't do
anything ok looks like it's getting a
little bit slow here maybe I'm
overloading it let's go back to phone
and see if that'll do anything I don't
think phone works Internet Explorer Duff
definitely doesn't work but Office
Mobile does work and here we are with
SharePoint so we can hook up to a
corporate sharepoint and be able to
download documents and be able to get
them from your device from the Office
hub which we're going to talk about soon
see if Maps works yep we can turn on
location and we're almost done the list
here we've Bluetooth and we already saw
that games and this is for xbox live so
you can log in with your live ID and put
in your password but this doesn't work
right now because of course this is an
early build of windows phone 7 series so
that was a quick look at the application
settings and the general settings in
Windows Phone 7 series it looks like you
get a fair amount of control and a nice
way to manage and tweak things on
Windows Phone 7 series is generating
which coming up soon we're going to walk
through all of the office applications
and talk about the office hub in Windows
Phone 7 series that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
