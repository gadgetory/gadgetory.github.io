pocket now calm windows phone 7.5 mango
has internet sharing in this video we're
going to check it out on the HTC Titan
let's get to it oh you are alright so
let's take a look we'll go into settings
and we will go down to internet sharing
it's just in the system settings and
we'll simply turn it on now of course
when the spoon comes to AT&amp;amp;T you have to
pay an extra fee for this but the
unlocked version of course is meant to
be used on any carrier and I'm just
going to use the unlimited data plan
here so here's the broadcast name HTC
Titan there's the password so let's
bring out a tablet here and just really
quickly connect let's see how many bars
we have we have full bars let's get an
idea of how fast the connection is going
to be so we're just going to drop down
in the corner here change the wireless
network alright and we're connected
let's run a speed test and see how fast
it is right now we're sharing and the
phone says one guest connected which is
accurate so we'll do the speedtest.net
app here and we'll just see what kind of
speeds were getting obviously they
should be pretty high I tend to get
pretty fast data speeds here new version
no thanks again test and let's see sort
of speeds we get here through the the
tether
okay so not the most impressive speeds
it looks like we're going to get about
700 kilobits per second of course that
could have something to do with the
network connection but hey windows phone
7 internet sharing is finally here with
the mango update and it works just as
easily as any other internet sharing
application so if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and check the
description we've posted the full review
of the HTC Titan the phone with a
monstrous 4.3 sorry 4.7 inch display
very very large indeed got the full
review for you so you can check out our
opinion of this device thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
