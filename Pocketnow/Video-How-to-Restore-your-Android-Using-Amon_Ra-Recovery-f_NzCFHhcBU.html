today I've got just a short little
tutorial video for you you'll see on the
table in front of me is my google nexus
one now what i did in a previous video
is I loaded up a custom rom on this
phone it is unlocked so I can do all
kinds of cool stuff like that but now I
want to go back in time I want to
restore a backup that I made earlier to
do that I have to boot up into recovery
mode so i hold down the down volume
button and the power button at the same
time and I let go of the power button
and you'll notice here is my bootloader
and in just a minute it's going to flash
with another little menu there you go
and I'm going to use my down volume to
select recovery and press power to
select that's going to reboot the phone
into recovery mode that'll take a minute
so i'll be right back alright we are up
in the end Royd system recovery this is
the rod nexus one point seven and what
we're going to do is we're going to go
down and select backup and restore
important part to remember about
restoring a backup is you have to have
backed up first if not you don't have
anything to restore from so we're going
to go ahead and select backup restore i
know i've already restored I've already
backed up before and I've already
restored from this back up as well so
we're just going to come down here and
dune and restore in here we've got two
different restore files that are kind of
cryptically named we're going to choose
the latter of the two alright so I
selected that bottom option and now I
have all of these different backups to
choose from kind of has your date in it
if you can look right here so you can
zoom in okay that bottom one says that
it's 20 100
Oh for 24 with some other stuff after it
now i happen to know that it is 2010 and
it is april the 24th and i've only done
one back up to date so that's the one I
want I'm going to go ahead and select
that one it says hey are you sure you
want to restore this press the trackball
to confirm so I'll do that and it starts
restoring now a restoration is going to
take generally speaking about as long as
your initial backup took sometimes a
little bit longer in my case that was
about eight minutes so I'm expecting it
to take about the same here you do have
the little buttons across the bottom the
little dots here to show you the restore
process so you don't have to watch dots
I'll let it finish and I'll be right
back okay just about five minutes after
you'll notice down at the bottom it says
my restore is complete and i'm back at
my backup and restore menu i'm going to
press the volume down button to go back
to the main menu and then that's my root
system recovery menu i'm going to select
the first option which is reboot system
now and it tells me that it's rebooting
and it should come back up with my
unlock nexus one boot screen which is
what it's doing right now now just like
installing a custom rom restoring from a
backup is pretty first boot intensive so
this first boot is going to take some
amount of time you should plan on it
being anywhere between 15 and 20 minutes
the first time it's probably going to be
less than that but don't be concerned if
it does run into the 15 minute range
that's entirely within the normal amount
of times you could expect to wait I
don't want you to wait that long so
we'll be right back
okay and just like that the boot has
completed and I am at my stock nexus one
boot screen or lock screen rather i'm
running the cyanogenmod rom on it and
can come over to the CM updater we'll
just run a quick check and see if Steve
Kondik is updated from 5.6 and one and
it turns out no he has not put out any
updates since the last time I did it but
just that easy now i'm back at the ROM
that I installed before the one that I
have customized the one you can even see
I've got my calendar on here I've got
all of my widget set up the way that I
want them to be even got a nice picture
of my dad and my brother as my wallpaper
so we're all good to go I tried out a
new rom decided I wanted to go back and
did that all in about half an hour's
time I would highly recommend that you
do this even if you don't plan on
updating to new roms every so often
whenever you do a major update or
preferably before you do a major update
like installing a whole bunch of apps or
removing a whole bunch and especially
before you update to a new rom or try an
entirely different rom on your phone
reboot up into that recovery console and
then into your special recovery rom and
run a nand backup i'd recommend doing it
about every week or so it doesn't take
too much time to run the backup it
doesn't take too much time to restore
from it take substantially less time to
do either or both of those than it does
to revert back to factory and custom
configure everything on your phone again
so this has been a android tip from joe
