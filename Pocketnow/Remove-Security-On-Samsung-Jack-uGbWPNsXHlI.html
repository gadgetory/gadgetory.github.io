pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to show you how to remove the
security so you can enable internet
sharing and other programs on your
samsung jack so i'm going to show you
that i hard reset the device and give
you a little demonstration of how
internet sharing will not work now over
media net so as you can see we can't
scroll down and select the media net and
this particular device has a two-tier
securities so it's going to take a few
steps to remove the security on this
windows mobile device so just go back to
the start page and i'll show you from
the computer and you'll need to install
a cab file and i'll post a link of
pocketnow.com as to how to get this so
now you want to connect your Samsung
Jack with the USB cable to your PC so
that you can sync files onto your
samsung jack and you can either use
activesync or windows mobile device
center for vista or windows seven so
here we have windows mobile device
center says it's connected so I'm just
going to minimize this and from that cab
file i said to download it's called
clear security and we're actually going
to open up our computer and move the
file onto our samsung jack so just find
a place where you'd like it i'm just
going to choose my documents maybe in my
sounds or something like that so i'm
just going to move it over we'll just
take a second to copy so it's not very
big and and now you want to install this
clear security from your samsung jack so
i'll show you that okay so now we're
going to install the clear security cab
file so i'm just going to click on start
i'm going to go down to applications go
to a file explorer and go to my
documents wherever that is and wherever
you place the file at and I place it in
my sound so i'm just gonna click on that
and install the cab file and it will ask
me if I want to confirm this
installation I'll click yes and it
should only take a second to install and
once that is done will actually begin
the process of removing this
on this device and it says it's
successful and was click done okay so
now I'm going to show you how to remove
the security from your samsung jack
using security configuration manager and
that's a microsoft download and i'll
just post a link i'm talking out of
comments how to get that so as you can
see with the device connected we're
actually going to use security
configuration manager to turn the
security off and it may state the
security is off already but it doesn't
allow you to edit the registry still so
we're going to provision this and it's
going to install a cap file to your one
to the samsung jack you might have to
look on your device and it will say that
a tool cab was successfully installed on
your device so then just click done and
now it will allow you to change the
registry so we can close this okay so to
enable internet sharing after our
security is all off on the samsung jack
will need to use a registry editor
program and i'm just using mobile
registry editor and i'll post a link how
to get this and you can also use total
commander whichever one you choose and
so you'll want to start by going to
local machine and expand that it'll
connect to the device go down to calm
expand that one go down to internet
sharing and click on settings now from
here you want to force cell connection
to see this for cell connection you'll
want to actually right click and delete
this it will ask you if you want to
delete that and you'll just click yes
and now it's deleted and i'll show you
back on the samsung jack that you can
actually use internet sharing through
media net okay so back on our jack will
want to click on start go to internet
sharing and as you can see it says
disconnected and we can choose either
USB or bluetooth i'm going to choose USB
because it charges the device at the
same time and now we have a couple more
network connections this wasn't here
before we have AT&amp;amp;T isp media net and
AT&amp;amp;T ims and you'll actually want to
choose media net because that's the high
speed internet that will allow you to
tether your jack to your pc so that you
can share the internet so we're just
going to click on connect go up here
wait for it to sync with the pc
and now it says connected so now we can
share the internet from our samsung jack
to our so this is how you remove the
security from the samsung jack so you
can use third-party software and enable
internet sharing to use media net and i
will post a link with all the downloads
