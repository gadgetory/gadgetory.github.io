pocketnow.com the wars for e-reading has
just picked up with the release of the
Google eBookstore
and the Google Books application for
Android and for iOS devices in this
video we're going to compare the Google
Books application for Android with the
Kindle application for Android and talk
a little bit about this new entrant into
the e-book reader space let's get to it
so right now a lot of choices if you
want to download or buy a book and read
it on multiple devices you have the
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook store you can get an
application for your smartphone you can
buy a nook at the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble store
or online among other things the Kindle
application store takes that to the next
level you can read it in web browsers
you can read it on Mac of PC you can
read it on pretty much any smartphone
that is out there and and Google's
aiming to take a similar approach
although they're opening it a little bit
more so not only can you read books that
you buy through Google Books in your web
browser on your Android phone or your
iPhone but you can also read your google
books on the Sony e-reader and the
Barnes and Noble Nook because of the
format's that they can support however
you cannot read Google ebooks on the
Amazon Kindle but although as mentioned
the Amazon Kindle has pretty much all of
their bases covered if you buy a book
you can read it on really any device so
let's talk about the books interface and
we're looking at this on the Samsung
Galaxy Tab right now but of course it'll
look about the same on any Android phone
it's a free application it's very simple
and here we have our library and we can
go into landscape from here a nice
simple and clean interface shows you the
front covers of the books it is
preloaded with some titles like Alice in
Wonderland so let's go into that and
we'll see what it looks like to read a
book now right now we have it set to
night theme and there's a lot of viewing
options here if we go to settings we can
turn on the day theme make the text
bigger change the font depending on what
you like
change the text justification if we go
back it'll change it and just like the
Kindle application just like the Nook
application you flick to turn pages it's
a very
we can go into landscape and we'll get a
should get a wider view perhaps we're
locked into a portrait view it's just a
very similar reading experience and of
course from the application you can buy
books but it's going to push you onto
the web so if we click get ebooks it's
going to bring you to the Google Books
books website which ties in nicely to
your Google account so we can scroll
down here and see all of these books you
can see the prices there and it will
work through Google Checkout and of
course these prices are pretty much the
same that you're gonna find in Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble e-reader store and the Kindle
Store let's say we want to get a sample
of this book we click get sample and
boom it says the sample is now in your
library read now it jumps you right back
into the Google Books application and
boom you are on page one within seconds
reading the sample very nice let's go
back because there are some settings in
this library if we go to the menu button
and click on manage ebooks this will
show you all of the ebooks associated
with your Google account you can Trash
them from the cloud or you can actually
buy them within this screen so very
quickly you can say oh I've been reading
these three books two of them I want to
buy and actually read instead of just
look through the sample let's go back
and see the other settings we can choose
so here's the the books the diversion
location where to store your books you
can actually store it on the SD card of
your phone and just like the Amazon
Kindle application you can have books
that are stored in the cloud or archived
as they're called in the Kindle
application and then books that are
stored on your device for easy reading
that is why if we go back to this screen
manage ebooks if I were to pin now I can
read the book while I'm offline so it's
actually going to download it directly
to my device within seconds so a very
robust reading experience it's actually
extremely similar to what you get on
Kindle so here in Kindle if I go to
archived items this will show me all of
the books that I've read that are
hanging out in the cloud and any of
these books I can tap and they will
download to my library and it says
download selected items it will sync the
page
and I last read just like good the
Google bookstore was so very similar
experiences now what happens if we want
to buy a book here now that gets a
little bit different so if we go down to
the menu button we go to Kindle Store
it's gonna drop us into the Kindle
interface which doesn't always keeps us
logged in it's a shame that there's no
built-in bookstore within the
application so of course from here we
can go to New York Times bestsellers we
can click on a book and again these are
about the same prices that you'll see
and we can try a sample and that's gonna
ask you to login but it's really only
one time so in terms of which of these
applications is better the books
application or the Kindle application
I'd say the books application has better
integration with the cloud which is
better that said if you have been using
the Kindle ecosystem all along you
probably don't want to start on
something new if you've been in the no
Kiko system you probably don't want to
start on something new but if you
haven't yet gotten into e-reading yet
and you plan to buy books and you want
to read them on your smartphone and your
tablet and everything Google ebooks may
be the best way to go because it's we're
going to work with the most amount of
devices and the prices are are very
similar to what you get with you within
the Kindle and the Nook store so the
Google Books application is quite good
you should try it out especially if you
haven't yet made a decision on which
bookstore you want to be a part of if
you want to read books digitally if you
liked this video please give it a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
