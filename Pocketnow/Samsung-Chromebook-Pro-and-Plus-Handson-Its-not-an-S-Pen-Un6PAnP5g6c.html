Samsung Chromebook with an S Pen
Chromebooks aren't really up our alley
but we just found it here at CES 2017
even if it's not what we were really
expecting I'm hey my event with pocket
now and this is the Chromebook pro and
Chromebook plus
first of all let's clarify some
specifics yes this does look like an S
Pen and it clicks like an S Pen but it's
actually not the same technology it
seems Samsung is dubbing at the
digitizer pen and it lacks the side
button that we remember from the s-pen
even if the tip is identical though once
you try to use it the glide isn't really
as smooth as what we remember from the
defunct Galaxy Note 7 still it will help
you with basic note-taking in addition
to some minor features included still if
we focused on the overall package you
really get a very nice product with this
Chromebook pro and Chromebook plus we've
got a full metal construction that's
actually very light it has the advantage
of being able to completely flip in case
you want to use it in tent mode or as a
full tablet where the keyboard becomes
inactive speaking of the keyboard we've
got no compromise on its size and the
trackpad is also quite comfortable there
are two USB C ports on the sides for
both peripherals in charging and we've
even got a micro SD card for extra
expansion with the Ferengi eights the
pro from the plus is that the pro rocks
and until Core m3 processor versus the
standard ARM chip atomic plus variant
but in everything else we've got the
same four gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of
storage the screen is a 12 inch quad HD
display with a very interesting 3 by 2
aspect ratio and we're running on the
latest version of Chrome OS meaning you
can even run touch space Android
applications from the Google Play Store
without the only tough selling point is
the starting price of $449 but I will
admit that I really like what I see even
for the price tag just remember this is
pretty much just the Chromebook we've
got more coverage of CES 2017 so make
