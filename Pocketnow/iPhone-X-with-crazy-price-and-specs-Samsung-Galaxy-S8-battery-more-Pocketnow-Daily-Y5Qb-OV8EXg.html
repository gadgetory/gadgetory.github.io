capabilities and a crazy price tag might
be in the works
Samsung is reportedly going to play it
safe for the batteries of the galaxy s 8
and then ot s6e to self Bachelet hmd and
oka can handle i'm hi mary that i and
whoever came up with the idea of mixing
Mario card with Star Wars as genius this
is pocket out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market for a new smartphone the
BlackBerry detect 50 any tech 6p have
always been good options mainly because
they look identical to the Alcatel idol
smartphones that we love second because
obviously they bring the BlackBerry mojo
so for those of you in the market
they're currently $50 off each for
Valentine's Days so you can learn one
link in the description now let's talk
about LG a lot of people join me in
saying that the LG watch sport is
probably not one of the prettiest things
they've seen and for those of you that
ended up complaining over the fact those
bands are non replaceable and please so
Ian's if you're building a sports watch
you understand that band is going to get
destroyed but it turns out that the
reason why these bands are fixed to the
SmartWatch is because the antennas are
there so for those of you that we're
thinking that the fact that that
SmartWatch is huge was it enough it
seems that the bands were needed for the
design too sadly now how about if we
talk about the nokia 6 that smartphone
that's currently only available in China
there were some complaints that people
were claiming that hmd was doing flash
sales and that was the reason why there
was no inventory but turns out that HMV
just confirmed the phone out sells so
quickly that the company is having real
trouble in being able to meet demand so
I guess that's the reason why it's only
selling in China let's see what happens
with the future of nokia now let's hold
the spotlight over to Samsung the Galaxy
s8 for those of you wondering what will
happen to the batteries of these phones
specifically with everything that
happened with the note 7 turns out that
apparently Samsung is going to play it
safe meaning the galaxy s 8 in its
regular size is currently going to bring
the same 3000 milliamp hour battery and
then in the case of the larger variant
verily it's going to drop 100 milliamp
hours compared to the
seven edge Carly it's only going to be
3500 like the galaxy note 7 so let's
hope they figure it out mainly with
battery consumption and finally the very
hot news today if we could call them
that way are the rumors that have to do
with the iPhone 8 or iPhone X we're
talking about the no holds bar taking
your anniversary eyes on this being
rumoured apparently Apple is going to
play a card here with a price tag it's
going to be a $1000 smartphone and don't
raise your eyebrows too much if you buy
an iPhone 7 plus right now and it's 256
gig variation that's pretty much what
you're paying for it then that's before
taxes actually so think about it
apparently the list of reasons why this
tone is going to cost so much is
significant
starting with the older display that's
apparently rare in a second thing it's
apparently going to bring this new
facial recognition technology dual
cameras at the front that enable this
phone to be able to recognize your face
in ways that a retina scanner can't and
I don't know how that can be any better
but hey the list is long as you learn
more than like a description and let us
know in the comments down below what do
you think are you willing to pay $1,000
for this iPhone 10-year anniversary
variant in my case I've learned my
lesson with Apple I am NOT spending a
dime on first-generation products
anymore and this sounds like too much of
an experiment leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion

video was filmed follow what I'm talking
