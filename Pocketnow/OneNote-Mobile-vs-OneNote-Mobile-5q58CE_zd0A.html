com we're going to take a quick
comparison between OneNote mobile on
windows phone 7 and OneNote mobile on
Apple's iOS so let's check them out
first off let's look at iOS so here's
one note mobile for the iphone ipad ipod
whatever and once you log in with your
live ID it's going to download all of
the OneNote notebooks that you synced
with SkyDrive already so they show up
right here really nicely you got
recently viewed ones unfiled ones are
right there and you got no really nice
structure here down here you always have
the quick note button got a camera
button so pretty good here and you can
easily drill down and find some
different notes and sometimes they get
different colors so that's pretty cool
you can't rearrange any of these and
deleting them is kind of tricky just
good guys slide it so I can create a
note
you gotta do is slide to show the delete
button now on windows phone 7 OneNote is
really integrated into the office hub so
let's just go back for a second there's
our office hub we get to OneNote now you
would think that since Windows Phone 7
has a live ID associated with the whole
operating system everything would just
show up right away and you get all your
notebooks from Sky Drive that just come
down but that doesn't happen you get to
default notes and then you have to set
up sinking manually and to do that it's
pretty much the same as how you do it on
the desktop OneNote you got to go to
SkyDrive on the web browser you've got
to browse to your notebooks and then go
to tap on it and then you gotta tap on
it again once it loads so you have to do
this for each notebook that you've
already set up on SkyDrive so if I tap
it again now it's going to say opening
notebook and that's going to download it
and set up a sink so now they're all in
here now you can notice where are we
some of them do not sync correctly like
this one is passwords this one is
password protected in one note on the
desktop it's not going to be able to
sync to Windows Phone 7 see it says that
right there and it's going to tell you
that's not going to happen okay now you
can also 10 have some really cool
integration here we can I can pin it so
I can put notes that i'm using
frequently or recently right there on
the Start screen which is it really
handy I don't have to go in
and browse and find it so there you go
next let's look at how notes appear
after they've been synced but first
let's see how it looks in real one note
so here's my test note and I have some
embedded documents there maybe I can
zoom in a little bit there's a Word
Excel PowerPoint PDF there I have a
little table here's a check boxes do
this do this too we have a numbered list
bulleted list hyperlinks there's some
handwriting recognition here's a video
video attachment recorded in OneNote
2010 there's an audio one as a screen
clipping just the picture regular and
there's an equation and some shape
drawings so let's see how that appears
on which one Windows Phone ok so if I
open that one here we see the title we
see some broken picture boxes here's the
embedded documents and these I can if I
can tap it correctly open so there's a
word document and all those will open
here's a table see that came just fine
these are checkboxes but they don't show
up I don't have checkboxes on Windows
Phone 7 numbered lists the littlest
those look good hyperlink to another one
note page does not work pepper link to
website does work
so there goes web page and this is some
ink handwriting doesn't appear can't
read that here's our video recording
note I tap it just right we can open it
and that plays just fine same with the
audio note I can open those I'm just
going to play screen clipping works good
where do we go you can zoom to read it
but it's a kind of low resolution
compared to what it is really and here's
an equation which is broken handshape
drives are not there in terms of editing
what you can do here you can type stuff
you can insert an audio recording or
picture we can do lists it's a numeric
list I can also do bulleted list
and we can do some formatting just a
little bit bold italic highlight
inserting the picture it's just a matter
doing this
and so it's in there
now let's look at iOS the same note
here's my same notes called test
so here see there's the title these are
embedded documents none of them work it
just says embedded file this is a table
that doesn't work either it just says
table so I lost that data right there
these are checkboxes we do have
checkboxes in iOS this numbered list
doesn't work bulleted list does work
hyperlinks are mess these you can't
click on them there they just show up as
URLs and got weird boxes there ink and
writing just shows up as the word ink
here's my video recording again nothing
just as embedded file audio recording
same thing screen clipping does show we
have pictures equations and shape
drawings do not show now in terms of
editing you can type stuff we can insert
checkboxes we can do bulleted lists and
we can insert a picture
so that's about it for editing and those
are the differences between iOS with
OneNote mobile and Windows Phone 7 is
one not mobile pretty different but
there you go hope you enjoyed this video
feel free to comment about these
differences and decide which one's
better and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
