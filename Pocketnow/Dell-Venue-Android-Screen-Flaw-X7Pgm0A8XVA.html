pocketnow.com and i want to talk about a
flaw we're going to talk more about this
in the review of the dell venues screen
let's show you okay so I'm calling this
a flawed because the dell venue pro has
the exact same screen which is a four
point in one inch AMOLED screen did not
have the same problem so here on the
venue we've got this beautiful curved
glass to supply its gorilla glass screen
sensitivity is great but there's a big
problem with it so if we turn on the
screen unlock the device as you can see
I've put launcher pro here instead of
the dell stage you I think it looks a
little bit nicer but we're not here to
see that let's go to somewhere where
there's white on the screen so here's a
browser page right when you're looking
head on to the screen it looks fine
right but when you turn it a little bit
it becomes green wow that is so weird
and it works both ways it even works
vertically and horizontally so if we
tilt it this way it becomes green and if
you go this way it becomes green it's
very clear it's coming through
beautifully on the camera this isn't
that big of a deal since when you use
your phone you're using it head-on but
if you're sharing pictures of somebody
or anything collaborative people are
going to say hey why is everything
tinted with a green color looks kind of
gross doesn't it so kind of strange
hopefully this is a problem specific to
this unit we're going to do a little bit
of research will have an outcome in the
review coming up on pocket now calm with
full benchmarks battery tests and
everything else you want to know about
the dell venue that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
