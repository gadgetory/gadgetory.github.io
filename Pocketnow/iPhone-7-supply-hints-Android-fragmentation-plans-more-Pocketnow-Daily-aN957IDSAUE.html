button that's here to stay ipad pro
release states might take a little
longer than expected and it seems that a
company just figured out how to add
range to a dumb watch I'm hi Mary vetta
and I will be out all of next week
expect the parking out that leads return
as of October 18th this is parking out
daily official news today began with
Apple as the company has just painted a
very nifty panic button using touch ID
and the way this works is that you would
trigger that panic button through one
specific finger that you rarely used to
operate touch ID and what the phone will
do is automatically lock the information
that's personal to you from your phone
obviously if the burglar would ask you
to you know unlock your phone then he
can take your phone your information is
not available to him within the phone
will call for help in addition to take
photos of the burglar and then send them
to iCloud so this is a really nifty
feature we just hope it becomes official
soon and for those of you that are still
rocking a KitKat android smartphone we
hear you it's a tough world out there I
know friends that are still on jelly
bean and ice cream sandwich but
apparently google wants to end
fragmentation by helping chip makers
apparently the company will somehow help
the design of chip makers like Qualcomm
and Media Tech and others in a way that
these companies can comply with a
minimum standard that can help other
OEMs be able to update their smartphones
early and not just have to make you wait
but we sometimes wonder if this is not
deliberate from OEMs just to be able to
get more phone sold and for those of you
that are waiting for an iphone 7 without
a home button think again it seems that
Apple has already begun ordering
supplies for it believe it or not and
the drivers are from synaptics for the
display meaning that Apple is not ready
with its proprietary display drivers to
be able to pull off there's a home
button list iphone where you can just
unlock your phone by tapping on the
display now it could also be that Apple
is actually ordering stuff for the
iphone mini that's being rumored because
hey that one's rumored for early next
year and not later but then again we'll
know sooner rather than later and even
though analysts are not really crazy
about the ipad
Pro we do know that there are some
people out there that are interested and
if you are in the market for one
apparently it will not be available on
November 11 for reasons we still don't
understand that will hasn't even
provided an official date apparently it
will happen until November 13 and we
would love to know in the comments if
you are getting one and finally the hot
news today have to do with the Chronos
wearables they just built the product
called Chronos and this is genius what
they've done is they've built a coin
that can attach magnetically to any
current watch any dumb watch either
magnetically or through adhesion and
what you get here is an accelerometer a
vibrating motor you get bluetooth 4.0 in
addition to other sensors that will
allow any watch to become a fitness
watch in a way it'll track your data in
addition to serving as a SmartWatch
because it has some LEDs that will shine
on your wrist to show you that you have
notifications obviously this is not
perfect and this product is going to
cost $99 so it's a pretty steep price
but we would love to know in the
question of today what do you think
about this product would you love to
keep your current watch and just fire
Kronos or you rather pay a little more
money and buy yourself a SmartWatch in
my case I think that this product does
have a future for those of you that are
wearing a Rolex for example but leave us
a comment down below I'd love to know
what you do friends as always you know
the drill if you want to get the news
