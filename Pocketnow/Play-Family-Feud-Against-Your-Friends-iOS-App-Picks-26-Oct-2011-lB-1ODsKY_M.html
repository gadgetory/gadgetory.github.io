pocketnow.com and this is another
episode of the Iowas appcake summit
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it
Dora is a free internet radio program
available on the App Store that allows
you to play music over the Internet
based upon what kind of channels and
what kind of ride artists you like so
here if I wanted to go to Muse radio
I'll do is click on here and it will
begin playing songs based upon my
preferences so now we'll play this song
I can also like it or dislike it if I
want to skip to this song I've just
clear on here and it will move to the
next song based upon how many times I
can do that in an hour
to add a new radio station option is
going on here search for a song artist
or composer
buh-buh-bah is a free application
available on the App Store that allows
you to find things that are nearby so
let's say I was to find something let's
try to find something to do in my
vicinity I'll just click on there it
will begin searching so if I wanted to
try this wildwood part that looks pretty
interesting we can just click on there
now I can get a map I can also get the
phone number and if I wanted even create
a postcard with a photo from that
attraction lemon is a free application
of L on the App Store those are just
scan your receipts and save them to your
lemon account so here if I will have
just click on here to scan a receipt and
I can match up the edges so now I have
that Racine saved for future references
and the event that I need to return
something I can also change the category
by going down here and I show exactly
what I've used to pay for it so just hit
confirm and we can search for reports by
clicking down here and selecting a time
period family feud and friends is a free
game available on the App Store the
allows you to play family feud against
your friends over Facebook and it so the
office - the game is - I go through
these surveys and guess the answers
based upon the top answers on the board
so on this level I was to name a state
where disaster could strike at any time
and I was able to get all of these
answers on the first three so I was able
to get 78 points and my opponent was
able to get 81
points and the game continues on like
this until someone has won Wikipedia
mobile is a free application veil in the
App Store the allows you to go through
the entire Wikipedia webpage on your iOS
device so here we can search for
something let's search for I don't know
something pretty simple like gold so
here I'll bring up the entire article
for gold so I can be the periodic table
no show me where gold is I can do a
photo of the gold and also view how
various properties about gold so they go
down here it will give me a little
description and it can also be more
information about gold so this has been
another episode of iOS at pics and if
you like our videos make sure you give
us a thumbs up and also leave some
comments down below to get the download
information for all these applications
