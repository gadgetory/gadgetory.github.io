over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's take another look at the
smartphone that continues to set the bar
for phablets in 2015 I'm Michael Fisher
with Pocket Dow this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note 4 and this is episode 44 of
after the buzz if you didn't catch the
spoiler in the intro let's get this out
of the way now the note 4 is still the
best phablet you can buy in terms of
sheer feature load no one else in this
size class has the s pen or the
digitizer that supports it no one else
has a screen and camera this excellent
and few others can match the fit and
finish but the world hasn't Stood Still
in the nine months since the note 4
launched so it obviously doesn't feel as
fresh or fancy as it used to one of the
note 4's biggest distractions comes from
Samsung itself in the form of the Galaxy
s6 and s6 edge the new flagships
completely regrew samsung's design
language using curved metal and glass
and the changes were well-received to
say the least while the note 4 is
absolutely the best looking and feeling
Galaxy Note to date
it's chamfered aluminum sides and
leatherette backplate can't help but
feel a little well not dated but
seasoned as we foretold in our full
review last year the exposed metal is
also quite susceptible to scratching
from keys or coins this particular
review device has only been in our
pocket for a week and it's already
showing signs of wear the note 4 also
feels decidedly less futuristic without
the built-in wireless charging or
Samsung pay hardware of the s6 and it's
older swipe-based fingerprint scanner is
almost laughably awkward compared to its
siblings precedent forget it pad but as
we saw in our s6 vs. Note for comparison
older doesn't always mean worse the note
4 retains a removable
battery and micro SD card slot making it
easier to repower and swap storage
on-the-go its display is absolutely
stunning in sharpness and color
reproduction its spec sheet is still
more than solid for 2015 and the phone
itself is remarkably slim and
lightweight considering its capabilities
take a look at the comparatively clunky
competition to see what I mean in a
hardware sense the note 4 has aged very
well as you might expect the story's a
little different in software here again
Samsung's both its own worst enemy and
its own biggest cheerleader where the
note 4 is concerned the latest version
of the TouchWiz interface on the galaxy
s6 is lighter cleaner and fully
customizable in making the older heavier
clunkier version on the note 4 feel even
worse by comparison Samsung is rumored
to bring its new interface to the note 4
with the android 5.1 update though when
that might land is unclear especially
given carrier approval delays here in
the States
honestly the update can't come soon
enough though we worried in our note 4
review that the software would age
prematurely and yeah that's pretty much
played out animations occasionally
stutter switching between apps often
involves reloading them into memory
despite the huge chunk of RAM and the UI
packs all the frustrations of yesterday
like unintuitive widgets a sluggish my
magazine and the cloying guinea-pig
bloop noise on every tab
what's worse it can be unstable we've
had the phone freeze for up to 10
seconds when doing something as simple
as taking a photo it doesn't happen
often and if you followed our trials and
tribulations with Android lollipop this
won't come as a surprise but it's still
mighty frustrating especially
considering the update we're running 5.1
was supposed to contain a lot of bug
fixes if you're more concerned with raw
capability over fluidity you'll be happy
to know that all the stuff that makes
the note so powerful remains like dual
window and that S Pen Stylus
each of which is still the best possible
example of its respective category
retesting the note 4 on Verizon Wireless
for a week the day to day performance
was up and down LTE coverage seemed
somewhat anemic compared to competitors
in Greater Boston and one voice call had
an echo problem that required a redial
to solve as with most Android 5.0 phones
our battery life was also underwhelming
not terrible at about 4.5 hours of
screen on time per charge but also not
as good as it should be with such a big
battery on the brighter side you do have
Samsung's adaptive charging for a quick
replenishment and also the note 4
launched with one of the best Android
cameras around and the 16 megapixel
optically stabilized sensor has
certainly held its own in the time since
despite the aging viewfinder software
and the recent release of cameras with
wider apertures on competitors the note
4 shooters still outperforms almost
anything you can find on Android at the
sunlight the display has a purplish tint
in daylight but its ability to overpower
its illumination to overcome direct
sunlight is hugely useful plus its large
canvas combined with a low light mode
makes it an outstanding nighttime
reading companion and if you own a gear
VR headset the high resolution of the
screen makes it very well-suited for
virtual reality when its inches from
your eyeballs finally don't count out
its Snapdragon 805 processor just
because it's from 2014 the note 4 still
runs graphically rich games
with a plum so on the whole the note 4
is held up pretty well but if Samsung
follows its established pattern the
Galaxy Note 5 will be announced at Aoife
2015 in early September just three
months from now given that and the
possibility of the next-generation note
barring some next-generation styling and
software you'll probably want to hold
off on picking up a note for this summer
even if the four turns out superior in
some ways to whatever the five ends up
being you'll almost certainly get a
better deal on the older phablet once
the newer one hits shelves so if you
don't have one already we're gonna
recommend you wait a bit if you do you
can still feel good about owning the
most capable phablet there is for more
on the Galaxy Note 4 check out our

the s6 and the in-depth s-pen lesson all

this episode of after the buzz let us
know by giving us a thumbs up till next
time this has been michael fisher with

cool see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
