pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to show you the new beta of opera
mobile 9.5 that was just released today
by opera this is a free download that
will work with any windows mobile
touchscreen device and i'll post a link
over in the description so that you can
download it so the browser itself really
hasn't seen many changes in this new
beta it's actually with another program
that i'll talk about in a second small
performance changes were made according
to the press release however we still
don't have flash support or that new
zoom slider on the bottom or the quick
way to search that you see on the HTC
touch HD what is new is widgets and let
me show you what that is so I'm going to
close this and go here I am in the start
menu upper widgets essentially operas
trying to create a new platform the
developers can use to create these
little internet applications that use
opera mobile to deliver internet-based
services and that sort of thing so here
are some widgets now that I've
downloaded we have something like an
analog clock which which you really
can't do much with I mean if you if you
tap on action you can zoom in but it's
not a vector so it gets a little blurry
okay so I'm going to click cancel and go
back out and then we have things like
Wikipedia although I'm not sure why you
just wouldn't use the Wikipedia website
it's pretty much the same thing the
mobile version of Wikipedia does a great
job at bringing the content in each
widget you have some options to play
with though not many you can change the
language you can have it load images
especially in this program other widgets
include shopping list which will allow
you to obviously create a shopping list
but you have to login to do that and I'm
not going to do that now we can go into
bubbles which is basically bubble
breaker and every windows mobile device
has bubble breaker on it already which
is a kind of little bit odd and the way
that you add widgets is that you go over
to add widgets here
and so far there aren't many widgets
that have been added this is kind of the
extent of them but the idea is that
developers will will take this on and
make their own wet widgets you know so
so mastercard the credit card company
may have their own widget to check your
bank balance or you know MLB Major
League Baseball may have their own
widget to do sports scores but I'm not
sure this is going to catch on so
overall this new update to opera mobile
is kind of a disappointment they really
haven't made any changes to the browser
itself I mean that said they did
implement a few bug fixes and
performance enhancements so if you
haven't downloaded it yet you definitely
want to get it for your windows mobile
touchscreen device because is hands down
the best mobile browser that you can get
for windows mobile and possibly that you
can get for any mobile phone that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
