prototypes emerged with new details
manger android release updates get
leaked ahead of google i/o and could it
be that we're still getting a google
nexus 6 i'm high memory that I and
mondays are cool they should not exist
and I'm sure a ton of you agree with me
this is parking out daily the first
batch of official news today is about
Samsung though it's very interesting as
first of all the LTE a model of the
galaxy s5 just got another model that
has this black design and looks really
cool but the biggest problem is that if
you want in the United States there's
still no option and still no word as to
when we're getting it but tamson keeps
releasing phones in Asia aside from that
if you are interested in an active
variant of the galaxy s5 and sprint the
company has just launched the galaxy s5
sport edition which is pretty much a
galaxy s5 active in a way it's more like
a galaxy s4 active it's got some
certification six of those are for full
details and specifications I'll sorry
while Microsoft does the competition for
online storage is still big and the
company wants a chunk of the piece of
the pie Dropbox still owns it but you
know you have google drive and microsoft
has got one drive in the company has
just upped its auntie now you get 15
gigs for free on onedrive any of you or
an office 365 subscriber you have that
crazy amount of money you get a terabyte
included in the subscription really
interesting links of the super full
details on that not even though we've
heard analysts predict for the longest
time that the next Apple iOS products
will get touch ID we haven't had any
real photos until now merrily these are
dead prototypes they don't have
activation they are not dummy units
though it's hard to confirm that
obviously the source says these are
prototypes so yeah apparently we are
getting to try the on the ipad mini with
retina display the next generation ipad
air and obviously the iphone 6 so let's
see if we do i even though google i/o is
just a couple of days away a lot of
people are underwhelmed that we
apparently won't get hardware and still
rumors emerged of a nexus 6 apparently
this phone will be made by LG because
it's got a 5.5 inch display that has the
quad HD specs and stuff almost
everything that we see in the LG g3 that
just got announced and since LG has been
partner in the past two years it could
be that Google wants to go out with a
bang on the Nexus project stay tuned to
see what we get and finally for the very
hot and interesting news of the day
another thing that apparently we are
getting at Google i/o is obviously the
next version of android and if you're
wondering exactly what changes it's hard
to predict if we are getting android 5.0
instead of android 4.5 it's hard to know
exactly what we're getting but what we
do know is it apparently this will be a
64-bit version of android finally we'll
is making that shift but then again
since we've seen Apple do that with the
a7 chip and no real applications take
advantage of it we don't get any extra
ram it leads me to the question of the
day how do you think that a 64-bit
version of Android will benefit you as
the user because in my case obviously we
want better applications but we would
like more desktop-class applications not
necessarily just in games but also in
productivity so let's see if that's
really gonna be the case that was a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
