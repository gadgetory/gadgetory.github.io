now and you're watching the HTC One mini
review the HTC One in a miniature size I
don't have it on me because I use it to
record this intro so without any further
ado let's jump to the review the HTC One
mini is and every aspect a miniature
version of the one flagship HTC tried to
identify an address in each a specific
segment of the market with the one mini
who are those future possible buyers
those that love HTC's designed this year
you consider the 4.7 inch form factor to
be too big or find the one to be too
expensive needless to say that the main
competitor Samsung has a galaxy s4 many
on the market and HTC needs to address
that with a competing device the one
mini is 40s for many what the one is for
the s4 fierce competition we've already
reviewed all devices mentioned
previously over at pocket now to read
about every aspect of those phones check
out the reviews and follow PocketNow on
social media to stay up to date with
everything just like its bigger brother
the HTC One mini speaks premium from the
moment you first see it until you start
to feel the cold aluminum while holding
it and we couldn't be more delighted
about the HTC fixing some of the issues
with the hardware design of the HTC One
let's start with the plastic while the
one has slight issues with minimal gaps
between the aluminium and plastic on the
sides
HTC went with a different plastic which
is also now thicker and bracing slightly
the front glass and the back aluminium
on the HTC One mini we also need to add
that the camera protector glass is
slightly recessed so that you can't
easily scratch it on the one that was
flush and the Beats Audio branding on
the back is marked differently than the
one on the one which in our particular
case lost the Beats part it wore off
those concerned about the size of the
one many should note that despite being
on paper just a little bit smaller than
the one it actually feels a lot smaller
in the hand we'll wrap up this outer
aspect the material segment by telling
you that it is one of the most premium
feeling devices we've ever handled
well-built solid and great materials the
inside is more mini compared to the one
than the
sigh the specs are no longer powerhouse
and flagship worthy but solid mid-range
er like this doesn't impact on
performance as you'll see further in
this review but it is worth mentioning
that it is at least on paper a slower
phone
the display is a 4.3 inch Super LCD to
screen with 720p resolution and a PPI
rating of 342 protected by Gorilla Glass
3 the processor is a dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 CPU clocked at 1.4
gigahertz and the memory is 1 gigabyte
for the RAM and 16 gigabytes for the
internal storage yes non expandable
boomsound delivers solid stereo
performance and Radio offers Wi-Fi a BGN
Bluetooth 4.0 GPS HSDPA and LTE
capabilities HD CDs the IR blaster and
left out NFC the camera is identical to
the one on the bigger brother 4
megapixel ultra pixel camera with LED
flash paired with a 1.6 megapixel front
fascia powering everything is a 18
hundred million power battery and
Android 4.2.2 with HTC Sense 5 on top of
it the entire software suite and overall
user experience is identical to the one
found on the HTC One flagship for a
detailed look at everything check out
our full HTC one review everything
applies here too we'll just mention the
most noteworthy features Android 4.2.2
is fast the Snapdragon 400 inside the
phone is fast the HTC One mini
is fast Sense 5 is subtle modern and
brings a breath of fresh air in a world
dominated by either stock Android or
touch ways it goes deep but at the same
time it is light blinkfeed still can be
disabled and still takes up a slot
number one for the home screens if you
like it you can have all the info from
your social networks and several content
providers including pocket now but if
you prefer not to use it set your home
screen number two as default and clear
all subscriptions you can feel the four
home screens there's a maximum number of
five available to the user but blinkfeed
takes up one slot with widgets and icons
there are a couple not too many though
but luckily the Play Store has a
truckload the notification shade can be
accessed by swiping with either one or
two fingers depending on whether you
want to see your actual notifications or
quick toggles the most notable software
offering on the phone is
in the ones case the gallery application
HTC thankfully removes social media
pictures from the app so you will only
see your own events and albums the
gallery is live and allows you to create
highlights out of your pictures and
videos new themes have been added so you
can explore your creativity snapping
pictures was never easier with the
camera app you can shoot stills in
several modes and with a lot of real
time effects or you can choose ohi's a
sequence of stills which you can further
tweak to select the best frame remove
unwanted objects have a sequence shot
see your friends always smile and they
laugh more for an in-depth look at the
camera and gallery applications check
out our full dedicated video in the
description below there are a couple of
things we don't necessarily like and
which HTC can easily fix the lockscreen
can only feature Google now and Google
Plus posts as widgets and the power
section and settings still doesn't allow
you to see screen on time we spent nine
solid days with the one mini as our
daily driver and we are impressed when
we compared it to the one flagship we
saw that it doesn't lag behind and when
it's slower it's just a millisecond or
two slower which is really negligible we
are still not sold on the camera just
like we're not sold on blinkfeed the
camera with the ultra pixel marketing
name delivers mediocre shots regardless
if you're inside or outside it's not the
best shooter out there it's not the
worst theater for megapixel images are
snapped and there's not a single thing
about the camera that impresses us shots
are okay battery life on the other hand
is good as our daily driver for more
than a week the HTC One mini was the
phone that answered our needs when it
came to email calendar phone calls text
messages social media and several
websites YouTube Spotify browsing the
web snapping pictures navigating and
even workout tracking we've got a solid
day and a half with the one minute once
we depleted it in a single day and once
it lasted us for two days
call quality was good both using the
earpiece and the speakers which reminds
us boom sound is everything you'd expect
from it loud and clear tunes or voice
however is different from the one
flagship we're not talking about
loudness but overall music
it sounds a tiny tetany er than music on
the one but nonetheless offers a great
experience latest peas were also
consistent with other phones flagships
or not overall we enjoyed our time with
the one mini for all the reasons we
mentioned in this review we are rating
the one mini an 8.5 out of 10 everyone
that's gonna do it for today for the HTC
One mini review this footage is also
recorded by the HTC One mini Ivan and
