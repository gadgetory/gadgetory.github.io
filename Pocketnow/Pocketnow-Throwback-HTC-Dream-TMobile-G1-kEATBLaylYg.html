new device Windows Mobile and Blackberry
were still key players and palms still
existed a new player emerged to shake up
the global smartphone scene but few
imagined just how thorough and profound
that shake up would be that player was
Android and its first commercially
available device was the HTC dream known
in some markets as the HTC g1 this is
PocketNow and this is our special
edition throwback review on androids
first smartphone including your tweets
the rapid development of the Android
platform makes it seem somewhat younger
than it actually is so it's easy to
forget that the g1 is actually almost 5
years old easy that is until you take a
gander at the spec sheet at 320 by 480
the 3.2 inch LCD kept pace with other
screens of its time like the iPhone 3GS
but it looks pretty pixelated today the
processor was a Qualcomm one running at
528 megahertz and backed up by a hundred
and ninety-two Meg's of RAM and internal
storage topped out at 256 Meg's though
additional expansion was available up to
16 gigs using a microSD card slot while
the version we're running on our g1
Android 1.6 donut offers a virtual
keyboard like more modern versions of
the OS the initial Android release did
not so the g1 offered a physical
keyboard hidden beneath the display
which folded out via a special
arc-shaped hinge and thunked into place
while well spaced the keyboard was also
deep set and rather mushy falling well
behind the BlackBerry keyboards of the
time something that still hasn't changed
much another challenge to typing on the
g1 was navigating around its big chin a
design feature which set it apart from
many of its competitors and made it feel
more natural as a phone but which not
everyone appreciated the chin was home
to early androids control collective
send and end keys for the phone home
back and menu keys for software
navigation and a clickable trackball
that recalled the BlackBerry and
sidekick devices of the time this
portion of the g1 also housed the ext
USB port
which doubled as a headset jack since
the g1 didn't incorporate a dedicated
earphone port instead an adapter was
required an oversight loudly bemoaned in
reviews at the time another low point
for the g1 at least initially was
battery life the 1,400 milliamp power
pack and our unit here is definitely on
the small side to begin with but many
units shipped with an even smaller 1,150
milliamp power battery
tiny indeed especially considering the
unoptimized software rounding it out
around back was a 3.2 megapixel camera
controlled by a dedicated camera key a
good thing flanked by a two tiny
speakerphone delivering pretty wretched
and tinny sound a bad thing
unfortunately earpiece quality was okay
and even today callers said we sounded
better on the g1 than on just released
phones cellular reception though
continues to be another story entirely
when the g1 dropped with android version
1.0 it traded the mature app ecosystem
found on the apple iphone for a tightly
integrated google experience apps like
Gmail Google Maps YouTube and Google
Talk were all either aboard at launch or
added pretty quickly thereafter making
the g1 pretty attractive too heavy
Google users even way back in 2008
adding to that attraction androids
customizable home screens then limited
to three linked to a kind of parallax
background wallpaper that shifted
relative to the main home screen
elements which included support for
widgets but the really big deal was the
notification shade or drawer
one of the first standout features of
Android and one that continues to
persist to this day modern touches like
the settings shortcut and toggle array
weren't there in the G ones day but
persistent access to notifications no
matter what app you were in was a big
deal in 2008 and it continues to be
today multitasking was a bit different
in the g1 s day on version 1.6 a long
press of the home button called up the
quick jump window it wasn't as fluid or
as flashy as today's recent apps ribbon
but it served as one of androids biggest
advantages over the iPhone which didn't
support third-party multitasking at the
and it could be used to jump into and
out of any of the hundreds then
thousands then hundreds of thousands of
apps in what we know today as the Google
Playstore is still called the Android
app market on our doughnut running unit
here in some ways the HTC g1 is the
exception that proves the rule it wasn't
the most heavily spec or the most
capable device on the market when it
launched and it certainly wasn't the
prettiest design example neither on the
hardware or the software side it was
outclassed in hardware aesthetics by the
BlackBerry Bold 9000 that came just
before it and its software was far less
aspirational than that of the Palm Pre
which launched the following summer but
the platform the g1 helped to launch has
far surpassed both of those
contemporaries only one of which still
survives and the g1 or maybe it's more
appropriate here to refer to it by its
dream title played a crucial role in
introducing Android to the public not
just by launching it into the
marketplace but by serving as a stable
expandable and reasonably compelling
hardware platform for developers to do
their thing via the Google dev phone one
and for customers to embrace a new
player in the smartphone space that's
why the t-mobile g1 will forever have a
place in our mobile history and why it
commands so many fond memories in the
pocket now Twitter audience on behalf of
everyone in pocket now thank you to
everyone who tweeted in with their
thoughts of memories fond and not so
fond on the HTC g1 or HTC dream really
appreciate it
we're hoping to make user tweets a
mainstay of the throwback series and
maybe other PocketNow videos in general
so thank you very much
