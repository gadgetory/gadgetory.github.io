major front-facing camera stuff google
search extends to answer contextual
questions and the reason HTC one a9
update proves to be a must-have I'm high
humidity vetta preparing in the tropics
for a major tropical storm this is
parking a daily the official Musa they
have to do with HTC as the company has
just pushed the software update in
Europe Asia in other countries that are
not the United States with a major
Cameron provements in addition to
battery improvements and heat management
which is something that some users
complain not everybody but the camera is
a complaint from everybody else and you
can watch our review for that but yeah
keep on the lookout and hopefully it
breaches the United States suit other
news have the moto x 2015 yesterday we
talked about a back with a fingerprint
scanner slot and now we get some other
backs then don't show the fingerprints
lot it could be that these don't belong
to the Moto X it could be a new revamp
moto G or it could be that the
fingerprint scanner is at the front of
this is just the prototype there's a lot
to expect here but we do know that
Google wanted to build this into the
Moto X 2014 so they tuned other news
that are rather concerning is that
apparently Apple will stream Apple music
at 256 kilobits per second when compared
to Spotify the does it at 320 and for
those of you music buffs out there that
could be a problem but just the word of
this claimer it seems that Apple will be
streaming at its AAC code compared to
mp3 apparently the quality is going to
be good enough this is what we currently
get in itunes anyway so audio files will
probably not be disappointed we can't
wait to test that out later this month
and tell you about it now since making
your search term smarter is the thing
that everybody's doing after poor Tana
brought it to the table it seems that
google has just updated its google
search to bring location awareness
meaning you can ask it where you are
it'll tell you where you are and if
you're in a mall for example you could
ask it at what time does this place
closed it'll know what place you're in
and give you information on that place
in particular and this most likely will
extend to give you shopping information
in the future we don't know that just
yet but these are cool updates the gist
the right to google search and should be
pushed to your devices very soon and
probably for the very interesting news
of the day
it seems that Apple wants to bring some
major front-facing camera update silly
iphone success there is code on iOS 9
that points to the possibility of a
front-facing flash for example in
addition to panorama slow motion and
other options that could be coming
hopefully better megapixel count as well
and probably a wide angle lens we don't
know those other two portions just yet
but it does seem that this is coming to
the iphone success and it does lead me
to the question of the day how important
our selfie photos for you do you take
them often because in my case I try not
to but I do their shameless but leave us
a comment down below what is your case
bren-ji know the drill if you want to
get the dozer Leo before this video is
Phil machine follow us on farnell
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
