pocketnow.com and this is part four of
the video review of the Amazon Kindle I
want to show you what it's like to look
at a newspaper on the Kindle here we
have the Wall Street Journal I'm doing
the 14 day trial and in order to not get
charged after the 14 days I have to
cancel it before the 14 days ends so
this is what it looks like when I am on
page 1 of The Wall Street Journal there
are no pictures what I like to do is go
to the section list now reading a
newspaper on the Kindle is a completely
different experience obviously than
having a real newspaper you don't get
the you don't get the pictures you don't
get to see a cover page and then you can
flip across to the next page to see the
continuation of a story it's basically
like a compilation of articles which is
okay because when you boil it down
reading a newspaper is just reading an
article after another article so let's
say I want to go to the marketing
section and it tells me there are 18
articles right now and here are the
front page articles for marketing and
other articles listed on other pages so
I'm going to click on the first article
here and it'll just take me to a page
that lists all of the text of the
article and just like as if I were
reading a book I can click next page and
read the whole thing so it's going to
take a lot of get a lot of getting used
to reading The Wall Street Journal on
the Kindle I'm not sure I'm going to
make it a habit but the option is there
if you want if you want to do that now
I'm going to go back to the home screen
and show you some features that Amazon
is experimenting with I'm going to click
menu here and go to the experimental
choice at the bottom here we have three
things basic web esque Kindle now now
interesting name I know and play music
the basic web is an attempt to render
web pages on the Kindle and it doesn't
atrocious shop I'm not even going to
show it to you just try to imagine a
monochrome screen with 800 by 600
resolution try to display a web page it
doesn't look pretty it's readable
it's definitely readable if you're out
and about you need to see a web page but
it's not a good experience then again
the Kindle is not a web browser
it really isn't then we have this thing
called ask Kindle now now you can type a
question
and apparently real people will research
your question on the web and send up to
three answers to your Kindle usually
within 10 minutes this actually works
it's really interesting I sent in a
question I said what are the side
effects of the prescription drug Allegra
it's a drug for allergies and about 10
minutes later I get a response with it
looks like somebody wrote an article
they obviously didn't I don't know how
it actually works
I'm assuming it's just some kind of
automatic web query and then you have
play music you can put in an SD card and
listen to music while you read on your
Kindle and that's it for part 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
