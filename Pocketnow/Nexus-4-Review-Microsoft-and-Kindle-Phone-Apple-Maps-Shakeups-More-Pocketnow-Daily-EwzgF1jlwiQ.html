and Amazon secure a smartphone
manufacturer and I will keep shaking the
tree with more dismisses after the maps
fiasco I'm high metal iveta wondering
what an Amazon phone is going to look
like and this is pocket out daily if
you're still on the ropes about getting
a nexus for this holiday season that's a
bit difficult lately because Google
reopens sales for the phone today and
sadly it's sold out in just eight
minutes and yes I was in line trying to
get a phone of myself but so far our
full review of the device is now live
and I'd recommend you watch it fully
because even though it is a good phone
it didn't get a great rating and it's
really important that you see why
speaking of the nexus 4 google has just
pushed the new android 4.2 point 1
upgrade to their current nexus devices
because the month of december wasn't
there as part of the bugs that were
detected reason Leanne were almost in
December they really had to do something
about it now the upgrade doesn't really
bring much changes except for these bug
fixes so keep a lookout if you're still
interested on moving into the phablet
space I'd recommend you have a look at
Amazon because they currently have the
galaxy note 2 on discount for example on
AT&amp;amp;T they have it down to 175 bucks
after a two-year contract which is down
from three hundred dollars now sadly the
device is currently on back water on
both colors but hey you get at least
secure the price so have a look Apple is
sadly still on the road to shake their
tree after the whole maps fiasco recent
reports have that they're firing their
current maps head after well you already
know what happened with maps on iOS 6 I
have to tell you that I personally
gotten lost looking for a target store
recently so I would want Apple to fix
this soon and even though it has gotten
better let's just hope they figure it
out this time and quick and finally for
the interesting news of the day
Microsoft and Amazon don't seem to be
playing any games when it comes to
starting their own smartphone recent
reports have fi age which is a foxconn
subsidiary already receiving orders for
a smartphone that comes from Microsoft
and Amazon that leads me to the question
of the day would you be interested in
getting an Amazon smartphone after your
experiences with the Kindles I'd ask the
same thing about Microsoft but you
already know what the surface is like
so leave us a comment down below
honestly I would be interested and if
you want an earlier scoop with
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary better thanks
