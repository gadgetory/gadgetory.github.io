the galaxy s6 but there's one other
top-tier Android device still waiting
for its turn in the ring
I'm ion to Houston with pocket now and
this is the LG g4 versus the HTC One m9
when it comes to the outward Hardware
leather versus metal is the most obvious
difference here in both look and feel
the one m9 sports a two-piece aluminum
frame three-piece on the silver and gold
variant with precision drilled front
firing speakers rills and a coated brush
pattern back the g4 utilizes much more
plastic in its chassis but offers the
optional vegetable tanned leather
backing complete with genuine stitching
down the spine
if leather is not your style you can opt
for more plastic with a ceramic coated
back instead but the material choice
only scratches the surface of what sets
these two phones apart for starters the
g4 is quite a bit bigger than the m9 in
every dimension it's taller it's wider
and at its thickest point it's even a
little bulkier though it's a touch
lighter than the m9 thanks to the less
dense materials used if you're like me
that all translates to a less
comfortable fit in the hand but of
course your mileage may vary and that
fit is leveraged with one of LG's most
identifying features its rear mounted
hardware keys the m9 s power and volume
buttons are well built but often
criticized for being too easily confused
for one another on the other hand LG's
buttons are easily distinguishable and
they sit right where your finger is
likely to rest when using the phone what
we're looking at the back though
something that's not so great about the
g4 is its single rear firing speaker
it's not just that it's facing the wrong
way its tinny it clips at high volumes
and it pales in comparison
HTC's boomsound speakers you get - about
the same volume but when it comes to
watching Netflix or listening to music
there's no comparison here
the g4 does deliver a major victory with
this 5.5 inch IPS display versus the One
m-9s 5 inch Super LCD 3 it packs
significantly more pixels at a much
higher PPI and the colors are much more
accurate it's also hard to ignore the
internal differences here both phones
have 32 gigabytes of internal storage
and the option for microSD expansion but
only the g4 has a removable battery and
comparing chipsets the m9 should
theoretically have the upper hand with
its eight cores Snapdragon 810 but the
g4 is 6 core 808 offers nearly identical
performance and the phone itself runs
markedly cooler so we're hesitant to
name a winner in specs when it comes to
the software experience I'll just say it
now I much prefer sense 7 on the m9 over
LG's offering while neither phone ever
seem to exhibit much of any lag sets
just feels more cohesive more finished
LG says that it worked closely with
Google to offer an ear stock experience
but as Michael pointed out in his review
there are clashing UI elements all over
the place in the g4 features like dual
window feel half-baked and limited
compared to the implementations from
other manufacturers but luckily for LG
HTC isn't one of them there's no
simultaneity on the m9 and since also
lacks a feature like LG's quick memo for
scribbling notes though it does have
extensive themes to change the look of
everything from icons to the lockscreen
and virtual buttons something totally
absent on the g4 we love that both
phones come with double tap to wake
functionality and both phones also offer
predictive software to make
recommendations based on weather
location and other factors but neither
really replaces the functionality of
Google now overall both software
experiences are fast powerful and useful
but features like blink feed and themes
make HTC sense preferable in my eyes HTC
and LG are both betting big with their
cameras this year but there's no doubt
which performs better and it's by a long
shot
HTC ditched is bemoan 4 megapixel ultra
pixel setup from last year in favor of a
more conventional 20 megapixel sensor
LG's camera is a bit lower in resolution
with 16 megapixels but man does a shoot
out reminded
that megapixels aren't everything the m9
actually performs pretty well against
the g4 in well-lit environments both
providing shots that look crisp and
colorful but take these two into a
dimmer setting and the differences well
night and day thanks to the g4 s optical
image stabilization and bright F 1.8
lens it absolutely dominates the m9
pulling in more light capturing more
detail and just producing better photos
both phones offer manual controls and
the ability to shoot in RAW but there's
no question that LG's camera will give
you better results almost 100% of the
time you can also shoot 4k video with
both phones but again OAS makes a huge
difference here this is one of those
pocket now things this is one of those
pocket now things we're not pocket later
it's good point
talking HTC does offer a more extensive
and fun photo editing experience the
features like face fusion to turn my
friend Dakota Johnson into famous
actress Dakota Johnson but a fun camera
isn't always a good camera and in this
regard I'd still take the g4 any day
both phones ship with some of the latest
and greatest chipsets the Qualcomm has
to offer and both have their high and
low points the m9 runs graphically
intensive games a little smoother but
the g4 runs them cooler the m9 gets
significantly hotter than the g4 when
you push their processors and this is
especially true when both phones are
charging thankfully they both offer
quick charge despite early reports from
LG saying otherwise and they can both
charge up from 0 to 60 in about 15 or 20
minutes that charge will last you about
the same on each phone but I'm going to
give the edge and battery to the g4 the
m9 is endurance is plenty good enough to
last you a whole day but the g4 manages
to squeeze out an extra hour or two of
juice and when it does run dry you can
always just swap it out thanks to the g4
s removable battery I bought my m9 back
at the beginning of April and nearly two
months later and after having used the
g4 I still think I made the right choice
it's smaller footprint great speakers
and front
and camera make it a better fit for my
needs but if you're looking to replace
your point-and-shoot swap out your
battery or just turn heads at the next
meeting the g4 may better suit you
either way you're getting one of the
very best smartphones of 2015 so Kay
we're all winners here we've already got
way more coverage on both of these
phones available on YouTube and at
pocketnow.com so go ahead explore just

i'm hi out to Houston with PocketNow and
thanks for watching we'll see you next
