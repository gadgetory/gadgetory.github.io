and we're gonna take a quick look at
this week's new Xbox Live game for
Windows Phone let's check it out
alright this week we've got pac-man Kart
rally on Xbox Live for Windows Phone and
this is kind of similar to Mario Kart
except about pac-man characters and
you'll notice we have multiplayer that's
a pretty cool new feature okay for a
multiplayer mode we need two phones on
the same Wi-Fi network and where one is
gonna host the game the other is gonna
connect to the game however this doesn't
seem to work it might be because both of
these phones have the same live ID so
let's just go straight to plain a
single-player game you choose different
characters and different cars with
different attributes you can choose
different cups and then you can choose
different tracks with that one and one
thing I like about this game the
controls are on screen it's not one of
those tilting games like many of the
other racing games so here we go you
just have to press the buttons on the
side to steer
and you can see a breakdown there and
once I get some power-ups there will be
a button to activate those like that one
let's see what that does
the sound is off by default you can turn
that on in the options I'm just racing
here the graphics aren't anything to be
terribly impressed about but it's fun
game you can see we're driving here the
controls work pretty nicely there we go
I lost so in the options we have game
settings after your music you can choose
accelerometer options how many laps you
want to do for each race items and you
can erase the data
there's achievements of course and
leaderboards got nobody else and there's
help for our learning controls and rules
and that's about it
so I think the multiplayer mode is going
to be a big draw for this game you'll be
able to play I'm not sure exactly how
many people but once more people have
this game it should be a lot of fun so
that's pac-man kart rally available
Wednesday of this week in the Windows
Phone Marketplace give us a thumbs up
you like this video and that's it for
now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
