all about it the verizon roadmap for the
fall gets leaked an HTC plans to bring
jellybean to the 1x very soon I'm high
Meadow iveta hoping Brandon doesn't do
with drop test on that iphone 5 and this
is parking out daily
that's right Apple has done it again
today is the iphone 5 day and the only
reason why is because apples the only
company that has figured out how to
announce a product today and ship it to
you 10 days later I wish every other OEM
would do that but our coverage is here
brandon has got the phone and we've got
our unboxing with our first impressions
we've also got a comparison between the
iphone 4s in the iphone 5 because i know
a lot of you are on the ropes that we've
got a full tutorial on how to cut a
nano-sim from a micro sim which pretty
much works the same for a normal sim and
the biggest video of today would be the
galaxy s3 being compared against the
iphone 5 so make sure you hit the link
in the description for details and also
follow our playlist because tomorrow
we've got more videos of the iphone 5
coming up now those of you are on
verizon will be happy to know that the
roadmap was recently leaked for the fall
among the boring things we've got the
samsung stratosphere two coming in
october along with the LG spectrum to
not interested but november's the big
news we've got windows phones coming
from nokia from HTC and from samsung you
already know those names and we've also
got obviously the android offerings from
HTC like for example the droid
incredible x that we've recently been
leaking so has a comment down below and
tell us which is your next phone those
windows phone 8x devices from HTC are
really cool and they're coming to
verizon now what you see has got a lot
of us on the edge of our seats waiting
for the Android 4.1 jelly bean to come
to the 1 series of Android devices so
far recent reports have the company
working on bringing the upgrade to the
1x as early as next month the problem is
next month includes 30 days and
obviously we don't get a specific date
but Samson is doing the same for the
galaxy s3 so let's hope it's early next
month I'm waiting now the asuste padfone
was a device that we enjoyed at mwc 2012
but for some reason it wasn't popular
probably because the device was a little
underpowered but recent leaks have in
the sooz padfone 2 being on the works
with the Snapdragon s4 quad-core
processor that was recently announced
for the LG optimus G and also 2
gigabytes of RAM now we're not sure when
this device will be launched most likely
mwc 2013 but if you don't know what app
at phone is we're talking about a
smartphone that also turns into a tablet
and where you can use the stylus to make
phone calls it doesn't get any more
futuristic than that and finally for the
stupid news of
we the mocking term for apple now is
Mapple gate and the reason why is
because an apps on iOS 6 suck they are
terrible and it's amazing because maps
on the iphone 3gs when they were back
then by google maps were much better
than what we get now that was three
years ago and it just makes you wonder
why Apple is doing this I mean they're
clearly trying to make something
beautiful with their 3d maps that's
clearly not functional at all so that
leads me to the question of the day have
you tried maps on iOS 6 I hate it but
leave us a comment down below tell us
what you think 3d maps are cool but
they're non functional now if you want
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow was on
parking now calm please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
I'm hi Marietta thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
