the launch of the first Galaxy S there's
just no way to deny that there is an
Android before the Galaxy S and an
Android after and to celebrate a decade
of dominance it's time for another
galaxy impact reporting from both New
York City and San Francisco mhmm it'll
be better with Park it now and let's
talk about the Galaxy S tens yes I said
it
so technically today we get three Galaxy
S tens but then they actually showed us
four and once you account for all the
variations yeah there are a few
disclaimer though the lighting in this
venue was atrocious so apologies in
advanced during our briefing we got to
see the galaxy s 10 e with its east
anding for essential the galaxy s 10 and
the galaxy s 10 plus their sizes are
different but the experience you get
from each is intentionally similar
Samsung made it clear that after much
consumer research there are three things
that are associated with the galaxy
brand display camera and powerful
specifications as for the display all
three devices have an all new dynamic
Super AMOLED panel which is the world's
first HDR 10 plus certified meaning
vivid digital content and dynamic tone
mapping for a wider range of color and
enhanced outdoor visibility
it also has blue light reduction by 42
percent without compromising quality as
for differences there's obviously screen
size with the S 10 II being a smaller
one at five point eight inches diagonal
and being a flat display as well it has
a single selfie camera cutout and its
fingerprint scanner is capacitive and
embedded on the power button the S 10
has a larger 6.1 inch display but curved
shares a similar single camera cutout
and the S 10 + takes a display up to six
point four inches diagonal also curved
and the way you tell them apart is
because of the larger camera cutout for
the deaf sensor on the S 10 plus
something shared between both of these
devices is the ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner tucked under the display which
reads 3d contours of your finger for
more secure biometrics internally we're
talking about the qualcomm snapdragon a
55 processor or Exynos 98 20 depending
on your region ram berries from six ego
bytes to twelve storage starts at 128
gigabytes up to one terabytes though
each variant is expandable battery on
the s10 he is of 3100 milliamp hours
3400 for the s10 and 4100 milliamp hours
for the s10 plus they are all ip68 water
and dust resistant they include the
latest Wi-Fi six fastest 4G LTE and
include fast and wireless charging and
there's even wireless power share that
serves other she devices including the
new Galaxy buds that were briefly shown
literally the only difference left is a
vapor chamber cooling system on the s10
plus for gamers to assist the spec sheet
1uy includes a I powered performance
enhancements this means faster app
launches as the phone detects what apps
you use when you're at home and at work
and will preload them in the background
at these locations
it means adaptive battery as samsung
claims that all three phones will last
all day regardless of their differences
it also means bixby routines to help you
get stuff done quicker which are things
we'll definitely have the test in our
review Samsung is dubbing these their
new pro grade cameras they all have the
same 10 megapixel selfie camera def 1.9
aperture that can now record 4k video
finally and then they also share the
same 12 megapixel primary camera at
variable aperture between F 1.5 and F
2.4 all 3 also have the same ultra wide
16 megapixel camera depth 2.2 aperture
and 123 degrees of field of view what
the s10 eel acts is the 12 megapixel
telephoto at F 2.4 aperture improvements
include the fact that you're now able to
shoot HDR 10 plus video and a super
steady video that Samsung claims will
compete with any action camera and then
there are also scene optimizer
improvements now with better AI and even
MP you support color options are prison
black flamingo pink inspired by the
Pantone colors of the year prison white
prison blue prison green and for those
of you Korea's of the materials there is
a ceramic white and ceramic black though
these are only available for the 512
gigabyte tiers and above for the galaxy
s 10 plus we were also shown the Galaxy
S 10 5g for a brief moment it has a
larger 6.7 inch display a larger 4500
milliamp hour battery and a
time-of-flight camera sensor though
sadly weren't even allowed to touch this
phone so yes this is the galaxy s 10 all
the units of the galaxy s 10 if you
think there's a lot we have to agree and
I'm sure there's a lot more to be seen
at the galaxy impacted
weren't briefed on there's just so much
digest here so definitely an extended
review period is an order for yours
begin on February 21st with a free pair
of galaxy buds have you picked the s10
rs10 plus you can find them in stores on
March 8 pricing starts at 749 for the
s10 II 899 for the s10 and $9.99 for the
galaxy s 10 plus prices that I do
consider aggressive considering that
these are some of the best black ships
let us know what you think about these
price points in the new galaxies in
general in the comments down below and
while you're at it make sure you follow
