pocket now and contrary to the usual
goings-on around here i'm wearing a hat
it's not because i think it looks good
it's because i didn't have time to do my
hair because i've just returned from
seeing my FedEx delivery driver who
brought me this it's not just a
dangerous lithium-ion battery it is in
fact a samsung galaxy note 3 so let's
unbox it and having gotten the fedex
packaging out of the way ahead of time
here is the retail box for the
much-ballyhooed
samsung galaxy note 3 before we start
the unbox we want to tell you that we
got this unit from Negri electronics go
ahead and visit them at their website if
you would like a galaxy note 3 of your
own and many thanks to them for
providing us this demo unit in a very
very timely fashion so as you can see
this box is coming from the same place
as the rest of the high-end Samsung
Galaxy line with this faux wood grain
finish on it we have an American model
probably only uploaded in America so
that's great that means we have the
Snapdragon 800 powered Note 3 with bands
for American LTE and that's excellence
we're going to go ahead and try and ease
the Box open here I have to get that
sticker out of the way which we will do
right now that goes and we can just
slide this up on the back mounted
sticker with the serial numbers there
whoo-hoo and it's a white one I didn't
know which one we were getting and the
white one is going to be fun to review
there should be a tab here yes let's do
it the easy way we won't make it hard on
ourselves boy after reviewing the iPhone
5c for a week this thing is a monster
to hold there's that stitch leather back
we'll come back to the device let's see
what comes in the box with the unit the
first thing I pulled out of the box is
this metal clip it's vaguely familiar
but I do not remember what it does when
I find out while I'm editing I will drop
in a description probably right about
here but for now we'll put that mystery
item aside as you might expect a
flagship class device like this comes
with Samsung's earbuds these are the the
linguini the linguini flat wire edition
with the gel ones that go on your ear I
actually quite like Samsung's stop stock
earbud offering a USB cable USB 2
USB 3.0 you can see here we can get
focused there it is it is a much thicker
connector than the usual USB 2.0 or a
micro USB 2.0 because of that added
added port there we will have a look at
that more closely as we have a look at
the device here's the battery on the
bottom big ol monster battery and if we
can get a little zoom here we'll check
out the milliamp power rating make sure
we got the right one 3200 milliamp hours
on this power pack put it aside and
there are some additional gels for our
stock earbuds finally I believe this is
the last of it
the wall adapter should be 2 amp just
like the rest and the rest is just
cardboard filler which we will put aside
coming back to the device itself as we
saw when we first took it out of a box
it is the white version these are this
is a pretty loose protective here I
think this was probably taken off at
some point before so we will just go
ahead and pull it off with no ceremony
but this front display protector jeez is
hard to get the whole thing in the frame
it's such a giant device sorry it's been
a while since I've handled my note -
we'll get the microphone a little bit
closer here for our ceremonial screen
peel off and we will ask for quiet
please oh yeah that's the good stuff
right there turning the device over
we'll go ahead and pop in this 3200
milliamp hour battery there's your
typical thumb slot up in the corner of
this this faux leather backing will be
not quite as gentle as we want to be
apparently and we'll go ahead and we'll
put in a memory card later and we'll put
in a simulator and stuff right now we're
just going to do a first power on a pop
better in there slide the cover back on
there's the s-pen hiding down below pop
that out in just a second make sure we
engage all the snaps on the side there
seemed to be more hardware hardware
snaps for lack of a better word on this
battery cover and it is a much more
rigid battery cover than uh than we're
used to feeling here and this is not
quite soft to the touch let's even get a
closer shot there for you this actually
feels a little bit more more rigid than
than I recall there's a protector on
that camera lens there this camera by
the way 13 megapixels with digital not
optical image stabilization BSI sensor
and the new design flash this is a
ticker on the right power standby key on
the right hand side samsung has got its
usual plastic side protectors here go
ahead and zoom back out so we can take a
look at that special USB 3.0 port along
the bottom along with the speaker port
microphone
there's the s-pen down below the
redesigned s-pen more to see in the
software of the new s-pen but this is a
this is a new design nonetheless and as
you can see that subtle ribbing there
mirroring the rest of the design of the
phone up front you can see that it's not
entirely smooth we have it is smooth to
the touch but we have this kind of
dimpled pyramid faux texturing below the
the gloss alongside the earpiece here
and the front-facing camera holes no
holes for the sensors as well samsung
branding up top and the traditional big
ol home button down below a pretty
attractive device didn't get a chance to
play with the white ones so much in
Berlin so nice to have this in our hand
this with the battery installed we're
looking at a 168 gram device so much
lighter than you would expect from such
a a large phone let's go ahead and power
on the screen here we're going to press
and hold the power standby button in
this screen as it comes to life will
tell you is Super AMOLED with a
resolution of 1080 by 1920 and it is 5.7
inches on the diagonal 386 PPI there's
the Samsung power on noise you saw the
notification LED hiding up there in the
corner and there is our welcome screen
with a little bit of haptic feedback
that you probably did not detect on the
camera there eventually that welcome
screen is going to mark the beginning of
our Samsung Galaxy Note 3 experience
which we will be embarking upon very
very shortly
and folks if you were around for our
Galaxy Note 2 coverage you know that the
coverage on the Galaxy Note 3 is going
to be very extensive at pocket now so
once again thanks to our friends at
Negri electronics for sending us the
demo unit please follow us on social
media drop us a like if you enjoyed the
video leave a comment down below if you
have something specific you'd like us to
cover in the full review or the
comparisons and as always thank you so
much for watching this has been michael
fisher with pocket now we'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
