emerges now claiming it to be the
fastest phone of 2018 sort of we get
some information of the series new iPads
and they are pretty interesting so far
that's like Samsung's UI is finally
getting the overhaul we've been waiting
for I'm hanging out Iveta and if you're
watching this version of the video it's
because we have to use the pre-recorded
version because that means that google
event was too crazy so expect separate
coverage on that and by the way don't
forget that the 1 plus 60 is coming very
soon follow the first link of the
description to register for the
livestream this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with another
chromebook announcement and this is
interesting because we had the HP
yesterday today we have the Lenovo and
then we have the Google event but then
again that Lenovo yoga Chromebook that
we saw that was the $6.99 variant that
was also a high-end Chromebook was
announced today be to pick it up you
could pre-order it it's definitely a
well designed computer the only problem
is it's a Chromebook you can learn more
in the description now let's talk about
Apple and iOS 12 point 0.14 those of you
that have been dealing with Churchgate
issues and apparently other issues like
Wi-Fi which I've been dealing with
particularly my iPhone is currently
updating we've actually been waiting for
that to be able to do our review so far
we'll see if that doesn't bring any more
bugs but we will keep you posted as this
is simple definitely something that we
needed now let's talk about Samsung as
some new leaks that just emerge that
xda-developers show us what to expect
for the next-generation user interface
of the phone and we're not exactly sure
if this is gonna be high on the galaxy
note 9 or pie on the s10 but we see new
iconography a new launcher a new user
interface on the camera things that we
were really wanting to see for a bit so
stay tuned for that now let's talk about
iPads we're still waiting for Apple's
invitation to its next event where we
should see new Macs and new iPads but
the changes to the iPad pro seem to be
significant no home button and edge to
edge display face ID that will actually
work in any orientation that you're
using the tablets the
rumors that apparently USBC is going to
make this tablet which I find I don't
think it's gonna happen
I mean lightning is just so important
for our volts ecosystem but apparently
the whole idea is for it to be able to
export 4k HDR or project it so yeah if
that ends up happening that's also gonna
be interesting
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the huawei mate 20 Pro we're
just a week away from the event I cannot
wait to be there and tell you more about
what we see but while some benchmarks
just emerged and it is claiming this to
be the fastest phone of 2018 to a
certain degree because of yes it does
great in gaming it does great and pretty
much everything they threw at it the
problem was when they compared it to the
new iPhones you know that the new
iPhones have the new seven nanometer
chip but it's just interesting to see
that iPhones are pretty much on par if
not better in certain tests when
compared to the may 20 Pro so let us
know in the comments I mean what do you
think are you expecting the huawei mate
20 Pro because of its speed or benchmark
still important to you because in my
case I start caring about benchmarks a
while ago but man you guys in the
comments go crazy about them so leave us
a comment down below I would love to
know your opinion friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
