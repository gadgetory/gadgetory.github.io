an HTC one google edition the feature
Microsoft Surface RT may be a lot
cheaper than you think and the new
google hangouts are not only out but
also blocked by AT&amp;amp;T i'm high memory
data and you know i really wonder why
AT&amp;amp;T focus on being the black sheep out
there this is pocket out daily let's
talk today off talking about the usual
rumors we've seen the white Nexus 10 in
the wild a couple of times these leaks
are not new but the rumors are that the
device will be retailed in the Google
Play Store on jun 10 it will also be
getting Android 4.3 on jun 10th for the
nexus 4 but if it doesn't ring a bell to
you just yet well June tenth that's when
WWDC happens for Apple so stay tuned for
the comparisons dear now let's continue
talking about Google as apparently they
have this dispute with Microsoft they've
sent them a formal letter stating that
the YouTube application that Microsoft
had to build for windows phone 8 does
not comply with the standards that
Google has and by the way those
standards of the fact that you can't
play ads they're lucky you guys at
Windows Phone but point being is that
apparently Microsoft came back and
stated no there are the only reason why
we haven't done it is because you don't
go as access to the api's and after
listening to Larry Page call out
Microsoft and then we see the scroogled
ads all over it's clear these companies
don't like each other at all now let's
continue talking about Google we know
that their new hangouts feature is out
it's a cross-platform messaging service
that supersedes google talk and the
whole idea is that you can start a video
chat at any point but AT&amp;amp;T is blocking
it because of that because they
eventually flocked facetime over 3g for
you know iOS users and now they're doing
the same to google because apparently
they don't trust on their own network
and it just really becomes maddening to
see how AT&amp;amp;T does these kinds of things
and then you've got verizon not doing
anything about it but anyways leave us a
comment down below what do you think
about ATT's move and now let's do a
little more talk about Microsoft we know
that they're working on a smaller
version of the Microsoft Surface you
know being seven inches nine inches
apparently that's the form factor range
they're looking for but the new rumors
are that this tablet is going to be
significantly cheaper Don targeting two
hundred fifty dollars cheap you know
nexus 7 cheap so
does seem that the company is looking
into competing with some better products
coming into the future but the problem
is that apparently only running surface
I mean Windows RT nevermind and now for
the sad news of the day we were all
excited when we heard Googlebot on stage
saying that well he's got his HTC One
that he likes but no he's got a galaxy
s4 now that runs you know stock Android
and obviously we now know that you can
pay 650 bucks for stock Android version
of the galaxy s4 and we were waiting for
them to do the same for the HTC One at
least eventually but when contacting HTC
about it the rep said that no there are
actually no plans to build the Google
version of the HTC One which is sad news
but that leads to the question of the
day I mean really would you be willing
to pay 650 dollars for an unlocked HTC
one google edition when you can get the
developer variant for that same amount
of money and keep HTC Sense I mean in my
particular case honestly I'm not a
really a big fan of stock Android I do
like it it's just I like HTC Sense more
so leave us a comment down below what
would you prefer sadly it's either one
or the other but you can't get cents on
that Nexus version of the HTC One if it
ever came out so sadly and of course as
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet rumors you follow
what I'm talking out a comment subscribe
to our YouTube channel as well you'd
also follow me on Twitter and Jaime
