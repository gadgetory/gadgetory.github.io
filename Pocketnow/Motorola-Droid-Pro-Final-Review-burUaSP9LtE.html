pocketnow.com and if you've been
following our progress on the droid pro
you've seen us run through many videos
in the device so far we've unboxed the
device we've given you a hardware
overview we've also given you a software
run-through and finally we've tested the
video recording capability of the 720p
30 frames per second camera sensor well
now it's time to wrap everything up on
our final review and give you our
thoughts in this quick video which is
actually going to address the pros and
the cons of the device if you want to
see the full article in depth be sure to
check out pocketnow.com let's get
started now first up a typical fashion
we're going to address some of these
things of the droid pro that we really
like and the first of which is going to
be the on-board storage or the ROM it is
one gigabyte on the droid pro that's
going to allow you to store a lot of
your applications directly on the phone
rather than on the micro SD card which
is going to help maximize your speed you
can save your microSD card from media
and pictures if you so desire staying on
topic of media and pictures you saw us
give you a video test of the droid pros
720p 30 frames per second video
recording now we found that quality to
be very good even taking still pictures
was great the dual LED flash goes a long
way if you haven't seen a recording
video you should definitely check that
out we were definitely surprised and
happy with the results we achieved now
one sometimes touchy topic with Android
are the different versions of the
software don't fret the Droid Pro will
have android 2.2 froyo pre-installed so
you'll be up to date with the current
latest and creative software now
gingerbread is expected to come out soon
if that does we'll have to wait and see
how long it takes Motorola to upgrade
the droid pro but for now you are
current you are up to date and you do
get the best of speeds the droid pro is
targeted towards business users and
because of sargodha tour business users
they've included a full physical QWERTY
keyboard on the front of the phone it's
actually a candy bar style phone so
there is no sliding keyboard whatsoever
a lot of our commenters have actually
called it the droid berry because it
actually is an Android device with a
pretty much blackberry keyboard so if
you've been holding out on Android
because you don't want to use just a
touch screen and you do want that
physical keyboard this is a great option
for you on the verizon network staying
with the business theme if you finally
you're traveling
nationally quite often whether it be
canada or occurring all over the pond to
europe wherever it may be the droid pro
is a world phone now what that means it
has an included SIM card so that no
matter where you go you always will have
reception you're going to have the
verizon top quality network in the
united states and then when you travel
outside of the country are going to use
Vodafone and last but not least for the
pro side of things we really like the
user programmable shortcuts we showed
you that side programmable keep and our
hydro overview you can also do the same
thing with keyboard shortcuts what this
allows you to do is switch my
application application in a very rapid
fire process this really maximizes
efficiency and just ease of use now it's
time to talk about some aspects of the
Droid Pro that need improvement or that
we really didn't like and the first is
going to be the smaller screen now this
is a personal thing you may or may not
mind having a smaller screen the 3.1
inch screen is definitely usable however
in a world where a lot of the screens
are now 3.7 up to 4 4.3 inches we
finally droid pro screen quite small and
a lot of the icons where sometimes
crimped if you've been using a
blackberry already you're going to be
used to having a smaller screen so it
won't be that big of an issue for you
the screen also features a pretty low
screen resolution but combine that with
a smaller screen itself and it actually
doesn't look too bad the colors are very
accurate and they do somewhat jump out
at you now the biggest issue that we had
with the droid pro was the battery life
Motorola rates it to get around seven
hours of talk time however we were
actually getting around four and a half
to five hours if you're an on-the-go
business user this may scare you away
but at the same time let's face it a lot
of the on-the-go business users if you
will already have a car charger for
their blackberry or whatever phone they
may be using or they may have a
secondary charge so if you don't mind
carrying around a second charger or
having a car charger close by it's
really not going to be an issue for you
because you're going to be on the phone
for close to seven hours a day to begin
with and last but not least the Droid
Pro seems to go against the typical
droid hardware future in terms of it has
a plastic battery cover now now this may
seem like nitpicking but we're every
droid device or most of the other droid
devices mind you having metal battery
cover any metal frame you would expect
one of the higher Android devices and
one of those you know geared toward the
very professional and sophisticated
users to have the metal design of some
kind overall we thoroughly enjoyed our
time with the droid pro the call quality
was absolutely phenomenal beating up
most of the devices that we've used in
the past the callers and other lines
that we saddle
we were actually standing right next to
them pair that with a very fast phone as
well as the froyo android 2.2 recently
installed plus the video recording
practically you name it the user
programmable shortcuts pair it with all
of that as long as you don't mind having
a smaller screen and having to recharge
your fault out the day this phone is a
winner for you we give this phone a 4.5
out of 5 if you'd like to get all the
details and see our full written review
