Grand Central I was starting to think
Google was going to kill this service I
have a pretty terrible track record of
investing in services which are cool but
fail to find some consumer excitement
when reports started filtering in that
Google was updating voice I assumed we'd
see the end of this standalone service
that we'd see it lumped into an existing
product like project buy so you can
understand why I'm so excited to see
this wasn't the case neglected for far
too long voice has gotten a significant
rework a fresh coat of paint and a few
new tricks
what is Google voice well we'll let the
service describe itself in its own words
welcome to google voice google voice
gives you a single phone number that
rings all of your phone face your voice
now online and transcribe your voicemail
to text other cool features include the
ability to listen in on messages while
they're dating left welcome one of
colors and make tape international call
we hope you enjoy using google voice not
only useful for managing multiple phone
numbers through one master account it's
also super handy for replying to text
messages through a proper computer a
feature iOS and hangouts users are
certainly familiar with now reviewing
something like this is always fraught
with danger and that I'm likely to show
off a ton of personal information it
would be a futile exercise showing my
real account looking like some redacted
document on a conspiracy site so you
won't see the full scope of how deeply
entrenched I am in Google Voice you'll
just have to trust me I'm in pretty deep
setting up a new account must be done
through a proper computer browser but
once completed installing the new app
will swap the web interface over to a
sleek new side panel look app on your
phone is cleaner and more in keeping
with modern apps I still don't like top
screen mounted hamburger menus but it's
more consistent with other Google
services sliding right and left will
move you through text calls and
voicemails and for some reason you're
managing multiple voice accounts you can
now cycle through them here like you can
a Gmail shortcuts allow for fast access
to archived messages famine marking all
of your messages as read the last is
particularly helpful as reading a
voicemail transcript won't mark it as
read so I often ended up with hundreds
of unheard messages the settings menu
has a prettier interface but a few
features are very deeper than they used
to
for example options like call recording
by hitting the number four while in a
call now need to be manually activated
in advanced settings also we no longer
seem to have options for conditional
call forwarding so hopefully this means
Google's call routing and smarter and we
won't have to fight carriers of her
voicemail issues trying to manually
enter a call forwarding dialer code
resulted in this error message from
Google Voice after the first day
voicemail seem to be recorded properly
and are played back fine through this
app interface fingers crossed it stays
that way unfortunately we do seem to
lose the voicemail widget which came
with older versions of voice but hey I
was trying to simplify my home screens
anyway right and what do we have here
and MMS message properly showing up
inside the voice app well that's just
crazy pants if any part of the voice
service was a hallmark for how neglected
this app had become it was the lack of
support for group text and picture
messages this is a long overdue but
ridiculously welcome update to a service
which has been mission critical to
people managing multiple devices or who
want a little extra peace of mind that
they'll never have to switch or port a
phone number ever again well done well
done indeed as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for more app reviews like these
and help us out some sharing on your
favorite social networks for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget guy
on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
