to sprint next month it's the first dual
screen android handset actually one of
the first dual screen handsets period
smartphones anyway so right now it's
obviously in tablet mode and tablet mode
to to enable the tablet functionality
where where you have browsers going
across screen and what not seems like
you actually have to download a free app
from the from the market so let's see if
we can do that looks like we're getting
a signal in here it seems to allow it
all right so let's take a look at the
hardware with real quick obviously the
thing most people are going to be
interested in is the opening and closing
functionality here and as you can see
it's not easy to do with one hand but
people will usually be doing it with two
hands let's see here we go okay so let's
see if you can see the side here a
little bit so this is how it works from
this angle like folds over and then you
just have a single screen and then it
folds back now it's in landscape now
it's and portrait so honestly the
opening closing mechanism feels really
chintzy here I'm not sure if this is
final hardware or not but you can see
the you know the hinges seem to be
plastic it the whole device is really
really plasticky you know except for the
chrome bezel here really you know not
something that that we would expect out
of it was probably going to be a you
know a flagship device for the carrier
it seems to have moved screens here so
around the back
we've got the camera sorry about my
hands yeah it's a little difficult to
manipulate this just one hand you can
see and again that opening and closing
mechanism just doesn't feel real solid
and see you know even on this demo unit
which really hasn't been used at all
probably it's just not real smooth so
let's check out the speed on this thing
if we can going to go to browser echo by
kyocera so you know they have the page
is set up and right now it's going to be
on evo this seems to be just a mobile
page but you know scrolling seems okay
pretty standard go out to the main
screen here see how scrolling is on the
home screen I'm sorry on the app screen
it's okay a little little bit jerky not
that bad though
all right you can see there's no no
search button on the bottom you just got
home menu back so I'm not sure what if
the apps that are on here actually going
to be indicative of what it's shipping
with know what movies is C or just a
flixster application an exciting there
all right so go back home um and finally
let's just see for the heck of it what
what android version they have running
on here and go to the
about phone
I'm 9,500 and your that 2.21 froyo okay
we're back home here one more thing we
wanted to check out was how the camera
interface looks so let's see if it's
like they don't have that on the home
screens and Dora here we go camera
now obviously this device doesn't have
wimax so you know there's no need to do
a speed test on that and you can see
here in a pretty basic camera interface
I'm not sure oh here probably push the
menu button again gallery alright so you
know really not too much going on here
so again this is the kyocera echo by
Sprint the first little screen oh you
might as well check out the browser on
here too in an open tablet mode Oh see
when you open the phone only the left
button seem to be active not the not the
ones that on what used to be the top
screen so that's kind of interesting
going to the browser in here all right
to launch a second application this
little simulcasting alright so you can
see there's there's quite a wide gap
here actually in between the two screens
a little bit wider than it looks like in
the press shots turn it sideways here
doesn't seem to be rotating there we go
alright so this is the the kyocera echo
and coming next month bunch sprint not
super impressed here but you know like
we said this might just be not final
production hardware yet there might be
some more it's a more metal and a bit
more quality but that we also don't
recommend trying to use this with one
hand when you get it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
