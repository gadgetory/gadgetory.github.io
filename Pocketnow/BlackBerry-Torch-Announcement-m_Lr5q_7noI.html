and rin have exciting news to share with
you this morning innovation in the
mobile industry is in high gear and
customers are winning it wasn't long ago
that the u.s. was seen as the lag but
that's no longer the case today the u.s.
is the leader we mobilize America's
personal and work lives using the most
innovative technologies on the planet
and three things have put our customers
at the forefront of wireless innovation
faster and more intelligent mobile
broadband networks derives or
smartphones and other connected devices
both traditional and emerging and
innovative applications that allow
customers to maximize their wireless
experience today we're introducing a
product that takes advantage of these
trends and further extends the US
leadership position in the world's
mobile ecosystem ladies and gentlemen
today we're introducing a env and grim
are introducing the best blackberry ever
and I have one to prove it and it works
fantastic so today AT&amp;amp;T and room are
introducing the best blackberry device
ever AT&amp;amp;T has a long history in bringing
innovation and choice to American mobile
customers and this legacy has put us in
an annual leadership position in the US
and around the world we lead the world
in the deployment of HSPA the world's
standards for mobile broadband networks
we're first in the world to commercially
deploy hfpa on a wide scale our network
supports just over twenty percent or
approximately thirty million of the
world's HSPA broadband customers more
than any other carrier worldwide
according to the
SMA Association this technology powers
ATM fees networks and it leads to a PNP
being able to claim America's fastest
mobile broadband network we complement
our 3G network with America's largest
owned and operated non municipal Wi-Fi
network AT&amp;amp;T has a very long history of
bringing innovative devices and services
to our customers we better mobile
broadband as smartphones early and it's
paid off today more smartphone users
choose a density than any other carrier
we have substantially more smartphones
that our next closest competitor and we
were the first to offer that blackberry
messaging solution way back in nineteen
ninety nine with rim an AT&amp;amp;T we take
pride in bringing great choices and
devices to customers over the years
we've offered great choices in devices
and operating systems and features and
services and applications to our
customers and those choices are about to
get better as a result of our alliance
with rim you know AP and theorem have
one of the most enduring most
collaborative and strongest
relationships in the wireless industry
AT&amp;amp;T and rim work closely together for a
number of years to deliver some of the
most innovative wireless products
together we delivered the first
blackberry messaging solution we were
the first to deliver the blackberry with
voice and data the first edge enabled
blackberry the first to integrate GPS
the first to offer the blackberry curve
their first to offer the blackberry bold
and together we have sold over 13
million blackberry smartphones since
singular and AT&amp;amp;T Wireless versed in
2004 together we have made millions of
AT&amp;amp;T customers blackberry fanatics and
great alliances deliver great products
an AT&amp;amp;T we believe in having great
alliances we work with other innovative
companies who deliver great solutions
and devices that while customers and it
takes months and years of effort
fine and finally bring to market truly
innovative devices and services it took
a lot of effort to bring this device to
market and if you include meetings from
the engineering level all the way to the
CEO level we spent hundreds of thousands
of hours between both countries however
I hope that you will agree with me today
that we're bringing a very special
product to market one that will continue
the legacy that our two companies have
from collaborating to deliver innovative
products and services to their customers
today we celebrate that legacy of that
vision by introducing the best
blackberry device ever and I think it's
a device that is available only from
apse of the nation's fastest mobile
broadband there now I want to introduce
my friend and our partner Research In
Motion president and co-ceo my class
Torito to tell you more about this
amazing device Mike caught up
well it's been an exciting time no I
look back and I think about when we
first invented the blackberry and
launched in 1999 and it did so much back
then you know I it was the first push
secure email solution that worked with
exchange it was one of the smallest not
the smallest portable wireless handheld
email terminal and it included this tiny
little keyboard that was so well
engineered that people just fell in love
with it it had a user interface that was
deceptively simple an incredibly
powerful because it allow you to access
your change in box your address book
content we took that basic idea and
developed it with our engineering
development manufacturing dustrial
design and over the years we've sold
over 100 million blackberries we're now
selling them in over 175 countries
around the world not entering focus is
something that we trade take great pride
in you make sure that everything works
just right you know we build art and
write our own 3g stack that's how we're
able to make the connection work
everyone the world when you get off the
plane it just works we make sure that
our battery life works really well gets
you through the old a stress-free we
make sure that everything just responds
works well to get you the information
you need to get through the day this is
something really really important
whether it's the custom chips whether
it's the custom management battery
management whether it's the engineering
and design of the product whether it's
the efficient transceivers or in tennis
you know this is something we take great
pride in because we just love producing
a well engineering product now today
we're celebrating one of the most
important product introductions in our
history it's a really special product
for us because so much new goodness has
been added to this product something we
go working for a long time on and we've
been busy today we celebrate and
announce the blackberry torch now the
blackberry torch is our first touch
gordy device slider it's the first touch
qwerty slider blackberry and you can get
a sense of the incredible engineering
escada you this product quality
materials the fit and finish and dusky
design and the simplicity of its
operation now you may ask why do we call
it the torch we have to understand that
not only is this the first touch qwerty
slider this is the first black braid
with a webkit browser and subsystem that
webkit browser technology cane from a
company called torch went mobile that
became part of the room team year ago
and helped us port their leadership
position in web and WebKit technology
into the blackberry now the other thing
that you would probably get a sense of
is when you take a look at how its put
together you've got a large capacitive
responsive touchscreen you got a
precision optical navigation trackpad
and you've got that signature blackberry
keyboard that just so it's so rewarding
to use and we've added an advanced 5
megapixel camera and flash it really is
a celebration of all the things that we
like to do integrated perfectly to get
so it just becomes seamless and almost
instinctive in its operation now the
other thing that we've done is we're
also watching this product with
blackberry 6 this is a new OS and UI for
blackberry that is not only fresh and
exciting it's also familiar if you've
ever used a blackberry you'll
immediately get get a sense of how to
use this will be very familiar to you
but you'll notice all these new things
you can do you'll notice that we spent a
lot of time on the details how the
applications interact how does how do
features interact what you can do with
this product now I just want to give you
a sense of a few of the features that
really got me excited about this product
there's something called Universal
Search and it really defines us product
you see you just open it up to start
typing on that keyboard it searches your
blackberry it searches feeds it searches
your email whatever you're looking for
if you're looking for a new setting just
type settings if you're looking for
email just type email if you're looking
email from certain person type their
name and it presents you your choices as
icons the top and just touch the one
you're looking for it's that easy to use
another thing that's really exciting
about blackberry is the universal inbox
and you can see that on the right-hand
side there you can see that it's feeding
in your your Social Feeds whether it's
Facebook or Twitter or BBM along with
your email if you touch those it opens
up straight into that that interaction
right into the application when you're
done like me responding or reading some
more when you mix it back using that
famous
back button it clears that from your
Inbox there's no clutter so you always
cut the most current information at the
top of your screen another thing that's
really exciting is along with our
browser and the full tab capability into
it one of the things I find I've used
all the time it's a great feature
because you know when you're going to a
website you have a relatively small
screen it's hard to read the text that's
why we've invented something called
autorap texts ooh in our browser just
double tap on it and it grows the font
the size that you selected and then
reformats the article so you can read it
just like an email it's never been
easier to read content on the web then
with blackberry 6 on the torch and we
didn't stop there we took that and we
redesign our multimedia environment to
take advantage of everything we've
learned all the hard work we've done
with blackberry 6 and we provided a new
way of looking at your at your content
where we've got things like album art
thumbnails throughout the interface it's
very easy to use we've taken that
simplicity and we made it work over
Wi-Fi so you can sync seamlessly to your
your personal content later PC and we
continued our seamless bluetooth stereo
duration for connectivity to your car to
your home stereo or your wireless
headphones
now I've been really excited with this
product launch I'm really excited to be
here with our long-term partners AT&amp;amp;T
work real hard with us to make sure this
product met all their stringent
requirements and that we had a great
user experience and a great launch
together so again very excited about the
partnership before I go I want to
introduce dawn Lindsey our VP of user
experience to talk to in depth about the
blackberry 6 UI
thanks Mike Mike already hinted at a
number of features but what I want to go
into depth on is a little bit of the
understanding of why the user experience
is the way it is black g6 when we set
out to applying what the goals were what
it is we wanted to deliver the very top
priority on that list was delivering
ratings experience and not just for
existing blackberry customers but we
want to deliver a great experience for
every customer who was going to be new
to blackberry who made blackberry
smartphone of choice and so in order to
define this experience we had to declare
a number of design criteria number
principles by way from you at base our
design on I like to share some of those
with you right now you've heard one and
one of those principles was freshman
phenom might use this when he gave us a
sneak peek of blackberry 6 back up at
our web conference in April fresh the
familiar meals that that despite all the
new interview innovations new ideas new
functionality that we're delivering
blackberry 6 it has to remain familiar
to existing BlackBerry users it has to
to preserve all of the expectations or
out how a certain feature should work
another principle is about making it
approachable and easy to learn
approachable means that if a customer or
user should feel encouraged to explore
and discover functionality and easy to
learn is actually I think that's the
supplied to the touch screen and a touch
screen really invites exploration and
discovery the touch screen really i
think is epitome of simple to use the
keyboard blackberry torch is really
around the best text input device the
last one I skip the slide sorry the last
one we go back
the last principle I wanted to talk
about was about powerful and flexible
and this is really not about bringing
something new to blackberry but it's
about preserving what is blacker is
renowned for power is speaks to
multitasking operating system the cross
application integration was leased to a
seamless flow from what apps of the next
is really about power the flexibility is
around the degree to which a user can
personalize or customize the
applications to their specific needs or
taste the flexibility actually manifests
itself in a different way blackberry
torch flexibility is around how when
using blackberry torch moving between
the touch screen the trackpad the
keyboard all feel completely natural to
the point where you're not even
conscious that you're actually using all
these different inputs we think that's
the flexibility is the blackberry torch
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
talk about three specific new feature
areas each of these i'm i'm going to try
tie back to these design criteria that i
play them and highlight where we can
manifest approachability easy to learn
power flexibility first up home screen
like make brief mention of the home
screen we've actually redesigned the
entire home screen experience and we've
added a lot of features and yet at first
glance it still looks very much like a
blackberry it's familiar but let me show
you something in features we've added
one new feature is about notifications
so Mike birdies always provide a little
icon that says you've got new mail we've
got a calendar event you've got a new
text message believe providing what
we're calling notification previews tap
on that bar now reveals more information
related to your recent notifications I
can now look the table who was that last
email from what was the subject line is
it important to me do I need to deal
with it now or can I just ignore it so
without even though leaving the home
screen i can now process some of these
recent notifications and make decisions
around
important enough the next feature at
what a point out is about how we brought
more content to the home screen
previously on blackberry your
applications would all reside here and
really was the launching point to start
and jump off and open up an app and
start a new task but we've added is the
ability to put individual contacts and
bookmarks right on the home screen but
what we had to do in addition to that is
provide different views of how you can
look at all that information the soledad
is a very simple gesture the quick swipe
to the left will reveal a view that
shows you all of the content or all the
applications that use most frequently a
swipe to the right on the top screen or
the trackpad will show you applications
that you mark this favorite so we
providing a degree of customization of
these different views to really
facilitate different the flexibility of
a different way you just want to use it
cause you can also see in the slide here
that we can you can modify that trailer
you can open and close it again
revealing just how much information do I
want to do it you can actually close all
the way down so it hides everything
shows your wallpaper that you just for
the last feature actually want to spend
a little bit more time on is universal
search Mike made mention of it what is
universal search first it searches all
the content on your device so it'll
search contacts bookmarks your music
videos it will search calendar events
text messages bbms it's best actually
let me just show you an example of how
this works blackberry torch is perfect
for search because just simply sliding
open the device will start typing
there's no other action required so
device slides open this example I'm
going to type
i'm going to type a name i'm going to
type a name of a contact that i know is
in my book type the first few letters as
you type results are coming back
instantly every character results are
being returned very fast but i can see
here I've typed GRE but I haven't have a
contact name Greg but I can also see
blondes a couple of emails that are
related to this a few characters are
names that I put in this calendar events
there's pictures that are real that
include those those characters in the
title what's also interesting here is
that beyond just providing content from
the device we're actually giving you
away to now broaden the scope your
search and jump off the noise so i can
type in this case great i can say well
actually i want to look that look to see
if there's an application and apples I
want to do a Google search I want to do
a search in youtube so now i can search
all the device and quickly jump right
off the device until you intimated i can
do it in it searches and we've made
search universal search extensible to
third parties so we're going to see
third party starting to plug into this
i'll give you a couple of examples in
the next the next slide we think this is
going to be really powerful for users to
spend they get a lot more time out of
the home screen not only can now you get
all hold your applications you get your
favorites and now you have the entire
content of your device and you can jump
off the device next example i want to
give you four related to the universal
search i'm going to type in a band aid
like lightning you too i can see i have
a bookmark ladies to youtube i have a
video on my device I still have some
music in my library from you too but I
can also go out of the search slacker I
can search youtube video search app
world or podcasts related to you too so
we think universal search is incredibly
powerful way to start activities to
start searching I'm not just the device
but I give searching anywhere in the
width so I want to switch gears move
away from the home screen now and talk
about media
home screen was about how can we
redesign something and you get to keep
it familiar media's how do we take an
existing experience black radios and
good media experience how can we add
functionality to it and yet also
preserve the familiarity but make it
incredibly more powerful so I'm going to
walk through just a handful of features
of different applications a part of the
media suite the first one I want to
mention is pictures we take pictures on
our phone we synchronize pictures to our
phone the one thing that we haven't been
able to do is manage those in a
meaningful way so what we've introduced
is the ability to look at your pictures
either by folder or by date and you can
manage folders creating folders renaming
folders moving pictures in and out of
folders all on your device that's a
degree of control device living not yet
seen in terms of managing media
constants now of course creating a
folder is one thing but it would be
tedious to just move pictures one by one
and out of the folder so we've actually
created a new user interface gesture to
finger tap to do multiple selection so i
can select multiple pictures at once i
can add and remove from that selection
and then i can operate on that selection
i can say delete I can play move into
this forward I can say seven or share
the the colleague or friend that may be
via email could be text messaging or
even uploading them to facebook so I
think multiple selections is really
powerful mechanism to be able to manage
media great on universe as it relates to
the picture is the one thing I do want
to mention it relates to our camera we
use geolocation about our camera to
actually automatically title your
picture by the city that you're
currently so pictures we take today here
will be titled New York City and then a
number we think this makes not only the
picture more valuable but also as a
release to search i can now search by
pictures by the title cities of it
we've added one new application to our
video suite that's podcast that we
listen to podcast may of us subscribe to
podcast download episodes so we provide
an application to do that you can browse
catalog because subscribe to podcasts
and you can download recent episodes
wirelessly so unlike syncing we would
previously do 10 it to a pc you can now
access what podcast wirelessly either
via Wi-Fi by default or via the g3t
never the last one I want to mention
Mike made a brief mention of it which is
wireless music singer so we see wireless
synchronization of media introduced with
podcasts will be extended that over to
music with our desktop software 6 which
we're shipping with blackberry 6 and
blackberry torch we've introduced
wireless music sing we think this is
actually a pretty interesting feature
beyond just simply the synchronization
of music wirelessly on your home Wi-Fi
network what we actually do is we take
your entire music catalog the
information that describes your music
catalog and put that on your device so
beyond the meatless individual songs
that you've chosen to synchronize you
can see your entire library of music on
your device and at any time browse it
search it and then you can tag
individual songs that if you don't
happen to have synced to your device tag
them for synchronization at a later time
so example here is you're having about
when you and you get a a wimp you say
you know I really want to listen to lady
gaga more so I'm going to I'm going to
tag a number of her Pelton's for
synchronization the minute I get home on
my Wi-Fi network instantly those songs
start to get synchronized we think this
is a gift like pictures another way to
provide a lot more control over your
media on your device
I'm going to leave media now and move on
to one last area which is Social Feeds
so many of us subscribe participate many
social networks and instant messaging
neighbors we subscribe read RSS feeds so
we created an application that
aggregates all these feeds into 11 list
so now I no longer has to go to my
facebook app my twitter app go to kiss
love windows live messenger google talk
to see the activities going on across my
network i can just simply open our new
social themes application and see an
aggregation with all of my activity so
in addition to in addition to the
handful services i mentioned here's a
more full list of all the different
services that we support and as i
mentioned in addition to Social Feeds I
can also subscribe to and read RSS feeds
and again you're seeing this swipe
gesture just to change change views from
one panel to another and now I can see
all the feeds that i've subscribed to
and you can subscribe rate on your basal
and retrieve these feeds but what's
really interesting about our social
feeds application is that it leverages
something that blackberry is
particularly strong at which is an
integration between applications that
allows or enables a seamless flow from
one app to the next so example I want to
give you here I am in the Social Feeds
application there's one particular
facebook feed which i think is of
interest to me and i want to dive down
into it read it in more detail respond
to it clicking it actually takes me
right into the facebook application and
yet that transition was fairly seamless
I didn't think have to think about that
I was launching a separate app I can
interact with that individual in the
Facebook app and then back rado to get
into the Social Feeds application so I'm
using multiple applications to
accomplish
and yet from my perspective as a user
I'm unaware that multiple applications
are running and again this is a
testament to blackberry strength as a
multitasking operating system and cross
application integration that we provide
so that's just a very brief summary of
some of the new features in blackberry 6
I hope what I've been able to show you
really are a testament to the goals that
we set out to create freshmen familiar
approachable and easy to learn powerful
flexible what I'm going to now is
actually show up short video which gives
you a law a sense of far more of the
breadth of changes that we've brought to
blackbird six in fact we've changed just
about every application in blackberry 6
in some way has been refreshed added to
enhanced modified so let me show you
this video
a lot of stuff the team has been busy
now what I had a personal note which is
this past that better part of a year
which we've been working on black 36
it's been a pleasure to work with our
partners at agency and the team working
with the team together and I personally
really appreciate the effort the folks
the podium in terms of the collaboration
in defeat I'm very proud of the work
that RIM has been able to do in terms of
creating and delivering black 36 today
with that I'd like to introduce talk
about our platform David yah chief
technology officer
Thank You Don for showing us the great
new user experience of blackberry 6 i'm
here to talk to you about what we've
done with blackberry torch of blackberry
6 to significantly expand the world of
blackberry applications what are the key
objectives of blackberry 6 was to create
a seamless and intuitive application
experience for users while making it
easier for developers to build great
applications and to maximize their
returns we've expanded the world of
blackberry applications in three
dimensions first we've made it easier
for customers to find and discover
applications second we've made it easier
for customers to purchase apps and for
developers to make money from their abs
and third we've made it easier to
develop applications ensuring users will
have a larger selection of applications
and services from all kinds of
developers this is why blackberry 6 is a
win for both our customers and
developers let's look at blackberry 6
from the view both the customer and the
developer first we've simplified app
discovery we in on the blackberry torch
we i we have blackberry app world isn't
pre-installed and comes out of the box
so that makes it easier for users to get
that initial experience of what it's
like to find discover an application and
content and themes
you've heard a lot about Universal
Search well one of the things when you
type in Universal Search first of all it
helps you find the applications of
already download because after you
download a lot of application sometimes
that gets difficult but you can also
then with one tap on search app world
for applications on that particular
topic so for example if you type weather
and the universal search and you just
tap on app world that will go find you
all the applications that will give you
weather forecasts and so this gives you
the capability to quickly find
applications both on and off your device
the whole goal of simplifying app
discovery is make it easier for our
customers to find applications to load
applications which on for the developer
then increases demand for applications
notice they want to talk to you about
was all the options for purchasing
applications and content first and
foremost with app world on blackberry
torch we now have carrier billing which
allows customers to add applications and
content and their purchases go great on
to their AT&amp;amp;T bill so a very simple
purchase process the second thing that
we have coming up is the library payment
service which provides the opportunities
for developers to have a vis which will
opens up a whole new world of digital
content services for end users so with
this api's and having chargeable events
they can do things like trying apps
before you buy you can put in
subscription models so you can subscribe
to your favorite content for games you
could buy additional levels buy
power-ups if your business user an
application can allow you to pay for the
next new report just came out this
morning the third way for increasing
capabilities for monetizing applications
is to advertising service abis these
allow developers to put ads right into
their applications and in addition to
that the get access to multiple ad
networks and then back of the shop they
have accessed into analytics in
information about what kind of click
through there getting of the ads and so
what this allows is developers to have a
wide range of business models ranging
from paying for download to paying for
specific content to monetizing through
advertising together by taking the
abilities than first payment through
carrier billing the payment services to
open up these other plantation
capabilities and the ad service we
created the ability for developers to
have a biz
small that suits what the application
and the customers they're trying to
serve in the third dimension that I
mentioned will be is to make it easier
for developers to create great
applications now one of the most
anticipated things about blackberry 6
has been the introduction of our webkit
browser with html5 support on blackberry
6 we're enabling developers with the
skills for things like html5 CSS and
JavaScript all web technologies to build
though featured applications on top of
our web get implemented and then they
can distribute these applications
through blackberry app world this is a
huge step forward in opening our
platform to a much broader set of
developers and a new developer community
and enabling them to create applications
more quickly and at lower cost what's
really important to note is that these
applications built using html5 web
technologies are not limited to the
typical constraints imposed by a web
browser in fact as part of the web
application platform they can create
apps that can do things like running in
the background again take leveraging
that multitasking capability accessing
all of the files and information on the
device such as calendar inbox media
leveraging location-based services much
like our camera uses location-based
services to tag pictures with the city
they can get just-in-time notifications
using our blackberry push services and
much much more the point is the
developers using what the web
application platform get all the same
capabilities that our Java developers do
and yes we do have new capabilities
available for our ever-growing list of
java application developers
blackberry 6 we deliver some new UI
elements and services in the AP is that
allow applications to quickly
incorporate them into developers to
quickly incorporate these into their
applications one of the things I'm most
excited about is is applications can tie
into the universal search that you saw
earlier so an application writer can
because of multitasking it usually takes
a search will go searching all the local
applications some taneously and bring
back the results so they paid you'll see
an example that in a minute well we have
new ways of doing menuing things like
asking menus to simplify the menu
structure of applications one of the
things that I didn't have to talk about
we got some new graphical action menus
that are part of the blackberry 6
platform you'll get to see that when you
could see some Devils later and so the
application our job application
developers get all these rich
capabilities as well the one thing I do
want to point out because it may not be
obvious to everyone is that applications
that already exists that were written
for 450 or earlier versions of
blackberry will continue to run a
blackberry 6 so people don't lose the
investment they have in the current
applications and developers can continue
to sell their current applications while
they adapt them were they didn't
blackberry api's attn brim were so
excited about all the app experiences
that we're enabling on this device that
we've chosen some of the most popular
applications due to be available
directly from their own homes you right
out of the box so this is a new
discovery mechanism so that users can
quickly find applications for things
like news for exert social networking
entertainment multimedia they're
optimized for the blackberry torch for
80 and by clicking on the icon they
mainly get it into the download
experience they don't even have to go by
a Perl to find those applications I
would have a chance to show you all
these applications but I did want to
give you a glimpse of how so many
third-party multimedia apps can
complement the core media experience
that's already built into the torch to
make one of the most powerful media
products to date so please take a look
at the video the blackberry torch
delivers a world of applications and
makes it easier than ever to discover
purchase and subscribe to the apps and
services that are right for you quickly
search blackberry app world using the
new universal search feature or choose
from some of the leading mobile apps in
the market available right from the home
screen including a powerful suite of
multimedia applications that empower you
to take your favorite video and music
services with you on the go find music
and artists and launch it customs like a
radio station for immediate playback
check the option to catch the station
and slack are seamlessly synchronizes
hours of music down to your local SD
card so we could listen
just play the station back from local
memory for a high fidelity listening
experience anytime anywhere with mobitv
you can access a range of live and video
on demand channels including full
episodes of top shows
tune in live to sports breaking news and
full-length entertainment from major
network providers or download and store
full episodes whether you're in cellular
or Wi-Fi coverage cubes prime time to go
to download your favorite TV shows and
watch a crystal clear picture no matter
where you are select individual episodes
or set the service to record a whole
season prime time to go will
automatically download the latest
episodes being a Wi-Fi shortly after
they they're all of these services offer
advanced features via hungry
subscription services on your AT&amp;amp;T bill
experience your digital world in a whole
new light on the blackberry torch
they may have noticed that well these
apps all look great and take full
advantage of the touchscreen and
keyboard and touchpad capability they
also offer some unique blackberry 6
functionality for example you can enter
a music artist name in the universal
search and jump right into slacker to
listen to music from that artist the
apps also take advantage of our to
multitasking capability in a very
compelling way you'll notice that those
applications could be set up to be
weighed in the background as soon as you
get a Wi-Fi connection and the
applications will start downloading the
content that you selected in the
background without for the user
interaction so in summary we've made it
easier than ever for users to find and
discover applications to purchase
applications or to purchase content of
his applications we made it easier for
developers to build applications get
paid for their applications and open up
to a platform to much broader than all
of our community by expanding in all
three dimensions we have significantly
grown the world for blackberry
applications and now it's my great
pleasure to hand it over to David
Christopher the chief marketing officer
for the wireless consumer markets at 18
thank you David I can't tell you how
excited we are about the blackberry
torch as ralph said earlier we've been
offering blackberries longer than any
other carrier and our relationship with
rim as is deep as any we have today we

smartphone portfolio in the US and the
blackberry torch brings that portfolio
to a whole new level this is an
incredible device the best blackberry
ever not only for traditional business

with our history of working together
with rim for more than 10 years means
that the torch comes to market with the
best of AT&amp;amp;T and the best of blackberry
we've spent thousands of hours of ground

world-class experience now let me tell
you about it about how we're going to
bring the torch to market it starts with
developers atts had the best care
develop a program for years we're
leveraging this experience to support

by the convenience and simplicity of
carrier billing this level of building
integration to purchase applications is
the first for blackberry it provides a
really simple and easy-to-use experience
for our customers at launch we're also
offering a joint webcast and detailed
technical specs to help developers right
for the new OS 6 platform we're also
looking forward to participating in and
actively supporting round at their
upcoming DEFCON conference in San
Francisco in September so that's a quick
look at how will support developers as
they build applications for our
customers now let's look at how we're
going to market the blackberry torch as
I've said this product is the result of
deep collaboration between our two cups
are two companies to create a truly
world-class smartphone experience so it
only makes sense to complement our
