pocketnow.com and today I'm going to
show you how to swap out the micro SD
card in your HTC surround Windows Phone
7 the tools you're going to need for
today's project are a Torx head
screwdriver tiny little one and also a
Phillips head screwdriver small one as
well and of course the memory card that
you're going to be swapping out with
last thing you need here is a disregard
for your warranty because after
performing this project you will not be
able to take the phone in for service
repairs insurance whatever so basically
only perform this if you're absolutely
sure that you're going to be holding on
to the phone for the rest of its life
that's the case please follow us after
the break and we'll show you right how
to do this all right so here we have the
phone and the first thing we're going to
do is take off the battery cover on the
back and it helps to have a little bit
of a long nail to do this because you
need to get it in there and then sort of
slide it along the edge and once you get
it all the way around you should be able
to top it off but yeah this is not the
easiest thing to do alright so once we
have that off we have the battery
compartment exposed and obviously we
need to take that out so just going to
remove that here alright and this is the
phone that you're gonna be working with
from here on out now I've already taken
all the screws out so I don't have to
bore you with watching me unscrew each
one but so you know there's going to be
four Phillips heads all on the sides
here one two three and then there's one
down here and then once you get those
out there are going to be five Torx head
screws four in the corners and then one
right here and two of the Torx head
screws are going to have warranty
voiding stickers on them so once you
take them out and you break that seal
that's what you know shows the the
repair people that that the phone has
tampered with so once you have all the
screws out the next thing you want to do
is take the backing off and this is
actually done in two pieces
first part is at the bottom here you
want to be very careful again you kind
of just want to get a nail under there
or maybe a credit card and sort of sort
of rocket loose because these are pretty
flimsy pieces of plastic as you see
doing this before I kind of put a little
bit of crack right here where the micro
USB slot comes through so you do have to
be really careful put that down here and
this one is even a little bit more
difficult to take off so your best bet
is probably starting at the corners and
then rocking it down now this came out
pretty easily because I've done this a
couple times already but generally
you're going to want to go very slowly
with this you know lest you you crack
the plastic here all right now let me
show you this is where the micro SD card
micro SDHC card I should say is located
and once you get down to this level it's
really easy to get out you just push it
in you know like you would any any user
accessible one and then you can pop the
card right out like so
all right there we go now one word of
warning is that the card that the phone
came with is not going to be able to be
formatted or read by any other device
except ones that can can read secure SD
cards which happen to mostly be Symbian
phones so so nokia based phones like the
n8 you could put this in and format it
but mmm excuse me you couldn't put it in
your laptop and expect the laptop to
read it or to be able to format it into
usable condition so that's something to
know when you're going to swap the cards
out now I didn't have a 32 gigabyte card
lying around so I'm just going to use
another 16 gig here but you will still
get the gist
so once we have the card we just pop it
back in here then you want to put the
pieces back in in the reverse order now
something to note is that there are
micro SD cards that are specifically
designed or approved for use with
Windows Phone 7 devices I found it just
using a regular card worked out fine but
you know Microsoft and AT&amp;amp;T they
recommend that you that you use the ones
that are certified so once we've got
this back together put the battery in
now one thing I would recommend is that
you don't put the screws in back in
until you've tested this out and make
sure that everything works or else
you're going to be wasting a lot of time
with the screwdrivers so pop this back
on here before we put the screws on now
here's one of the most important things
and that is if you turn the phone back
on it's going to say that that this is
not the card that came with the phone
and to please you know reinsert that
card so just trying to swap it out
you're not going to have any luck what
you have to do is hard reset the phone
after the swap and to do that you want
to hold volume up and down buttons at
the same time while also holding the
power button and then the phone will
turn on and you'll get a screen here
see if you can see that this operation
was elite all personal data down yes no
or whatever so volume down to report
restore manufacturer default and then it
restores it almost immediately hit that
again and then not gonna leave this here
but it's just going to boot up like the
first time you turned on the phone go
through your live account setup SIM card
access points whatever so there you go
this has been Evan glass of pocket now
hope you enjoyed this tutorial and just
remember to please not perform this
unless you're absolutely comfortable
with voiding your warranty having a day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
