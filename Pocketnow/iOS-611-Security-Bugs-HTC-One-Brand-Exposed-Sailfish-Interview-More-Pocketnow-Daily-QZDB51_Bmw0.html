security issues the HTC One brand
becomes more evident than possible and
if any of you remember me go well we've
got a story to tell you I'm hi I'm at
Atlanta and I'm wearing red for no
particular reason this is out
daily sadly not everything is fun and
games when it comes to iOS 6.1 point 1
you can still jailbreak your device but
the problem is that there is this old
buck coming back to iOS where you can
unlock your device without needing a
password by going into the emergency
dialer last time this happened sadly we
had to wait for an iOS update for it to
be fixed and hopefully your phone will
not be caught by somebody that has the
skill to unlock it just out of the blue
now let's move on to Android 4.2 point2
for those nexus for customers that have
figured out the XDA tweak that allows
you to unlock the LTE capabilities on
those supported areas and people that
are lucky enough to get it well the sad
part is that this update sadly cancels
your capabilities of using LTE so before
you upgrade your nexus 4 be sure you
know what you're doing and for those of
you waiting for the Galaxy Note 8 that's
been teased for so long well Sammy is
really not contempt they want more they
recently had this podium in a trade show
where they were throwing off the Galaxy
Note 10.1 and instead of using the 10.1
in the banner at the back they were
actually using a Galaxy Note 8 it just
makes you wonder what's taking Sammy so
long to release the damn tablet just get
it out there these teasers are really
becoming annoying and for those of you
wondering if the HTC m7 will be called
the HTC One all of you watched the
recent celtic vs juventus game and
italian soccer you pretty much notice
that HTC one was all over the banners
the biggest question is if it will be
HTC one m7 because just think about HTC
to happening next year but if you're
still wondering when these or this
device will be released well apparently
march eight is the leak date for Europe
and March 22nd is when it will reach all
four US carriers or at least all three
because there were recent rumors that
verizon was not getting it because of
the droid DNA so we'll keep you posted
and finally for the interesting news of
the day those of you that remember the
Nokia n9 and it's me go operating system
that was later
ditched over windows phone well it seems
that the company or at least the
employees that were in charge of the
mEagle project decided to found their
own company on their own which is called
Jolla and they have a new operating
system that's based on Mego which was
definitely genius with all its swipe
functionality that we now see on
blackberry 10 the point being is that
Michael Fisher spend some time with cio
Stefano Moscone explaining everything of
why selfish why would you want to get
this new operating system that will soon
be launched it looks really beautiful
really minimalistic but that leads it to
the question of the day do you think
that there is space for another
operating system we've got iOS we've got
windows phone we've got android we've
got you bunt to coming soon and yes
sailfish is out there but we also know
that webos didn't stand a chance so
leave us a comment down below and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone it's
all the world make sure you follow us on
parking out on comment subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well let's give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I'm high never leave it up thanks
for watching and stay tuned tomorrow for
top 5 reasons on why you should not
jailbreak your iphone and aside from
that happy Valentine's Day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
