Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and let's get this thing unboxed the lg
optimus G pro LG's third entry in the
phablet sector first was the Optimus
View second was the Optimus Vu 2 and now
we have the optimus G pro this is
essentially a direct competitor to the
samsung galaxy note 2 and it's soft
launched just before Mobile World
Congress and it's expected to release in
other markets around the world including
the US market sometime in quarter two
but the exact date is not known so let's
get inside the box and see what this
thing is all about take the lid off and
you have the device itself we'll push
this to the side for the time being
we'll come back to that I can get this
box open inside you have your reading
materials which we can't read because
they're in Korean so not very helpful
here is it's an included set of
headphones or a headset inline mic and
looks like volume control maybe your
standard microUSB cable a power adapter
of course can't get very far without
that and a battery in the very bottom of
this is a dock for the phone it'll sit
in either landscape or portrait and yeah
that's good it also has a slot for
charging batteries so that's nice
you can get a spare battery and charge
it in this little charger here let's get
this stuff back in the box and take a
look at the hardware because that's what
we really care about right so let's take
a look around the hardware of this
device on the front we have a 5.5 inch
1080p true HD IPS plus display now that
differs from the Galaxy Note 2 because
this one is 1080p the note 2 was 720p so
it's much higher resolution much higher
density it's around 400 pixels per inch
I think 401 it has a 2.1 megapixel front
facing camera here your standard speaker
grille a physical home button and that
strip around the home button is not
just Chrome it is LEDs so that is your
LED notification is the actual home
button and back in mini buttons to the
left and right you'll also notice that
the bezel here is very very thin I don't
know the exact measurements but it is
very close to edge to edge it's very
minimal bezel which is really nice
especially on a device this big it makes
it feel a lot smaller
here's your volume rocker on the left
side and this is actually not the power
button the power button is on the right
side on the left side this is actually a
cue button I think it's called and
that's a shortcut button you can set
that to pretty much anything you want on
the bottom is a microUSB port top is an
IR blaster and a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack in the back we have the
13.1 mega or 13 megapixel camera LED
flash and a loudspeaker and your typical
branding 4G LTE LG and you get this nice
pattern on the back this one isn't glass
like the optimus G but it is plastic and
it shares a similar pattern like a
speckled tile like pattern that you see
on the Nexus 4 and the Optimus G but
this battery door is removable and
inside actually so it comes with a spare
battery which is nice I guess that's to
show off the dock but we have a 31 40
milliamp hour battery inside this is
micro SIM slot micro SD card slot and
that is about it on the inside it has a
1.7 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 600
it's not Snapdragon Qualcomm 600
processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of storage and I think that's
everything so let's just quickly boot
this thing up and look at this
notification light because that's what's
really cool about this thing yes it's
not the only cool thing but it's it's
one of the really cool things about it
and if you saw that really quickly yeah
light up and make a nice little
visualization there and while we wait on
it to boot up let's wait for this noise
to go away see if we can get noise the
past few devices that I've unboxed they
didn't make any noise when I pull the
plastic off so
yeah I think I think they're they're
done with that noise they don't like us
to get happy over that mmm if we can get
this one off there's just not a lot of
noise that's it's upsetting
one thing I almost forgot is this right
here
now it may look like a stylus because
it's usually hidden in the bezel
somewhere but no this is not this is
obviously the Korean model so it comes
with this nice long antenna and that is
not for cell reception that's not gonna
make you pick up signal better this is
for television if you're in Korea you
could watch television just as you could
from your TV over-the-air from your
phone anywhere so that's a really cool
feature but it's not helpful to us so
the other models that are coming out the
International model the global model and
maybe the US model are said to have a
stylus in place of this thing so
hopefully because a stylus on the device
this big is nice to have and if it's a
direct competitor to the galaxy know -
it needs a stylus so there you have it
this has been a quick look and an
unboxing of the Optimus G pro stay tuned
for more coverage there should be a full
review and many comparisons over the
next week and into next week so stay
tuned for more that's all we've got for
now so if you liked the video be sure to
give it a thumbs up and stay tuned for
more lg optimus G pro coverage I'm
Taylor Martin and I will see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
