calm and I'm going to show you something
new about Windows Phone 8 let's check it
out alright in this video we're going to
take a look at Bing local Scout and maps
so first off we're going to go to beam
search and there's the search button
just like usual a couple little things
have changed the microphone is up here
now and sit down there we still have the
music search and beam vision but here's
something new look at that little thing
sticking out over there we have a
panoramic design on the bay nap so this
will show different data there's a movie
and you can see more movies and the
cinemas is going to load and over here
we have local deals the order of these
pains seems to change sometimes so
there's a something I might want to buy
nearby here's the videos interesting
videos you might want to see and there's
top headlines for the news we can load
more news and pretty easily see that and
then we're back to the beginning now
there's something else cool is the
search has some new features let's try
voice search jessica alba so that works
pretty quickly we have a usual link to
IMDB and we have local nothing there but
here's something good media and look at
this we have videos so i can see videos
and here's some more it's going to load
lots of videos and all of these actually
work on a Windows Phone let's try that
one and what does is it actually goes to
a mobile site so there's dailymotion and
you can play that pretty easily and
here's the images this has been upgraded
as well
remember on windows phone 7.5 you
couldn't even zoom in on these pictures
those basically all you could see was
this tiny little thing but now we can
zoom and pan and you couldn't sort you
can scroll through them either but now
we have a filmstrip view and can even do
it in landscape you can save the picture
or set it as your lock screen now if
you're in the movies here's a a movie
that I pinned to the Start screen we see
related here's a new feature that's
pretty cool it's called buzz buzz panel
and right up top we have a graph of what
percentage of the expert reviews really
like this movie so taken to you is a
forty six point eight percent and we see
all the reviews there's links here so we
can really easily click and read more
about the movie and we even have user
reviews so 90.5 percent of the people
who saw this movie really liked it and
you can read more reviews there of
course with short times too and there's
apps so i can go to msn movies to buy
tickets or I can go to IMDB and learn
more about this movie so it's going to
run a search there it is so let's get
back to local Scout this time and it
looks pretty much the same as before
there's your food there's your see and
do it's shopping here's a new feature
it's called for you and this list things
that bean thinks you would like based on
your foursquare account and your
Microsoft account with being search
history if you allow it to use those
things so I did allow it and we can see
some of my friends like this place it
lists their names there and we see how
many people checked into that place we
see Victoria of a new
he likes minuites delicatessen maybe
because she's related and if you see
something that you don't like you can
check it off and you can say dislike so
that will help teach bin and local Scout
about the things that you like or not or
don't like back here we have some crazy
new options for filtering so I can sort
by distance or rating or suggestion but
I can also show what is open now and
what is open what is offering a deal and
we have all sorts of other filtering
options here but those two top ones are
pretty interesting so these are new
Nokia Maps and we have the usual buttons
at the bottom to find me the directions
one thing about directions is there's no
longer the tap the screen to pronounce
the instruction you won't be able to
hear the next instruction anymore
however if we go to a location there's
going to be a drive button there it is
and with this you can put that address
into a gps navigation Program however I
don't have any yet and there aren't any
available in the store yet because it's
not released now we also see buzz for
the locations here this is going to get
stuff out of Twitter see who's talking
about the location whatnot of course
there's apps well and another big thing
is in the settings we can download maps
there's also check for updates in case
there were some changes made to the maps
so i can download the maps for offline
usage without having to be connected
i've already downloaded new york and to
choose new ones i just press add and
then i can choose
whatever countries I want and whatever
States and you see we have a lot of
options so that's a quick look at some
of the new features in beam local Scout
and maps on Windows Phone 8 be sure to
give this video a thumbs up and thanks
