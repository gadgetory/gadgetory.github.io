improvements to come to the iphone 7 the
galaxy note 7 leaks extend to show us
how underwhelming the battery will be as
early as it started the SmartWatch
market has already begun to shrink I'm
high Meadow iveta inviting you all to
enjoy your fridays accordingly even if
you don't remember anything tomorrow
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you are
in the market for the ipad pro 9.7 inch
which i highly suggest it's probably one
of my favorite tablets of all time it is
currently having major deals at Best Buy
$125 off select models $225 off others
making the 1000 something dollars tablet
pretty much only eight hundred dollars
I'm not saying that this tablet is
affordable it is not but then again if
you want one this is probably the time
to buy one thing that Apple is not
celebrating is a pretty much the
SmartWatch market share and I think
that's something in general there were
three point six million units shipped in
the same quarter last year as it stands
right now and all this for predicting
only 1.6 million units that's a terrible
fall and Apple is the company that took
the longest or should I say worse fall
of all of these as the company is down
fifty five percent in total sales pretty
much still owning forty five percent of
the market but showing us that
definitely the SmartWatch market is in a
desperate need of a revamp let's see
what we get this year now where Apple is
sort of celebrating we could say it that
way is in a smartphone market share
Samsung continues to reign supreme at
twenty four percent but the company is
down from twenty-eight percent market
share worldwide and then when it comes
to Apple surely it grew from 14.5 to
15.7 not a significant growth if you do
the numbers but then again it's really
interesting to see the two companies
that follow which are huawei
respectively and then Oppo owning the
fourth place in smartphone market share
that is rather interesting I'm speaking
of Samsung we finally get more renders
of the galaxy note 7 in full glory
everything you want to see about this
phone is up there but probably one of
the things that has is the most curious
is battery mainly because there are a
lot
conflicting rumors we heard 4,000
milliamp hours others said 3,000
milliamp hours today we hear from very
trusted sources that it's going to be a
3,500 milliamp hour battery which is
smaller than even the galaxy s7 edge and
if you're wondering exactly why Samsung
is going to launch a phone with a
smaller battery well sleekness is one
thing but definitely the other might be
that Snapdragon 823 processor stay tuned
we'll tell you more as soon as we learn
more and finally the very hot news today
have to do with the iphone 7 mainly
because some trust that analysts are
already predicting what to expect from
these new smartphones and notice these
because according to the analyst there
are some standard features that will be
shared by both iphones number one is
optical image stabilization on both
units which is a first ever since the
iphone 6 pretty much the second would be
the fact that there is this new home
button that's force touch enabled that's
one thing that was rumored recently but
the third and most important listen to
this professional-grade waterproofing
not water resistance waterproofing
meaning that apparently Apple finally
figured out a way to make this phone
waterproof which is something that other
manufacturers do not offer leading me to
the question of today what waterproofing
on this next-generation iphone Lori to
buy one notice the others are water
resistant meaning that Apple finally
figured something out and that would
probably make it compelling at least for
me but we would love to know your
opinion in the comments down below
