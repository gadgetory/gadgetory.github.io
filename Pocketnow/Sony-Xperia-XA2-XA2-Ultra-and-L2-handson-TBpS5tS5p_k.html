few years completely ignoring the United
States market when it comes to mobile
devices
it seems that Sony finally decided to
make a comeback and this time in a good
way this is high metal Yvette and Jules
wrong with pocket now and let's talk
about Sony at CES 2018 keep in mind that
the offerings that we see at CES or what
Sony calls the high mid-range and the
mid range no flagships to report on so
don't expect features like stereo
speakers or water resistance etc at a
glance you'd assume that the design
language is the same but it actually
isn't the glass packs have been replaced
with aluminum and this time we have
fingerprint scanners at the back that
actually work in the United States the
l2 is the least remarkable of the bunch
we have a 5.5 inch 720p display that
brings bezels on all sides we have a
mediatek processor with three gigs of
RAM and 32 gigs of expandable storage
cameras are 13 and 8 megapixels and we
presume that the price tag will reflect
the lesser specs included its user
interfaces Sony all over though running
on top of Android 7.1.1 nougat the X a 2
and X 8 to ultra are pretty much
siblings and most of the obvious things
both share the same Snapdragon 630
processor the same primary 23-minute
pixel camera the same design elements
across the board up to the fact that the
display hides the bezels on the sides
the display looks wide but it's really
just 16 by 9 aspect ratio at 1080p
resolution on both obviously the ultra
has a larger 6-inch display versus 5.2 a
larger battery at 35 80 milliamp hours
versus 3300 the ultra has more RAM at 4
gigs and its maximum storage varies in
32 and 64 gigs of expandable options
where the small variant only has 32 gigs
of expandable storage
another interesting kick is that the X a
2 Ultra sports 2 selfi cameras one with
16 megapixels and OAS and the other of 8
megapixels and a wide 120 degrees field
of view and yeah there's even a flash
here to bring better photos in low light
we've got a Sony proprietary user
interface on top of Android a toe or
heel on both variants and I'm actually
not gonna complain as the UI feels and
looks fluid so far there are various
color options for all three devices
these all feel premium in the hand
thinks of their aluminum feel and about
my only complaint are the sharp corners
for economics we also got to see other
products from Sony like the Xperia e R
concept which are open headphones free
to mind your surroundings while you
commute we also got to see the Xperia
hello robot which is supposed to assist
people in Japan and we even got to see
the experience such projector now as a
more finalized product let us know in

offerings and while you're at that
