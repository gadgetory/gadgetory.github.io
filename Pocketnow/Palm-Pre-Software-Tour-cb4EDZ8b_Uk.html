going to do it quick software tour of
the plum creek first off we have our
launcher you can do that I'm flicking up
from the home screen and we have our for
customer customizable icons and our
launcher icon at the bottom so first one
is the phone and if we flick up on the
gesture area here we've minimized that
program you can go to the next here's
our contacts these are flick scrolling
look up like that we minimize it again
going to put through like this next is
calendar that's going to load our
calendar up here we have ability to show
different calendars from google or
exchange you know multiple calendars
that i'll have different colors there's
one from google and this is nice if kind
of collapse those free time to give you
hell easier view of all the appointments
there's no year view that week day and
month this month
and wait for it okay it shows shaded
areas where you have appointments and
then my fat next is email on email
there we go
here's my accounts I guess
know how I got the added count and this
has nice unified inbox that shows all
the emails from all the different counts
based on when they were received so
that's good I got to do a back gesture
to get back to the accounts and our
different counts there I can go straight
to gmail
and open an email we have zooming
capabilities with a double tap or with
your multi-touch pinching stuff it's
just kind of a pain to do sometimes come
on now i can forward this or reply those
are the commands of bottom now let me
show you copy pasting get our keyboard
out
you got to put your cursor in there but
we can't seem to do it there we go
all right well it doesn't work over
there I can do it up here so I got to
get your cursor and it's kind of
difficult to get an accurate cursor
insertion point with a finger and then I
have to hold down the shift key and that
brings me is some arrows there and I can
do a lot of swiping to select stuff that
I want that was too much there we go and
now if I pull my finger and then do copy
for Part C for copy I copied it I put my
cursor up there and I hold my finger and
press the V now paste it so that's
pretty nice shortcuts we got them also
up here pay stuff like that now got two
of them so that's that copy paste not
bad kind of difficult with a finger next
is our launcher and we'll show you what
else
I got different sections wallpaper photo
roll all images so the photo role is the
ones that took with the camera see how
those look rotates and zooms the double
tap or with your multi touch
now that's fun
messaging these are text messages and
instant messages on aim or google talk I
tap that up here I can tap at and see
which aim google talk for text messaging
I want to use to reply and that's that I
go back this button shows our buddies
not online right now next we have
music music
so I go back
sometimes gesture doesn't work this is
really really great i love the shuffle
all button at the top I don't have to go
in here and find the artist I want to
order it's just straight away chef
allowance guys playing half i push it
goes to the next track that makes it
doesn't always do it instantly but that
makes it really easy to switch tracks
while you're in the car because we don't
have to look at these buttons down here
now what else is nice is when the music
player is playing you got this little
icon down here and you can still access
the next previews and play tracks button
is rather like to start playing again so
that's really nice i love that feature
expert videos
come on and this syncs with itunes so
pretty nice quality it can load it
so that's good
and also have notes memos
with a fun little graphic pushpins pass
these do sync with exchange unlike some
devices up oh no dismiss onions cars to
free up memory can't do anymore and a
close them
oh that one came back so if you run out
of memory you have to manually close a
bunch of these programs whereas you know
windows mobile try to close them for you
unused ones Google Maps orissa clock
this is just the clock and you have
alliance
yep pretty basic
leaves are some programs that i
downloaded accuweather tweed but uh I go
to this side these are some spring added
programs you have the app catalog try
that
wait for that to load youtube amazon
that blows come back to that app store
oh hey
and you can look around here find all
these different programs to download and
same with amazon mp3 download music
pretty good sprint navigation is there
gps navigation program with voice
prompts so that's a important thing to
have for me
and it's getting GPS so that we'll talk
and this is a really great package
chillax my music this place to music
stand time excellent really quick we
have some document viewers calculator
nascar sprint TV and over here are the
settings yeah yadda yadda bluetooth all
right take him too long settings are
kind of on the simple side but i think
that can be a good thing so we don't
have much to do here because too many
settings might be confusing complex so i
think that's what the pre is going for
simplicity alright that's enough for now
with the software or check out our full
