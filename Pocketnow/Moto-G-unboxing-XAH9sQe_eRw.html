and it's time to get it out of the box
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is our unboxing of the Motorola
MOTO G what we're looking at here today
is not a device that is just the biggest
baddest thing on the market but it's
something that we've all been really
wanting to get our hands on to see what
it's really all about it's not the
biggest baddest thing it doesn't have
the fastest processor or the best camera
it doesn't promise any of that but what
it does have is a very compelling price
point this is the Moto G from Motorola
and it's sort of like the smaller
cheaper sibling to the Moto X this one
is much cheaper this is the 16 gigabyte
model and it retails for a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars and the eight
gigabyte model retails for a hundred and
seventy nine dollars so it's very very
cheap and its internals aren't terrible
they're not great but they're not
terrible so before we get too far into
this we'd like to thank our friends at
clove for supplying us for this review
loaner if you'd like your own you can go
to clove and order one right now
so without any further delay let's get
inside this box and see what this foam
is all about as you can see it's very
easy to open the box but we're gonna set
the device aside it's just right there
we'll get to that in a minute
under this flap there's really not a lot
to get excited about there is a micro
USB cable for charging and data transfer
and a few pamphlets
they've got safe smart protected let's
get started guide and removal of the
battery door a little explanation of how
to remove the battery door and that's it
I can't be too upset because this device
cost about a third of what most
smartphones cost off contract and yeah
you can't expect too much to be in the
box so right off the bat you can tell
this is very very similar to the Moto X
there are some differences and you can
see them immediately especially if
you've spent any time with the Moto X
for one the speaker grille is different
the front facing camera is on the other
side and there's a little more trim here
you can't see that without the display
on but we'll get to that in a minute the
speaker grille is a little different and
there are just a few slight differences
all around the device that really kind
of show how different it is and we have
our custom Moto X here and you can see
the camera placement and reading
are very similar but the speakers are on
opposite sides so there's that they both
have the dimple they both have the same
plate port placement which is your three
your USB microUSB on the bottom 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the top
power and volume rocker placement are
very similar and the phones look a lot
alike you can tell that they're very
similar very closely related but one of
the biggest differences and if we can
get this display turned on really
quickly that's the biggest difference
right there that you're going to see at
least design wise is this display is not
edge to edge this one is so there's that
but this is a five point four point five
inch 720p display it has a Snapdragon
400 on the inside so it's a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core CPU it has 1
gigabyte of RAM and the camera around
back is 5 megapixels so it doesn't have
the clear pixel camera that's a 5
megapixel camera basically this is a
bare-bones
smartphone but it has a bare-bones price
so for a hundred and seventy nine
dollars or 199 in this case this is a
very very impressive smartphone so
there's a lot to be said for a device
that costs about the same as any other
device on contract but offers you know
decent specifications and a very similar
build quality to one of our favorite
smartphones this year the Moto X so
we're gonna get very friendly with this
device and learn the ins and outs of it
we're going to be comparing it to other
devices namely the Moto X and we'll get
back to you with some reviews and
comparison videos as well as some other
editorials about this phone in
particular so stay tuned for all of that
