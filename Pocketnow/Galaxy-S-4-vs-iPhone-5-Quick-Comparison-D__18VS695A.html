so no doubt Apple is looking at the
Galaxy s4
when it comes to this big launch and how
do they compare let's take a look I've
got very different design philosophies
here we've got metal on the back on the
iPhone and plastic on the back on the
galaxy s4 and the Galaxy s4 is thinner
than it's ever been but not enough to
beat the iPhone if we put them down on
the table the iPhone is like half a
millimeter thick thinner it's it's very
impersonal looking on the on the back
here they look so different don't they
we've got a 13 megapixel camera on the
galaxy s4 we've got an 8 megapixel
camera on the iPhone 5 we've got much
smaller screens 4 inches versus a full 5
inches and what's interesting is Samsung
was able to keep a similar size to the
Galaxy s3 in fact they made it a little
bit smaller in terms of width and height
but they made the screen so just a
really interesting look here we're going
to turn on both devices we're at maximum
screen brightness on both we've got
AMOLED screen technology here on the
galaxy s4 and of course LCD technology
so LCD gives you that crazy bright white
right so we're going to go into the
browser and try to get some whites on
the screen and as you can see the whites
I don't know what page this is the white
is much whiter on the iPhone 5 compared
to the Galaxy s4 just because that's the
way that the you know this is the way
where the pixel crumble that's the way
the pixel chroma so but if we take a
look at we put on the notification shade
and we try to compare the black here of
the black on the iPhone you know the
iPhone comes pretty close it's it's a
little bit more washed out on the iPhone
because it's not a mo
so two very very different devices Apple
still going with a high quality thing
with the metal and the glass and the
chamfered edges and Samsung's not shying
away from Beauty either this nice
polished edge around the around the
perimeter of the screen looks a lot like
what came on the galaxy s3 but this time
it's more pronounced it catches the
light if I move it in the light you can
really see how this kind of looks a
little bit like I'm not gonna say
jewelry because you know but it looks
very attractive kind of like if you tilt
the iPhone 5 in the light if you can
ignore all the bangs and the dents and
the dings we've got a lot more coming up
on the galaxy s4 stay tuned to pocket
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
