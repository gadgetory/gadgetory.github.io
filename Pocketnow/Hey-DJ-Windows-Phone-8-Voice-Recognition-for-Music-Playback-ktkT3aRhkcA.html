calm and I'm in the car today to show
you a new Windows Phone 8 app that lets
you control your music with your voice
without having to touch the phone at all
so it's called hey DJ now let's check it
out
so first of all I have to do is touch
the Bluetooth headset button there's my
Bluetooth car kit right now I have the
phone plugged into the stereo with a 3.5
millimeter headset jack I'm not going to
touch it I'm just going to press the
Bluetooth button
hey DJ surprise me and the screen went
off hopefully it'll come back on there
we go and it's playing something random
on my device now let's try it again I'm
gonna say something different
hey DJ play artist Joss Stone play
artists just done
so I can play artists now let's do a
genre hey DJ play genre country play
Johanna country that's gonna load a
different playlist so there's some
country music and now what's something
cool about this is that it's actually
able to play both music on my device as
well as music in my xbox cloud
collection
so let's look up here this one is on my
device but sometimes it'll show music
from the cloud collection which is
pretty cool so let's pause this and look
at what can I say here the options so
you can say play artist blah blah blah
and it lists all the artists that it
recognizes and here's a genre you can
also play playlists so here's some
playlists on my device this one is
actually in the cloud collection and
there's albums of course you can play
song and here's other so surprise me or
play all and there you go and we see a
nice background image we see now plane
I believe some of these are cloud
collection and we see a history you can
pin it to your Start screen in case we
want to touch it to activate it there's
some settings but this is a really great
feature for Windows Phone 8 now that it
supports third-party extension of the
speech interface because well back in
2003 Microsoft had this feature in their
windows mobile phones but somewhere
along the way it got lost it's now it's
back it does not support smart DJ which
would be really cool maybe in that
upgrade some time and it also does not
support showing artwork in the music and
videos hub so let's start playing that
again we get a screen saver but we don't
get the actual artist artwork you see it
doesn't recognize as playing through the
Xbox music hub so there's a look at hey
DJ a free app for Windows Phone 8 that
gives you hands-free music plane
capabilities on Windows Phone 8 be sure
to give this video a thumbs up and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
