checking out the new vaio duo 11 here at
IFA in Berlin this is the slider hybrid
PC that was leaked a few weeks ago this
is running Windows 8 you can see the
Metro interface here but in addition we
can hop right back into the standard
desktop interface there as far as the
hardware goes want to just pop back into
Metro because it's prettier for the
moment there's a lot of ports here we've
got a USB port HDMI out is supported and
power button there sorry on the other
side here at a serial port and an SD
card slot this is much more actual pc
than simply a tablet
and we can see that if I can figure out
how to work on mechanics there we are
with full keyboard so hence slider
hybrid this is functioning on an Intel
Core I six backed up by an amount of RAM
that I have forgotten it's configurable
that's right that's why I forgot it and
SSD configurations are also configurable
and we also have stylus support this is
Microsoft OneNote I believe with palm
rejection so you can kind of let on a do
your duty thing and pressure sensitivity
as well for lights and hard touch
processor it's running Windows 8/rt so
your best of the patients will run
exactly
pop back into Metro they're a lot more
on this as we get a little bit more
familiar with it for now it is a very
fully featured windows 8 device the lot
of accessories and what looks like a lot
of fun a lot of work abilities Tony
behind the camera I'm Michael this is
IFA in Berlin in the pocket now calm
stay tuned for more thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
