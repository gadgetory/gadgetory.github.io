mobile OS but we're here to sift through
them and find the best for you I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
these are the top five social apps for
Android a large portion of mobile usage
is social sure a lot of gaming and
multimedia consumption goes on but let's
not forget that these are primarily
communication devices with entertainment
capabilities on the side so what are the
social applications you should know
about of course the official
applications are always a great place to
start
Google+ Facebook Twitter Instagram vine
etc but it would be pointless to make a
list of standard first party
applications you probably already know
about so we did some digging through
Google Play to find the best third party
social apps for Android these are our
top 5 picks since I first tried Android
I've been on a never-ending search to
find the perfect Twitter client for me
it's the most engaging in fun social
network out there the fun is in the
limitation being forced to keep it brief
to date I've been through dozens of
Twitter clients for Android and the only
one I found myself coming back to is
Plume mainly because it's the most
stable and reliable Twitter client I've
come across on Android a few contenders
have arrived over the last year or so
like Falcon Pro carbon Twitter etc even
twit and one ladders tweet castor have a
decent fanbase
but in my experience Bloom has the best
combination of additional features
aesthetics and reliability it's also
great for managing multiple accounts
it's not the greatest Twitter client
I've ever used and had Falcon Pro not
ran into issues with API token limits it
would have likely made the list in the
place of plume but that's not the case
and plume takes the cake it's available
for free but to remove the ads you will
have to cough up $4.99 speaking of
Twitter clients and not being able to
leave plume I may have to recant that
statement in the near future I've
recently been using an up-and-comer in
the Android space talent for Twitter
it's sleek beautiful and impact with
useful features like an in-app browser
emoji sport and talent pool the closest
thing you're going to get to push
notifications on Android from a
third-party client
it's an always-on listener service which
will notify you of the types of
notifications you want to receive in
real time Talon has a robust theme
engine with some built-in UI
customizations to boot it also has many
more features to tweak in the settings
the only reason this clay
has a completely replaced plume yet is
reliability it's still very new and not
all the issues have been resolved quite
yet but it's well on its way to becoming
my favorite Twitter client for Android
it's currently only 199 of course a list
of social apps wouldn't be complete
without a reddit client on Android I've
tried a few and mostly have been back
and forth between bacon reader and
reddit sync Pro note that both of these
have ad supported versions which are
free and both premium and free options
are $1.99 ultimately I chose Redick
Saint for the UI it's simply gorgeous
it's also laid out better making it
easier to navigate and use it's a fairly
basic app but it has several settings to
tweak including various UI
customizations and other settings for
sync if your redditor reddit sync pro is
easily one of if not the best reddit
clients on Android
I've made videos about buffer a few
times now what it does is rather simple
but if you want an easy way to manage
multiple Twitter and Facebook accounts
as well as Google+ pages with post
scheduling buffer is one of the best
options out there essentially you create
a buffer account and log in to all the
servers as you want to connect from
there you can create various posting
schedules for each account and begin
buffering posts from Chrome feedly Plume
or wherever you find things to share
send them to buffer select which
accounts you want to share to and it
takes care of the rest I use buffer each
and every day to manage my own accounts
as well as some Facebook and Google+
pages I manage on top of sharing you get
analytics from within buffer if you
share a lot of links or manage more than
one account buffer is a must-have not to
mention the app is completely free as
well as the service but if you need more
features you can upgrade to a pro
account
finally Flipboard it's an incredibly
popular application for many reasons
it's not only a news reader it's a
social reader login to your social
accounts in Flipboard will integrate all
the RSS feeds you follow with your
Facebook newsfeed
Twitter timeline and Google+ posts and
those are only a few of the accounts you
can add to your Flipboard essentially it
lays out all your need-to-know
information into a beautiful magazine
format you can also curate content into
your own magazine for others to follow
Flipboard is also free of charge folks
that's going to do it if we've missed

Android be sure to drop them in a
