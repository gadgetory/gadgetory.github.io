pocketnow.com and today we're unboxing
the highly anticipated HTC Touch pro2
this device will see a release on most
major carriers across the world and will
undoubtedly get a lot of attention from
the smartphone community it already has
there's a ton of excitement around this
device so we're really really excited to
finally get the chance to unbox it here
so without further ado let's get to it
the unboxing experience will probably be
about the same that it was for the touch
diamond2 and we're gonna do some
comparison shots in the in a minute they
did away with the diamonds like boxing
that they had for the previous
generation touch pro so let's see what
it's like for the touch pro2
yep the same kind of box here so HTC has
brought back the popular tilting screen
that was made popular by the Titan 2 on
the ATT tilt they've also added a much
larger screen super high resolution WVGA
this is the European version so it won't
work in the US unless you don't mind not
getting 3G data so you could put an AT&amp;amp;T
SIM card or t-mobile SIM card and get an
edge data if that's good enough for you
so let's get inside the box ok let's
take a look at the device in a second
all right let's see what we have in the
box we have some looks like stereo
stereo headphones usual stuff we've got
the USB charger ok of course the wall
plug with non-us plug an extra style is
good and wow look it's actually sober
very nice very nice touch and the
battery which is of size 1500 million
powers pretty good size and Wow is this
actually a case great HTC included a
case just as they should for a
professional device like this let's
let's do the smell test and see if it's
real leather yes it is real leather very
high quality smooth leather - this is a
really nice case Tibet it's not a
holster just like the HTC Touch pro came
with a sleeve this is kind of sort of
like a sleeve in itself it's not made to
go in your belt or anything like that
and then we got some literature inside
of the box let's see what we have here
software HTC Touch pro2 wow so exciting
that we're finally getting a chance to
unbox this I'm getting started
other stuff and other stuff HTC included
a screen protector very nice with a
cutout for the front-facing video camera
and warranty accessories blah blah blah
let's get to the device
all right so here we are wow it's a big
device but it feels thinner much much
thinner than the HTC touch pro and
absolutely the Titan 2 very big screen
nice flush touchscreen a nice spring
action Wow
look at this keyboard with the offset
layout keyboard feels the buttons don't
press in that much surprisingly but it
will take some getting used to let's see
how much the screen tilts it's actually
a pretty stiff oh there it goes Wow
amazing the tilting screen is great
because you can watch a movie on your
tabletop if you're doing GPS navigation
you can rest it on the dashboard in your
car it provides a better viewing angle
so that when you are typing you can tilt
the screen a little bit if the sun's in
your way but Wow a very very slick
device it feels so good in hand and of
course it has two microphones and two
speakers for that new speakerphone
technology that we've really appreciated
by business professionals very slick
device extremely high quality feeling in
hand I mean this is the this is the
cream of the crop in terms of build
quality the what's kind of weird and
what I'm noticing is that the screen
kind of sticks in this position and you
give it a little bit more force and then
it starts to rock it's kind of kind of
interesting so anyway let's take a look
at how this compares to other devices
we should definitely compare it to the
original tilting screen device the Titan
2 and of course that had a tilting
screen that tilts it actually a bit more
than the new Touch pro2
I'll show you that now so the touch pro2
doesn't tilt as much let's take a look
at how they compare in terms of size
yeah that the Titan 2 has gotten a lot
of use so excuse the dirtiness of the
screen the touch pro2 is much larger but
it also looks a lot nicer it's got
chrome all around the edges a much
larger screen of course the the screen
resolution is much higher on the touch
pro2 in terms of thickness much thinner
and it's got a nice silver coating to it
which is good because this is not going
to be a fingerprint magnet surprised to
hear that be said of
course the screen will be but what do
you expect so let's take a look at at
the touch pro2 next to its predecessor
the touch pro and same deal here it's a
much larger device with a much larger
screen a different configuration of
hardware keys here we don't have a d-pad
on the touch pro2 but we do on the the
original touch pro much thinner and like
I said it really feels thin in hand
compared to a device like this and let's
take a quick comparison of the keyboards
a much more spacious keyboard on the
touch pro2 and of course you have this
offset layout which will help a lot with
ergonomic sigh think and let's take a
look at how it compares to the diamond 2
about the same size the screen sizes are
a little bit different 3.2 inches here
and 3.6 inches here and of course it's
going to be thicker than the diamond 2
because of the inclusion of the keyboard
so we've got a lot more coming up on the
HTC Touch pro2 we have more videos and
of course the full review coming soon

they ship internationally that's it for
now we'll be back with more very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
