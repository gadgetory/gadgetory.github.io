ever wondered what the recovery image is
what it does why do we have it that's
what we're going to talk about on this
episode of the Android power user so the
recovery image just what is that well
first we need to talk about Android and
the way that it's set up no I'm not
talking about icons and widgets and all
that kind of stuff I'm talking about the
way you well to put it in PC lingo the
way the hard drive is partitioned does
that make sense okay so what we've got
is we have essentially a system image
now that system images is where the
operating system lives it's where you
know your apps go that's over in the
data side and whatnot but there's
another part and that's the recovery
image and you don't use it all that
often fact really the only time you use
it is when you're applying an update so
let's say you've got a perfectly stock
Android and you get an over-the-air
update it's got to install somehow now
it's going to download essentially an
update dot zip file and inside that is a
manifest and a whole bunch of other
stuff instructions and files essentially
that says here's what you need to do to
apply this update now it might be named
something different but for the sake of
clarity we'll just call it the update
dot zip all right good deal
and it is it's just a zip file you can
open this thing up on your desktop
computer and look at all the stuff
that's in it you can't do much with it
on your desktop computer except flash it
on your Android but hey you know it's
always fun to look inside zip files
anyhoo so once that file is downloaded
on to your machine it triggers something
and that something is a reboot into
recovery now most people call it
recovery mode or just simply recovery or
who knows what else people call it but
it's your recovery image and it varies
by device when your stock OEM they look
pretty much the same in fact all you're
really gonna see when you're applying an
over-the-air update is a download
and a prompt to say hey do you want to
apply this you say yes it'll say okay
I'm rebooting make sure you don't unplug
it make sure you have a full battery
yada yada yada and it goes ahead and it
applies that update after it reboots so
reboots into this super special recovery
mode and you basically see a status
indicator that says hey I'm applying the
update please wait and you might even
have a status bar and then it's done and
it reboots into your system image and
that's it okay but that that's not
really cool that doesn't make you an
Android power user what makes you an
Android power user is knowing just like
being able to swap out your system image
or say a custom ROM a okp CyanogenMod
whatever you can swap out your recovery
image in fact if you want to do a custom
ROM you pretty much have to replace your
recovery image so how do you install a
new custom recovery image on your device
I can't go into details and specifics on
every single device suffice it to say
you're gonna need a desktop computer
you're gonna need a DB and fastboot and
you're going to need the recovery image
that you're going to apply and of course
every recovery image is specific to
every device out there so you can't use
one recovery image on another device
you've got to get the one specific to
yours
after that it's essentially just
flashing that recovery image which is in
a dot IMG file over onto your Android
which will overwrite the existing
recovery image so if you wanted to go
back to stock too late after that unless
you go back in restore the factory
recovery image which you can do just as
simple as flashing a custom recovery
image okay once that's installed it's
pretty easy to reboot into your recovery
image now the way you do that again
varies by device usually you're holding
the the up volume down volume and the
power button and it just does it or
maybe just the down volume and the power
button again it varies by device it's
quick search you're gonna find out how
to do that once you've got it
you can do whatever that recovery image
lets you do so for the remainder of this
video I'm gonna talk clockworkmod
recovery
CWM for short or just clockworkmod what
that recovery image lets you do of
course you can boot up into it and you
can flash stuff you can apply other
images system images you can fly updates
you can install new kernels we'll talk
about those in an upcoming video you can
do backups you can do restores you can
fix permissions you can do a whole bunch
of maintenance inside that recovery
image and I like it quite a bit
now you don't manually have to go in
there if you've got some other tool
we've talked about a couple of those
over at pocketnow.com that let you
specify what you want to do in the GUI
on the Android side of things the system
image side like I've got ROM manager and
I want to install an update to
CyanogenMod nightly I can do that
through the GUI and the GUI essentially
sends a parameter string down to the
recovery image as it reboots and it does
it all automatically for me so although
I technically see the recovery image I'm
not pushing any buttons I'm not
navigating around I'm not telling it to
do anything there because I did it all
in the GUI and it just handed everything
off makes it very simple but that's all
in the recovery image that's what that's
doing for you I highly recommend
clockworkmod recovery if only for the
fact that you can do full system backups
with that very nice very convenient I
liked it quite a bit and it saved my
bacon more than once so hat tip off to
you clockworkmod recovery that's just a
quick overview of what the recovery
image is why we have it what it does and
a little bit of how it does it if you'd
like more information of course head on
