pocketnow.com about half the
smartphone's that come out nowadays have
digital zoom but we don't really talk
about the digital zoom because well
digital zoom is horrible it just blows
up the pixels as if you're zooming in on
the screen it doesn't really serve any
purpose in most situations well in for
some people in some lines of work
digital zoom actually does matter we got
an email from someone named Mark who is
a real estate agent and he wants to be
able to take pictures of properties and
use the zoom in some situations so in
this video we're going to compare the
digital zoom of Android with iPhone and
Windows Phone 7 these three devices
happen to have digital zoom but again
about half the devices out there just
don't have it so we're gonna do a
comparison in this video let's get to it
now how can we possibly test digital
zoom well here's an attempt I've got a
reading chart on the wall up there it
just says some words it starts in a very
big font and it progressively decreases
in font size if I use the optical zoom
on this camera which is very very good
we'll be able to see everything so I'm
going to zoom in hopefully you don't get
motion sickness and as you can see you
can see the smallest line there okay so
keep that in mind now we're going to
take out each cone and try to zoom in on
the words through the same distance away
from the reading chart to see which one
of them has the best digital zoom again
we're going for quality so we want to be
able to actually read the words and it's
a bonus if you can read the words that
are all the way at the bottom of the
page there which represent the smallest
font so I'm going to take out the camera
starting with the inspire 4G it's gonna
be a little bit tricky to get this to
work
so right now through the camera lens you
cannot see the words let's do some
digital zoom action here
okay we're zoomed in all the way and we
really still can't see the words I can
tell you from behind the camera I can
see the top line it says this is a smart
phone reading chart the second one is
blurry and so on and so forth so not so
good here on Android on the inspire 4G
let's bring out the iPhone so the iPhone
has sort of a different zoom mechanism
and again let's see if we can position
it just right on the camera okay so
that's pretty good now we have to tap
the screen to bring up the zoom tool and
let's zoom in all the way okay a little
bit better we can read the top line this
is a smart phone reading chart the next
one the quick brown fox the next one I
really can't make out too well so at
least lines one and two are legible here
on the iPhone remember with the Android
phone the inspire 4G we only could see
line one let's turn that off and go to
the next phone the the Windows Phone 7
all Windows Phone 7 devices will have
digital zoom and here we go again
so although we zoomed out we can't see a
thing but if I tap the plus icon plus
plus plus plus okay we zoomed in
probably the most out of any of the
devices this is a smart phone reading
chart the quick brown fox I think that
says jumped
I don't know what line three sets but
sort of maybe you can even say it in
this video I think it says yeah I did
type this so I should know what it says
but I kind of forgot fox jumped over
okay so lines 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 are legible it
looks like Windows Phone 7 is the winner
here in having digital zoom so that
answers your question which platform
generally speaking has the best best
digital zoom the answer seems to be
Windows Phone 7 so if you can think of a
smartphone that has a better digital
zoom please post a comment and let us
know
thanks for watching and that's it for
now
