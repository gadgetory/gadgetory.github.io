like to say and it's not just something
OMS are trying to force down our throats
big smartphones with big screens make a
better match for our ever-changing use
cases they're arguably better for
playing games reading browsing the web
hacking through your emails on the go
and just about anything else you can
imagine
except for calls of course if you're not
into the big phone craze you're almost
out of luck all the so called mini
versions of high-end smartphones
unnecessarily sacrifice specifications
in favor of a more pocket-friendly form
factor Sony wants to change that the
Xperia z3 compact is by today's
standards a high-end smartphone but it's
much smaller than your average hero
phone is it worth the buy though that's
the real question I'm Taylor Martin with
pocket now and this is our review of the
Sony Xperia z3 compact
we want to extend one final thanks to
our friends over a clove for supplying
us with an xperia z3 compact for review
visit clove code at UK to see about
getting your very own z3 compact or to
browse hundreds of other mobile products
for sale if you've used any of the Sony
smartphones from the last 18 months the
design of the z3 compact will not strike
you as odd or unusual it features the
very same design languages all Sony's
recent phones like the newer Xperia z3
the compact features the slightly more
rounded edges however its edges aren't
the high-quality metal like found on the
z3 instead it has translucent
polycarbonate edges which aren't exactly
unusual for Sony otherwise it's the same
square hard edged chassis sandwiched
between two slabs of glass you get the
same protruding silver power standby
button covered ports to uphold the ip68
certification and dual front firing
speakers which were first introduced on
the z2 and while the bezels aren't the
thinnest we've ever seen the z3 compact
is very light on wasted space it has to
be it crams a four point six inch
display into a tiny little package which
is slimmer and neater than the beloved
Moto X it's just 129 grams 127 point
three millimeters tall 64 point 9
millimeters wide and eight point six
millimeters thick
somehow it maintains its small nature
without sacrificing hardly any
specifications it has 2 gigabytes of RAM
16 gigabytes of fixed storage with a
micro SD card slot for up to 128
additional gigabytes a fixed 2600
milliamp hour battery a Snapdragon 801
SOC with a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core Krait
400 CPU and a twenty point seven
megapixel camera with a physical shutter
button and has Wi-Fi 802 and Bluetooth
Low Energy the only factor that might
turn some potential buyers away is the
4.6 inch display obviously its size it's
in the catch
it's the resolution 720p that's a total
of 319 pixels per inch the triluminos
panel is extra vibrant thanks to the
x-reality Engine blacks are deep and
despite the 720p it's still pretty sharp
honestly we can't find many bad things
to say about this display except for
maybe the side visibility viewing angles
aren't the best if you're after a very
pocketable phone and you're okay with
some port covers and double the exposed
glass the z3 compact is as good as it
gets
under 4.7 inches it's pretty built
exceptionally well and Sony polls nope
punches on the hardware the same goes
for software it's running Android 4.4.4
beneath Sony's custom skin and some
improvements have been made since the
last time we looked at Sony's UI more
themes are available some third-party
small apps have been added to the mix
and the overall look has improved we're
huge fans of some of the work sony has
done in the settings app the ability to
toggle certain info off and on in the
status bar is something every Android
phone should have likewise the ability
to clear some missed notifications out
of the status bar without removing them
from the notification shade it's
something will sorely miss when using
other devices even the appearance of the
home screens is more stock like from the
edit pages function to the app drawer it
looks a lot like the Google now launcher
it's frothy and snappy and we rather
like it but not everything is perfect
the bloat is an issue some apps come
pre-installed to show off the camera
applications function plugins to use
directly from within the camera app and
we're not fans of how hard Sony pushes
its own content stores the what's new
app is accessed with an inappropriately
placed shortcut to the left of the
Google now shortcut the Sony specific
content only really benefits you if you
own other Sony products like a ps4 if
you do you're going to be able to get
more out of your Sony mobile products in
the not-too-distant future in all we're
happy with most of the changes Sony made
to its software it's actually improved
the Android experience some and it
offers enough customizations for users
to make their phone truly theirs without
sacrificing user experience and
cluttering the UI with too many
frivolous features performance is an
area where the z3 compact leaves other
smartphones in the same class in the
dust it screams through everyday tasks
without hesitation scrolling switching
apps pinch zooming returning home and
everything else is buttery smooth it
slices through synthetic benchmarks and
is especially great at gaming and
multimedia playback
despite its 720p display the front
firing audio is a huge plus and we
haven't had a single notable issue with
this phone's performance at all it
definitely holds its own even amongst
its larger high-end competition
technically the z3 compact isn't
optimized for use here in the States but
it works just fine on t-mobile with all
the proper band support we've gotten
respectable data speeds and call quality
was acceptable we plan to really test
this more over the weekend in different
parts of the state so look for more
in-depth information in the written
portion of the review next week likewise
we'll really put the battery to the test
over the weekend but so far it's been
fantastic averaging well over four and a
half hours of screen on time per charge
that's while snapping tons of photos
browsing the web benchmarking playing
games and syncing several social and
email accounts we'll put it this way in
the time we've been testing it we
haven't needed to enable one of the many
power saving modes yet the camera is
easily one of the highlights of this
phone but there's more to it than that
you're going to have to put in work to
get great photos out of the z3 compact
by default it shoots pictures at 8
megapixels using the superior auto mode
this mode does a fantastic job of
picking just the right settings for any
given shooting conditions at the expense
of a lot of resolution if you want to
shoot at full resolution you'll be
shooting in 4:3 aspect ratio and you'll
have to switch to manual mode for
someone who knows what they're doing
it's not so bad maybe a little
cumbersome to have to manually tweak
several settings each time you snap a
photo but in both modes the camera
captures lots of details with very sharp
focus
the downside is color reproduction and
like competing smartphone cameras the z3
compact airs heavily on the cool side
taking lots of dull and drab photos it's
nothing you can't fix with a photo
editor after the fact but it's
definitely something to be aware of and
low-light the digital stabilization is
great often making very dark scenes much
brighter than they actually are
depending on your preferences that could
be a good or bad thing personally we
fall though low-light shots turn out
very muddy with very little detail but
we guess it's better to have bright
muddy pictures than pitch-black pictures
overall the camera is very capable but
it may not be the best camera for
someone just wanting pictures to turn
out great every single time with no
hassle in all the Xperia z3 compact is a
fantastic little phone Sony did a
wonderful job scaling down the z3 its
footprint is small enough to actually be
considered compact its specs are in line
with many 2014 flagships and it has all
the great features found on the Xperia
z3 we're not completely done testing
this phone so we'll have more for you in
the full written review next week
spoiler alert we really like this phone
and so will anyone looking for something
a little smaller than your average
smartphone without tons of compromises
the Xperia z3 compact is exactly what
every so-called mini smartphone should
have been all along
