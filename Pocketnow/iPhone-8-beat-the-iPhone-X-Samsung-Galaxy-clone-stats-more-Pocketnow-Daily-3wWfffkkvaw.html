that it's not as popular as many
speculated Samsung just won the crowd
for the most copied products of 2017 and
the battery nightmare of Apple is going
to bring you some benefits of you move
quick I'm high metal Ravana and there's
somebody that should show some delight
for Monday even though I try at least
I'm happy to be back home and back to a
regular schedule this is probably now
daily the official news today begin with
deals aveer in the market for the LG G
6n you should be as a the LG G 7 is
apparently not going to happen
at MWC or at least we don't expect it to
be NH currently has the g6 plus which
has a couple of higher specs currently
for $5.99 meaning it's 25% off that's
actually a good deal even though the p30
continues to be a better phone the deal
is actually compelling now let's talk
about Apple mainly because the whole
battery debacle is bringing the company
some drama that could benefit you mainly
if you have an iPhone 6 or 6 plus the
company is having a hard time getting
enough stock for all the replacements
it's getting so if you go to a store and
they don't have a unit they might end up
giving you an iPhone 6s or 6s plus you
learn more details in the description
now let's talk about Samsung as well the
company is about to launch the galaxy as
nine in a few weeks and we know how the
company plays with its camera sensors
some of them are sony some of them are
Samsung it's really hard to tell the
difference if any but we hear that the
company is bringing some major changes
to the focus capabilities and also the
low-light performance of the company's
own ISO cell sensors which don't work as
well for other companies as they work
for Samsung stay tuned
let's see how that plays out in the end
now since we're talking about Samsung
believe it or not the company has just
won the crown for the most cloned
devices of 2017 usually Apple held this
title you can go to certain countries
and certain regions and you can notice
that there are a ton of smartphones that
look a lot like the iPhone and are
obviously not and well it turns out that
this time the most clones came from
Samsung devices and clones up to the
point where they are pretty much and
even titled as a Samsung Galaxy
something
it's actually just a fake phone if you
can find a ton of those on eBay but yeah
it seems that Samsung won the crown we
have Apple nice as always and finally
the most interesting nuisance they have
to do with more analytics over what
phone sold the most in the holiday
season
pertaining to iPhones and for those of
you the thought that it would be the
iPhone 10 believe it or not no
apparently according to numbers only 20%
of iPhones that were sold included the
knotch
and then after that believe it or not
the film that sold the most was the
iPhone 8 the regular sized iPhone 8 24
percent and then trailed back by the
iPhone 8 plus and this is interesting I
mean ever since the iPhone 7 plus I
believe this phone that sold the most
was the plus variant were the one that
was hardest to get and now things are
flipping around it leads me to today's
question what do you think that is why
do you think the iPhone 8 sold more than
the iPhone 10 in my case I think that
it's just logical it's the least
expensive of all three phones obviously
there is a smaller price tag to pay and
also I mean the iPhone 8 was one it was
really good at number two the iPhone 10
was crazy expensive number three it was
harder to get the iPhone 10 as well
