pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at a windows phone
7 series theme for windows mobile 6.5
and six point five point three we are
starting to see a lot of these and be
sure to check out pocket now calm
wouldn't be talking a lot about these
themes so but even if you don't have
Windows going seven series you can make
your device sort of feel like it does
have it so let's take a look at what
this team brings it's a very basic theme
that doesn't work too well all the time
but this is in beta and so it's not
supposed to work perfectly well so we
have a few panels that we can do some
things on we can kind of move it up and
down and sometimes it's smooth and
sometimes it's not we can swipe to the
right to get the program list although
this isn't actually how it looks in
Windows Phone 7 series and we can tap
the back button we can also tap on
people and this will take you into the
sort of people hub although it's not
perfect of course here we've all people
you can scroll through the kinetics
aren't working too well we can go to the
right what's new and we can set up
facebook and that's really the extent of
the people area what you can do from
here is tap on the name of someone and
you can call them send text or back
although of course this is not how the
final windows phone 7 series is going to
look but it just gives you a little bit
of a feel we can use the back button
down here to go back to the home screen
and you're actually supposed to see some
other things here that aren't working on
the hd2 right now such as a little slide
show for my pictures and some other
things down here we can tap on this
search icon to bring up the bing search
application and it takes sticks a second
but here it is so we can quickly search
bing let's go back and these other
things are mostly program launchers so
we've got the phone which will go right
into the phone text messages and eat
outlook email so a lot of this isn't
functioning but you're beginning to see
how we're going to have some really cool
windows phone 7 series themes that will
give you that look and feel like I said
without you have actually having to get
the upgrade because most phones won't be
upgradable so we'll keep an eye on this
theme and report when it's in a better
shape that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
