lot new features and functionalities and
it just looks nicer but that's not my
favorite part I'm Joe Levi for PocketNow
my favorite part about Android lollipop
believe it or not is the setup process
the first thing you're gonna notice is
what a beautiful starting screen this is
this is the welcome screen that
everybody's going to get as soon as they
power on their Android powered device
running lollipop it's got a nice welcome
message and of course you can come in
and change what language and locale you
want and it changes the language is
right there as you'd expect it to I'm
gonna keep it at United States English
if we needed to at this point we could
make an emergency phone call we don't
need to let's continue with the setup
from here since this is going to require
talking back and forth to Google servers
and whatnot
it asks us if we want to set up a Wi-Fi
network I do I'm gonna set up my five
gigahertz Network and I'll go ahead and
put my password in for that and then
we'll connect goes and connects and
authenticates which takes just a minute
it checks that connection and this is
where we start waiting a little bit so
we're gonna do some cuts so that you
don't have to wait through the entire
process but we'll hit on all of the the
highlights next and this is wonderful if
you are upgrading from one device to
another device and both of those devices
have NFC and Bluetooth you can simply
tap one device to the back of the other
and it will transfer your account and
settings over to the new device so you
don't even have to put in a username and
password to do that now I did that
originally when I was going from my HTC
Desire eye which we've covered it here a
little bit of pocket now and it
transferred everything over I didn't
have to put in my my Google username I
didn't have to put in my Google password
I didn't have to do my 2-step
verification because I had that trusted
device that I was able to use so we're
going to go ahead and skip that because
I don't want to use that device because
I want to show you something else about
it at this point it's saying okay just a
minute let's go ahead and sign into your
Google account or we can skip that so
I'm going to put in my
account here and everybody knows how to
get ahold of me all over the place it
goes out and sees what kind of a
vlogging credential that I need so at
this point it's gonna have me put in my
password and once I've done that it says
hey my account is protected by a 2-step
verification so I need to do that I can
either use the Google Authenticator app
which I just erased off my device when I
reset it or I can hit this problems with
your code a link and that will let me
authenticate in some other way I can
either get the code from the app I can
have it call my phone on file which is
this one that might be a little bit
cumbersome or have it send a text
message again same problem or use a
backup code that I received from Google
so I'm going to go ahead and do that
from here I will put in that 8 digit
code and continue through once I've
input that code it will go through and
check everything make sure it's all
kosher and just a sec next and this is
really where the magic begins this is
going to go out and get my apps and my
data data being a very operative word
it's going to easily set up my device
for storing a backup from another device
and I have the option to choose which
device I want to restore from my Nexus 4
Nexus 5 the desire I that I just told
you about the HTC One eh that I did a
versus comparison on and some others I
like using the Nexus 4 that I had set up
previously just for this purpose so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that it then also
asks me from that device what apps do
you want me to include and here all of
the apps that I had installed on that so
we're gonna go ahead and let that
install all 54 apps and we will continue
next from here it's asking about my
Google services and other than a new
skin a new look and feel this is
essentially the same setup process that
you've become familiar to if you've had
an Android in the past so we'll go ahead
and continue next through that I'm
accepting all of the defaults there and
at that point we're at our tutorial so
okay to that and now you can see that
it's installing my applications and what
all of my my settings are here let me
and bump that brightness down for you so
it's a little bit easier to see on
camera once it does that it's going to
start setting everything up you can see
this is kind of the old launcher it
hasn't installed the Google now launcher
yet to to install and configure that so
we're gonna wait while it does that and
be right back the Google now launcher
has now installed I just hit the home
button and I am gonna switch from
launcher over to Google now launcher and
I'm gonna ask that that be always
that'll be my default launcher app now
the first thing that you're gonna notice
is I've got my calendar over here which
is loading I've got my icons all
arranged in folders including my my
dialer which has phone has the contacts
and if you'll notice this is my Hangouts
dialer and it's grayed out alright let's
go ahead and look at some of the others
I've got hangouts I've got Gmail over
here I've got Chrome I've got Google+
and Facebook and Twitter are there but
they're both greyed out and then of
course there's my camera we don't need
to see in there cuz that'll just show a
picture of the keyboard so I'm back here
and that's what I've got set up right
now I haven't opted in to to Google now
on the the far side so it's not letting
me go to that pain yet but I'm still
downloading and installing things but
it's configuring things exactly how I
had them before in addition to
downloading the apps so this just right
here is very very nice and it works with
widgets too which is something that
Android hasn't had very much of in the
past unless you got into some some
third-party launchers and whatnot but
now if I had 10 different widgets across
several different screens those widget
at least placeholders would be there
until that app downloaded and installed
and in the case of beautiful widgets I'd
be able to tap on it and go ahead and
configure that once it was installed but
like you're seeing here until the app
itself is installed there's a great out
placeholder they're already occupying
where that shortcut is going to be as
soon as you get it downloaded and
installed on your device now the one
thing that you are going to still have
to do and it's kind of a pain and I wish
they would do something about this but I
understand why they
don't if you come in and look at
accounts these are my accounts right now
as soon as Twitter and Facebook and
whatnot install I'm gonna have those
accounts in here as well but I'm going
to have to manually install or Emmanuel
II put my credentials back into those
settings instead of having them
automatically filled in being
transferred over for my other device now
that's because it's not a good idea to
put all of your passwords in one basket
there are some people who would argue
that with password managers and they
have legitimate reasons to that but in
this case where it's in the automated
restore they're good legitimate reasons
why we don't want to put all of our
credentials into that one place so that
they're all right there you have to go
back in and manually Rio tentacle which
is probably a good thing in this context
I'm going to go ahead and let this
continue to download install and
configure all the apps the same way that
I had them in the past it's a very nice
thing that I can just set this down walk
away and let it do its thing and don't
have to spend the next hour - setting
everything up the way that I liked it in
the past that's why it's my favorite new
feature in Android lollipop more or less
that's the process that you'll go
through and what you can expect when you
switch to a new device running lollipop
from a previous device running another
version of Android or lollipop itself if
you like this make sure you give the
video a thumbs up and subscribe to the
channel so you don't miss out on any of
the new tips and tricks that we're going
to have coming down the line for pocket
now I'm Joe Levi we'll catch you next
