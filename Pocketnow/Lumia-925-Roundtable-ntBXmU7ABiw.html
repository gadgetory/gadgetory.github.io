this like 11 times at least right guys
and YouTube hangouts are having some
technical difficulties but that's okay
because we are back and we are talking
about the the Lumia 925 we're just going
to sit around this metaphoric table here
and and talk about what it means for for
nokia what it means for Windows Phone
what it means in the general smartphone
industry but before we get started I'm
just going to recap some stuff here and
then we're going to let jaime michael
and taylor talk about what they think
about the Lumia 925 so what is the the
Lumia 925 there are a bunch of videos on
pocket now right now that you can see we
sent Tony to London and he got some
hands-on time with it it's basically
like a Lumia 920 but it's significantly
thinner and lighter so it's going from
10 point seven millimeters down to 8.5
the the weight is much less by about 40
grams going from 185 to 139 and there's
some interesting metal construction
going on the edges are actually aluminum
or aluminium as if you will yeah if you
will or Johnny I've and not so so kind
of a Lumia to bring up to speed with
what other manufacturers are doing
especially HTC an apple with the
aluminum thing it's coming to the u.s.
to t-mobile first and maybe 80 later and
then it's got some interesting software
stuff going on so for example it's got
this awesome double tap to unlock and
what that will do it will bring you to
your lock screen so it's not going to
bring you right into the phone but it'll
skip the step of you having to feel for
the camera button I are the standby but
it's also going to have a new Nokia
smart camera software which does some
really interesting stuff in action
scenarios so let's say you've got your
your friend running down a field and you
press the the action shot button it'll
take 10 shots and then there's a lot of
cool stuff you can do with it and by
way this is coming to the Lumia 920 and
other nokia models it also will actually
superimpose multiple images on top of
one another so you can actually see a
picture of your friend running down the
field and like three in three different
instances so some really cool software
there um I do have a question can I
interrupt you for a second go for it do
you know if they have the other
technology from schelotto I was talking
about that's actually it's because of
the purchase of schelotto that right all
these features on this smart camera yes
do you know if they have like the erase
feature and the rewind feature yeah it
does does that be great that's all I I I
do know that they have some blurring and
out of those ten shots you can I'm not
really sure if they have the erase
vietri yet I I haven't been able to
confirm that but I do know and they did
mention it in the keynote that because
because of their purchase with Schelotto
it would because of the acquisition
there including all these features and
they're involving them over time right
check it out or anyone you when you
google Schelotto yeah you come up with
grace collado Merline schelotto and scar
a lot of restaurant which is apparently
a great Italian place near city what the
hell are you guys talking about okay so
the technology we're talking about is
what you see in blackberry 10 because
they license the the software from
schelotto and what you get is the red
wine feature in the blackberry 10's
camera so take a picture and you can
it's it's kind of like best shot but
instead of changing the entire picture
you change just someone's face I'm the
moment or yeah without making it look
photoshopped it looks like you just took
another picture that's perfect yeah and
for example in the galaxy s4 there's you
talked about that technology where you
can actually erase people from a shot
that you don't want their dad that that
that does not really invented by
schelotto as well the intro it was a
company that nokia purchased last year
year last year exactly last year so so a
lot of a lot of interesting camera stuff
coming to the the 925 the camera itself
is pretty much the same except that
they've added a sixth lens to the array
to help with optical image stabilization
in stone 8.7 mmm
pixel camera it's got dual LED flash not
the Xenon flash so we're seeing on the
928 which is another topic of
conversation the so so the first thing I
want to ask is a question directed at
Michael who loves the 920 probably more
than any other phone what do you think
they're a there it is what do you think
about this 925 are you gonna are you
gonna buy one and we'll replace your 920
so here's the thing first of all google
tells me that i muted yeah my muted or
no no no you're good very what an
interesting little banner I have then it
tells me i muted too yeah thnkx hangouts
let the here's the thing with it with
the 920 and I just I just posted an
editorial about that was largely based
on a comment that somebody left a very
prescient comment where it was like you
know the the the Lumia 925 is an
aesthetic reinvention and it's exactly
the opposite the galaxy has four but
we'll talk about that in a second but
the 920 has always been a heavy kind of
unwieldy device and I've apologized for
it and I've told I've had arguments with
Brandon with with with everyone about
how I don't mind the wakes I like a
substantial feel in the hand but it's
definitely the outlier this is 185 grams
it's my heavier than a galaxy note 2
it's a tank yeah I mean it's it's absurd
so I can understand why people would be
put off by that um you don't have to
wear a belt anymore keep your greater
whole Fred with the summertime coming I
like a lighter phone but oh the thing is
so I think the weight reduction was a
really good idea I have to say
aesthetically I I don't know mate and I
would like to hear your guys thoughts on
this um I don't think the 925 look looks
better than that I like its aluminum
rail along the side but I think it said
not a very good looking phone compared
to this 928 which has a very distinctive
but also thought out aesthetic you know
you have this extreme minimalism on the
back here which we don't have on the 925
got all those holes on the people raised
lens and you know I mean what do you
guys the night the 925 does look generic
but but you make a very good point that
the weight and the size of the 920 is
off-putting to men
including me and and you get to the cell
phone storing your feeling like oh this
is just too much I'm gonna go with the
gaseous three or the galaxy s4 and now
nokia has kindly I kind of removed that
barrier Taylor you were gonna say
something yeah I was gonna say the just
like when i saw the leaked pictures and
we talked about it either in a podcast
or alive the 925 looks like oh great
long long long walk over there um then I
25 looks just like an HTC device it
looks like a like a really fresh of a
windows phone 8x or something you know
um it doesn't look like Nokia it's I
don't know maybe maybe I'm alone in that
but yeah you're not alone in that it
doesn't look as much like Nokia but I I
would it would be my argument that it
doesn't look as good as an HTC 8x
revision like I got there's a lot going
on with it that I don't think it's great
we're suckers for we're suckers for you
right after body yeah we're suckers for
your body and that's going to make it
feel like if it's got that separation
just let it have a removable battery
which I don't believe it does right and
they're all fixed it doesn't come apart
so but the back cover you can take the
back cover off can't you is you know if
you have to replace it with a wireless
charges either better no or yes that's a
case actually that's that's a case that
you place on the phone so it's got three
reports at the bottom but that that's
that one that is weak sauce 101 that's
sucks okay so so am I the only guy here
it might be only knows actually not a
fan of Windows that actually that
actually likes that phone cuz I like it
no yeah it would not say what I don't
think anybody saying we don't like it
but I just the look of it as not as
refined as the 920 I don't it's the last
40 I have a question I want to go back
to this wireless charging thing Michael
does the active s have wireless charging
no it does not that's very interesting
because if you look at the windows
phones that have wireless charging they
are a little bit thicker like the Lumia
920 what other phones Windows Phone our
verizon version of the 8x has it some
other some of the mid-range Lumias have
back covers available i think the 820 is
a back cover
yeah yeah I'm just wondering if there's
some technology issue here where the
phones got to increase in thickness
unlike a galaxy s3 where you just change
the back cover well there requires coil
I requires this but I inquire the nexus
4 has it built in and it's pretty slim
right right it doesn't necessarily have
to be a thick or heavy device to have
wireless charging that's why I'm pretty
much flame nokia over that because yeah
because when nexus 4 that was always the
excuse right it was like yeah well it
has to be big and thick because while i
was charging and I kind of bought into
that for a while until I did that mod of
the galaxy s3 where I took the coil out
of the palm pixi back and I mean it's
it's there's anything I mean it's just
copper wire is all it is yeah the
biggest part of what your wireless
charging is going to be is the actual
module the charging the inductive
charging module in the charger not the
actual yeah yeah but yeah but your
Galaxy s3 look like if it had implants
after you plays that thing well that was
because the battery do I that was that
was because i was using stone knives and
bearskins I wonder I wonder if notin
nokia is saying something about the
state of wireless charging by making
this an optional accessory not just
building it right into the phone you
know I'll tell you this much for those
people that like the Lumia 920 design if
you look at the phone at the Lumia 925
with the case of that you know that
plastic case that you put for wireless
charging it ends up looking like a 920
once you snap that thing on and yeah it
they're basically I guess participating
in the death of wireless charging and
mobile or at least not pushing it
forward because they're saying it's not
important enough to build it to the
phone you know natively it's something
that you can add on and when you have to
add it on when you have to buy a
wireless charger and a wireless adapter
for your phone it adds up to seventy
eighty a hundred dollars or more and
they know what useless but honestly this
is like the sexiest wireless charging
cover that I've ever seen can you try to
link it in the in the checkers i can't i
have not seen the the currency either
end and here's the the nexus 4 for
reference it's yeah very thin and
wireless charging is built-in so now
i'll try i'll try to find one but you
know
going back to the design you know I I
don't know I I do like you know I I
can't understand why Nokia wasn't able
to bring out a full aluminum body for
this design it's funny but this is like
the first time that I see an aluminum
phone and black that I like more than
the gray 1i thinks great when it's like
if they did an all aluminum phone people
are gonna say hey they copy HTC they
copied apples so they did like a kind of
a combo thing where the sides are
aluminum the edges where you touch the
phone but the back is that kind of soft
touch plastic here we go well but well
we're not saying that that you know
they're copying samsung for going for
the with a plastic you know design it's
like I think that it would have been
cool if they would have brought a full
aluminum body that's not look Taylor
Taylor has officially what the heck is
this that is the wireless charger oh my
guess it's like an extremity of some
it's like a some exoskeleton oh god yes
spacesuit yeah latches on can you scale
that down so we can see the whole thing
or no that's the whole picture okay let
me see if I can find another one yeah
it's you're right it's like a space
shooter Taylor is looking I'm i have a
question have you ever played the game
Jenga you know what were ya pull them
out i play giant chicken last weekend
but no not know really not really oh I
was gonna say because you've got like a
real-life version of Jenga behind you
with like your 15 iPad boxes what is the
deal with that why do you for med boxes
do you deal one in every bathroom or
something I I sort of sorry I actually
have kept all the boxes of the iPads
that i've owned in iphones that I bought
that's the reason it's like your side
plugs that I bought okay so table sevens
not showing us an image of a red backing
for the for the 925 smoke it's very
thick oh my god in its gross looking and
it doesn't protect the phone at all so
if you're gonna have a case on there you
would at least want protection right
that's just kind of like a its
piggybacking it's like a monkey on its
fact that does one thing I cannot help
but think the tailor that the tailor's
voice is coming through this case okay
I have a question I have a question for
you guys which has been haunting me ever
since three in the morning when I woke
up because I'm obviously in central time
not like lucky you guys where it was 5am
with the event um where was Stephen Elop
yeah this is where was Stephen Elop I
mean John crews that Stephen Elop
announced the Lumia 520 he comes on
events to announce Asha naughty those
are not even smart phones why was he not
available for this event what does this
means i think it was symbolic of the of
what this means to the company they
don't want people to think that like
this is their flagship for this year
they're going to come out with some new
hotness with with the new windows 18.5
and it's going to be a big leap it'll be
the real successor to the 920 this is
kind of a mid-cycle refresh that get
people re interested in the nokia brand
but doesn't get them all the way there
to being competitive again well what do
you guys think great I think I don't I
don't know if you got my email about the
editorial idea that I'm going to go with
but uh it's something along that affect
where they should have learned something
from Samsung and HTC and that you don't
need to release 20 different devices one
for every carrier to get your point
across you need it people want one phone
to choose from I guess you know the same
phone on every carrier just so you don't
have to pick and choose what you want
even though these are all the same if
they have mostly the same specifications
they're different models and it's just
not smart in terms of branding and
marketing right is it's kind of
confusing you have the Lumia 920 you
have the Lumia 925 the 928 you have the
a20 the 800 the 900 I mean it's just a
21 a 22 oh my god it's like blackberry
a10 the antenna no it's true i mean the
810 the a20 the v8 I even forget the
numbers they're pretty much the same
phone on a different chassis I and I so
much these these naming schemes that
reminds me of back in the early 2000s
when you add the like SPM 5hs wqr three
1796 HT oh yeah they curve idioteque tex
yeah what do you do what is that what is
that Fang this this is actually um
that's the new q5 this is this is an
antique just like it Keller king yeah
you turn it to the side there so you can
see the thickness of that phone can you
put it up convince Alexis for here
character next year have fun with that
oh yeah when you got highly over there I
this is the blackberry tour I belong man
I've been I've got them all over there
oh wow I got I've got something better
look at this I've got one of those too
yes yay yeah but it's exactly like that
because there was the light the
blackberry curve 8310 8320 8530 beam 350
360 I mean just so big i but there is
merit Everest if you are the thickness
of this tissue box I mean that is I'll
show you there's the this is this is
thick right here that's a SPH a 8500 or
SCH 8500 from 2000 that is that your DD
now Michael yeah man I just roll with
this you know I got tired of color no
but here's the thing like there is merit
to this approaching in that Nokia is
just basically you know saturating the
market and where did they come from they
came from a place where their mind share
was completely in the toilet their their
market share was just collapsing and I I
think they don't want to lose that I
don't think I think they want to lose
presence at every particular level so
while yes it's confusing I wish they'd
done some different naming choices I
think they have to do this as far as
just pushing volume out there and it's
just like yeah we know we just drop this
610 well here's a 520 eat it you know it
means it's kind of blowing up in their
faces though they're not really giving
any love to the US carriers they're not
performing are they going no i don't i
don't know i don't think so I mean
shareholders and investors are very
upset with Stephen Elop we read about
that wasn't i was about to say we all
read the fact that Stephen Elop is not a
you know the investors are not really
happy with this performance so you know
I don't know could it be that you know
the Nokia is sending us the message that
Elop is probably not going to be in the
company soon or so that's a very that's
a very good possibility I mean he's he's
failed with companies failed to do an
HTC eris am
song which is to get a flagship device
on every carrier and and we're seeing
now that that is the magic and HTC is
benefiting from that magic guys we're
getting to the end here of the round
table I want to ask one final question
want to keep this as close to 30 minutes
as possible what do you think this means
for windows phone does it move the
needle at all ah not really know why do
you think sand in the grand scheme of
things no because it's just another
device and it's going to be buried in a
couple of weeks by the carriers the
sales reps on the ground the first point
of contact for consumers don't care I
guarantee you none of them on launch day
will really care about the device they
might they might push it for three days
a week and then after that it's going to
be back to the HTC One the galaxy s4 and
everything else yeah that's exactly how
it'll go and that's unfortunate because
it is probably going to be a good device
just like most other windows phones of I
Windows Phone devices before it but it's
it's all about getting the sales reps to
care that's that's the big problem with
windows phone is they don't care so
consumers not gonna buy good point what
do you think I may I don't I don't know
no kiss like pulling an apple here it's
it's it's funny because you know Apple
can be the company that comes up with an
iteration of a phone when it comes to
hardware but then changes the design
that people will buy it that's just the
way it works and they're trying to do
this here with this Leumi I mean this is
pretty much a Lumia 920 on another
chassis and if the Lumia 920 wasn't able
to move the needle then you know doing
just bringing out another phone with a
different design doesn't necessarily
change anything and you know it's funny
I mean it's not like if this phone is
cutting edge in anything in comparison
to anything that's already out there so
there is again there is nothing
different in this phone that changes
Windows Phone and so I don't really
expect it to move anything it'll
probably just again less Taylor mentions
it'll be buried eventually it'll turn up
to be an exclusive on certain carriers
and therefore not everybody will get the
phone the other people will keep the 920
and it's just going to be another
Windows Phone out there in the market
and that's that's really sad because I I
do notice the Nokia
buying hard they're just not trying the
right things in my opinion do you agree
that they're not trying the right things
Michael uh yeah I think that they were
on the right track for a while there and
now and now I don't think they they are
with this particular iteration no listen
it's good that they that they improved
on the 920 the 920 is a solid device but
I need an improvement in some areas
that's been taken care of and weight
that AMOLED screen coming back to the to
the 929 2x line is a is a great thing as
well really makes Windows Phone pop
camera improvements the area yeah I I
think though that if we had seen this
earlier it would have made a big
difference you know we've had the 920
you know the 920 is beautiful and we
love talking about is a device in an
international context but from an
American point of view you know what you
need to have a 920 you need 80 not every
American wants to be on 18 here it can
be on 1800 okay you know we come back to
the whole Gary exclusive thing it's
gonna be nice to have the 928 on verizon
it's too late though I mean it you know
if all this had happened when the
excitement surrounding the 920 was fresh
that would have made a difference in
awesome this is a rehash of a phone that
people is not necessarily old but we've
done or after the buzz on it already
that you know people are fickle even
outside of our circles they're not going
to really latch on to this it's a it's
not going to move the needle at all we
need to wait for the next flagship yeah
what is the maximum number of people
that can actually buy these phones so
many my carrier availability yeah I mean
in the US the 928 you're looking at what
may be 160 million total that will ever
be able to buy it yeah on verizon and
sprint right and then how many of those
are actually gonna buy it all right all
small percentage because only what
fifty-seven percent of those are smart
phone users and how many of those are
going to upgrade to a windows phone
first tell her I'll district navin
that's making my owner of it no but but
you guys you guys have a solid point I
mean their market penetration in back in
the fall of last year was terrible
because only AT&amp;amp;T got like a real
flagship phone they were the only ones
that got the hot Lumia 920 and then
everybody got an 8 22 or an 8 20 and you
know yeah they got the windows phone 8
X no comment on this this is a pretty
phone that I would love for it to run
Android but there's nothing really hot
about this phone at all so yeah I feel
that I think the milk is approaches is
good for them because they're getting
the exclusive deals with AT&amp;amp;T that will
pop up some money initially but they're
not getting any market share so
eventually even AT&amp;amp;T could turn their
back on them and then what's that going
to turn out for them I really like
Taylor's point that it really starts
with the sales people on the floor and
what's going to happen is that you're
going to have a 925 next to an HTC one
next to a galaxy s4 and the sales rep is
gonna be like yeah these two guys at
1080p screens ones like one's heavier
then they're going to get for 925 and be
like oh it runs the windows phone and
and then they're gonna be like but I
want the Android yo and you know it's I
want the new Galaxy i want the new
galaxy yeah you got the new droid you
got the new galaxy yeah like droid so
guys I want to conclude this I think we
can all agree on one thing that Lumia
needs to put android on its phones and
that would solve well that Nokia doesn't
ya know I I still don't agree but I
understand oh come on now you would buy
a nokia made android phone and a
heartbeat no I know I would it is a lot
podcast now I I think I 10 key i should
stay firmly in bed with with Windows
Phone I think Steven ela I want to say
this before we go I think I don't think
Stephen Eli was doing a bad job you know
how long it took dan hesse to turn
sprint around I know we're talking about
a carrier and not an oem but it's like
it took him like three years to get any
kind of results because the company was
in such trouble I think Nokia was in
really big trouble i thinkI lab has
taken a lot of steps that were many of
which were not very popular but i think
the company's in a better place than it
was maybe things get a bit with HP was
that get some web OS f I don't want two
men to do oh you're gonna you know
spinner list you made up spin around it
is okay if you you know I'm gonna give
you an analogy this is like this is like
this is like NASCAR you know knowing
that you're gonna compete at NASCAR and
arriving with a VW Beetle it's a
beautiful car it's got everything you
want but it's not a NASCAR racing
vehicle in this point of the game and so
in my particular
okay so I mean think about it HTC does
windows phone and they do android sansom
does windows phone and they do android
even Samsung who is Samsung has not been
able to succeed with Windows Phone at
any point even if they were part of the
pioneers so if I were Stephen Elop I'd
be like yeah sure these are my lumia
line items in hey these are my android
liners I mean what's the what is the
problem of having a society nokia does
not have the resources that a bigger
company like Samsung does they can't
split their focus like that they're
they're losing money every quarter in
Japan days losing millions of billions
every quarter they used to be ballin
fresh with lots of dough but then things
happened and then they weren't you know
guys we gotta we gotta wrap this up I
actually want to say thank you to the
viewers because we have as many viewers
in this sort of niche like roundtable
discussion that we do in our bigger
general purpose pocketnow lives so
that's awesome that you guys really care
about what we have to say and come and
join us so thank you for for joining us
and thank you taylor and michael and
high may for sounding off about the
Lumia 925 and we've plenty more coverage
on pocket now some videos from Tony all
right we have podcasts coming later in
the week in another pocket now live and
maybe another round table is that right
you have a roundtable tomorrow for
google i/o let's see what they bring
we're gonna be talking about who I of
tomorrow we are going to have a podcast
on Thursday and pocket not live on
Friday so and of course NASCAR sorry I
had to do that because you made a NASCAR
analogy and I live in NASCAR country so
