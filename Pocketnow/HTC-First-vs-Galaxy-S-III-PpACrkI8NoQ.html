phones ever compared to the first
so-called Facebook phone I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
HTC first versus the Samsung Galaxy s3
last year was undoubtedly the year of
the Galaxy s3 with over 50 million sold
worldwide to date it's fairly obvious
why it's a high-end smartphone that
comes with a horde of unique software
features that not only set it apart from
its toughest competitors but also put it
ahead of virtually all the other
smartphones on the market at its launch
it was a smart phone that came with tons
of value proposition and few to no
compromises HTC's latest smartphone
other marketed as a mid-range device has
already proven in a prior comparison
video that it's capable of holding its
own against last year's flagships the
two smartphones with little in common
and hardware or software actually
targets similar consumer bases basic
users but the galaxy s3 also appeals to
those after a still powerful device for
a fair price and the HTC first is geared
towards Facebook enthusiasts though the
stock Android beneath Facebook home has
also turned the heads of many Android
purists so how does HTC's Facebook phone
compare to one of the most popular
smartphones ever let's find out the
hardware on these two devices is quite
different the HTC first is excruciating
ly minimal the face only features the
display front-facing camera notification
LED and three capacitive buttons which
are also very plain a leftward pointing
arrow for back circle for home and a
short line for the menu function around
the sides and back the first is covered
with a matte finished soft touch plastic
with no embellishment and only three
insignias one each for HTC AT&amp;amp;T and
Facebook it's extremely plain in a good
way the galaxy s3 was as Samsung put it
designed for humans and inspired by
nature and design cues from various
natural elements are evident in the s3s
built the wide radius corners and
rounded edges paired with the hyper
glazed finish give it a smooth pebble
feel the face has a standard Samsung
button configuration a centered physical
home button and two capacitive buttons
for menu and back to the left and right
respectively the
HTC first with its unibody design is
extremely solid in the hand even when
gripping it with an extra tight grip
there is no squeaking noise in the
hardware it's a totally different story
for the galaxy s3 thanks to the all
lightweight plastic build and removable
battery door
the HTC first is also notably smaller
than the galaxy s3 measuring 126
millimeters tall by 65 millimeters wide
and eight point nine millimeters thick
to the s3s dimensions of a hundred and
thirty six millimeters tall by a 70
point six millimeters wide and eight
point six millimeters thick and at 133
grams although it's larger the s3 is
only 9.1 grams heavier than the first we
have to say that while we prefer the
more solid and premium feel of the first
the galaxy s3 does have some redeeming
features the button important layout for
example is great it's much easier to
find the buttons on the s3 as they
protrude from the edges a bit more and
are more ergonomically friendly sitting
naturally beneath the thumb and the
first and middle fingers and removing
the battery door reveals two
advantageous features a removable
battery and expandable storage the
galaxy s3 comes in two variations the
global model and the slightly different
US model the global model the one we're
using for this comparison comes with a
1.4 gigahertz quad core Exynos chip set
1 gigabyte of RAM 16 32 or 64 gigabytes
of built-in storage an 8 megapixel
camera 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera
2100 million power battery and an HSPA+
connection the u.s. model comes in only
16 or 32 gigabite variations as 2
gigabytes of RAM comes with a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 chip
and LTE connectivity the HTC first has a
1.4 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon 400
chip under the hood 1 gigabyte of RAM 16
gigabytes of fixed storage with no
expansion options a 5 megapixel camera
1.6 megapixel front-facing camera 2000
milliamp-hour fixed battery and HSPA+
and LTE connectivity the displays on
these two smartphones are absolutely
gorgeous the galaxy s3 comes with a 4.8
inch HD Super AMOLED panel at a
resolution of 720p that equates to a
density of approximately three hundred
and six pixels per inch the HTC first
has a 4.3 inch Super LCD panel also at
720p resolution meaning its density is
much higher at 342 pixels per inch
the LCD panel on the first produces
vibrant and fairly accurate colors it's
extremely bright and offers wide viewing
angles and it's got an edge on the
galaxy s3s Super AMOLED panel sharpness
thanks to the higher density and the
pentile matrix sub pixel layout on the
AMOLED panel the galaxy s3s display
offers supersaturated colors which some
favored and truer inky blacks all in all
we have to give it to the HTC first for
like its larger sibling the HTC One
having one of the best displays around
while the galaxy s3 has the edge and
specifications the first is nothing to
scoff at and takes the cake for design
and build quality by a wide margin
software is one thing that truly sets
the galaxy has to be apart from other
flagship models in 2012 it came with an
impressive number of useful features
such as smart stay pop up video best
shot and s voice as of December the
global model of the s3 was updated to
jellybean 4.1 - but software on the s3
is heavily customised with Samsung's
lover hate TouchWiz nature UX interface
cues from nature are also evident around
the interface from the water ripple
effect on the lockscreen
to the water droplet sounds and nature
wallpapers an almost no interface
element has gone unchanged from the
lockscreen to the deepest settings menu
the interface is entirely customized the
icons are custom the notification shade
incorporates quick toggles for various
settings and a brightness slider and the
recent apps function is customized with
a shortcut to task manager Google now
and a clear all button the software on
the HTC first is also customized out of
the box when you power than if Ison
you're prompted to log into your
Facebook account and when you do your
homescreen becomes your Facebook
newsfeed or cover feed essentially your
wallpaper is the picture associated with
your friend status updates or cover
photos and it constantly streams content
meaning you can stay up to date with
your friends without ever having to open
any applications however underneath
Facebook home is not the usual since UI
we're used to seeing on HTC Android
phones instead it's an otherwise
untouched stock Android experience
jellybean 4.1 - and Facebook home can be
disabled quite simply and to various
degrees it can serve as a lock screen of
sorts or be completely disabled outside
Facebook's own services the first comes
with virtually no bloatware
the software is as lightweight and
vanilla as Android comes on any other
stock Android phone the Galaxy s3 has
its fair share of unique features which
some consider gimmicky and the HTC first
is preloaded with the most elaborate and
integrated Facebook experience you can
get on any phone samsung software feels
a bit more well-rounded mainly because
it is but the first comes with software
choices Facebook home or completely
stock Android which is hard to argue
with our galaxy s3 unit is the global
version meaning it packs the 1.4
gigahertz quad core Exynos chip and in
our time with the galaxy s3
especially since being upgraded to
jellybean the performance is buttery
smooth there is little to no choppiness
and everyday usage and it's adept at
handling games and more laborious tasks
without stuttering
for the most part the same could be said
of the HTC first though facebook home is
to blame for most if not all the lag
we've experienced on the first with
Facebook home disabled there were no
instances of notable lag or major
performance hiccups while the quad core
Exynos chip in the galaxy s3 has a
slight advantage over the dual-core
Snapdragon 400 chip they both perform
exceptionally well in everyday use and
in synthetic benchmarks battery life is
fairly comparable between the two as
well on most days we were able to last
an entire day on a single charge for the
HTC first though some days of heavier
usage warranted a mid day charge to last
until bedtime the galaxy s3 doesn't have
exceptional battery life either but it
manages to last at least most the day in
most cases but it's worth noting that it
has a removable battery meaning carrying
a spare or two can alleviate any battery
concerns the HTC first comes with LTE
connectivity on att's network and it has
offered some of the fastest LTE speeds
we've seen to date averaging speeds well
above 30 megabits per second down and
often reaching speeds upwards of 50
megabits per second the galaxy s3 being
the global unit utilizes AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ and
3g networks here in the States
meaning the speeds aren't nearly as fast
but the AT&amp;amp;T model of the galaxy s3
comes with LTE connectivity the galaxy
s3 was regarded as having one of the
best smartphone cameras of 2012
especially on the Android front and
while newer smartphones may offer new
tricks the galaxy s3s camera fares about
the same today as it did when it was
brand new
you images while often airing on the
warm side are pretty well balanced with
vibrant colors and sharp detail its
low-light performance isn't quite up to
snuff these days but it holds its own
the five megapixel camera on the HTC
first is hardly the worst camera we've
ever used in great lighting conditions
it's actually capable of taking some
great shots with some of the most
balanced and accurate colors we've seen
but in anything but perfect lighting the
performance drops off rather quickly and
the low-light performance of the first
is dismal at best not to mention the
stock camera software on the first lacks
some pretty important features such as
HDR mode and burst shot the galaxy s3
was easily the most popular smartphone
of 2012 and it's holding up quite well
today even with its successor edging
closer to release as far as bargains go
we'd be hard-pressed to recommend the
first over the galaxy s3 considering
they both sell for $100 with a two-year
agreement on AT&amp;amp;T but the HTC first is
most definitely a diamond in the rough a
mid-range phone that exceeds
expectations and proves specifications
aren't that be-all end-all if you're
after a stock experience without the
hassle of hacking and modding a phone
the HTC first is an easy way to get just
that it's a great choice if you have
smaller hands too but we have to give a
slight edge to the Galaxy s3 in nearly
every category excluding hardware and
design that about does it so if you
