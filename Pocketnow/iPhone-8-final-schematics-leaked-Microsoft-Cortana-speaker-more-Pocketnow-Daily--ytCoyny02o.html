revealed that most rumors are accurate
taking shape the whole deal of the
Microsoft speaker continues to grow into
a possibility and Samsung and LG have
soared through their core results
unbelievably I'm hi Mary vana and if I
were only capable of leaving the gym
this then after a workout I would be
there all day this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with the
official announcement should we say of
States and everything of the BlackBerry
key one we have already published our
unboxing I have actually been using the
phone for the last couple of days and
that's the phone that I tweeted about
the fact that you just can't kill that
battery I actually intentionally listen
to a few podcasts with the screen on and
everything battery just wouldn't budge I
so far things are going well those of
you interested well the phone will be
available for pre-order and string
carriers on May 18th available on May
31st you'll learn one description other
official news confirm LG as the company
has posted quarter results and these are
actually not bad the company continues
to lose money but it's nearly cut its
losses in half more than half actually
to the point where the company is
actually posting some significant
profits all of this has to do with the
g6 by the way we price the phone and it
seems the consumers have as well now the
company that surprising everyone is
Samsung it predicted that it would break
all its records and it nearly did so
much show that this is actually
significant because all these quarter
results have nothing to do with the
Galaxy s8 those results will be until
next quarter so there this the company
is not just posting amazing profits and
revenue we're talking about a 48 percent
growth in revenue and we're trying to
figure out exactly what the company has
done during that period of time because
if anything what it had to do is about
the cost of the Galaxy Note 7 so anyways
we'll keep you posted as we learn more
after those of you wondering if we are
getting a competitor for Alexa and the
Amazon echo from Microsoft it seems that
it's actually happening that Cortana
speaker is apparently a harman kardon
invoke speaker that's actually the name
and the
ending the thing is we were supposed to
get this earlier apparently it might not
even have it on made second but instead
on May 10th for builds conference from
Microsoft so not exactly sure what it'll
do differently but build is actually the
best platform to show it off so yeah and
finally the very interesting news that
they have to do with more iPhone 8
schematics this time apparently these
are the official ones I mean they look
like engineering schematics up to the
dot two very interesting things those of
you that have been wondering if that
vertical camera hump is happening it
seems that it will number two is that we
do see a wireless charging coil it
doesn't major deal as we've been
wondering exactly when Apple will adopt
it and we haven't blamed Apple for not
doing so given the fact that very few
people care about wireless charging but
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day we've seen a lot of leaked
schematics obviously if this phone has
where I was charging it means the back
it's most likely made of glass we've
seen that vertical camera what do you
think about these designs does it entice
you to consider the future iPhone in my
case that actually doesn't I think this
is probably the ugliest iPhone I've ever
seen at least in schematics but anyways
leave us a comment down below we would
love to know your opinion frangie
totally goes if you want to get the news
