know the smart thermostat and fire
detector company but boon to touch just
lost support for a ton of devices you
actually care about an HTC is about to
break the hearts of a ton of legacy
users I'm hi Mary that I and in a
perfect world the weekend would last a
lot longer than just two days and I
really need that this is pocket now
daily lesser stay off with some official
news as Google has just acquired a new
company which is the typical thing this
time they acquired nest which is famous
for their smart thermostat and smart
fire detector and you know this is all
part of that whole energy sense project
that was leaked recently the rumors are
there and everything but the question is
how exactly is this going to mix with
Android and what's going to happen to
Iowa's users that currently have support
for nest and Motorola you know another
google company has just updated their
new motorola assist application for the
moto x and for those of you that have
been under the water and don't really
know what it is there's probably one of
the coolest features of the moto x which
allows you to control everything from
your phone while you're driving in a
safe way this how you can actually
respond to text messages with your voice
and also control the music application
and music as well with your voice
without the need of interacting with the
phone it's great to see these
applications from motorola they make the
Moto X unique we just wish they brought
them to other phones but anyways that's
the price for getting a Moto X and
speaking of Android even though we have
a rough time believing that the lakes of
the nokia normandy are of an android
phone the leakers continue saying that
this is an android phone at this time
look at the first link photographs up
the phone actually turned on and either
they've made android or its new android
you eyes flattened ugly or this is just
another Asha operating system so stay
tuned let's see what we get because this
is definitely going to be an entry-level
phone now let's go through some kind of
odd news as you remember that boon to
operating system running on a meizu
phone last week in leaks as it turns out
it seems that this will be an exclusive
deal because first of all boo to touch
could run on almost every Nexus device
but as of today canonical has confirmed
that the operating system will now be
running only on the Nexus 4 and the
Nexus 7 and they are not bringing
support to the Nexus 5 so this clearly
means that they're making this
an end-of-life thing the question is why
are they going exclusive if a boot do
has always been open sores I don't know
what's going on here and finally for the
very disappointing news of the day even
though HTC has done a fabulous job with
software updates on their phones from
2012 and on those of you that are
running an HTC One X and even the one x+
will not be getting Android 4.4 KitKat
the company has just confirmed this and
this is just really really sad because
obviously the one x+ and the one extra
really good phones a lot of you are
still on contract with the one x+ which
is really odd but that leaves you to the
question of the day what do you feel
about HTC dropping support two phones
that are pretty much still within their
two-year time frame because in my
particular case I can't believe that the
an iphone 4 has iOS 7 even if it's a
crop down version of iOS 7 I would want
android 4.4 kitkat which can actually
run on something much lesser than the
Tegra 3 and not have these issues but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
