pocketnow.com I just recently ran to
catch the FedEx man the delivery truck
outside my apartment I came up on my
front door he was driving away I ran
about two blocks which for me is like a
mini marathon I don't like running
anyway I've caught him I was glad that
he stopped because in his truck he had
for me the Motorola Q Photon Q 4G LTE so
many words I can't even get them in
their right order this is the latest LTE
device from Sprint it is also so far the
only LTE device from Sprint with a
physical QWERTY keyboard so we're gonna
have a review later on but for right now
and I want to pop open the box show you
what's inside so let's take a look so
starting with the packaging here is
Sprint has been on this kick for a while
where they are super green and they want
to make sure everyone knows just how
green they are so this is packaging that
is 100% recyclable as it tells you right
there also gives you a little bit of
information on the device which is kind
of split on that corner there
it's a 4G LTE device obviously with a
4.3 inch color boost display optimized
with smart actions like we found on the
razor razor max in the Atrix and so on
eight megapixel HD camera and here's the
insanely long product name down below
down here not much going on there's a
little QR code you can scan if you want
to this is trademark stuff that's
numbers that you don't need to see and
some more feature call-outs on the back
pop open the device here device is front
and center which is always very very
nice to see kind of a standard thing
these days we'll take it out wow I
forget how thick these devices can be
when they have a sliding keyboard that
was uh it was an interesting surprise
cool let's put this aside for a second
pop this open here we have a get started
guide not much new and exciting about
that USB cable and wall adapter aside
from that nothing else in the box we can
go ahead and put that aside
coming back to the device here this is
uh information about location privacy
here on the screen protector let's see
let's take a little hardware tour before
we open her up on the left side of the
device this is the microUSB port and the
HDMI out Jack nothing on the bottom on
the right hand side looks like we've got
the dedicated camera key as well as an
opening hatch here that does what micro
SD close that back up volume down volume
up on top looks like the power button
there headphone jack
on the back here 8 megapixel camera with
flash Motorola logo here speaker phone
grill down on the bottom aside from that
not much else going on let's rotate the
phone and yep we got to go in the right
way and there is that first LTE physical
keyboard on Sprint with laser etched
keys
we are told or laser cut keys rather
they seem to have pretty good travel how
they feel great very interesting to be
using a physical keyboard after so long
on touchscreens
only with once again a dedicated number
row up top close it up we'll take it out
we'll give it a boot in just one second
ok we just wanted to make sure I had the
battery in there now we're gonna give it
a boot test here we go press and hold we
should get the Motorola logo and there
it is let's go ahead and get this screen
protector out of here I just trimmed my
nails for this video so I don't know if
I have the tools necessary to I actually
might not be able to get this screen
protector off here there we go yeah it's
a beautiful thing that goes it's gone we
should get the carrier splash screen
here in a second once the Motorola logo
is done doing its little flashy thing
one interesting point this is a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera up top but
it does shoot in 720p HD so that's nice
it's not something you see all the time
don't know how well that performs but
we'll find out during our review and
there's a welcome screen there Android
ready for us to set it up
and ready for me to use my first phone
with a physical keyboard in quite a
while we're gonna have lots more on this
device in the coming days including a
review probably early next week so keep
it locked to pocketnow.com you can leave
a comment there on the post at
