its smaller sibling the LG g3 s about
three-quarters as much from Aoife 2014
this is michael fisher from pocket now
with LG g3 s vs. LG g3 tradeshow edition
it's not hard these days for
manufacturers to build smaller versions
of high-end flagships at least in terms
of look and feel the g3 s is obviously
smaller than its premium predecessor and
substantially so so we're a little
surprised this isn't called the g3 Mini
in the hand it's noticeably thicker but
aside from that it feels very much like
the larger version right down to the
faux brushed metal details and the
vaunted rear key and of course the style
up front is the same too with the
pronounced chin down below the screen
software is similarly identical the demo
unit here didn't have LG's special smart
notice homescreen off to the left but
aside from that everything's the same
from new flat UI to qslide apps and
performance on these beaten and battered
show floor units seems similar to that's
a surprise because there's a substantial
drop-off in power going from the
full-size g3 to the g3 s snapdragon 801
- 400 5.5 inch 2k displayed to 5 inch
720p display 13 megapixels - 8 on the
camera and 3000 milliamp hours - 25 40
in the engine room
those are substantial drop-offs in major
areas given the responsiveness we're
seeing on the show floor though it seems
LG has done a great job optimising
software for its G 3s but unfortunately
that's all we can tell from a trade show
comparison so we'll take a closer look
if we're given the opportunity for a
review when an F this comes to us Shores
