and 2015 has been a very interesting
year companies have done an amazing job
at raising the bar of their smartphone
quality and price tags have actually
begun to drop
we've got great cameras we've got great
designs we've got great build quality
but the biggest question is can we
actually narrow these down and define a
perfect smartphone for 2015 so off the
bat let's just be clear no we can't
define a perfect smartphone because the
needs of people are different there's no
such thing as a perfect thing in this
world and as technology evolves year
over a year so do the needs of people
think about it 10 years ago we would
have never considered having cameras on
phones and now we judge a smartphone for
its camera quality the concept of a
smart phone alone was completely unknown
to us many years ago and now it's what
we all want you actually did a little
experiment here in pocket now because we
all come from different countries
different backgrounds and we have very
different tastes we asked each editor if
they would stop working for PocketNow
today and they had to pick one phone to
use for the rest of the next two years
which one would it be what would be that
ideal phone that they would trust their
time over the next two years you're
gonna be shocked with the responses
Michael Fisher's our review
extraordinaire he needs no introduction
he's pretty much tested the hottest
phones this year and out of all of them
believe it or not he chose the
blackberry print yeah I know the
BlackBerry proof surely there are no
software updates guaranteed but
according to Michael the design is great
he loves blackberries he considers
himself a weirdo and he loves the
community that's backing BlackBerry up
to the point where he has a lot of
expectations over the future of the
Prive
even if blackberry doesn't do a good job
at it an't on the other hand to fight it
over the iPhone 6s according to him he
wants good battery life a great camera
he wants good performance and he also
wants a fingerprint scanner that
actually works all the time
and according to him the only phone
that's able to do all that in a package
that's not the size of a phablet is the
iPhone 6s
trust me he's tested pretty much every
Android phone out there as well and yeah
he inclines for the iPhone success at
the end our own Adam doubt was torn
between the Galaxy s6 active and the
galaxy note5 the active is probably one
of our favorite rugged phones this year
and brings great camera quality great
battery life and a design that only a
mother could love but far better than
any of the other ones out there the only
problem is that he values that camera
quality with added security features as
well and even Samsung pay and the only
phone that could actually bring all that
matched up was the galaxy note 5 and we
kind of agree Adam Lane is our own
Windows Phone expert and even a
professional photographer and according
to him if he had to pick he wouldn't
choose the Lumia 1020 from two years ago
up to the point where he actually has a
Lumia 1020 in its box ready in case the
one that he's currently using has a
problem according to Adam there is no
phone out there with a better camera
than Lumia 1020 and the build quality is
also top-notch obviously if we asked our
own designated Android expert mr. Joe
Levi what his preference would be we
kind of knew it would be the Google
Nexus 6p and we don't blame him Google
finally figured out the Nexus line of
with this phone they've got great build
quality a great display an amazing
camera and the price tag is not
necessarily that bad but obviously you
have to start at the entry level so far
this is one of our favorite phones this
year and definitely a good idea if you
want to continue with stock Android for
the next few years and if you asked mr.
Jules Wang after testing a ton of really
good phones this year he actually in
corn for the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 and
he makes a very solid point surely this
is a budget-minded premium mid-range err
but you're not really cheeping out here
it's a great 1080p display it's a great
experience with the JBL speakers of the
performance is top-notch in addition to
great battery life and the price tag
will not burn a hole in your pocket it's
probably one of the best phones of the
year if you are looking for that
budget-minded tear I know a lot of you
are and finally even though I'm infamous
for being the group's iPhone guy believe
it or not
phone that I would pick would be the
galaxy note5 and it has to do for a
couple of reasons starting with the fact
that the company finally figured out
essentials like the camera quality in
addition to the performance of that
camera
we've got great build quality great
battery life and we actually have a
great suite of applications that back
the S Pen up this time even though
you're rarely ever going to use it
TouchWiz has gotten better and I just
feel that you are getting more for your
money for me productivity is a big deal
and I find it pointless for you to pay
money for tablets and not get an
enhanced experience for all that screen
real estate I feel that no other company
does it better than Samsung when it
comes to that but then again that is
just my two cents
bottom line is yeah believe it or not
even us in the industry battle over what
our perfect smartphone should be because
again we come from different backgrounds
our needs are totally different and we
all live in different parts of the world
so just as we have different choices we
know you do too and we would love to
know that in the comments down below
which would be your top pick your ideal
smartphone for 2015 maybe you would have
to choose that phone for the next two
years leave us a comment down below and
while you're at it make sure you also
follow us on social media so scriptor
youtube channel as well he could follow
me on twitter and underscore to be
better on instagram and i'm it'll be
better please look this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi never
be better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
