in a box in this kind of condition you
really hope that there's a rugged device
inside well fortunately if the spec
sheets are to be believed this is one of
the most durable devices you can get
from Samsung so let's see if it survived
the rough treatment of our friends at
UPS I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is the samsung galaxy s4 active
let's unbox it and see if it's intact ok
so this is the box in exactly the
condition it arrived in from from UPS so
we want to say thank you for AT&amp;amp;T thank
you to AT&amp;amp;T for sending this to us it's
not a teenage felt that I did arrive
this way hopefully this rugged device
survived this apparently rough passage
so the first thing we see is a
QuickStart guide before even seeing the
phone put that aside hooray no shattered
display oh oh and we got a color this is
not the urban grey version we were
expecting but the dive blue oh that is
impressive Wow Wow vocabulary fails me
as I look at this very very shiny die
blue phone this phone also available
once again in urban gray and orange
flare I'm gonna put it aside for a
second and see if what else is inside
the box here let's see Samsung has
bundled in some literature here now you
have nothing to lose upgrade to the
Galaxy s4 active samsung Smart Switch
that's what this is a cloud based
solution that they're advertising as
well as texting and driving it can wait
drive mode from 18 t we'll look into
that in a future video USB cable in
white very nice and the Samsung charger
we are familiar with anything else going
on in here no just decrepit blown out
cardboard packaging let's get it out of
here ok so coming back to the Galaxy s4
active itself we're just gonna drop it
on the table here and put it next to
another rugged device that we happen to
have on hand
these don't meet exactly the same
standards for durability but they are
definitely serving the same market
segment this is the Kyocera torque from
Sprint the push-to-talk enabled rugged
phone that we reviewed
few months back and you'll notice there
is quite a difference here in in
thickness in overall size and the entire
design language is different that's not
just because these are coming from
different companies it's because until
now or until recently manufacturers have
not really focused on durable device of
making different durable devices
resemble their flagship counterparts any
other functionality or appearance see
this is very very clunky very very brick
like the Galaxy s4 active is actually
not so that isn't very interesting
change of pace okay once again we have
the microphone positioned and we have
the AT&amp;amp;T it can wait campaign good
reminder there do not text while driving
it can be fatal
let's get the screen protector out of
here beautiful thing that panel is the
size we were expecting this is a 5-inch
1080p display not AMOLED this time
around TFT LCD instead but maintains
that 443 PPI very very high resolution
especially for a durable device let's
take a tour around the hardware taking a
look around the phone still can't really
get over this awesome dive blue color
here but let's take a poke around you'll
notice that the capacitive home and
backyard schema the capacitive back and
menu keys have been replaced with
physical buttons down here flanking the
always been physical home button see if
we can get a little bit of a close-up
there for you
now that is handy as we were talking a
little bit about the pocket now weekly
on the pocket a weekly podcast today
always nice to have physical buttons on
a phone that can go underwater and yes
this phone can spend some time
underwater it is rated to ip67 standards
for immersion meaning it can survive and
up to a meter of water for up to 30
minutes if I recall correctly this is a
sticker talking about how to best
protect the device firmly seat the
battery cover and USB cover before use
so obviously this device not relying on
a nano coating for protection but on
keeping water out of the casing there's
our AT&amp;amp;T branding on the back of flash
camera has taken a step down from the 13
megapixel camera on the galaxy s4 to an
8 megapixel camera here and there's no
another something Kyocera torque we have
this nice coin-operated slot almost to
seat the battery door in it's gasket
that is not present on the s4 active it
just looks it feels like a regular ol
battery door that's not even that much
thicker that's fascinating
at any rate I'll put that aside here's
our battery 2600 milliamp hours not two
thousand milliamp hours it was a slight
error on Tony's part but we can forgive
him that from London because he shot
something like 2 1 T videos or 200 I'm
not sure it felt like anyway we'll go
ahead and replace the battery cover here
seated properly and then we'll look for
that USB cover there it is here's our
there's how we clear that make sure that
water stays out of there by reseeding
that and it looks like it's on a little
rotating hinge really feels quite quite
low-profile almost flimsy for something
that's supposed to keep water out but we
will see how that works some exposed
screws here power standby on the side no
physical hardware camera button but as I
think we saw from London you can trigger
the camera using the volume keys which
are on the other side there's our
headphone jack nope right there no cover
for that one IR port you can still
control your TV remote from here we'll
go ahead and see if we can power this
device on press and hold on power
standby that's a 2 megapixel webcam up
top I believe and underneath driving
this experience is a 1.9 gigahertz
processor 2 gigs of RAM 16 gigs of
storage but there is microSD as always
there's our AT&amp;amp;T splash screen blowing
out the frame with its brightness and
this is available if you're interested
from AT&amp;amp;T as of today in the United
States - 1 9999 on contract or 5 94 99
without little pricey but maybe worth it
if you are someone who needs a rugged
phone and doesn't want to sacrifice too
much in terms of features and specs
we're gonna have a lot more on the
Galaxy s4 active but for now there is
your unboxing
folks we have a lot more on the galaxy
s4 active here on YouTube including
Anton Dino dropping one in a tank full
of water in London at Samsung premier
