long sleeves and what's the weather like
there and what's wrong with my long
sleeves and yet was cold hi mera verdad
Rivera Rivera I'm gonna have nightmares
because of your surname when we made up
Rivera can you imagine what I'm going to
have with your surname Microsoft
scroogled campaign no we're on that and
man this is not a soap opera this is
YouTube that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi mera neta this is
pocket now and this is our pocket now
daily recap for last week so on Monday
asked you if you would pay for
protective coating for your phone
because obviously the LG G flex has all
this fanfare about its self-healing
protective coating and we took it for a
little spin and see how it was and we
have 94 comments out of which soldier
2.0 says I am very careful with my
devices so I don't use any kind of
protectors that used to be my case until
I stopped being careful I don't know why
then Timothy McDaniel says I would pay
for a smart coating if it worked well
and yes you know there is invisible
shield and other options out there so
there were one that we're smart why not
then Tyler says tempered glass screen
protector and an ultra thin TPU or
tasteless you know the problem of those
TPU cases is in the case of
polycarbonate phones sometimes they get
these permanent smudges at the back and
even that happens with glass so I would
rather stick to something that is not
visible and it's better then on Tuesday
I asked you what did you order for black
friday or cyber monday the news were
obviously of the biggest winners for
black friday and then ended up being
apple with the worst deals and we have
375 comments out of which Edward bluefin
says the new acquisition is more debt
and that happened to everybody buddy
then Timothy Jackson said I got an ipad
air good for you a lot of people didn't
actually that's probably one of the best
buys when it comes to tablets in the
market right now it's actually sad for
some people because they could be more
productive for that price tag but still
the ipad air is a good tablet then
victor says i bought the best phone
right now on cyber monday wednesday
which was the moto x and you're lucky
man i cannot believe you were able to
land the phone in 10 minutes because
that's how much it lasted it was
terrible then on wednesday i asked you
if you were planning to buy a samsung
phone for 2014 as the rumors are that
samsung is planning a multiple launch of
smartphones during early 2014 which is
odd we have
357 comments out of which one of them
says no Samsung Sony only and Sony is
doing a fabulous job in design we're
getting waterproof phones you're doing a
great job with software and software
updates but their screens just suck i
hope they fix that and hopefully that
will be the case next year then John
Bell says yes note 3 and shouldn't be
the note 4 but yeah the note 3 is still
a great phone probably one of my
favorites then another commoner says
unless Apple makes a bigger screen on
the iphone 4 2014 I'll get a note for
and you will be buying a note for just
like I will because that's not going to
happen then on Thursday I asked you if
the bat camera the Nexus 5 has kept you
from buying it because the news war of
android 4.4 point one reaching the Nexus
5 to fix these problems and we have 265
comments out of which David lawmen says
i bought the HTC one over the Nexus 5 no
regret and you're lucky you probably
don't have a Retina Display tablet or
computer and you don't see all those
pixels on the HTC one's photos and yeah
they do better in color reproduction but
the Nexus 5 only needs software for fix
and peer Galiana says the camera is fine
for the average person and the picture
quality is actually decent to begin with
the only crappy part is the software and
you're right it's been historically true
that the software on Nexus devices is
terrible when it comes to the camera
then Sam salt says please look past the
camera the Nexus 5 is the best phone in
my opinion it is the best phone when it
comes to the price tagging is the pest
phone when it comes to everything you
get for it but I do believe that I would
have rather pay a little more for a
better camera because camera and image
quality is a big deal this year and then
finally on Friday I ask you if you would
like for other OEMs to have their own
retail stores the news were of Apple and
their whole ibeacon technology and how
good it was an innovation and we have
387 comments out of which one of them
says agree HTC stores would be the way
better than robert downey jr's ads and
yes you are so right i would think that
HTC stores in the united states would do
a far better job than teaching people
how to say HTC and range for that then
another commoner says I would love to
see Google stores for Nexus devices and
more and yes you're right it is terrible
to see that you can't really buy nexus
phones on well you can't find them in
some retail stores but it would be great
to have the experience I mean Google
alone needs to provide better exposure
for Android
then with Android having so many skins I
do understand why we don't have the
stores yet and then the last commoner
says amazon stores and yeah that would
be cool amazon is doing a great job with
their kindle hardware we are expecting
them to have a phone by next year and
drones prolly by 10 years from now so
why not an amazon store would also be
great the other commands and marching
band this is just my day all right 57
