hockey now calm and this is the software
and hardware review of the LG gg9 10
watch boom let's take a look again this
is some really futuristic technology the
ability to make a phone call from a
device the size of a watch is really
cool and it also has a front-facing
camera so that we're supported in Europe
you can actually make video calls so
let's talk about the hardware first its
appearance it's actually a very nice
looking watch as a piece of jewelry a
lot of my friends have put this on and
say hey you know I really like how this
looks for me I've got kind of small
wrists so it doesn't make as much sense
but you can get the sense that with
someone with a bigger wrist especially a
male this would actually look really
cool so it's got this chrome around the
edge it's got a flat flush space which
is of course the capacitive touch screen
the band is made to look like a carbon
fiber although it's definitely not it's
it's actually some rubbery plastic
material which is a shame to see on a
device that cost nearly a thousand
dollars you would think they'll use
higher quality materials of course we've
already seen this area which is where
you put the SIM card in with the special
tool I'll put a link up at the end of
the video if you want to see how to put
the SIM card in we've got some contacts
here that is used for the charger slash
sinker so you can put this connect this
to your computer you just go like that
you connect this wire your computer and
that's how you charge it that's how you
sync it with all of your information
your contacts and music and anything to
that effect so let's talk about the
watch itself let's go through a software
tour I'm gonna zoom in on the screen
okay now it's not actually this dim it's
on this sort of screen saver mode right
now which will show you the date and the
time so it doesn't use much power this
has been on standby for many days and
it's still kicking so let's turn it on
I'm going to wake it up by pressing the
the call end button over here there's a
call end call start and a back button so
here we get the actual clock and you can
flick through and change the clock to a
variety of different styles so you get
the kind of futuristic analog style we
have a digital with a little bit of a
light show this one's more classy too
in one so if you're traveling you can
see what time it is back home and
likewise for this screen and this one is
very digital very modern and we get back
to the beginning a lot of time choices
so that's the first way you interact
with the watch phone you scroll up and
down to change the way the time looks
and you'll probably keep it on one
particular time now we can access all
the other screens by swiping right and
left so I'm going to swipe right and
over here these are the notifications so
I can see my battery life which is
actually very much empty right now I can
see my cell phone signal which is quite
good I'm on AT&amp;amp;T as you can see this
doesn't have the proper bands to do AT&amp;amp;T
3G or t-mobile 3G but that's fine
because the 3G is only used if you're
doing the video chat so there's no
internet on here like you'll find out a
real smart phone but how are you going
to fit internet on a device with a
screen that's 160 by 128 across it's not
really made to check your email okay so
here we are we can change the the volume
the profiles very sensitive touchscreen
can be operated exclusively with your
finger in fact it won't work with
anything else because it's not a
resistive touchscreen we can turn
airplane airplane mode on and off
quickly from there if we swipe this way
we get to our calendar which really
doesn't show you too much and it's not
really made to input content so you're
not really supposed to use this to
schedule a meeting for example and so
let's go back with the back button and
we can swipe over here and this is
really the main menu so let me go into
this a little bit we've messaging and we
can actually write text messages on the
watch phone and it's not too difficult
so I can go to create new message and
I'm not going to put it too but I'm
gonna type the message and say hello
this is a test and as you can see this
is using t9 so something very familiar
to a lot of people this is a test there
it is this is a test I'm going to press
Enter there's the message very easy to
use the text messaging and you get sort
of pop-up notifications when you get a
text message so I'm gonna go back and
I'm going to exit without saving and
we're back in our inbox go back again so
that was messaging again you can't do
email it's only text
messaging we can go into contacts and we
can add a new contact this will sync up
without look and a lot of other
different mail programs you can't do any
sort of wireless sync it's all done
manually which is kind of annoying but
again this is a watch phone it's not
meant to replace your smart phones it's
meant to be sort of a supplement to it
so again we can add contacts we can
search through the existing contacts to
find someone to call and here's a
contact that I added testing so the
green button there lets me call the
person directly go back here are a
couple of utilities so we can go into
multimedia you can sync up a variety of
music with this it plays all the major
formats and it has two gigabytes of
space you would want to use or you would
have to use a Bluetooth headset to get
music out of this because there's no 3.5
millimeter headphone jack certainly on
this watch phone so we can go through
some music we can go to the camera and
actually take pictures so it's going to
show me so hey you there I am behind the
camera and smile
take a picture saves the picture you can
transfer it to your computer with the
the cable that's included with the watch
phone and of course here are a variety
of other pictures that I've taken pretty
much doing the exact same thing well you
get the point and it's just zoomed in
very very nice there and let's go back
so with a small screen it's not the best
picture viewer but it works pretty well
it stores about 1900 pictures depending
on the quality level on average about
1200 if you use the highest quality
setting now we can go here into
organizer and you already saw the
calendar there's also a to-do list quite
simply it's a it's a task list that you
would find on any basic smartphone so
we're gonna go back we can add memos if
we want to you know just say get the
milk
so we tap there and say get and I would
bet that this the speed of text entry
once you get used to this and you're not
at a weird angle like I am right now is
akin to what you would get on a regular
smartphone I found myself to be very
fast with this nice t9 pad it's the
buttons are large enough the screen is
sensitive enough and it just it just
works okay and then there also are a
couple of settings here for sort of
memory info on the calendar
not too deep in terms of what you can
change on this phone
okay and then there's a date finder in
here sort of very basic utilities
there's an alarm certainly I'm so you
can have multiple alarms just very handy
to have on any sort of watch certainly
we have voice recorders so it works as
advertised this is a test of the voice
recorder quality is pretty good so this
would be good to have in a meeting if
you want to get somebody somebody to say
something to remind you of something
nice handy voice recorder and then we
have a couple of tools in here like a
calculator got to have a calculator and
so as a variety of functions we have a
world clock a stopwatch and I don't know
what STK is down here perhaps that is
for developers so I'm going to go back
and back again and so now we're back to
this main screen and here are the
settings I should say for the entire
device before I was in the productivity
settings so we can add a Bluetooth
device through this and I have tried
with a headset quality is great the
range works quite well we can change the
profiles based on where you are if
you're in a meeting you put it on silent
if you're outdoors you want to Rea
louder you can do that as well okay we
can go to screen and change some things
about this we can change the top menu
style we can change it to sort of a
larger style a list style a kind of
honeycomb honeycomb grid so I'm just
going to leave it on what it is there's
this change to confirm we can change the
backlight to turn off at certain
intervals and change the brightness of
the backlight right now it's a 100% by
default oddly it's at a hundred percent
so if we bring it down you can see that
the screen still stays very usable so if
you're using this as a full time phone
you probably want to turn the brightness
down just to get enough battery life out
of this and that's pretty much the end
of the settings we also have
connectivity there this is the network
settings it automatically configured
itself to the AT&amp;amp;T network which was
nice but it really didn't have to do
that much because I'm just using it for
phone calls and texts
is not for data because there's really
not much you can do with this with data
it comes with a really nice program that
lets you synchronize like I said but
nothing is done over-the-air so let's go
back one more time now you're probably
wondering how you make a call well I'm
almost there
here we are video call and voice call
since I can't do a video call I'm going
to jump to a video demonstrating a voice
call I think you will be pleasantly
surprised
okay so let's actually do a test call
here I'm going to go to voice call I'm
going to take it off the screen here and
dial a phone number okay and it's
dialing and from this distance you
should be able to hear the person on the
other end hey Mason
am i coming through clearly great let me
I'm going to increase the volume now if
you press and hold I believe it is on
the call start button or maybe it's the
back button yeah here it is the volume
so now if Mason talks you probably be a
bit louder yeah so the speaker distorts
a little bit when it's at loud volume
but it's pretty clear and I'm holding
the the watch about 12 to 15 inches away
from my face and he can still hear me so
that is pretty cool so thanks for taking
the call Mason all right bye-bye and
then to end the COFF course you press
call end here and it is done so as a
phone the watch phone actually is a
really good device it's very clear the
other person can hear me very well it's
very easy to dial somebody to call
somebody when calls ring through it's
very clear that somebody's calling it's
very too easy very easy to accept or
reject it works very well as a phone but
that's really it if you think about it
it's kind of cool that you they have
been able to fit a full cell phone into
a device the size of a watch it's a
really really small device but for $1000
I really don't know who would want to
buy something like this maybe a James
Bond wannabe if this was a quarter of
the price it could be a cool product to
have you know for the weekends or when
you didn't want to carry around a full
phone but again at $1000 it's really
prohibitively expensive for
of us so that was a look at the LG gg9
10 watch phone a really cool product if
you've got the bucks that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
