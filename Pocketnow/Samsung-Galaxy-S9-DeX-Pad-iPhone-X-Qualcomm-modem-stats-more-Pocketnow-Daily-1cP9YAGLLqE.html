color options at an index pad
recent studies show how Qualcomm modems
are far superior on the iPhone tendon
from Intel and the 1 + 5 t just
unwrapped it's Star Wars Edition and I
am drooling over it I'm Jaime Rivera and
26 hours later I am in Maui we are here
for the stab dragon summit I can't wait
to see what we get this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for any of
the new Samsung Galaxy S 8s
8 + or no date devices there is a
current deal at Best Buy where you get
$100 off at an egg if card after the
devices ship and in addition to that you
also get a wireless charger which is a
lot of money in this zone and I actually
do use these every now and then so you
can learn more on the description other
interesting news come from the new Star
Wars edition 1 + 5 t oh my god it's a
silverback with the Star Wars logo a
black front and even though we don't
have information on specifications just
yet or what markets are going to be used
for the launch because we notice it's an
Amazon exclusive but it doesn't really
say what countries I am really stoked
for what I see mainly because I love the
1 plus 5t design I just I really wanted
that silver with black 1 + yes thank you
the spotlight over to some interesting
news that I've discovered over my review
period with the iPhone 10 it took me a
while to realize that the unit that I
was using brought Intel modems it seems
that only the CDMA variants of the
iPhone 10 include a Qualcomm modem and
from the experience that I heard from
others with amazing battery life and
great connectivity and that actually
wasn't my case and as it turns out there
is now a study that proves that the
Qualcomm chip modem on the iPhone Tenace
far superior when it comes to efficiency
and connectivity than the Intel modem
why is happily allowing this I don't
know I don't know why not just stick to
Qualcomm modems I mean we've been
dealing with this problem ever since the
iPhone 7 so yeah and speaking of the
iPhone 10 one thing that is shocking
everybody is just how well this product
is selling up to the point where we've
got analysts already predicting that
this device is going to
ringback Apple to the time when it broke
all records that pretty much stopped
with the iPhone 6s we obviously don't
have specific numbers just yet but
apparently Apple is going to break get
records yet again in this quarter so
stay tuned for that information
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy S nine as
we still don't have full details on
specifications but we do notice two
things number one that apparently there
will be a purple color option that's
going to be crazy
not necessarily the orchid gray so that
is a thing to be expected though
apparently it won't launch initially the
second thing is that apparently there
will be a new Dex pad not a Dex doc and
it makes all the sense in the world I
love the concept of the Dex doc I just
loved the Huawei implementation where
you didn't need a doc it was just a
cable with the huawei mate 10 probe in
May 10 so apparently there will be this
pad that will provide the same
functionality but also allow you to use
your Galaxy S 9 whatever the case may be
in the question today what would you
like to see in the Galaxy S 9 in my case
I would love a Dex cable to be honest
with you but Dex pad let's see what we
get in addition to whatever other
features Sampson can bring leave us a
