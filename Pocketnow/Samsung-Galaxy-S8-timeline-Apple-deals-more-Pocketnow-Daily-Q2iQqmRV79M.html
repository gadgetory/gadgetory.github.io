first device to rock Qualcomm's new
chips HTC goes official with yet another
flagship that drops the spring flavor
and Samsung is reportedly working on
pushing more galaxy s seven units before
the year ends I'm hi meri behna and one
thing that I've learned about Tuesday's
is that you should never underestimate
the power of an extended Monday this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with very odd deals as Apple
is not the company that's common for
providing any but set your calendars for
November 25th the company is going to be
offering some special sale that looks
more like Black Friday and you can learn
more about her than the likes of
discretion and speaking of deals those
of you that are interested in alcatel
idol 4s which is actually a smartphone
that I really like and you're not caring
about that VR headset that most people
don't care about you get it for three
hundred and fifty dollars on Amazon this
is one of the best premium mid Rangers
in the market great design and if it's
not for that fingerprint scanner that's
really hard to find I highly suggest
this phone household the spotlight over
to HTC as the company has now launched
the bolt as the evo or 10 Evo should we
call it and yes there is a striking
resemblance between both devices but you
have to remember that specifications are
actually not the best with this bolt
evil whatever you want to call it
Snapdragon 810 processor three gigs of
ram pretty much everything is watered
down except for the fact that you're
running nougat you can learn more about
markets and pricing in the links as well
just followed over to Samsung as the
company according to polls is not really
being affected by the whole galaxy note
7 thing up to the point where we hear
that the company might launched yet
another galaxy s7 before the year ends
it's going to be glossy black and if it
brings a striking resemblance to a
device that also comes in jet black well
this might be the option that just won't
scratch let's see what we get and
finally the very interesting rumors
today have to do with the samsung galaxy
s 8 and the Snapdragon 835 processor if
to remember that qua command Samsung
worked together on this processor but
this is not the first time the both
companies collaborate and it's not the
first time that these processors don't
make it first to the gallic
smart phones usually it comes first from
LG but according to some sources it
seems that the samsung galaxy s it will
be the first device meaning that will
either get an early galaxy s 8 which
would mimic what happened at CES a
couple years ago or we don't know
exactly what will be the case but it
does lead me to the question of the day
would you rather in early galaxy s 8 and
what would you like to see in this
particular device to solve all the
issues of the node 7 in my case I would
love a galaxy s 8 edge with an S Pen but
