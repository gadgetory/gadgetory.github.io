pocketnow.com today we're going to take
a look at Windows Phone 7 vs windows
phone 7 we've got windows phone 7 pre
update or pre know they'll build 7008 on
the left and Windows Phone 7 modo on the
right build 7390 the nodal update is
supposedly bringing some faster
application launch times and even faster
resume times for applications which are
running so we'll make sure to put that
to the test on Windows Phone 7 vs
windows phone 7 pre update versus no
dough let's take a look at how these
perform and we're back we got LG optimus
7 pre node 0 LG optimus 7 no dough we
have installed no no just a couple of
hours ago and we will see how it
performs nevertheless these devices are
turned off we are going to start them at
the same time see which one gets to a
stable usable start screen faster let's
hit the power button and two one go
usually it takes around 20 to 25 seconds
from the second of pushing the power
button to get into a stable usable start
screen we'll see which one of these gets
there faster now though pre no go nota
was first one two three four five six
seven eight seconds no don't vanish it's
faster to boot up to a start screen
actually the pre nodal is stuck windows
phone 7 it doesn't bring any performance
enhancements it just prepares windows
phone 7 devices to the nodal updates to
arrive let's take a look further into
launching some applications and games in
the game's hub now these both devices
have the same amounts of memory use
basically they are mirrored same number
of music same number of
pictures videos applications what not
you name it they should perform the same
but they are not let's see okay so let's
try to run bejeweled live on both
devices at the same time now bejeweled
life is great for making comparisons
because it has that animated startup
logo which acts as a progress indicator
Noda looks to be quicker and yep there
you go nodal load it up first and it's a
considerable difference pre no dough is
second let's take a look at how these
two applications behave when they are
resuming let's switch the screens of
they are both switched off at the moment
let's try to switch them back on unlock
the screen well nothing new nothing
major to see here they are both running
and resumed let's get out of here and
let's try to launch flight control looks
like a little bit of advantage to know
though here but else they are going
head-to-head nope actually no dough
finished first and pre no dough comes in
second let's get back and let's try to
launch mmm fruit ninja hmm definitely no
dough is again ahead it looks like a
second or show yup pre no dough first no
dough comes in second again let's get
back
let's try something else let's try the
new poker game looks like again no dough
is a little bit ahead only by a part of
a second yep again mellow finished first
pre know though is still launching and
its considerable difference yep now it
finished okay so let's get back out of
here this game saves its state upon
exiting and let's try to launch a Bing
search at the same time on these two
devices so let's get back and launch
Bing yup no dough comes in first pre no
dough comes in second again let's get
back and try to launch an application
like Facebook okay both look to be
running head-to-head and they both
launched at the same time we can say
yeah we can call this one at sigh okay
let's get out of here no actually let's
just see how these to resume stare a
screen off let's turn the screen back on
unlock the screen and yeah they're both
running
let's try to launch chasm pretty much
the same no actually a meadow was first
breno de came in second let's try to
launch Twitter judging by the first
screen they go head to head both now
actually pre knodel was faster this time
even if it was by a thin margin let's
get back now let's try to resuming so
we'll screen off we're going to turn the
screen back on unlock the screens and
see how they do in resuming their both
resuming again a very very slight
difference in advantage of nodal
let's try another one let's try Adobe
Reader pretty much the same know though
is a little bit ahead so this was pretty
much it windows phone 7 node 0 vs
windows phone 7 pre no dough or pre
update Microsoft has done some
performance enhancements in application
load times they have reused resume times
of applications and the system feels
overall a little bit snappier this was
Anton denied from pocketnow.com taking a
look at Windows Phone 7 node 0 vs pre
know though thank you very much for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
