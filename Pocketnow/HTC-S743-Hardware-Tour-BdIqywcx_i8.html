pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the unlocked HTC s 743 this
device will work on AT&amp;amp;T 3g network in
the US and if you have tmobile it will
work on their edge network so let's take
a look at the hardware in the upper left
corner we have a ambient light sensor
which will help to adjust screen
brightness based on how bright it is
wherever you are we have a speaker to
the right of that the screen is 2.4
inches diagonal with q vga resolution so
that's 240 across and 320 up now because
it's a smaller screen it looks pretty
crisp even though it has technically a
low resolution screen but it looks good
and you'll see that in the next video
I'm going down we have HTC logo and then
we have a very interesting kind of
cluster buttons down here call start and
call and are very very tiny buttons but
fortunately they are raised quite a bit
so that if you're running your finger
along the screen you can easily find
those buttons the d-pad is very
pronounced which is good a lot of people
who have the touch pro or touch diamond
complain that the d-pad is completely
flat and thus it's pretty hard to use
not the case on the S 743 very
pronounced very easy to use with a huge
select button in the center below that
we have a home button which will take
you to the home screen and a back button
now here we have the numeric keypad and
I was hoping by the looks of the
prototype images that they would have
little ledges on them but instead they
are completely flat too which makes it a
little difficult to feel for them
although you get a little bit of a bump
on the five that's something you'll have
to get used to and all of these keys are
backlit if you start using them in a
dark room ok let's take a look at this
keyboard the keyboard is a 4 row
keyboard unlike the HTC touch pro which
is a five row keyboard that's because
there is no dedicated number row up top
and so if you want to get to a number
you have to hold down the function key
and then press a number which is kind of
annoying but I mean they wouldn't be
able to fit an extra row here because
it's not
that big of a device we have some
shortcuts here if we do function and
symbol will launch the internet browser
she turn on and off t9 through the green
letters here and profiles and there's
some other things there as well now
something I find kind of weird is that
the right softkey button is all the way
to the right when on the screen you'll
see the right soft key command show up
right here so it takes a little bit of
getting used to and over here we have
lights for function and caps lock on the
side we have volume up and down buttons
and the power button is right on the top
just like the touch diamond touch pro on
the bottom we have USB mini USB port
which will work for audio and charging
and syncing unfortunately there's no 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on this device
and if we go to the right we have a
camera button and flipping over to the
back this may look familiar too because
if you look at the HTC touch pro it has
pretty much the same exact backing it's
got the faceted backing with these kind
of soft rubbery material that feels
really good in the hand and then you
have that diamond-cut look with the
camera lens same thing over here 3.2
megapixel camera and a speakerphone hole
right here and if we take off the back
cover we reveal the 1000 milliamp hour
battery and that probably seems kind of
small but for a device of this type that
should be enough though I'll have a full
wrap up of the battery life in the full
review on pocket now calm and you're
probably wondering where the microSD
slot is and the SIM card holder well
it's not under the battery it's actually
awkwardly placed behind this screen and
I always have trouble with this you have
to slide this open and then you get the
sim card here and if you take out the
sim card you will get the microSD slot
so really awkward place for the micro SD
card and even the SIM card so hopefully
you don't swap your your microSD card
too much and you just leave it in there
so overall I like the hardware on the
HTC s 743 it is a very high quality feel
it feels great in hand and in pocket I
just wish that HTC would focus more so
on function than they would form the
front of the device looks beautiful but
the small start call call start and call
end keys the flat numeric buttons aren't
really practical and
and they did this to with the HTC touch
pro and touch a diamond where the d-pad
is completely flat and a lot of people
have trouble using the d-pad fortunately
the s7 43 has a raised d-pad what the
flatness of some of these buttons will
take some getting used to we'll talk
more about that in the review coming up
we're going to do a software tour and
show you all of the added software and
enhancements that have been made to the
s7 43 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
