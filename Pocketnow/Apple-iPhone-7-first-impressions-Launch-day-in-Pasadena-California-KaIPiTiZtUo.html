brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet please visit D brand calm no
other tech company can make as much of a
spectacle out of a new phone lunch as
Apple can I was hands-on in Pasadena
where my pals at AT&amp;amp;T were kind enough
to open a store early for me to start
playing with the iPhone 7
before my pre-order was delivered this
came with the benefit of being around to
chat with local reporters and I
basically hit every major local news
outlet in the greater LA area talking
iPhone non-stop for over four hours but
enough bragging about me being on TV you
folks want to see the new iPhone right
well here it is we ordered a matte
finished black iPhone 7 and opening the
box this is super familiar packaging
papers we won't read some stickers
though for being familiar I still
managed to almost drop the thing showing
it off here under the phone we've got
this insert for the earpods and of
course a lightning cable and a charger
it should be mentioned that the earpods
no longer come in a plastic case this is
a cardboard insert but once you unwind
these headphones make sure you also grab
the Lightning 2 3.5 millimeter adapter
on the back I had a friend at the launch
almost throw this away today getting to
handle both versions of the black iPhone
I personally prefer the satin finish on
the matte black better than the jet
black iPhone it does collect
fingerprints but far less aggressively
than the glossy version and after a
short set up logging into my itunes
account were greeted by an instructional
prompt showing off the new home button
now just a sensor you can tweak how much
of a haptic pulse you receive during the
initial setup this might be one of my
favorite new features it's such a simple
way to address the number of home
buttons which have failed on iPhones in
the past it has a different feel which
takes a little getting used to but it
doesn't take long to get the hang of it
we've all known by now that Apple is
removing the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack but this hasn't changed the overall
form factor in any significant way this
iPhone is almost identical in size and
shape to last year's iPhone 6s I'd even
be able to use my 6s cases were it not
for the repositioned camera sensor and
flash we wouldn't fault anyone for
making a joke about this phone re
being in iphone6s it's so similar but
we've praised Samsung this year for
refining the Galaxy s7 / the s6 and in
fairness there are a lot of little
touches on the iPhone 7 which are
greatly appreciated early impressions on
speaker and headphone audio quality are
positive though I don't have a lot of
faith in the durability of this adapter
after all of the worn out lightning
cables I've seen will always be fans of
making phones more water-resistant and
it really is a joy to fire up a
base-model iPhone and see over 20 gig of
available storage there's nothing
revolutionary here we kind of know what
we're in store for on a new iPhone
launch but our first impressions are
definitely positive if for a little
controversy as to how consumers might
respond to the headphone situation it's
only day one and we have a lot of
testing to jump into has this new 8n
chipset handled gaming do these new
antenna bands improve reception and you
know we're going to dig really deep into
this shooter for our real camera review
stay tuned folks we're gonna have a lot
of fun with this one pocket now's iPhone
