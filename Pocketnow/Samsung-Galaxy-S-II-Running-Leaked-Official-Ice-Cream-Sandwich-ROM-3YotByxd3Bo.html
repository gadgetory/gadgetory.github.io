launched the Google Samsung Galaxy Nexus
many still believe that the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 is still the Android phone at
the moment now we won't go into that
debate but Samsung has promised an
official Ice Cream Sandwich Ram update
for the Samsung Galaxy s2 and we're
expecting it to be rola rolled out
sometime this quarter that being said we
have a leaked official but not final
version of the Ice Cream Sandwich ROM it
is of January 29 and we'll take a look
at how it runs on the phone and it
should give us a slight idea on what to
expect in terms of software for the
Samsung Galaxy s2 this is engine denied
from pocketnow.com let's take a look at
Ice Cream Sandwich on the samsung galaxy
s2
now straight from the beginning you'll
notice that the unlocking mechanism has
changed you no longer have to swipe off
the entire lockscreen wallpaper but once
you put your finger on the screen
regardless of its position you will be
presented with the unlock ring which is
typical to Ice Cream Sandwich but of
course we have seen the ring and the
best with HTC devices and with HTC Sense
but this is more Ice Cream Sandwich like
now once you put your finger on the
screen you will be presented with a
small lock and once you move your finger
towards the edges of the screen that
lock will be opening up gradually until
you managed to unlock your phone and
this is the home screen of the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 it's running Android 4.0
point three Ice Cream Sandwich with
Samsung's own TouchWiz user interface on
top of it and the TouchWiz user
interface has been slightly modified now
we have the still list we have still the
same numbers of home screens and you can
swipe between them but you can see that
swiping and flipping through the home
screens is more fluid one of the changes
Samsung has included with the new
TouchWiz user interface is that when you
reach the end and you still try to swipe
you will be presented with this little
animation basically a tilting of the
plane to let you know that there's
nowhere else to swipe to and this is
valid when you reach the other end as
you can see the plane tilting and also
in the applications once you are at the
last page you can swipe no more so this
is one of the new additions in the Ice
Cream Sandwich run for the Samsung
Galaxy s2 another new feature of course
is the notification drawer
it still looks the same but because of
Ice Cream Sandwich all the notifications
which you will get here will be
swipeable that means that if you have a
new email text message called tweet
whatever you'll be able to swipe it off
and basically clear your notifications
Asians from this area in addition you'll
have it will still have the Clear button
which will be placed right here now in
terms of applications there are not many
new applications you will notice that
Google Plus and Google Plus Messenger
are installed by default so expect to
see them once samsung rolls out the new
Ice Cream Sandwich rom that aside once
we get back to TouchWiz and talk about
widgets Samsung didn't add at least not
in this version of the ROM any new
widgets so whatever you will find down
here matches what you currently have on
your gingerbread powered Galaxy s2
now diving into settings you will see
the new Ice Cream Sandwich settings with
what's important at the top wireless and
networks of course you have the more
button and as you can see the scrolling
is fluid you can notice the new Roboto
font which is standard for Ice Cream
Sandwich and while we are here let's
take a look at the version numbers as
you can see it's currently 4.0 point 3
this is not the official final version
it's an official version but it has been
leaked but still it's pretty close to
final we find it to be stable we find it
to be fast so we wouldn't be surprised
if we would see an official rollout
coming soon let's take a look at the
camera application which is still
basically the same as you've seen before
you have your menu right here with the
new menus which come with Ice Cream
Sandwich that aside everything is
unchanged now let's take a look at the
internet browser because this has been
pretty much improved in Ice Cream
Sandwich
we have pocketnow.com loaded but we will
also load this up but it's just to see
how fast it is so far scrolling is very
smooth and you won't be able to see any
checkerboard in the browser if you
double tap to zoom in it will be as
fluid as possible even more fluid
it was on gingerbread and again it's not
chappy it's just buttery smooth and
let's get back here now let's go home on
a webpage and see how fast it loads
should take a couple of seconds we have
all add-ons enabled we have flash
enabled and we should consider that when
we take a look at the browser speed you
can easily scroll the page while it is
loading it will have no problem with
that it manages just fine let's see how
screen rotation is it's not instant but
it's nice Ice Cream Sandwich brings that
Windows Phone 7 like animation when you
fill the phone which is now coming to
many platforms iOS also does that so
instead of just presenting you with the
new view you will be presented with a
small animation rotation but that also
adds to the rotation time that aside
rotation is quick browsing this quick
zooming panning is also quick and the
new Roboto font is very very very
readable on this device let's take a
look at the gallery application which is
also slightly improved but the general
looks and concept are the same you will
be finding it should behave a little bit
more smooth than on gingerbread for
instance but the basic gallery is still
just the same of course talking about
the pictures
Samsung also included its picture
editing application which should be
right here right here it's photo editor
it's useful if you want to quickly edit
pictures on your phone now we don't want
this to be a software review we are just
taking a look at Ice Cream Sandwich on
the Samsung Galaxy S 2 this is what you
should expect slightly improved
performance buttery smooth scrolling
overall a good addition to a great phone
this was an Cindy night from
pocketnow.com taking a quick look at the
Ice Cream Sandwich leaked around for the
Samsung Galaxy S
