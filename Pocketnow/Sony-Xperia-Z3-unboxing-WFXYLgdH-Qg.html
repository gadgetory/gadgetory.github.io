needed a refresh well it depends on who
you ask
and if you s Sony it was because we now
have the Sony Xperia z3 launched at this
year's FIFA and Berlin
well not mostly because the z2 needed a
refresh it performed well it was speedy
it looked good but because Sony promised
and committed to releasing a flagship
every six months we've got it here in
our labs we're going to unbox it and
this unboxing starts our coverage of the
z3
at the end of which we will find out if
this is a worthy successor to the z2 so
let's dive into it
so here we have the two generations we
have the Sony Xperia z2 on the right and
we have the Sony Xperia z3 on the left
and we'll just take the z2 put it to the
side for a second and we'll take a look
at the box of the z3 as we all know you
love looking at boxes this is a special
thing we do with the unboxings and while
we take a look around the box will tell
you that the z3 is an incremental update
over - see - there's a faster processor
a slimmer form factor and as you can see
around the back the colors have been
tweaked we have white and black no
longer have the bluish magenta we have
the copper version alongside the black
and white classics and some specs are
being called out here
try luminous display for the screen with
the X relative or for mobile engine
which all improve the display quality we
have the 4k recording capabilities and
all the rest of course we have the water
and dust proof build which we had on the
z2 and as well as on the Z but we'll
take a look at that with the occasion of
our full review for now let's just crack
open the box and see what's inside and
put the top to the side
we're being welcomed by the phone let's
enter a little bit to the left we'll put
it to the right and see what we have
here we have as Sony usually bundles a
additional screen protector with a
cleaning cloth which comes in handy but
we're not interested right now we have a
wall charger which is in our case a UK
plug because that's where we bought the
Xperia z3 from we have a micro USB to
USB cable a nice accessory if you need
it and if you don't have 50 others we
have a micro USB cable by itself in case
you don't have 70 others and the
headphones themselves and we're
interested to see if Sony has improved
the quality of the audio not necessarily
as in the frequencies but as in the
volume let's take a look at the phone
itself take it out from its protective
sleeve and compare it real quick with
the z2 as you can see they both follow
the same design language to the letter
of course there are a couple of changes
vz3 on the
left is slimmer and of course it's the
black one so it will be easy for you to
spot we'll just get back to differences
between these two let's peel the plastic
and you will find no funky special
camera effects here like Michael Fisher
does we'll just peel it and see that
this is a nice glossy slab of black
glass which will usually collect a lot
of fingerprints but hey that's what you
expect from black phones nowadays which
are shiny we're not going to power it on
right now we're not going to bore you
with specs you can find them on the
internet as well as in the post on
pocket now where this video will be
embedded follow us for more comparisons
including the z3 versus z2 where we will
tell you if it is worth it or not
everyone thank you very much for

on twitter as well as on facebook and
don't forget to follow PocketNow and all
the usual social media channels we got
lots more on the sony xperia z3 so stay
tuned
