pocketnow.com just got back from Aoife
in Berlin and found a cool package
waiting for me on my stoop this is the
Motorola Droid Razr am one of the three
new devices Motorola announced yesterday
in their New York City event we can have
a full review up for you as soon as you
can but in the meantime why don't we
take a look at what's inside the box I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow let's
get to it okay guys so take a look at
the packaging here this is nothing
terribly new from Verizon
we have Verizon and Motorola branding
some blurbs on the back but otherwise
this is very very minimal packaging we
slide the sleeve off here here's the
Droid Razr m branding there and we can
just pop this right up here take that
there Motorola Droid Razr m here's the
device I'm going to go ahead and take
the device out put it aside for a second
pop open the packaging here there we are
pretty typical array of stuff we're
looking at a you as a wall charger USB
cable this is a card insertion and
removal tool thank you motorola wait for
the sim Verizon Start Guide in multiple
languages consumer information product
warranty and safety information etc
usual stuff no headphones not much extra
there but it is a tiny little box so we
didn't expect that here is the device
itself oops sorry about that so you can
get the glare off there for now the
first thing you'll notice if you have a
look at how it's sitting in my hand this
is actually a quite a compact little
device
it feels weighty in the hand not too
substantial but certainly not too light
either and this is a 126 gram device
some call-outs on the screen protector
here for the the various buttons and
controls let's take a little hardware
tour for you on the right hand side here
looks like a power standby button volume
up volume down some exposed screws on
the side here so you can tell this is a
device there
trying to mark it as a little bit on the
beefy side and Wow look at that we have
kind of a reverse chin there a little
tapered edge on the bottom coming around
to the back here this is a we know that
this there's a thumbprint on it now
sorry this is a HD video camera is what
it's calling itself out eyes but this is
an eight megapixel shooter capable of
shooting at 1080p that's an LED flash
next door speakerphone there Kevlar back
Verizon 4G LTE branding over here with
looks like we've got yes a tray for the
SIM card and the micro sd micro USB port
there along the top three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack and that looks
like that's about it
now this display if we take off the
screen protector here sorry I'm Lea
there that's better this is a 4.3 inch
display I'm going to power on the phone
while I'm talking 4.3 inch display which
is qht it's actually the same panel as
the original Droid Razr as far as anyone
can tell Super AMOLED advanced covered
by Corning Gorilla Glass 2 as I
mentioned that is a Kevlar back on the
back here already getting fingerprinted
up in this hot booth with my sweaty
hands sorry water repellent nano coating
covering the whole thing
there's our Droid branding whoa that's
impressive how they just get more and
more elaborate every time don't they
there's an aluminum frame under all that
as well the device is 8.3 millimeters
thick as a front-facing camera up here a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 at 1.5 gigahertz
powering it all underneath backed up by
one gig of ram user-accessible memory
eight gigs only half of which is user
accessible so you'll want to probably
buy a micro SD card but we'll tell you
more about that in the official review
finally Android 4.4 LTE radio obviously
and Verizon and Motorola claiming a 20
hour battery life on what they're
calling regular use on a 2000 milliamp
hour battery
so that's about all we've got for you on
the Motorola Droid Razr

video like I said at the beginning we're
gonna have a review video up as soon as
humanly possible please stay tuned to
pocket now tweets on Twitter you can
