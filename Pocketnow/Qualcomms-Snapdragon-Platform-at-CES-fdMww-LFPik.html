right here is a new device that as a
slider capability you're seeing right
now as it transitions it over
we're actually taking a look at our
media flow capability with this device
as a small antenna on the back that you
can actually see as well so if we were
outside of the convention center you
would actually be getting live TV really
run multiple channels of different video
on it as well you can see as I slide
this up that it has a keyboard in it
which is really great this device not
only does it have the media flow
capability you can also obviously have
your music on it you can run email
everyone's windows mobile 6 point what
kind of wireless radios does it have
well right now this has its poop of
cellular what kind of sailor well we're
actually not talking about that right
now which I think another time that
labor of cellular really
on what the individual
okay so are you trying to get this onto
a carrier or well we're doing this by
showing the prototypes we're trying to
really demonstrate what can be done with
this app tracking platform right this
African platform is a 1 gigahertz
processor Wow incredible battery life
options on it really you're looking at a
5 is 6 21 comparison to maybe something
x86 type of devices is that the only
speed 1 gigahertz or does it range well
right now we're looking at one gigahertz
processor core Snapdragon the obviously
of other processors run at various
speeds right snapdragon countries a
single core device and as we get farther
out 2007
start to see more really what's the
what's the maximum amount of course
Snapdragon platform kid well you know if
anything it's all theoretical right now
right looking at 244
yah
possible sure now I take a look at the
device some more and so what's what's
the resolution of the screen looks
pretty good I think it's actually I need
to check on it I think it's you remember
the resolution on the screen no this is
just a prototype babies in the
screen resolutions that makes sense you
know what's really interesting about
this prototype bring our readers is that
it has right now a mini version of an
ati video processing card it's actually
the same graphics card in a miniature
version as what you can find in the xbox
360 right it's actually more powerful
than what's in the sony PSP right now so
it has a really good graphics video
absolutely so you know really again
these are prototypes so you know we can
see OEM is developing this type of
device or you know potentially CEO ems
developing other things that the P&amp;amp;V
style right maybe it's a media player on
steroids
all sorts of different combinations
so this so what's really hot about this
is that it's a much faster processor I
mean what would have ice processors have
been stuck at 400 megahertz for a long
time now so you kind of your kind of
making the leap maybe going against
Intel yeah absolutely one of the things
that's really interesting about this is
that at this processor speed you can
actually run not to choose the window as
well you can actually
OS it's interesting using the navigation
functions are on this year as well so
let's see if i can get this too
so is integrated GPS yeah again you're
just you're just it's a prototype so you
just put it some radios in here and well
yeah I mean one of the interesting
things is a lot of different aspects of
this functionalities all integrated
within the Snapdragon lab really so is
GPS integrated in oh yeah in the chips
up yeah that's one of Qualcomm
specialties interesting so this book is
this in 10 more for cell phone devices
or kind of ultra mobile computers it was
a really this whole initiative this app
dragon platform is really
and other devices outside the cell
phones right oh really it's meant to be
a consumer about garage
certainly is
selkie right
power and all the cell phone needs
that's why we're starting to show other
types of demos besides self something
like this can just see is actually some
of the things in policy seminar on
Windows Mobile tours this is actually
the sorting see see one of these resting
thinks that
what we see is a continuum of devices or
have your cell phone your smart phone
one end maybe it's a Blackberry or some
sort of context capable device and they
write app and then on the other end of
the continuum you have a laptop right
well there's this missing category right
now yeah somewhere in the middle between
a laptop and
a blackberry and that's really that's
where these types of devices that's what
I think it's sweet spot
interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
