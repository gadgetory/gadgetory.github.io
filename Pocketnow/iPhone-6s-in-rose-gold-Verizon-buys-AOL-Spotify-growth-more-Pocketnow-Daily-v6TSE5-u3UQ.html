claimed major improvements in internals
verizon acquires AOL and a new plan
focused on the gentle media and warner
music claims that music streaming is the
way to go in the future I'm hi Mary vet
I am once again I will leave it up to
the Jersey to do the talking this is
pocket out daily let's begin today with
the official news starting with
Microsoft skype service as they've just
made the Skype translator public to
everyone without the need of a sign up
and this has been waiting a long time
the service was announced last year but
you have to sign up for it now it's
available to everyone and what it does
is pretty much translate what you're
talking live in either English Spanish
Mandarin or Italian and if you want this
to be transcribed in text you get 50
language options the service is really
cool though again it is still a work in
progress at sea other official news have
AOL being it quired by verizon for 4.4
billion and if it wasn't for the verizon
news we probably wouldn't be talking
about this the cool news here is that
wealth even though AOL was not supposed
to be worth so much money it seems that
the company is a portfolio for
advertisement in addition to its video
services are enough for verizon to want
to acquire it we just wonder what
verizon will do with it and we will keep
you posted on that other news that
aren't official just yet as a deep
discount from t-mobile for samsung and
the way this works is that apparently
you'll get a hundred dollar master card
rewards if you acquire a galaxy bone and
a galaxy talent now there's only applies
for the galaxy s6 and six edge or
not--and note edge and in addition the
galaxy tab as for the galaxy tab for
obviously this is not officially it will
keep you posted as soon as we learn more
about this but yeah this seems to be a
cool option now in some shocking
official news today we get word from
warner music group in its conference
call for results claiming that for the
first time ever the company sold more
through music streaming on youtube and
spotify and it did on Apple's iTunes
services in whichever other digital
stores are out there this is crazy news
at a time when Apple is trying to use
its sales leverage in order to get music
labels to move away from the freemium
ads that
we have right now with Spotify in
YouTube it's really hard to know what
will happen soon but just give an idea
thirty-three percent of growth was in
music streaming compared to seven
percent growth but it came to digital
via downloads there's a true shocker but
I don't blame them Spotify is awesome
and finally for the very hot news of the
day KGI is famous for getting very
accurate iphone rumors and apple rumors
in general and this time we've got
predictions for what to expect for the
iphone 6s and 6s plus or iphone 7 and 7
plus whatever the names will be it seems
the first of all we're getting for sex
technology with a new display seems
we're also getting better materials for
the design to avoid Bend Gaeta and even
sapphire in the case of the iphone 6
plus with limited quantities we're
apparently also getting a 12 megapixel
camera finally finally seriously in
addition to other changes like for
example the option to get a rose gold
iPhone to match the Apple watch in case
you bought the addition Apple watch
which we highly doubt and yeah we've got
other enhancements that are coming to
the next generation iphone but it leads
me to the question of the day what would
Apple need to do with the
next-generation iphone for you to be
willing to buy it and no don't say
running Android because in my case I
feel that these upgrades are great but I
wish the design of the iphone 6s and 6s
plus wouldn't follow the current design
I wish it the better but leave us a
comment down below what is your case
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is still make sure you follow us

our YouTube channel as well you follow
me on Twitter hina underscored any
better please give this video a thumbs
