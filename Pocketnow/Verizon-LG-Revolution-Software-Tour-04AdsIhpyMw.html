pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look at the software on the
verizon LG revolution so sit back relax
and enjoy the show starting from when
you power up the device you can see the
verizon slide to unlock configuration
here we've got pretty typical home
screen configuration with widgets that
come default you can move around as
expected there is a little bit of a
difference creates this grid of items
and when you want to add widgets they
actually appear down here you can add
shortcuts and wallpapers as well back
completely out of there you may notice
that there's a lot of screen space taken
up here with the dot indicators and the
reason for that if we go in here to the
phone app make a phone call and go to
the home screen then you can see how the
phone call overlay appears up at the top
here taking up that space and though the
dots are no longer there it's
interesting and it's convenient from the
aspect of not having to flip the
notifier down in order to be able to
switch back to the current call but when
it's not in place the fact that it takes
up so much screen space is a little
annoying the verizon navigator and the
Bing Maps do work just fine but they
seem to work in a very typical horizon
overlay fashion compared to the Google
Maps we found that it didn't work nearly
as well interestingly enough though in
the app list and this is the app tray
app drawer that is used by the LG
revolution if you go down here at the
bottom you can see I actually had to
install google maps on the device now
you thankfully you can install it but it
didn't come default the google
navigation google places latitude and
maps all had to be installed
to the fact the verizon did not include
them by default speaking of the app tray
everything is broken up into little
sections we have communication then news
and search media and then tools
applications are this one was actually
zero was actually up here in the media
until I just updated it and then these
are all the apps that i have downloaded
it's pretty simple to manage the
categories and move these around but i
wanted to make sure that you saw how
when you download a new app where those
actually go they don't by default to
move into the categories which would be
make it more interesting as it stands
it's a little funny to navigate around
especially if you're used to any other
app drawer this device is running froyo
it's not running Gingerbread which is a
little bit of a disappointment
considering it's a brand new device and
because of that this skin here does have
a tendency to lag as you saw before when
we open up the phone call just a few
minutes ago it took a few seconds for
that to launch if you pulled bar down
then it has a verizon LG based launcher
here to turn on airplane mode the GPS
Bluetooth Wi-Fi and toggle the vibration
on off and then it's a standard
notifications here as you can see the
scrolling is just fine little has a
tendency to snag up unsurprisingly using
the default browser now I'm pressing the
home button here you can't see that but
it took a couple of taps for it to
actually rack this is a typical thing
about this device as we mentioned the
hardware swiping and tapping sometimes
doesn't react as it should or what as
one day's expect on the device messaging
is about the same as expected one of the
problems I have with a verizon this
verizon based phone is that the number
of apps that are included on here that
you can't get rid of there
actually full apps let's golf rock band
slacker rock a rock a blockbuster you
can't get rid of these even though
they're on the device and they aren't
the full versions of these apps the
let's golf is a demo rock band is a demo
and if you're gonna put demos on the
device frankly you should be able to
delete them other items of note on this
device are Polaris Office to view your
office apps the tune wiki that comes on
it by default for looking for music and
listening to streaming music amazon
kindle comes out you felt netflix comes
on default now let's talk about netflix
for just a moment did some tests with
this compared to the galaxy s 4g and the
netflix when streaming at the exact same
time for the exact same account Zack
same movie the netflix on this device
would seem to stutter and act choppy
although the audio always stayed very
clean and smooth versus the nexus s 4g
from sprint which video was very smooth
the entire time no glitchy nasaan either
audio or video and as we mentioned in
the hardware review the screen didn't
look nearly as good since we talked
about speed test last time we didn't get
a chance to really look at results
because i wanted to make sure that we
showed off some LTE speeds this was up
in Seattle here when you see we've got
10 and the nine averaging about about 10
across the board we moved down here this
bottom section here was back in my home
service area about 1 and then in the
basement here 158 my office 129 151 some
sir pretty miserable speeds in this area
out about in the daylight then we got a
little better speeds and then being up
in the Seattle area you can see that I
was getting a lot better speeds once the
LTE kicked in
I want to show you one particular
disturbing thing about the being
integration that comes on this device as
expected you would have to expect some
some sort of EULA before you could
actually use the software which is fine
but if we go in here and it launches the
app and it says you need to view this
service agreement most of us would just
skip over it but let's say you wanted to
view it what comes up is this and if you
save you on PC site what you get is this
again and again and again so you can't
actually view the service agreement that
it's asked asking you to accept in order
to be able to use Bing if you hit the
search button again you have to agree to
the location services and the service
agreement but you can't actually see on
the device in order to be able to use
being on here I'm going ahead and accept
it the purposes of demonstrating it so
you can see that it comes up here one
interesting item to note in the settings
which is pretty default for Froyo if we
go into the wireless and networks then
into mobile networks and then system
select you can see here you can choose
to enable LTE CDA or cdma only if you
choose to make a change to either one of
these the device actually has to reboot
in order for it to be able to switch so
if you're not an LT area and you want to
save on some battery you actually have
to reboot your device causing more
battery loss than just being able to
toggle the LTE 4G service on and on are
on and off frankly I found the verizon
LG revolution software to be about the
same as the hardware yet another
disappointment stacked on another
disappointment even though there were
some things that worked well on the
whole it just doesn't seem to be a
device that I would still recommend to
people
especially at this price point that
they're currently selling it for at the
time of this review anyway if it was
several hundred dollars for this large
of a screen and the average battery life
then maybe maybe you could consider it
but at the price are wanting to ask for
right now it just doesn't seem worth the
will you know disappointing color and
the screen the battery life only be
ending up about six hours the forced
being the x apps you can't remove etc
etc etc that bout wraps up our software
review of the verizon LG revolution if
you have any questions that you would
like to see addressed on the final
review drop us know below thanks for
