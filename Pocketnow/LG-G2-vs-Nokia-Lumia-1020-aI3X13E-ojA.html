smartphone and can't decide between
Android and Windows Phone you might be
faced with another dilemma lg g2 vs.
Nokia Lumia 1020 I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and we're here to help you
with this decision and now for most of
you the most compelling portion of this
comparison is probably the camera
section but as always we want to cover
the differences between these devices as
thoroughly as possible so let's kick it
off with hardware these phones don't
just look like they come from different
manufacturers they almost seem to come
from different planets and it's not just
because of the fanciful yellow shade of
our Lumia 1020 here nothing is the same
Nokia's sharp cornered matte
polycarbonate plays host to a four point
five inch display with sizable bezels in
the biggest camera humph the smartphone
world has ever seen
by contrast LG's gentle curves and
glossy plastic finish suggest a much
more typical modern device while it's
ultra thin bezels and 5.2 inch display
work together with its curious rear
mounted volume and power keys to make it
stand out just a little bit and though
the 13 megapixel camera features optical
image stabilization just like on the 41
megapixel nokia device the optics module
is felt enough to fit entirely within
the casing with no bulge on the back
meaning the g2 sits firmly on a table
top while the 1020 kind of wobbles
around so the Lumia is thicker heavier
and more ungainly than the g2 but the
resulting cocktail is more substantial
its polycarbonate and aluminum feels
better than the g2 s slick plastic even
if it is slightly top-heavy and harder
to hold once you turn on those displays
either with a button or with the double
tap to wake feature present on each
you're instantly shown what device to
buy if you're a screen freak
well the Lumia is 1280 by 768 AMOLED
panel is beautiful in its own right it's
crushed in size resolution and screen to
phone size ratio by the IPS display on
the g2 LG's panel might not achieve the
deep blacks of the Nokia display but
it's 1080p resolution means it packs
almost
hundred more pixels per inch than the
Lumias is that noticeable and day-to-day
use only if you're constantly reading
Kindle books six inches from your
eyeballs but coupled with the added size
and the more authentic color
reproduction particularly in white tones
the added resolution makes the g2 stand
out quite a bit it's the clear winner
between the two on the spec front that
victory is only compounded the g2 is a
product of an Android ecosystem obsessed
with raw power and the brand-new
quad-core Snapdragon 800 SOC that powers
it is worlds ahead of the dual-core
Snapdragon s4 running the Lumia the two
gigs of ram is the same between the
devices and the lack of expandable
microSD storage is just as annoying on
each but the built-in storage varies
considerably between the g2 builds while
you're stuck with just 32 gigs on the
Lumia 1020 nonetheless you're on
telef√≥nica the g2 also builds in
support for bonuses like Mirasol and an
IR transmitter as well as AC support in
its Wi-Fi radio and it's embedded
battery while just as non-removable as
the one on the 1020 is also fifty
percent larger now one might say that a
lot of those overpowered specs in the g2
are the bare minimum required to
smoothly run an operating system as
heavy as a manufacturer skinned version
of Android whether that's true or not
it's pretty obvious as you flip through
the screens of each of these devices
that the Android phone is for those who
value feature density and an absurd
degree of customizability everything on
the g2 can be customized from button
positions to home and lock screen
animations and there are no fewer than
three distinct ways to run multiple apps
at the same time there are widgets on
the home screen widgets on the lock
screen and even widgets in the
notification tray the g2 is a tweakers
paradise if that sounds more like a
usability nightmare to you the Lumia
1020 version of Windows Phone is the
polar opposite its no-frills interface
might not be as novel as it was when it
was unveiled three years ago but its
simplicity remains as fresh as ever this
is still a smartphone Live Tiles flip
and rotate to show you info from
and third-party apps and the Windows
Store now offers many of the same titles
of its Android counterpart but the Lumia
1020 is nowhere near as customizable as
the g2 and as a result the experience is
very consistent both visually and in
terms of responsiveness instead of
aspiring to be part smartphone and part
tablet the Lumia 1020 is content with
being a very good smartphone with one
particular standout feature that feature
is the one we spent a lot of time
describing in our Lumia 1020 full review
the Nokia's 41 megapixel shooter remains
unparalleled for those looking for a
nearly professional-grade photography
experience on a smartphone in concert
with Nokia's pro camera app the hardware
allows for manual control of focus and
shutter speed and other advanced
settings while add-ons like the smart
camera app and Windows Phones various
lenses bring more consumer-friendly
features the g2 puts a much greater
emphasis on those consumer features and
includes far more of them for users to
play with but it doesn't skimp on the
high-end stuff either you can also
adjust manual focus on the g2 and the 13
megapixel camera is optically stabilized
as well
floating freely within its housing to
dampen vibrations from say walking up
some stairs against the Lumia 1020 the
g2 zop tackle stabilization actually did
a better job of keeping the frame steady
in our recent testing but the g2 did
take a bit longer with autofocus
adjustments and it's audio zoom resulted
in an audible history the entire
recording session when turned off that
hiss disappeared here's a back-to-back
comparison and here we go this is
Michael Fisher with pocket now is
sending some stares checking out the
camera performance in video mode of the
Nokia Lumia 1020 against the new g2 by
LG
settings are mostly how the box defaults
full resolution on both units 1020 or
1080p rather varying exposure levels and
walking at a brisk pace one phone one
hand one in the other and let's see what
we can do about changing things up
optical image stabilization is of course
automatic on these units as it is
Hardware based not digital optical image
stabilization is of course automatic on
these units as it is Hardware based not
digital hopefully we're getting a good
idea of how it withstands just your
typical pedestrian style walking audio
zoom is turned on on the g2 out of box
default is turned off and let's look in
the window in still mode it's tough to
pick a favorite here of course we love
the 10 20s photos as we said in our
review but the g2 s camera isn't half
bad either
each of these phones amps up the
saturation quite a bit which you'll
either love or hate and each produces
sharp and crisp results without of box
defaults the g2 shoots 10 megapixel
photos cropped to 16 by 9 and the Lumias
PureView distillation process creates 5
megapixel photos but you do have the
option on each to shoot full resolution
images and there of course the Lumia
blows away the g2 in sheer pixel count
and in zoom ability the nokia phone also
tends to generate more authentic images
in low light or in photos with areas of
both high and low brightness but for
normal day-to-day photography each of
these cameras delivers photos to be
proud of other aspects differ more
significantly the speakers on each of
these phones are bottom mounted but the
Lumias are far more powerful seeming
almost twice as loud as the g2 s when
playing tracks on Spotify
this sound is more similar over
headphones while the Lumias dolby
effects give Trax a slightly richer
sound both phones are perfectly adept
media players from an audio standpoint
voice calling is close to even as well
at least here on AT&amp;amp;T s network in
Boston callers said they preferred the
sound of our voice on the g2 but said we
sounded just okay on both phones on our
end we preferred the less clumsy feeling
of the g2 for chatting and the rear
mounted volume keys actually were pretty
comfortable once we got use of them we
have a feeling we'd be able to carry on
a conversation much longer on the g2 as
well the 3000 milliamp hour battery
isn't just big on the spec sheet it
provides some fantastic endurance in the
real world easily surpassing the 1020 in
staying power by calling it the simpler
choice we don't mean to suggest that the
Lumia is any kind of junior smartphone
it's a very capable device running a
very smooth and reliable platform and if
you're buying your mobile device
primarily for its camera there is no
better mainstream phone out there in
many other departments though the g2
offers more capability from RAW
processing power to the more robust
Android ecosystem to a fully
customizable interface and it's camera
while not as beastly as the Lumias is
better than average for a smartphone
shooter if that's the combination you're
looking for the g2 will likely be the
more deserving recipient of your gadget
dollars the Lumia 1020 isn't the only
phone we've put the g2 up against we
also compared it with the HTC One last
week you can find that video on our
YouTube channel and please stay tuned
