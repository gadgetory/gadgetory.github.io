things from notifications to fitness to
voice commands to scheduling the peplum
is one of the newest smartwatches to hit
the market but how does it integrate
into your daily life let's find out I
might add to Houston and you're watching
pocket now our own michael fisher
already covered the pebble time and it's
full review and in short pebble time its
timeline you I make for a great
SmartWatch if what you're after is
scheduling and a personal assistant
waking up and strapping the pebble on
quickly becomes part of your morning
routine and the default watch stripe is
comfortable enough that you'll forget
you're even wearing it I always checked
the upcoming events in the timeline as
soon as I put the watch on it's a great
help if you're busy and forgetful like
me throughout the day the pebble time
pulls in dozens and even hundreds of
notifications from hangouts messages to
emails to tweets and so on the vibration
is much more noticeable than on the Moto
360 and thanks to misuse of the Android
wear API the pebble can take advantage
of voice replies which tends to be my
preferred method of interaction with
text and instant messages on the go if
any notifications are particularly
important the evening for display means
that they can stay on the screen until
dismissed and the same goes for lists
which I find much nicer than enjoyed
wear is similar but battery consuming
feature also nice as the pebble times
water resistance meaning that when it
comes time to wash the dishes I can do
so without having to take the pebble off
in fact thanks to the physical buttons I
can even still reply to the messages
with wet hands by the end of the day I
rarely need to charge the pebble once a
week in most cases and all that's left
to do is set it aside until the next
morning the pebble time is a great new
SmartWatch and we've got plenty of
coverage on it and other smartwatches

Houston and until next time thanks for
