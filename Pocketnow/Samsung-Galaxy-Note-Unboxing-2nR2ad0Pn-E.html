another calm and today we're gonna be
unboxing the samsung galaxy note a cross
between a large Android smartphone and a
tablet so we'll see how that works out
and this is one of the first devices to
come with a stylus for a capacitive
screen let's get to the unboxing so one
thing to mention when we ordered this
from cloak coda UK it does come with a
plastic cover which is a flip cover so
it protects the screen and it says not
for sale so this may be a promotional
item that comes with all these Samsung
Galaxy Notes we'll just set that to side
and if we look at the box it's pretty
plain of course it just had the device
with the stylus on the front and it says
Samsung Galaxy Note over here we have a
5.3 WXGA HD Super AMOLED screen a
dual-core 1.4 gigahertz processor 8
megapixel autofocus with a 2 megapixel
front camera we have our s-pen which is
the stylus for the Galaxy Note we also
have an advanced positioning Full HD
recording and playback and a huge 2500
milliamp hour battery so we'll just uh
remove this protective do not a disturb
seal here and we'll open up the box and
wow that is a large smart phone / tablet
so that is huge so we'll set that aside
for just a second we'll go into the rest
of the contents of the box
so let's look in here we have a warranty
card we have our Samsung Galaxy Note
Quick Start Guide we have our microUSB
to USB charging sync cable we have our
let's see err UK adapter here and we
also have our wall charger so you
probably buy another adapter if you live
in the States or whatever and we have
some white earbuds and it looks as
though these are the kind that go in
your ear so those are pretty nice
opposed to the iPhone ones which kind of
just sit on the outside and we also have
extra earbud adapters when we have our
huge 2500 ml amp hour battery
so let's get to I'll start with the
phone itself and then we'll look at it
and see how it works out so one thing to
mention about this particular Galaxy
Note is that it did not come with a
micro SD card but it does come with 6
gigabytes of internal memory and you can
swap it on microSD card and expand it up
to a total of 48 gigabytes so they look
at the screen it's pretty phenomenal
it's really clear the device seems
really fast let's just try out the
stylus and the button configuration is
very similar to the galaxy s that was
unlocked also so let's just go here and
the stylus comes out of the bottom so
we'll pop that out and it let's see if
we're able to draw anything and let's
see okay let me add a note here and if
the stylus works really well it even has
a button on the side I don't know how
that works I don't know if it's powered
or whatnot but it has a button in it so
we can begin writing and let's see I
don't write very well but there you can
see my name and let's just try something
and it works really well I'm really
surprised
it works way better than one of those
capacitive stylus is that you use on an
iPad or what not so we can just click
out of here go cancel and let's just
compare this to some other devices and
we'll just go home and if we compare it
to the iPhone 4s the device is dwarfed
by the galaxy note the screen is you
know over an inch larger than the iPhone
4s compared to a couple of other devices
this one has a 4.3 inch screen is the
Droid Charge kind of the same Super
AMOLED of course this one has a much
higher resolution and we compared it one
more device and this is the Samsung
Focus which was running Windows Phone 7
so we just close out of that so this has
been the unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy
Note and the device is running Android
2.3 Gingerbread and at the price tag is
pretty hefty around $800 unlocked from
cloack coda UK of course if you are
going to replace your smartphone what as
well as your tablet it may be a good
investment because you know each of
those devices costs around $400 or more
each so stay tuned for the hardware
review and the software review coming up
next and if you like your deals make
sure you give a thumbs up and also leave
some comments down below and thanks for
