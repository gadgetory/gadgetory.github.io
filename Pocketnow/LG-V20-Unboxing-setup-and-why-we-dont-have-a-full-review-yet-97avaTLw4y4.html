first-look videos for the LGV 20 a
hands-on we toured the new camera app
and checked out the new audio features
but one thing we haven't done yet is
take one out of the box and set it up
LG sent over a pre-release unit showing
off what their ideal packaging would be
for an unlocked device and it's pretty
slick panels unfold to reveal the phone
the center section holds the charger and
cable and the last section is home to
the replaceable battery in select
markets the v20 will also ship with a
pair of bno earbuds which unlike the v10
these won't be in the foam packaging
instead a separate box maintaining LG's
friends branding we'll talk about those
in just a bit with no carrier branding
this phone fires up fast and drops you
quickly into setting up your fingerprint
security I was going to pan the
performance of the sensor but it turns
out I was using it for days with the
clear plastic guard on the button make
sure you take that off unsurprisingly it
works much better when this is removed
starting with the g5 LG installed a skin
which removed the Android app drawer and
I've been on the record numerous times
about my disdain for this style of
disorganisation happily on the V 20 it's
fairly easy to jump into the settings to
switch this back to a more traditional
Android layout now we're back to a
fairly clean nougat phone some of LG's
icon color choices and wallpapers are a
touch on the garish side but theming is
fairly simple and I'm happy to see the
settings menu is much simpler and
cleaner than last year's phone and now
we get our second listen to these
earbuds and this is a fantastic
follow-up to the terrific AKG earbuds LG
shipped with the v10 last year these
puppies are lively and juicy and come
with a fully functional remote for
controlling volume and playback it's
exciting to see such high quality buds
included with the phone and looking
through the B&amp;amp;O catalog the h3 retail
for around 160 dollars
not bad LG not bad at all and
unfortunately this is kind of where we
need to leave the v20 for now we've been
asked by a lot of you when we'll have
our reviews up for this phone though
this handset we're looking at today is
in a near consumer release date it is
still pre-release hardware and software
the reps at LG have asked that we not
base our reviews and perform our
in-depth
tests on this device and we're inclined
to honor that request to make sure we're
giving this phone the fairest chance at
competing in this hyper-competitive
market as an early tease though using a
pre-release phone we're very positive on
the handset v20 offers one of the best
multimedia experiences we've encountered
this year it's a fun camera system to
use and the headphone jack is pretty
stinkin loud all points on track for
what we were hoping when this phone was
announced now we just have to play the
waiting game for a proper retail unit to
complete our testing before we shoot our
full reviews as always thanks so much
for watching be sure to subscribe to
this channel for our future v20 coverage
you know the real camera review is going
to be brutal and help us out with some
sharing on your favorite social networks
for PocketNow i'm juan carlos back now
some gadget guy on twitter and instagram
and i will catch you all on the next
video testing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
