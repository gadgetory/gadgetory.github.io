pocket now calm and this is a look at
the new version of windows marketplace
for mobile which brings some much-needed
features to the application store for
windows mobile it allows you to download
applications right to your storage card
which really gives you a lot of room to
store applications and also allows you
to switch regions now at this time you
can't get this a version of marketplace
for mobile unless you uninstalled from
your phone and then install it again
which I've already done I expect that in
a few days you'll be able to just click
on marketplace it will automatically
download the new version and you'll be
ready to go so these changes are very
subtle really if you go into menu and
settings we can change the default
install location to the storage card and
it will show you how much space you have
available I have a 2 gigabyte card
installed right now so I can store a lot
more applications than if I were to
install it just to the device itself at
only about 100 megabytes also you can
change the regionality so right now we
are at English and the United States so
let's go take a look at how many
applications we have in the catalog so
just get a quick look of what we're
dealing with it's about 500 applications
or so let's go back and let's switch
marketplaces and see what that process
is like let's go to say let's go to
Germany and German apps so I'm going to
click Save and let's see what happens
okay so here we are in the German market
place presumably and we have a lot less
applications it looks like the US
English market places where most of the
apps are found and of course now with
this new version of marketplace for
mobile you're able to access those quite
easily so that was just a quick look at
the new version of windows marketplace
for mobile again if you don't see it on
your device right now you just need to
uninstall the marketplace and reinstall
it and you'll have the new version with
these new capabilities that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
