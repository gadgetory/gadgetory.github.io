devices Microsoft finally talks about
Windows Phone 7.8 and the galaxy note 2
finally reaches verizon I'm hina Rivera
happy that there's finally a world
beyond microsoft office and this is
parking out daily
if you've ever had to experience what
it's like to edit a specific cell on the
previous version of Google Drive for
mobile devices you'll know how
frustrating it was and have you never
did that I hope you never do go bliss
finally pushed an upgrade for iowa's an
Android that enhances the experience and
now it does feel like if you're editing
a real spreadsheet and not something
that came out of a web page so make sure
you upgrade because it is worth it
that's right the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
is finally reaching big red though I
find it kind of interesting that it
didn't make it there before Black Friday
verizon is going to be selling the
device starting tomorrow online for 300
bucks after a two-year contract though
yes you'll have to swallow that verizon
logo on the home button with a big
gallon of water because it is coming
Microsoft is just released an outlet
calm application for Android that
provides a more intimate experience with
your mail calendar and just about
everything in your Microsoft account on
Android devices now it's interesting
because first of all you could pretty
much do that out of the box with most
Android devices already and the app is
getting terrible review so far first of
all because it's the same as the hotmail
application that was already there and
it's a terrible looking application I
really don't know what designers were
thinking of here speaking of Microsoft
they finally come on record to talk
about Windows Phone 7.8 and their
release though as everything coming from
Redmond that you already know they never
provide specific dates they just said
that it's going to be available to as
many devices as they can as of early
2013 and depending on who you ask early
2013 can in sometime in June so let's
hope the mayans don't have their thing
and we end things by the end of this
year now you probably see the upgrade
before that happens and finally for them
well interesting news of the day Steve
Ballmer has just come on record to talk
about Windows Phone 8 sales sadly he
doesn't provide specific figures but he
says that windows phone 8 devices sold
four times more this year than they did
in the same period last year though we
never got the figures last year to
compare anyways but that leads you to
the question of the day or let's call
this more of an exercise go outside
tomorrow and for the first 10 people
that you see with a smartphone
how many of these smartphones will win
those phones I did that exercise a week
ago and to be honest with you none of
them were windows phones not even the
old windows phone 7 devices so leave us
a comment down below we're interested to
see what you get and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm
heightmap iveta thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
