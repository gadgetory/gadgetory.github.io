on its way however Motorola and Verizon
are still providing a phone right now
that will get that capability sometime
later via a moto mod but is the prospect
of 5g enough to make you buy this phone
today well this is PocketNow and I am
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
welcome to my full review of the Moto Z
3
all right full disclosure I have used
the moto Z 3 for a little while now but
I haven't used a moto Z phone in a
little while so there are a few things
that have changed here that might be
familiar to you but or brand-new to me
and on top of that I actually didn't
have any of the modal mods for my review
of this which I kind of preferred
actually because I have used plenty of
the mods in the past and they haven't
exactly changed in terms of their
architecture and in this case I wanted
to make sure that I use the moto Z 3 and
see what it would be like as a
standalone device after all the nature
of the Moto mod hasn't exactly changed a
whole lot and Motorola has stated that
there are going to be three generation
supported of the mods and with the z3
we're coming up on that third generation
and I can see why that needs to be the
case the moto mods do require a specific
design language and after three
generations of it Motorola doesn't want
to back themselves into a corner in
terms of how they build their phones you
still get those pins over on the bottom
third on the backing and the backing
itself is really a fingerprint magnet
and then there's that bulbous camera
hump at the top that kind of requires
you to have at least a style cover so
that you can keep that thing flush with
the back without anything on the backing
the phone is pretty thin and it's so
thin in fact that there is no headphone
jack on here you have to use an adapter
with the USB C port and speaking of
saving space there's no fingerprint
reader on the front or the back anymore
it's embedded into the right side but
not in the power button there's still a
dedicated power button over on the left
side just opposite the fingerprint
reader and everything else about this
phone screams reliable but not
necessarily exciting the six inch super
amoled Full HD plus screen does its job
quite well and even if it's not as
spectacular display some of the features
that moto baked into eight are ones that
we want to see in plenty of other phones
see the Moto display in particular makes
it clear that you don't really need an
always-on display but you do need a good
ambient display that's exactly what this
is you can wave your hand close to the
phone and the sensors will know it and
it will show you the clock and any
notifications underneath you can press
and hold on any of those notifications
and swipe in any direction depending on
what you want to do moto display also
includes its own brand of night mode and
then from there moto includes plenty of
the gestures that are returning from
previous moto devices with a couple of
additions but in keeping with the trend
that we've been seeing in Android lately
the navbar can be replaced by one
singular button or bar that you swipe in
either direction or press upon in order
to do the back recent apps and home key
function it's just I going to the
different recent apps that I want to
require that little swipe and it just
doesn't feel as intuitive or as easy as
having an actual button dedicated to it
with that said multitasking between
applications and all the ones that I
have installed is still good with the
snapdragon 835 which is last year's
processor now that's not a dig at the
8:35 it's more just a way of saying that
this phone doesn't necessarily have the
best specifications to go up against the
high-end flagships the 835 is still
going to be compatible with the modem
that is inside the 5g mod so you're
still going to get that evolution and
otherwise you get four or six gigabytes
of RAM with 64 or 128 gigabytes of
storage with microSD card expansion and
finally to round out the specifications
there is a 3000 milliamp hour battery
unit in here that is not exceptional
it's definitely not spectacular but the
Moto z3 still manages to get through a
full day of work and play with in my
case four and a half hours of screen on
time so we can talk about the cameras
the front-facing shooter is an 8
megapixel shooter that does come with a
portrait mode so even if it's not an
exceptional performer that portrait mode
might be nice to use if you can get the
effect right and get that bouquet tout
background the portrait mode is also
used on the rear camera which is a 12
megapixel dual lens array where one of
the 12 megapixel shooters is a
monochrome sensor I kind of like that
there's a true black and white mode for
both photo and video because it's using
that dedicated 12 mega pixel monochrome
sensor and the result can be some pretty
cool looking very contrasting and very
artsy looking black and white photos and
videos I found the camera quality to be
just fine there could be a punch to the
colors in these photos and also in video
even when you're recording in 4k
resolution my main gripe with the photos
is that with an F 2.0 aperture you're
not going to get a whole lot of depth of
field behind your subjects without
having to resort to using the portrait
mode but for people that are looking to
this phone as their next purchase mainly
because of its lower price point I don't
blame them for going for it and they
will still get a camera that is usable
in general daily let's say social media
usage so again this is a phone that you
might be familiar with because a lot of
it is something you've seen before so
what is this
actually four well the obvious answer is
that it's going to be a conduit for that
future 5g moto mod and it's going to
prove that 5g is going to be the next
evolution of mobile Internet assured in
by Verizon what I will admit is that
while this phone doesn't exactly get me
too excited just as a standalone device
what it does remind me of is that
sometimes I have carrier Envy no matter
how you slice it Verizon is a reliable
and probably the fastest network we have
in the US but here's the thing you're
kind of gambling on 5g actually being
amazing from the outset if you're going
to get this phone and then wait to pay
the potentially hundreds of dollars for
the 5g mod somewhere down the line and
I'm not saying that the 5g mod is not
going to fulfill its promises but it's
not something that we can really
guarantee especially at this point in
the game but there are people out there
who are really spec hungry and would
require the snapdragon 845 require the
latest processor probably there's going
to be one that we're going to see coming
out the woodwork by the time the 5g mod
even comes out so you have to pick and
choose where you want to be on the
bleeding edge do you want to be on the
bleeding edge in terms of mobile
internet or do you want to be on the
bleeding edge in terms of general
everyday device performance as by the
time 5g becomes a reality this phone
might be up to two generations behind
all of the phones that we're getting in
that point in time there's really only
one other person I can think of that
would really want to get this phone that
is the Verizon user that is budget
minded and needs to do an upgrade
without breaking the bank you can get a
really good specification combination in
the Moto z3 even if it's not the
absolute best one and if you are not
hankering for the latest and greatest
then the Moto z3 is kind of a bargain
and finally if you happen to be an avid
user of the moto mods then this is going
to be the last time that you can use
what actually has been one of the better
innovations in our recent smartphone
history and by the time the Moto z4
comes out things will be radically
different as always thank you very much
