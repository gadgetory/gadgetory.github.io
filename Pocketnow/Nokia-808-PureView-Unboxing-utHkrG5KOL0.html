the apple iphone 4s and the samsung
galaxy s3 as well as the HTC One X
according to some are the best camera
phones on the market we have eight
megapixels eight megapixels and eight
megapixels in total 24 megapixels here
but still 17 megapixels shy from the
Nokia 808 PureView which has a 41
megapixel sensor I like to call it a
camera with phone functionality we have
it here in our labs we're going to unbox
it review it so stay tuned and let's get
to it
so here we have the Nokia 808 PureView
of course you have to disregard the
butchering which was basically made by
my customs authority because this is a
phone which is coming from the States so
it's outside of the European Union but
that aside we have the basic blue carbon
box which is standard for Nokia phones
we have the Nokia 808 PureView branding
on the side with pictures of the phone
and it's strange that the first picture
you see and also the second one are
pictures of the phones back and that's
exactly because the camera is the main
selling point of this phone flipping it
over to the back you can see that the
box contains the phone battery manuals
charger headphones and USB cable and of
course the first feature here is the 41
megapixel sensor and the curled size
optics together they both form the
PureView technology we have a four inch
AMOLED ClearBlack display we have xenon
flash 1.4 gigahertz processor and 16
gigabytes of internal storage now let's
get the obligatory Swiss Army knife and
let's get this open so let's get to it
let's open the box and we are greeted as
usual by the phone itself we'll put it
to the side just for one second let's
take a look at the battery the battery
is one of 1400 million powers we'll see
how much battery life and real-life
usage that offers we have some usual
manuals with some NFC instructions here
we have the wall plug which is us
standard I'll have to use an adapter for
that we have your headphones which are
in ear headphones noise-cancelling we
have a lanyard you can wear the phone
strapped to your wrist and we have the
standard USB cable for syncing and
charging let's put everything to the
side and let's take a look at the phone
itself let's take it out of its bag and
I have to tell you straight from the
beginning that this has some pretty
hefty it's pretty heavy weights for for
a phone without its battery introduced
let's compare it to the Samsung Galaxy
s3 the Apple iPhone 4s and the HTC One X
we have one happy family here everything
on one frame probably the best camera
phones on the market at the moment we
have 8 megapixels 8 megapixels 8
megapixels and we have 41 megapixels
here so if we add up all the megapixels
on the HTC One X galaxy s3 and the Apple
iPhone 4s we're going to be still 17
megapixels short - the Nokia 808
PureView now in terms of thickness
really there's no debate here if you can
see it's one to probably three times as
thick as the Samsung Galaxy s3 if we
take a look at the hump where the camera
is and that's exactly what we're going
to take a look at right now let's just
take the iPhone out of the frame and
this is the main attraction of the phone
this is the Carl Zeiss lens and of
course the 41 megapixel camera sensor
together they form the PureView
technology we have dual xenon flashes
four flash firing while shooting
pictures and we have an LED flash for
assistive light while shooting video now
on the top of the phone on its front we
have a speaker grille and of course the
sensors the 4-inch ClearBlack AMOLED
screen we have three buttons which are
hardware buttons on the side we have the
volume rocker for volume up volume down
we have the screen lock slider here and
the two-stage camera shutter button
nothing on its left at the top we have a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack USB port
and micro HDMI port for mirroring and
that's pretty much it the bottom holds a
microphone and the back holds the camera
as mentioned plus the speaker which you
can see right about here nothing else on
the phone will power it on get back to
you once we have booted now the 808 has
16 gigabytes of internal storage but you
can also expand it via
a micro SIM card of course pictures
taken in full resolution 41 megapixels
they will be huge in size so you want to
add a micro as the expansion card as
soon as you get this one open and this
is the slot for the Micro SIM we have
just installed that we don't have
anything else just let's insert the
battery which pops in like this and we
have the battery cover with the NFC
antenna on the plastic itself so let's
pop it back in its place
like this and let's see the first boot
of the Nokia 808 PureView let's just
zoom in a little bit just like that
there we go nokia logo and as you can
see the clear black screen really shines
you see male backlight bleeding the
black is really black and while it's
working we need to mention that this
phone has a 1.3 gigahertz processor it
runs Symbian Belle has 16 gigabytes of
internal storage and of course the
camera which is the main selling point
probably everybody will talk about the
camera and neglect the phone there we go
with the nokia boot animation so I would
rather regard this Nokia 808 PureView as
a camera with phone capabilities rather
than a smartphone with a huge camera
attached but we will take in-depth look
at every aspect of this phone stay tuned
