using new 3d sensing technology for
upcoming iPhones but not for the front
camera Samsung will reportedly feature
new sound on display technology for the
Galaxy S 10 as soon as CES and we should
expect the Nokia 9 PureView in late
January and with pretty good
specifications it seems I'm Jaime Rivera
and for those of you complaining about
the show being all about rumors this
show particularly is for you this is
parking out daily sponsored by the
Huawei band three pro and band 3e the
official news today begin with the vice
launch that could probably turn into a
deal we talked yesterday about the pixel
three light and three accel light being
possible Verizon exclusives now we've
got price tags and oh wow if these
phones are going to retain the cameras
of the pixel three and cost three
hundred and seventy nine dollars which
puts them into Nexus 5 territory and
that's gonna be crazy that's gonna be
great let's just see if it happens now
let's talk about LG I mean the company
launched the v40 and we wanted to love
that phone but we know the reasons why
we didn't now we're talkin about LG G
eight actually two devices coming soon
the first one being the g8 possibly at
MWC with a drupe knotch design in
addition to some 3d sensing technology
in the camera at the back but we also
hear that there's another device by the
way the g8 codename is alpha but then
there's another device codenamed pride
which is reportedly the 5g variant so no
5g from WC at least it seems now let's
talk about the Nokia 9p review that
device with an insane amount of cameras
reportedly five in the back one at the
front we've got specification squawking
stamp dragon 845 a possible launch
that's not going to happen at CES nor
MWC but in between so we wonder why it's
not 855 but then the rest of the specs
are great the battery is I believe a
4150 milliamp hour six gigs of RAM and
then a lot of storage let's see if we
get it I mean Nokia has been launching
some really great phones lately that was
with the spotlight over to the Galaxy S
10
as one of the biggest concerns is are we
getting stereo speaker functionality on
this phone or not we've seen companies
experiment with building the earpiece
into the border of the screen and then
we lose the functionality for the stereo
speakers now according to some sources
we will be getting the technology but on
the display somehow it seems that there
will be some technology that will
provide audio through the screen that's
even possible I would love to see it and
it seems that we might get a demo of it
at its CES but not necessarily a phone
and finally the hottest interested I
have to do with feature iPhones and a
collaboration between Apple and Sony so
he's got this new tech called
time-of-flight wood chip has nothing to
do the name has nothing to do with the
technology it's a sort of 3d sensing
feature that works in the primary camera
that allows distance calculations and
everything through a sort of a laser
technology that points at you and is
able to calculate more like AR
technology and reports habit that Apple
and Sony are going to be using this
technology in the next iPhones obviously
we know that Apple wants to make a huge
push and AR we've seen it in every
single event for the past few years but
the question today is do you care about
AR I mean do you think that it's worth
it for companies to invest so much in AR
if it's something you don't use or do
you use it because in my case I'll give
you an example I love all the measuring
techniques of AR but I can't really tell
you how often I use them actually the
answer would be more like none at least
beyond the review period so we would
really love to know in your case what
happens to you do you use AR or not let
us know in the comments down below and
Happy New Year everybody and folks
