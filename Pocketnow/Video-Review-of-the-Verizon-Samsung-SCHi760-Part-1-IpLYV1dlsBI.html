pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the video review of the verizon samsung
i760 let's take a look at the devices
external design the i760 comes with two
batteries a standard battery which is
rated at the 10 50 milliamps and is good
for about three and a half hours of
continuous runtime this battery fits
into the back of the unit and creates a
flush look while the extended battery
which is rated at fifteen hundred
milliamps and is good for about five
point four hours is a creates a bit of a
bulge on the back in terms of weight
Samsung lists the weight with the
standard battery is 5.2 four ounces and
from my calculation the extended battery
adds about a half an ounce although
there's no listing in the specification
of what that the total weight of the
unit is with the extended battery but I
figure it's a little less than than 6
ounces the device has quite a few
buttons so for those people who like the
tactile feel of a device this is clearly
a device for you to look into on the
right-hand side of the unit you can see
that there's a headphone port then
there's a start menu button and if you
press and hold that start menu button it
is linked to voice command which is
included in windows mobile 6 there is a
button for okay and there is the camera
button on the back of the unit there's a
camera which is 1.3 megapixel and also
includes a flash and there is an
external antenna port as well on the
left hand side of the unit you have a
cover that protects the microSD card in
samsung list the maximum capacity as
being two gigabytes there's the volume
up and down to control of both the phone
volume in the PDA volume and allows you
to
go into the off turn the audio off as
well as going to vibrate mode on the top
of the unit is the power on power off
for standby and if you hold this button
down you can actually shut the entire
unit off on the bottom of the unit is
the USB and charger connector there are
several very interesting design aspects
of this phone the first thing that
you'll notice on the front is that the
call and end button are actually at an
angle and allow you to access it from
the side or the top of the unit also
samsung had to place the numeric keypad
buttons at an angle in order to keep the
windows mobile standard button layout
which includes the d-pad and the left
and right soft function buttons I
thought that placing these buttons at an
angle would create a problem when
pressing them but I haven't found that
to be the case so far another real
interesting aspect of the design is the
fact that the stylus is pulls out from
the side rather than the top or the
bottom and this is an expandable stylus
also at the top of the unit is the
speaker and the multicolored status led
the QWERTY keyboard is a three-row
keyboard and the numeric keypad really
adds to the functionality of this phone
since you don't have to press the
function key to get to the numbers while
you're typing away also there the
keyboard has a left and right soft
function key buttons the little red dot
allows you to do a soft reset on the
unit so this about does it for the tour
around the design aspects of the i760
and i'll be back with some more detail
in a short while bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
