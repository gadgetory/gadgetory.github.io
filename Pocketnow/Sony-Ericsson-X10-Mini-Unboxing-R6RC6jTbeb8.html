now calm and in this video we're going
to unbox the sony x10 mini android
smartphone now sony has really targeted
everyone with this phone by making it a
very small phone as well as a very
affordable phone it's a 2.5 inch screen
with a round right now about a 325
dollar us price tag so without further
ado guys let's go ahead and get it
unboxed alright and we are back and as I
said before we are about to unbox the
sony ericsson x10 mini and true unboxing
fashional so let's go ahead and rip this
bag open and as you can see here we have
the x10 mini and it i would say it
definitely follows the typical sony
ericsson style of box where it's very
square very small sony likes to follow
this style of the box going to go ahead
and actually zoom in a little bit here
as we can kind of get a better view now
the top of the box actually shows the
phone itself and i once again it looks a
little unproportional only because of
the fact that it is very small juicier
the sony x10 mini as well as the logo
there nothing really happening on these
sides of this device here nothing
information wise really i mean it does
give you another Wi-Fi and the QuickTime
symbol but it's not really to give you
too much info about the phone however it
does show someone here actually holding
the phone and again it's very small I'll
be a little bit of spec here we have the
3g HSPA we have the two point six inch
screen so it's a two point five five
inch but it looks like they round up has
he 3.5 inch headphone jack and it's a
600 megahertz processor with a five
megapixel camera and once again it's
using the android operating system so
let's go ahead and open this guy right
up and the phone itself actually had
fallen through the packaging which
happens in this is a shipping process
especially when it's coming from
overseas and i will tell you right now
guys this phone is very very let's just
say quaint it's very small what's very
cool about what sony is going to do
though at first
Glantz I put the phone aside they're
going to give you now there's already a
black cover on there it's also going to
give you green orange and pink so you
can customize your phone right off the
bat with these back covers here which
will cover the battery so that's pretty
cool a lot of manufacturers actually
none that I really have ever experienced
will actually do that it is going to
give you the USB charging cable like
typical phones as a micro USB and
there's the charger for right there this
is the UK version a set of headphones I
would imagine very good quality or
decent quality headphones because they
are Sony let's see what else might be
hiding away and of course just some
literature about the phone itself a
little user guide that sort of thing
which again follows the same small
consistency here so let's go ahead and
put this stuff aside and you're actually
going to go ahead and just look at the
phone very briefly I will go over this
in more detail in my hardware overview
which will be coming very soon after the
first software overview video like I
said it's it's tiny'mon it's in the palm
of my hand right now however it does
have some heft to it feels like a
quality phone a quality device as you
can see i'm going to pull the screen
protector off and we're actually going
to boot this guy up right now so we can
see the screen for the first time
turning on now i think give me a little
bit of a vibrate so while that's
happening once again what kind of show
the phone itself we have the charging
port down here on the bottom some
buttons on the sides like a camera
button there this is the back it is a
soft touch feel which again i will go
over more and as you see that we have
the sony ericsson logo popping right up
now one thing I can just tell you're off
the bat are the buttons these are
different buttons that we typically see
on Android phones now the HTC evo 4g has
the four soft buttons as well as most us
android phones over the samsung galaxy s
as you saw in my past videos has he to
other buttons with the main home return
button this follows a different path so
that might get a little confusing to me
I would imagine this is probably the
home button but we'll see i will go over
that in more detail for my hardware
unboxing it does want me to insert a sim
card and restart my phone from the
cancel just i can kind of see the main
splash page once again i will go into
this in more detail on my next video
which will be the software overview so
as you can see it is fully booted up i'm
not going to go into too much detail
here because it's
just my unboxing video but what I would
do is stay tuned for the next coming in
the series which will kind of go over
the software more in-depth followed by
the hardware and so on and so forth if
you looking to pick up one of the xperia
x10 minis you can get it at clove co uk
right now for around 325 US dollars
which is a great value especially for a
unlocked smartphone of this caliber as
always guys thank you very much for
watching please give us a thumbs up if
you like this video or you like any of
our videos for that matter and also
leave a comment with any questions or
input you may have and stay tuned thanks
