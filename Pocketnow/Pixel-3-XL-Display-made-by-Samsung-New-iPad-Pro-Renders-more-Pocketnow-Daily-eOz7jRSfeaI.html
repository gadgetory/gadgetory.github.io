the insides of the Google pixel 3 Excel
and some of things are actually
surprising we got some more renders of
what to expect for the new iPads and no
surprises here and YouTube and Google
services were struggling all day
yesterday so yeah we get it I'm Jaime
Rivera definitely yesterday was awesome
with the Huawei made 20 Perla doesn't
know what you think about that device in
the video that we published yesterday
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals to a certain
degree if you pre-ordered the Google
pixel 3 or pixel 3 Excel Google is
offering you $50 off of there's actually
a process that you have to follow and
think about it is today is the last day
that you can claim it and I hate that
this video is gonna go live a lot later
you could probably take advantage of it
but still fold in like a little
description you never know it's 50
dollars in your pocket now let's talk
about LG and Lenovo two companies that
we never thought that we here working
together are apparently work in the
process of building this 13 inch tablet
that has the purpose of being a foldable
display smartphone tablet hybrid stuff
like that apparently the company is
working for this to be available in 2019
at some point up to compete with
whatever Huawei and Samsung are working
on we just don't know if it's this if
this is an LG panel working on a Lenovo
tablet or what the case will be we'll
see now for those of you that we're
having issues watching your YouTube
videos yesterday yes it was happening
there were issues with pretty much all
Google services up to the point where
you to was down to pretty much 30
minutes depending on whatever server you
were on honestly here in the UK we
weren't really having issues or at least
I don't think we did I didn't notice I
was very busy yesterday but let us know
in the comments that you were affected
or anything now let's talk about iPads I
mean once we've got 3d renders by these
guys from my smart price which are
actually not theirs they just buy them
from the leaguers it's set in stone we
get pretty much the design that we've
been able to see lately and I am still
shocked at the fact that I do see that
there is USBC support up again this is
the iPad pro we're not talking about the
regular iPad it seems that Apple finally
has decided to take a leap and make
iPads more Pro like let's
in the end of it turns out to be as
great as it should be and finally the
hot news that they have to do with my
allergies no not my allergies but those
of you that are in the market to buy a
Google pixel 3 or pixel 3 excel this is
interesting I mean iFixit has already
tore them down and we were assuming that
the panel on the pixels was made by LG
they just want an award from display
mate as the best screens and it turns
out that guess who manufactures the
screens of the winner of the previous
prize which is Samsung is they also
build the Apple ones of they also build
the galaxy ones and now they've won this
one and this is rather interesting I
mean I don't agree with the display mate
rating because even though the pixels
have a great screen and they have a good
screen it's not as bright as everything
else out there and and you know
sometimes brightness is not important to
people until you walk into direct
sunlight so let us know in the comments
number one if you're out for the Google
pixel 3 or pixel 3 Excel number 2 how
important is this you know the fact that
we have a Samsung panel and anything
does this change your mind and makes you
want to buy one because yes I mean
Samsung has proven they make the best
displays in the market in my case it
makes it even more of a reason to
recommend but I'm hoping that somehow
the display gets brighter leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news earlier full of us on poking
out on common subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one and follow me on
Twitter hey man just go to be better on
Instagram and hey metadata please give

you saw I'm high metal you and I thanks
