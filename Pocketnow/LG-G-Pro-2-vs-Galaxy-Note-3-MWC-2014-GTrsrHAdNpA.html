their next phablet the g pro 2 is one of
the most anticipated devices of this
year which is the successor to the g pro
that we review last year and we're now
going to compare it against lee phablet
the Galaxy Note 3 this is high midori
better with pocket now Tony behind the
camera let's go through it ok so off the
bat the first thing that I'm going to
show you is size 5.7 inch display 5.9
inch IPS display here both 1080p
resolution but both phones are almost as
tall LG does a fabulous job in finished
fitting this display in this chassis and
if you look at them they're just this
thick almost as thick actually only LG's
got this curve that Sampson doesn't have
now one of the cool things about this
texture behind that we get from LG is
that it does feel great in the hand the
phone doesn't feel gigantic whereas in
the note 3 because of these sharper
edges you do feel the phone to be a
little more uncomfortable even though
you do have this faux leather back it
does make the phone look great now now
when we go through the camera at the
back one big importance even though we
do have the same 13 megapixel camera on
both this is not the same thing optical
image stabilization on both software and
hardware we're here there is nothing
stabilized only on software pretty much
doesn't do the best job in the world now
aside from that we've got a 2.26
quad-core snapdragon processor 2.3 on
the note 3 actually these are pretty
much almost the same processor same
thing kegs of ram same 32 gigs of
storage though this one does have a 16
gig storage where this one goes directly
to 32 ok now one of the cool things
about the g pro 2 is the fact that you
can't expand it just like you can do so
on the Galaxy Note 3 as well you do have
microSD expansion and you do have again
32 gigs of storage just like you do on
the Galaxy Note 3 obviously the main
differentiator between the Galaxy Note 3
and the LG G pro 2 is the fact that you
do have the S Pen functionality on this
galaxy note 3 that you do not have on
the g pro two you can't even detect it
it does support capacitive stylus but it
doesn't do the job that we get from the
galaxy note 3 you don't
the multitasking features that you get
from the note 3 now aside from that both
displays are beautiful now keep in mind
android 4.4 kitkat out of the box
android 4.3 right now on the Galaxy Note
3 and obviously if you have a carrier
bearing you're going to have to struggle
with this but exactly that both phones
are pretty much the same there are great
competing devices although if you're
looking for more productivity the galaxy
note 3 is for you and if you're looking
for a bigger display a better color IPS
display then obviously the g pro 2 is
dream I never get up a parking down it's
only behind the camera we've got more
videos coming up soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
