being a point release what is that and
what does it mean for Android this is
pocket now I'm Joe Levi that's what
we're going to talk about on today's
episode of the android guy weekly way
back to the early days google has listed
their operating system iterations well
as nice tasty desserts versions a and B
kind of broke that model but see was
cupcake and well after that it was all
downhill the next version after the
current version which is of course Ice
Cream Sandwich version 4.0 has been
rumored to be jelly bean now Google's
let that name slip a little bit so we're
pretty confident that that's ultimately
what the next version of android is
going to be called but what version is
it we think that it might be four point
something some people thought it might
be five point oh well what's the
difference first and foremost by all
accounts it looks like it's going to be
Android version 4.1 yes jelly bean we're
putting our money down on 4.1 why is
that well google released their galaxy
nexus phone in the Google Play Store so
you could buy it directly from them
which first of all that's really cool
we're glad they brought that back as you
used to be able to do that with the
nexus one back before it was called the
Play Store now they're doing it with the
Galaxy Nexus they let something slip
though just last week when looking at
the description for the phone online it
said that this was the first version of
the phone that was going to get the next
version of android version 4.1 and they
listed jellybean by name so we're pretty
sure it's going to be called jelly bean
and we're pretty sure it's going to be
version 4.1 they pulled down that
description relatively quickly those
screenshots do exist indicating that
that's probably what Google's go
to be doing also means that the nexus is
probably going to be the first phone to
get it and it's probably going to be
relatively soon so if we take all of
those assumptions which at this point
they are they're pretty well founded
assumptions but if we take all those
assumptions what does it mean what is a
point release and what does that mean
for Android well for a point release
we've got to look back to software
development hey and we're going to do
this in the context of Android the
operating system all along the way we've
had really minor versions with a couple
major versions now what's a minor and a
major version major versions are full
versions so version 12 version to
version to version 3 version 3 diversion
for version for diversion 5 those are
major revisions sometimes they're not
all that in major as far as what they
include but that's what they're called
minor revisions are sometimes called
point revisions sometimes minor
revisions are called something else but
will kind of column synonymous for the
purpose of this video a point revision
is simply that we're going from version
2.0 to 2.1 or 2.1 to 2.2 generally
speaking in software development just in
general point revisions are bug fixes
they are suffering modifications to add
stability to correct errors they usually
don't add many new features well all one
has to do is look back at the history of
Android to realize that's not the case
for Android because we get lots of new
features and functionality with point
revisions now we're going to call them
minor revisions next and that's
sub-point revisions so for example right
now on my galaxy nexus i'm running
version 4.0 point for so Google usually
does bug fixes in the minor revisions in
the sub point revisions I'm still
running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
it's just version zero point
or of that make sense all right so we
kind of have some terminology down and
under our belts we kind of know where
Google breaks with the standard as far
as naming goes so what do we expect
we're going to get with Android jelly
bean which is probably going to be
Android version 4.1 if we think back to
froyo and gingerbread which really want
that long ago a lot of you guys are
still running one of those versions of
Android there's not a lot of differences
between the two but the difference that
are there are some of them are subtle
some of them are a bit more grandiose
some of them are a lot more important
but they're still very close to one
another at least from a development
standpoint a developer doesn't have to
do much different to get their stuff to
be optimized for Gingerbread versus just
running on an optimized for Froyo but
runs on gingerbread make sense so we
expect the same things going to be
happening with Android jelly bean again
hopefully version 4.1 if it's not this
video is going to become really
irrelevant really fast isn't it we'll
cross that bridge when we come to it but
I'm putting my money down on 4.1 so what
does that mean what are we going to get
recently we have seen a lot of
improvement with Google Maps well we've
seen it we just haven't been able to
experience it Google Maps has this
really cool new 3d building texture
trees landscape topography thing we've
seen it in their videos but we really
haven't seen it on any devices yet they
had a press release that showed us how
cool it was and holy crap it's cool
imagine flying over taking multiple
shots of an area and using a really
sophisticated algorithm patching those
flat two-dimensional images together
into a three-dimensional model and then
painting the two-dimensional images with
the appropriate stretches and skews to
handle the three-dimensional three
dimensionality
wow that's really hard to say painting
that over the sides of the 3d model
sounds awesome and in fact it is
everything that we've seen so far looks
amazing but we haven't been able to play
with it in hand why is that probably
because they're waiting for their next
major conference to come out so they can
announce it give us an early release
look at you know just to the people who
are there maybe hopefully to us out in
the industry as well so we can get some
videos and show you the cool stuff will
let you know on that but I suspect that
is going to be built in to android
version 4.1 or at the very least
exclusively released to Android 4.1
initially and then it will be built back
into older versions now why is that I
suspect their stuff inside Android for
one that enables some of this more
high-end 3d stuff with less lag and and
more fluidity that's going to make the
whole experience in the new Google Maps
a lot nicer but of course that's not in
downlevel versions of Android so they
don't want to release it down level
versions of Android because the
experience would be less than ideal
again just my assumption I don't know
that for sure but I kind of suspect it
what other stuff well of course we're
going to get incremental improvements
we're going to see things getting just
more polish smoother and all around
better do we have any more specifics
about what's coming in Android jelly
bean I certainly don't that's what I'd
like to turn it over to you what have
you heard might be included in Android
jelly bean what would you like to be in
Android jelly bean and what are some
things that you want to see Google avoid
with Android jelly bean some mistakes
that they may have made in the past I'd
like to hear from you head over to
pocketnow.com and leave your comment
down at the bottom of the article so we
can all kind of get a feel for what
everybody thinks is coming what
everybody wants to be coming that's the
best part of this whole thing at least
in my opinion is hearing from you guys
the audience it's awesome you open up my
eyes so
many different things and thank you for
it for pocket now musing about android
4.1 and jelly bean I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
