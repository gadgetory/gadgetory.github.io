pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to demonstrate the HDMI output on
the Motorola Droid X let's get to it
okay so the Droid X like the HTC EVO 4G
has this HDMI output they are among the
first devices to have this which is
really handy but you really can't do
much with it as I'm going to show you in
this video
now this cable that I have I got off of
ebay for about ten dollars it's an HDMI
type D connector I'll put a link up in
the description and in the post in case
you want to get one for yourself so I'm
just gonna plug it in and show you how
it works you can't do too many things
with it so I'm gonna turn on the Droid X
unlock the screen there are some
settings associated with HDMI not that
many you can change the HDMI format to a
variety of resolutions here I try to put
it on 720p 50 Hertz and this relatively
new TV couldn't handle it's kind of
strange so I leave it on automatic and
that seems to do it so you have to be in
the gallery to get this to work so I'm
gonna jump into the gallery where I have
here a video a video that I've recorded
on the device and if I wait a second the
TV is going to change into the playback
so just give it a second and what's
happening is it's just sitting on the
playback screen and eventually it will
recognize that it's time to play it on
the on the TV okay and now it recognized
that this is what happens and you're
going to see the video go fullscreen
pretty good this is 720p video being
scaled to 1080p so it doesn't look
terribly great but it's smooth the
playback is smooth I'll let you listen
for a sec so imagine if you recorded a
soccer game on here or something like
that and you're at your friend's house
and really quick you want to just put it
up on the TV this is a great way to do
it
since the Droid X doesn't support that
many video formats like DivX it's gonna
be a little bit limiting it's not likely
that you will you know download a full
movie on your computer transfer it to
your droid X and have it play because
it's just not that versatile so we can
go back to the previous screen I'll show
you how this looks with photos so I'm
just going to tap on one of these photos
these are very high resolution photos
although they're going to output in only
1080 by 720 resolution it's not going to
scale it up but of course that may have
to do with the TV setting so I can press
over here kind of go through a slideshow
of pictures it's a nice touch or I can
press the play button just to get it to
automatically go through say I just took
some pictures on my device I want to
show off what I took and so smooth
transitions it works it works it would
be really nice if this HDMI out actually
outputted everything that's on the
screen at all time so that I could have
this on the screen I could play YouTube
I could read my email all those sort of
things but right now the Droid Acton
doesn't support that many things so
again I'll put a link up in the
description and in the post on how to
get this HDMI connector it's about ten
bucks and it's good to have if you have
a Droid X an Evo 4G or any other
smartphone that has the HDMI output
please thumbs up the video if you liked
it and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
