smartphone emerges it seems the iPad
Mini has it stays counted according to
certain rumors and let's all reminisce
as today marks the anniversary of the
first ever iPhone
I'm hi Natalie vera and yeah I kind of
need a full week of sleep after CES this
is parking out daily the official news
today began with deals of you are in the
market for the galaxy s7 galaxy s7 edge
or even the galaxy s7 active I would
highly suggest you visit us buy as it
currently is shaving 150 dollars off the
price tag and in addition you actually
also get a gear fit to which I actually
enjoy using I would highly suggest you
follow this deal and speaking of the
gear v tool in addition to the gear s3
those of you wanting to use it in an
iPhone well the gear application from
Samsung is now available obviously it
now allows you to have certain of the
features of the gear s3 or gear 4 - on
your iPhone sadly it's not perfect
obviously you need a galaxy phone for
that to work but still it gives you an
option and we do love the design of
either of these products and speaking of
iPhones it's actually a good time to
reminisce and remember that today marks
the anniversary of the announcement of
the first generation iPhone surely there
are a ton of iPhone haters out there and
we know that the iPhone is not the
perfect smartphone but you have to
remember that before the iPhone
smartphones were very different to what
we know today and we actually do like
the way that smartphones have evolved up
to the point where a lot of things
evolved with the process like for
example the smartphone business and the
fact that pocket now actually exists
thanks to the growth of the smartphone
business etc etc you can leave us a
comment down below let us know what you
think about the iPhone and it's pretty
much ten years yeah ten years and
speaking of Apple we continue to get
some very interesting rumors from
trusted sources that claim the future of
the iPads apparently the iPad Mini might
not happen at all it's not that we have
a confirmation that it won't but we do
hear that the nine point seven inch iPad
and we're talking about the iPad air 2
pretty much could probably become the
entry-level iPad and then we have the
pro lineup so it seems that the iPad
Mini might not make it we do know that
that is the tablet that sells the lease
for the company makes a lot of sense but
it's sad for me at least because I
actually like that 7.9 for
factor and finally the very hot news
that they have to do with Nokia it is
2017 and hmd in conjunction with Nokia
have just announced the company's first
mark phone it's being dubbed the Nokia
six and we don't know exactly why it's
being called a six what we do know is
specifications we've got four gigs of
RAM 64 gigs of storage 5.5 inch 1080p
display the video even shows us a
fingerprint scanner in addition to Dolby
audio dual cameras and all this is great
the only part that we don't like is the
snapdragon 430 processor we're not
really sure if this is a typo from HMD
or if it's the fact that we are getting
a slouch could just be but it leads me
to the question of the day what do you
think about the video of the nokia 6 you
can find a link in the description tell
us if your opinion is positive so far I
like what I see in the design I just
don't know what I'll do with that
processor it was a comment down below
