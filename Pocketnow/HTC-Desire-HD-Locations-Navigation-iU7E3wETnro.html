pocket comm and today we'll show you the
new navigation program that's built into
the HTC Desire HD prong so the cool
thing about this is you don't need a
data connection to use the navigation
program so if you're out of your
coverage area that means that you can
use your navigation without having any
service so let's get started
so yesterday Brandon had demonstrated
some of the new features on this Desire
HD ROM that was ported over to the HTC
hd2 of course this is still the beta 2
version so not all of the features are
exactly integrated like the HTC Sense
comm website so some of the maps aren't
able to download directly to the device
so the first thing I show you is the
actual navigation program and this is
the basic one that comes with the Desire
HD ROM and this is the free version
there's also a paid version which is
about $4.99 for the entire United States
the htcsense.com website is not fully up
and running so unfortunately the maps
were not able to download all the way
but we can go into still some of the
great navigation features so let's do
that so we have two separate views we
have this 3d view which is pretty cool
because at night time it shows you the
Stars and even shows you to the North
Star facing in the north direction of
course we can also get the 2d view which
is pretty simple and it shows you the
street names and street numbers and go
back to the 3d view again so if we go
down to the menu we can browse for
certain items we can upgrade a course
and get directions it can also change
the view so if I click on here I can add
all these certain points of interest
another cool feature about this if we go
all the way down course this is a pretty
glitchy right now because it's still the
beta 2 test version we can also get 3d
buildings so I'm gonna go back click
done and wait for it slow just one
second and now if I navigate to Seattle
I'll just take one second to do this and
I'll show you the 3d building so let me
just zoom back in to Seattle so here we
are in Seattle when you have a few
buildings we have the Space Needle let's
see if we can zoom in on this we have
the experience music project the Seattle
Center so this is like the the main
metropolitan area of the Seattle area so
we can also zoom out if I like and get
all these other points of interest as i
zoom in closer course and we have a few
other buildings but there's not too much
on here right now because it's still of
course in the beta 2 test so I'm gonna
show you the navigation and then we're
gonna go for a little ride and I'll show
you how it works
ok so here I am in airplane mode you can
see that with the little airplane Signia
at the top so the cool thing about this
is courses you still have the maps on
the application and this is called
locations
by HTC so another great thing about this
is if I go into the car menu I'll show
you that just a second it gives me many
more options so let's do that so I'm
just going to go home and then go into
the car panel and it's pretty cool so
you can use your phone in your car but
we don't really recommend that doing
that of course unless you're stopped or
as the passenger so we can pick our
destination so if we wanted to find
something let's say we gonna go here and
we'll search for something simple let's
try a gas station so hit search I turned
off the data connection so this is what
everything that's saved in here and I'm
just gonna select this am/pm these are
all the points of interests that are
saved on the application itself so I can
either use the premium navigation which
is the $4.99 service through HTC or I
can use Google navigation so I'm just
gonna use the premium navigation here
and we'll let it load and it will
display my destination right now it's
searching for GPS because I'm inside the
house so we'll go out to the car just a
second and now it looks like it's found
the direction it's gonna route my course
and give me a turn by Sun directly left
ok so there we go another cool thing
about this is if you hit the bottom it
gives you a progress bar opposed to the
estimated time of arrival so let's go
outside and I'll show you how this works
ok so I live on a private road so I
wouldn't suggest anyone driving with a
video camera and a cell phone in there -
this is my own private road and as like
in our community we own this property so
it's not really that big of a deal
but I'm just gonna show you some of the
ways that this thing navigates and let's
see if we can turn here sorry about this
probably like the Blair Witch Project or
Cloverfield but I'll try to give you the
best beat views that I can as we drive
so it should start speaking to me and as
you can see the navigation works pretty
well it's exactly where I am on this
street luckily my gate is open so
and then the second row turn left
so it's pretty simple of course it does
give you English and you can choose
between a male or female voice whichever
you prefer after - when I first
installed it this was speaking to me in
Chinese so that was a little annoying so
I'm just gonna go to the end of the
street and then I can go back and I'll
show you the rest of the features of
this application okay so some other cool
things about this application is that
you can zoom in and zoom out you can do
the pinch to zoom or you can also hold
and select and move your finger slightly
and you can get this zoom in and zoom
out bar over here you can also go to my
location it'll take you directly back to
your location if we go back I'm gonna
show you the rest of the Karman you'll
buy I can also click here on the screen
of course and hit stop get a 2d view if
I'd like and it switches to a 2d view I
can just tap back on the screen I can
get a preview of my entire itinerary and
route so I can view my entire itinerary
if you'd like I can see the entire
turn-by-turn basis and the distance
traveled I can go back I can also click
here and if I would like to use my phone
I can do that of course I can also mute
it and go back to my car panel so from
here I can view my footprints if I made
photos on the wall I'm venturing out I
can also view my photos I can see near
bright items like points of interest and
stuff so click here and I can get all
these other sort of items here of course
parking fuel shopping eating transit and
all these other great features so I can
also mark this location so let's say I'm
right here and I want to mark this
location and I have my address of course
it's not going to give me my direct
address because this is still the beta
and it just shows me my GPS coordinates
so we can go back or save it to
footprints so this is the free version
on the locations app through HTC Desire
HD ROM so a cool thing about this is it
does give you your compass on the top
you can also change between two and 3d
views this is the free version of course
I can go down here to the bottom and get
directions and let's just search for
some gas again because I think I've
already had that saved click there and
what
for it to load I get this gas station we
can either choose between driving or
walking so I'm going to choose driving
of course and we'll give you my
destination and start my directions and
it loads really fast for a navigation
program to reroute something that's
quickly so if you like our videos make
sure you give us a thumbs up and also
