pocket calm and today we'll show you the
new navigation program that's built into
the HTC Desire HD wrong so the cool
thing about this is you don't need a
data connection to use the navigation
program so if you're out of your
coverage area that means that you can
use your navigation without having you
in service so let's get started so
yesterday Brandon had demonstrated some
of the new features on this desire HD
rom that was ported over to the HTC hd2
of courses is still the beta 2 version
so not all of the features are exactly
integrated like the HTC Sense calm
website so some of the maps aren't able
to download directly to the device so
the first thing imma show you is the
actual navigation program and this is
the basic one that comes with the desire
HD rom and this is the free version
there's also a paid version which is
about four dollars and ninety-nine cents
for the entire United States the HTC
Sense calm website is not fully up and
running so unfortunately the maps were
not able to download all the way but we
can go into still some of the great
navigation features so let's do that so
we have two separate views we have this
3d view which is pretty cool because at
nighttime it shows you the stars and
even shows you the North Star facing in
the north direction of course we can
also get the 2d view which is pretty
simple and it shows you the street names
and street numbers and go back to the 3d
view again so if we go down to the menu
we can browse for certain items we can
upgrade a course and get directions it
can also change the view so if i click
on here i can add all these certain
points of interest another cool feature
about this if we go all the way down
course this is a pretty glitchy right
now because it's still a beta to test
version we can also get 3d building so
i'm going to go back click done and wait
for closest one second and now if i
navigate to seattle i'll just take one
second to do this and i'll show you the
3d building so let me just zoom back
into seattle so here we are in seattle
when you have a few buildings we have
the space needle let's see if we can
zoom in on this we have the experience
music project the seattle center so this
is like the the main metropolitan area
of the Seattle area so again I'll zoom
out if I like and get all these other
points of interest
as i zoom in closer course and we have a
few other buildings but there's not too
much on here right now because it's
still of course in the beta to test so
I'm actually the navigation and then
we're going to go for a little ride and
I'll show you how it works okay so here
i am in airplane mode you can see that
with the little airplane cigna at the
top so the cool thing about this is
courses you still have the maps on the
application and this is called locations
by HTC so another great thing about this
is if I go into the car menu I'll show
you that just a second it gives me many
more options so let's do that so I'm
just going to go home and then go into
the car panel and it's pretty cool so
you can use your phone in your car but
we don't really recommend that doing
that of course unless you're stopped or
as the passenger so we can pick our
destination so if you want to find
something let's say we going to go here
and we'll search for something simple
let's try a gas station so hit Search I
turned off the data connection so this
is what everything that's saved in here
and I'm just going to select this a.m
p.m. these are all the points of
interests that are saved on the
application itself so i can either use
the premium navigation which is the four
dollars and ninety-nine cents service
through HTC or i can use google
navigation so i'm just going to use the
premium navigation here and we'll let it
load and it will display my destination
right now it's searching for gps because
i'm inside the house so we'll go out to
the car in just a second and now it
looks like it's found the direction it's
going to route my course and give me
turn by spin directly after 100 yards
turn left okay so there we go another
cool thing about this is if you hit the
bottom it gives you a progress bar
opposed to the estimated time of arrival
so let's go outside and i'll show you
how this works ok so i live on a private
road so i wouldn't suggest anyone
driving with a video camera and a cell
phone in their dash this is my own
private road and as like in our
community we own this property so it's
really that big of a deal but i'm just
going to show you some of the ways that
this thing navigates and let's see if we
can turn here sorry about this probably
like the blair witch project or
Cloverfield but I'll try to give you the
best beat views that I can as we drive
so it should start speaking to me and as
you can see the navigation works pretty
well it's exactly where I am on this
street luckily my gate is open so I
don't worry about whether flat and then
at the second road turn left so it's
pretty simple of course it does give you
English and you can choose between a
male or female voice whichever you
prefer mr. to I just come with all the
other voices on there but when i first
installed it this was speaking to me in
chinese so that was a little annoying so
I'm just going to go to the end of the
street and then I can go back and i'll
show you the rest of the features of
this application okay so some other cool
things about this application is that
you can zoom in and zoom out you can do
the pinch to zoom or you can also hold
and select and move your fingers
slightly and you can get this zoom in
and zoom out bar over here you can also
go to my location it'll take you
directly back to your location if we go
back i'm going to show you the rest of
the car menu I can also click here on
the screen of course and hit stop get a
2d view if I'd like and it switches to a
2d view I can just tap back on the
screen I can get a preview of my entire
itinerary and route so I can view my
entire itinerary if you like I can see
the entire turn-by-turn basis and the
distance traveled I can go back I can
also click here and if I would like to
use my phone I can do that of course I
can also mute it and go back to my car
panel so from here I can view my
footprints if I made photos on the while
i'm venturing out i can also view my
photos i can see near bright items like
points of interest and stuff so click
here and i can get all these other sort
of items here of course parking feel
shopping eating transit and all these
other great features so i can also mark
this location so let's say I'm right
here and I want to mark this location
and I have my address course is not
going to give my direct address because
this is still the beta and it just shows
me my GPS coordinates
so we can go back or save it to
footprints so this is the free version
on the locations app through HTC desire
HD rom so a cool thing about this is it
does give you your compass on the top
you can also change between 2 and 3d
views this is the free version of course
I can go down here to the bottom and get
directions and let's just search for
some gas again because I think I've
already had that saved click there and
wait for it to load I get this gas
station we can either choose between
driving or walking so I'm going to
choose driving of course and will give
you my destination and start my
directions and it loads really fast for
a navigation program to rear out
something that's quickly so if you like
