advancements in smartphone technology
and all the great processors and
displays that we get there are still a
ton of things that annoys about
smartphones so I'm huynh every data this
is pocket now and these are the top 5
things that's still annoys about
smartphones even in 2013 number 5 is
really a lot of basics you would think
that smartphones are supposed to be
smarter than feature phones but I could
give you a ton of feature phones that
have better call quality than most
smartphones and that's actually one of
the worst realities today the fact that
we actually have to review phones and
tell you which ones have better call
quality than the others because there is
a huge dramatic difference between one
phone and the other aside from that we
still have basics that people have not
been able to fix like speakerphone
quality which is such an irony given the
fact that a lot of smartphones are much
bigger than feature phones and again we
have feature phones that have better
speaker phone quality and that has a lot
to do with the fact that we are still
using mo no speakers on smartphones
which are supposed to be a lot better
number four is image quality on most
smartphones that is still hit or miss
and probably one of the biggest ironies
is that I still have photographs taken
with a 1.2 megapixel camera of a
motorola v 635 almost half a decade ago
that are much better than a lot of the
photographs that i can take with the
current Moto X and that's really one of
the things that we don't understand why
is it that there is such an involvement
of camera technology and we have
smartphones like the iPhone which really
do a good job but then again we have
other OEMs that still haven't even
figured it out and probably one of the
biggest ironies there is Sony which is
the company that's in charge of the
imaging processors of most smartphones
and their camera technology is really
not the best number three has to do with
software and mainly with stability and
also software updates you think that by
now with all the enhancements and
project butter and all the new
enhancements and kit kats you think that
all smartphones would perform great but
no sadly this is one of the things that
we still have to review we have to tell
you just how good software is on a
specific smartphone because there are
some companies that get it right and
some companies that just don't get it
right at all we have performance issues
we have issues where we think
that so much processing power would be
great but no some smartphones don't
perform as well as they should even with
all the force power that they have and
then we have software updates which you
would assume should be solved by now
with all the Nexus programs and all the
enhancements we have even in Windows
Phone and no sadly there's only one OEM
that's figured it out and that's Apple
and even then Iowa 7 sucks number two is
all-day battery life just think about
this analogy what's the point of view
buying a sports car if you won't be able
to actually use it the way you should
that's the same case with smartphones
we've got great app stores on almost
every platform we've got great games
great movie selections we've got great
music quality now but we have smart
phones that don't have great battery
life for me to actually be able to enjoy
all this content and that really makes
having this great multimedia machine
pointless if I'm not going to be able to
play the game that i want for more than
an hour or watch the movie that i want
for more than a couple of hours then it
really becomes pointless for me to be
able to have youtube on my phone if i
also have to be taking care of the
battery to be able to actually get phone
calls because i also use my phone for
that or for messaging as well we wish
that smartphones and OEMs would figure
this out we really don't understand what
the problem is they're working on more
processors they're working on more
displays they're working on bigger
phones but they're not working on
battery life and we really don't
understand why in the top number one
reason why we're annoyed by smartphones
in 2013 is really compromise it's the
fact that there is no such thing as the
perfect smartphone if you want to buy
the gorgeous HTC One you're gonna have
to put up with the terrible camera that
it has or probably get that gorgeous
galaxy s4 and then hate the hyper glaze
coating in the plastic and touch was as
well you can get great battery life on
the Galaxy Note 3 but you're not gonna
like a phone that big or you can get the
gorgeous iphone 5s and pretty much hate
the fact that it's got iOS 7 there is
really no perfect phone and you have to
put up with a lot of things lately like
the great camera technology on the Lumia
1020 but it's got this huge hump and
it's also got the time that a lot of
people don't really like Windows Phone
so again it's that compromise is the
fact that there is no perfect thing out
there but that leave these are the
question of the day what annoys you the
most of your current smartphone what
would you wish that your phone did
better
in my particular case honestly that are
still a lot of things but mainly it has
to do with battery life but leave us a
comment down below what are your current
annoyances that's it for today's top
five thank you very much for watching
