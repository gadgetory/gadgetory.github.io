with the next iPhone 5 the Sony
experience have let us now available in
the US and the UK and the HTC windows
phone 8 lineup seems to be leaked I'm hi
Mary Vera hoping that any of those HTC
windows phones looks like the One X and
this is parking out daily one of the
biggest debates this year's whether
Apple will release a next generation
ipod touch or not many assume that Apple
will be replacing this device with the 7
inch iPad Mini that looks a lot like the
ipod touch and others now believe that
Apple will be releasing a next
generation ipod touch along with the
iphone 5 with a similar design but
obviously without the cell phone radio
which is kind of awkward because Apple
never launches any iPod that's not in
their September music event we are in
September though so we could be in for a
treat so stay tuned for the news now
Sony wasn't playing around when they
announced their smartphone and tablet
lineup at IFA they were the only company
that provided release dates for their
products and so far the only company
that has delivered the Sony Xperia
Tablet S is now available for sale in
the US and the UK and they have a lot of
variants and a lot of really compelling
prices this Tegra 3 quad-core tablet is
pretty much the better tablet that
you'll find in the market this holiday
season so make sure you order if you're
interested now HTC September 19th event
this close by and already we've got
rumors of the windows phone 8 lineup
that will be getting first of all we've
got the HTC 8x notice a resemblance with
the 1x which is codenamed the zenith now
we've got the HTC 8s which notice the
resemblance with the 1s which is coding
the Accord that we already leaked
recently and then we've got obviously
the HCC 8v which notice the resemblance
what the 1v is codenamed the Rio now
aside from the resemblances there are a
lot of really neat specs for these
devices so make sure you hit the link in
the description because they're a lot so
make your bets because we'll probably
get something really good windows phones
in the next couple of days recent leaks
have an official version of Android 4.1
point one running on the galaxy s3 now
what makes this version specialist that
obviously this was the
official version that was launched to
the market for the Galaxy Nexus because
the first version of Android 4.1
announced at Google i/o wasn't really a
stable or done yet now obviously we
don't know what Samsung's gonna do
because we know that Android 4.1
jellybean is coming out for the galaxy
s3 soon so hopefully they'll make the
jump for 4.1 point one in the end it's
kind of a mouthful to be saying that
name and finally for the set news of the
day we've got recent renders of an LG
escape for AT&amp;amp;T coming very soon and the
reason why this is sad is because the
name is very specific escape the specs
are bad and sadly it does seem that LG
has not really got their game back there
obviously offering mid tiered phones
that are not that good and none of the
phones that we've reviewed recently have
made any high marks that leads to our
question of the day do you care about LG
smartphones anymore because sadly we
haven't really found anything good aside
from their first iterations of Windows
Phone which were sadly not continued now
if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow was on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary venom thanks
