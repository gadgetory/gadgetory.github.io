speakers all over samsung may show a new
design language coming for future galaxy
products and the nokia aluminum catwalk
finally gets leaked in photos I'm hi
meri beta and after watching oblivion
yesterday I'll tell you this much it's a
good movie with a weird story this is
 out daily that's right for those
of you that were wondering when is the
samsung galaxy s4 reaching sprint well
pre-orders start tomorrow officially you
can get the device on April 27 so you
can get it actually for 50 bucks less
then you can get it on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
which is really interesting but then you
also have tmobile with their off
contract deal and you can start pre
ordering your device on April 24th to
get it later so stay tuned if you're
interested on this phone pre-orders are
the best way to go and speaking of
Samsung new leaked photo show that
Sammy's working on a new design language
for their future galaxy products and
even though you're still getting
polycarbonate here no metal just yet it
is interesting to see that Sammy is
thinking about getting rid of their
curved design and going for sharper
edges it's kind of an iconic very
interesting design but obviously don't
get your hopes up remember companies do
prototypes all the time and that could
just be the case now let's talk about
the motorola x phone or x lineup of
rumors if you were thinking about being
able to change your processor on your
phone sadly those rumors were dismissed
days ago but on the positive side it's
interesting that apparently the company
is going to bring you a rainbow of color
options and not target about three four
or five colors I'm talking about more
than 20 colors that you could choose
from for your next smartphone but then
you think about it I mean you're gonna
choose your gray or magenta beautiful
phone and then you're going to get a
trashy camera with a laggy version of
Android and then that totally defeats
the purpose now let's talk about the
Nokia catwalk and you believe we finally
get some leaked photos of this aluminum
device in man look at that lens look at
the list for that camera that thing is
huge makes us wonder if the no kick
catwalk is actually part of their EOS
program to bring the 41-megapixel camera
of the 808 PureView into Lumia territory
and judging by this design that's most
likely the case I've never seen the lens
that big so stay tuned for the rumor
and finally for the interesting news of
the day if you thought that HTC was
ending their battle with the HTC One
this year well think again we've got
some leaked photos of the 606 w which
looks like the HTC one in the Windows
Phone 8x had a baby I mean it's a
polycarbonate design of the windows
phone 8x but then you get the boomsound
speakers and some of the design cues up
the HTC One this is a very beautiful
phone that then once you start looking
at the specifications you get to see
that this is actually a mid-tier drone
so that leads me to the question of the
day you know at this day and age when
all the difference between a mid-tier
phone and an expensive phone is actually
a hundred bucks would you buy this myth
tiered HTC device or go for the HTC One
in my particular case I mean seriously
for a hundred bucks and then having to
pull over a two-year contract I would
rather wait for the extra hundred bucks
and go high in for that device to have
better longevity but leave us a comment
down below what would you prefer when
you pay cheap or will you go for the
most expensive of course for an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet mature follow

much for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
