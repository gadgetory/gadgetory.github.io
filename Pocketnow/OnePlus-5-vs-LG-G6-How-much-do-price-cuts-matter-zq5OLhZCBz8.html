getting quite a few requests for this
matchup the g6 has become something of
an underdog this generation the phone
reviewers loved to sideline often
proclaiming it the best Android no one
will buy yet people still keep asking
about it even on my personal Twitter it
handily won an unofficial poll for which
phone I should use with my personal sim
a fresh new take on design with the new
display aspect ratio against a premium
mid-range err looking to kill some
flagships this comparison was actually
really fun to put together both for the
advantages each phone brings to the
table but also the cons we can criticize
1 + 5 vs. LG g6 yeah let's do this
I always kick these off with design and
immediately I have to give the win to LG
the screen in curved corners the overall
profile the flat easy to grip edges the
flush camera sensors the slight robocop
blue sheen to the rear glass on the
titanium model after some missteps LG
delivers one of the most attractive and
well finished phones the company has
ever produced and it doesn't look like
anything else on the market today the
one plus 5 is well-constructed and the
matte finish feels great against my
fingertips but this isn't my favorite
look for a phone too much of the overall
aesthetic lifted from another device LG
takes an easy win here the hardware
discussion flips the conversation
launching later in the year our review
oneplus is sporting the qualcomm 835 8
gigabytes of ram and quadrupled the
internal storage of the LG the
Snapdragon 820 one in the g6 is still a
capable performer and most folks likely
won't notice significant differences in
performance when looking at social media
and communication apps but the
compromise for being one of the first
phones of the year was using last year's
top-of-the-line chipset the
counter-argument to the oneplus is raw
horsepower are the lifestyle and
durability features on the g6
not just ip68 water-resistant like the
galaxy but also milspec 810g drop
resistant like the v 20 and while the g6
is working from a storage deficit and
32gb now feels lean for a modern
flagship you
can still pop in a memory card where the
oneplus is dual-sim by the narrowest of
margins we're giving the oneplus a win
for that newer chipset but we hope folks
won't overlook the collection of
benefits brought by the g6 design
display tech lands another win for LG
taller screens will be all the rage and
the g6 was first nearly identical
surface area compared to the oneplus but
in a smaller form factor which is a bit
friendlier in width for my stumpy thumb
I love the contrast on AMOLED and more
content is currently produced for
sixteen by nine but the higher
resolution coupled with some fun
software additions to show off the
taller shape help LG pull ahead software
however is another battle of nuance LG
is doing a good job of showing what you
can do with this new screen but people
who aren't fans of heavy manufacturer
skins will not be won over by this
latest effort oxygen OS on the oneplus
is a fancy name for a lightly tweaked
build of nearly stock Android and when
combined with the more powerful hardware
and lower resolution display you get
screaming fast performance we often
discuss these issues hypothetically but
I recently ran into a perfect example of
why more complicated manufacturer
software can sometimes muddy the waters
for consumers obviously I'm very storage
conscious on the g6 so you can imagine
my surprise when I saw that I was almost
out of room with a ton of space eaten by
this other category tapping on this
sends you to a start LG File Explorer
with no indication of what's occupying
that storage after a lot of hunting I
discovered that the issue was with the
LG gallery app including a Trash folder
and mine apparently wasn't dumping
deleted files after seven days total
fluke now I really liked the idea of a
trashcan for phones I think we've all
accidentally deleted a file we didn't
mean to but these pieces did not line up
LG storage reporting to different LG
file managers and the gallery app none
of them properly reported what was
taking up space and I think a lot of
folks would have been frustrated by
having to unravel that mystery on their
own I personally like what LG brings to
the table and customizing their phones
but sometimes simpler is the way to go
oxygen OS does a better job of getting
the way for users to focus on the task
at hand a quick word on the radio's the
oneplus proved for competition for
wireless performance both LTE and Wi-Fi
the glass bag g6 held on to signal
better and sometimes by a fairly
significant margin but what makes the
oneplus a snappier performer also helps
it take a battery win in our media bench
the g6 posts only adequate numbers for a
flagship device I can make it to dinner
time on both phones but I have
noticeably more juice left in the
evening on the oneplus while the g6
posts respectable numbers for recharging
its facing one of the fastest recharging
systems of the year - charging lands
another win for the oneplus 5 the audio
fight is a lot closer both phones have
mono bottom firing speakers which are
close enough in performance that I
really don't feel like wasting the 30
seconds in doing a speaker comparison
the headphone game however ekes out a
small win for the oneplus 5 quality
numbers are nearly identical with both
phones delivering true 32-bit playback
but the oneplus amp is a touch stronger
so it gets the win now we get to the
camera battle we have real camera
reviews for both and if you're curious
how these to perform we'd highly
recommend watching those separate video
reviews for a ton of real-world samples
but to sum it up here for general
performance these two are neck-and-neck
in good light and the difference is in
exposure saturation sharpening and white
balance will largely depend on personal
preferences I tend to prefer the
exposure on the oneplus but the white
balance and saturation on the g6 it's
the low-light game where LG's smaller
camera sensor and more aggressive
sharpening lose to the 1 + 5 night shots
look a lot greener and edgier and the 5s
photo processing is largely able to hang
with the g6 image stabilization the
video matchup is an easy win for LG
though driving the phones with UHD video
Hardware image stabilization makes a
huge difference in delivering nicer
footage the g6 microphones also provide
a nicer audio capture we're also
inclined to give the second sensor win
to LG a little extra zoom is nice but
the ultra wide view on the g6 adds a lot
more flexibility this means the GC
slack's a portrait mode and I genuinely
do like playing with software blur but
zoom sensor phones are not my favorite
way to achieve this artificial depth of
field for the core photography
situations people most often need to
address when out and about the g6 ii
sensor is likely the better solution
lastly while the 1+5 has a nicely
streamlined camera app LG is still
producing one of the most feature
complete camera control interfaces
available on a mobile device requisite
auto and easy modes but formidable
manual modes and excellent video options
want to take advantage of that tall
screen why not shoot some cinema wide
video all the while being able to
control the framerate bitrate and
shutter speed putting everything
together we have to award the g6
as the better multimedia content
creation device so let's wrap this up
where does that leave us between the 1+5
and the LG g 6 listing out the various
pros and cons the oneplus 5 takes an
overall win but what's shocking is
seeing how aggressively the price has
dropped on the g 6 carriers in the US
selling the phone for a hundred and
fifty dollars less than when it launched
and the odd sale where it falls below
the oneplus price tag in the UK easily
finding the g6 for some 50 pound cheaper
than the oneplus 5 flagship killing is a
lot more difficult when pricing is this
volatile which phone would I rather
carry I don't think I'd be much
conflicted trading the faster chipset
for better design and durability I like
showing off this screen I like the
smaller skinnier shape I really like
LG's camera features and if they're both
roughly the same price I think you know
which one would end up in my pocket as

audio reviews for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos bag now so I'm gadget guy on
