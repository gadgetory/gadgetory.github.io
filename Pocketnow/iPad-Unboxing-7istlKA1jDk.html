pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to unbox the iPad you may have
heard of it it is now out and selling
and in my opinion the ipad is going to
change a lot it's going to in my opinion
save print publishing all the magazines
and newspapers that are really
struggling it's also going to change the
way that we consume content and interact
with our digital devices that could mean
that you may have an ipad in the future
that could mean that other companies
Google and Microsoft are going to follow
suit with a similar kind of device that
really has that natural way of
interacting with a tablet-style device
anyway let's get to the unboxing and see
what the fuss is all about let's check
it out alright and here we go
this is how all the iPads ship they came
right from right from China where they
are built and we've got some some
plastic wrap to go through here so we'll
take sort of a key gently rub it along
the edge here maybe not so gently
alright and let's take off the the lid
here Wow it's funny my first impression
is I hate to use the cliche but yeah it
looks just like an ipod touch I can't
wait to feel how heavy it is quite light
quite light let's see what else we get
in the box we're and do a lot of size
comparisons I'm sure you're curious as
to how big it is here we've got some
some quick start guides talks about the
device some apple logos in case you want
to advertise for Apple we've got the
same wall charger that you get with the
iphone although this is actually a
little bit different this is the older
style wall charger used on the last
generation iphone oddly same connector
that you get with all apple mobile
products hopefully someday they'll make
that smaller and i think that's it they
kept it really simple it's just the
device and a charger in a sync cable
that's a yeah that's that's definitely
it they don't even want you to remove
this because you can't get it out there
seems to be some sort of tab holding it
anyhow let's take a look at the ipad
feels extremely high quality in hand
it's actually a lot heavier than I
thought it would be they say it's 1.5
pounds it it does have some weight to it
beautiful glass panel on the on the
entire front wow this thing is gorgeous
very sharp edges it's got a nice bubbly
shape to it kind of like the iPhone and
they do that so they can have these
night nice thin edges make it look
really thin but still have the
components in the back and kind of give
it some some some depth there it's got
the apple logo this is the 16 gigabyte
version very beautiful let's take a
look at this device compared to some
other things you may know let's start
with a five-dollar bill so it's a small
device it's only a 9.7 inch screen it's
actually about the same size that you
will find on most netbooks out there so
it's about this the width or the screens
about the width of a five-dollar bill
just look at my hand next to the screen
it's not that big of a screen let's see
how how how sort of thick this is to
compare to some other devices it
definitely feels thinner than the iPhone
because the edge is actually thinner on
the iPhone you kind of have this broad
edge that looks and feels larger the
iPad just feels very very solid and very
spelt in the hand let's let's take a
look around the device and then we'll
turn it on and see what it's like so
this is the power button we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack over here
nothing on the bottom we have the
charging port again it uses the same
exact port as the iPhone and the iPad
and all the other ipod products we have
a volume up and down rocker and a screen
lock button I love the back of this
thing is just gorgeous it just feels
extremely solid so let's turn it on well
it looks like I already turned it on
just by tapping the back and I actually
press the button let's see what happens
okay not much I guess I gotta plug it
into itunes so we'll be back with more
on the iPad a lot to talk about and this
button has a very very clicking pneus
about it a little less clicky then
you'll get on the iphone which is kind
of silent it's actually has a or
pronounced click so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
