Tony behind the camera MWC 2014 is still
on roll we're actually starting right
now
there's the Huawei booth and we are
looking at the Huawei media Pat M 18.0
and I just lost my breath there and this
is the iPad Mini let's do some
comparison work so off the bat what can
I tell you from these two tablets well
first of all even though the huawei CEO
only compared the media pad x1 to the
iPad Mini the iPad Mini is even bigger
than this media pad M 18.0 you've got an
8 inch display here when you have a 7.9
8 9 inch display here and obviously but
it comes to specification it's probably
the biggest problem with this tablet is
the fact that you do not have the latest
and greatest version of Android which is
something that you do have to consider
but then again you have another benefit
here and it's the fact that you have fun
firing speakers on the media pad m1 8.0
and you don't have these with the iPad
Mini you have back firing speakers which
are not as good as these even though we
haven't really been able to test it well
so far you have Android 4.2.2 here you
have iOS 7 point whatever version you
want this is the first generation iPad
Mini so we don't have the Retina display
to compare the resolution quality of
these tablets but so far you got the
options of front and back cameras here
even though you do have them on the iPad
Mini they don't have the same resolution
so again if you're in the market for a
media pad a media consumption tablet
that will give you a decent experience
if you have the option between the iPad
Mini in this but then again it does seem
that this tablet from Huawei is more
elegant and feels lighter
it feels better in the hand actually you
can actually grip it completely whereas
in the case of the iPad Mini obviously
you have to have big hands to be able to
do this so again this is high memory
that of pocketnow.com
Tony behind the camera you have a lot
more content coming up from MWC 2014 we
don't plan on sleeping today and that's
really because of the coverage not
because of the booths but we'll keep you
posted again thank you very much for
watching thumbs up if you like this
