of the really cool apps that I like and
I've had it for a long time is from
level up Studios it's called beautiful
widgets well I've shown you that before
today they released a huge update to it
that just adds all kinds of cool stuff
they also updated the beautiful live
weather wallpaper that you guys have
been asking about in almost every
comment it looks neat it's really
organized let's go take a look okay in
most of my videos you guys have seen
this big clock widget at the top and
you've seen this live wallpaper in the
background and it's really I like it a
lot I mean this this beautiful today
widget it's it's gorgeous has what you
need big nice clock in it as the current
weather the temperature the expected
high and low and the location where you
are and of course the the day and date
so it's a lot of information packed into
one this morning the level up Studios
developer released an update and this
update is huge
I don't know why he just didn't release
an entirely new package called beautiful
live widgets to order or something I
have no idea but it's that different you
can see these are the new widget styles
in fact let me go ahead and remove this
for you so you can see exactly what I'm
talking about
we're gonna go ahead and add a widget
this is going to be in the beautiful
widgets pack and it is called beautiful
super clock alright you got that so
we're gonna go ahead and put on the
beautiful super clock 4x2 because that's
what we had on there before it's going
to ask us to go through and configure it
now this is just a stock configuration
one thing that's been added you can
change your feature from the weather to
the battery if you want a battery
indicator so that's really kind of nice
I've got a little battery indicator up
there that says Joey you've done too
much surfing and reading today already
and your battery is low but we'll
forgive that for now one about the old
beautiful widgets is the the
configuration just kept
bigger and bigger and bigger and longer
and longer and longer well in this
iteration in the new widgets not the old
ones the old ones stayed the same which
is kind of nice for compatibility
there's a new organization scheme so
it's got this tab based organization
where you can set your general stuff you
can set your clock settings whether you
want to use the short date format or the
24 hour format I'm partial to 24 hour
coming here to weather
you can choose your weather service
either AccuWeather or Google set your
location you can either specify a
location or set it to geolocation geo
locations what I've done
set your update interval of course how
how current do you want your weather to
be and how much battery do you want to
suck down to get that information and
keep it up-to-date I've got mine set for
an hour of course you can set it to
longer and shorter than that or refresh
on awake it's going to refresh the
weather as soon as you power up your
device well since I power on/off power
on quite often I don't want all that
extra data going across so I've
unchecked that button 1 use Celsius or
metric rather than Fahrenheit I can do
that if I want to get temperature
notifications up here in the bar I can
do that and just lots of stuff that you
can do so I like it quite a bit I'm
gonna skip appearance for a minute go
over to advanced in advanced you can set
what happens when you touch various
parts of the the widgets the time app if
you touch the clock what apps it's gonna
watch so if you have a custom clock
application that you like to to use you
can set that date application forecast
application unlock animations now this
is kind of worded weird this isn't to
unlock any animations that are built in
this is to animate the weather across
the screen when you unlock your device
and usually when I turn on my device I
just want to get working on it and that
that little animation although cool can
really impress your friends it takes up
a little bit more time than I'd like and
I just have that turned off try it both
ways I really like it the first few
times that you use it for GPS for
geolocation alternate geo decoder fast
open effect yada yada yada changelog
okay any developers listening put this
in your app that's really really a nice
feature so we can see what you changed
since last time even if it's a bug fix
or what not so anyway let's go back to
appearance and this is where
some stuff has changed superclocked
skins new skins for the superblock very
obviously unfortunately this just came
out so it comes with a standard skin
which doesn't really even look like what
it looks like so I think that'll be
fixed in an upcoming one if we go to
download skins there's only two
available so and we need to wait for
some of those to come out but even still
it looks very gingerbread like so if you
want to throw a gingerbread look and
feel on your Froyo or Eclair phone go
ahead and do that you can set the
weather skins as well what you want
those weather icons to look like battery
skins are new obviously with this and
background transparencies and some other
stuff we can go ahead and save and apply
that and since I'm using a VW lunch or
e^x it asks me how big do I want this
widget I'm gonna accept the default 4x2
and there we've got that there are lots
of different sizes too if I want to use
the four by one to compress it a little
bit I can do that if I want to use the
two by one I can team that up with the
little forecast widget next to it once
it's just a one by one and really save
some space so I can do lots of cool
stuff so really neat go out and grab
that it's an update available in the
market but we're not done yet
I've got one more thing that I want to
show you and that's the beautiful live
weather wallpaper all right so I've
cleared my screen and believe it or not
this is the live weather wallpaper and
it doesn't look like much because it's
really overcast and foggy and cloudy
outside right now and that's actually
pretty much what it looks like so it's
really realistic but let's go in and
look at some stuff I'm going to long
hold and go into wallpapers once in
wallpaper of course I'm going to go down
to a live wallpapers since that's what
this is and you'll notice I've got two
of them now I've got beautiful live
weather and I'm gonna go ahead and
launch that one and just set it with my
settings because it remembered that and
I've got kind of this herky-jerky
animation I actually have this set up
using a setting called CPU hog and I've
got my frames per second set to 25 so
it's pretty much as smooth as it can get
you can also see kind of some static
stuff down here it can show the the Sun
and the moon so in the daytime the Sun
rises and sets and the moon rises and
sets it's really kind of cool looking
and then of course you can have
animated grass on the bottom which I I'm
not partial to that so I turn that off
but really kind of cool and you guys
have asked me a ton about that you know
what is this oh it's by level up Studios
go ahead and search for them in the the
Android Market you can download this the
wallpaper last time I checked is free
but to get the the weather updates you
need to have the last app that I just
showed you which is those those
beautiful widgets but this isn't the
cool part you ready for what he's done
today let's go ahead and look at this
new one again live wallpaper beautiful
live weather with OpenGL OpenGL is the
open graphics library for those of you
that don't know and it's really really
powerful so let's just take a look at
this first of all you'll notice the
animations are a ton smoother and he's
doing a lot more stuff with it with the
Sun rising and setting it gets dark
there's a sunset the moon rises and then
the moon sets just really cool really
fluid really smooth I know you're gonna
ask well Joe how does that affect the
battery life I have no clue I just got
this this morning please let us know in
the comments what your battery life is
like is it better than the last one is
it worse we want to know and I think
community feedback to the best way to do
that so let us know in the comments the
settings are basically the same with
some differences we can go in to animate
the Sun the moon which I have set we can
set a custom background which I haven't
done yet simply because I don't have a
good one on my phone but this means that
you can use your own images to
background so it kind of and I don't
want to take credit for this because I
don't know if this was me that the idea
came from or not but I did submit this
as an idea hey why don't we have a
background that you can set it's your
own custom picture and then I'll lay the
weather animations and whatnot over the
top of it so uh okay I'll take credit
for that although I don't know if it was
from me that he actually implemented it
but it was my idea so there you go
straight from pocketnow.com grass-type
this is new we go in here we have three
different types we've got the green
grass we've got the yellow grass and
we've got wheat i'll show you we just
because it's kind of neat we have to
enable or disable the grass i'm gonna go
ahead and enable it cpu hog of course
that means it uses more
CPU resources for smoother animations
kind of make sense it also chews up your
battery faster which also makes sense
but it's only gonna do that when your
screen is on so it's not gonna use that
much or it shouldn't come in here to
target frames per second and 25 is the
stock but check this out you can go all
the way up to unlimited high of 40 and
then some and a low 15 so it's really
really opened up how fluid it can get
but let's go ahead and and set this up
using these and I'll just show you right
here because it's a little bit nicer
than what you're gonna see if I go back
to my my home screen because it's just
gonna be fog you can see here they the
wheat blowing in the the breeze there
Sun comes up Sun comes down shows you
the the clouds and those clouds change
based on what the weather is like if
it's snowing you're gonna have
snowflakes you'll even have some
accumulation if it's raining you'll have
rain if it's foggy you'll have fog if
it's going to have a combination you
have a combination one of the things I
like is when it rains you get rain dots
on your phone or at least that's what it
looks like there's spots all over the
phone looks like you've been out in the
rain and your phone's gotten wet so
really cool update just came out go
ahead and grab that from the market if
you haven't done so already again
the wallpaper app is free you just don't
get the live weather updates unless you
have the partner app which is that
beautiful live widgets so very cool from
level up Studios we'd like to see what
you think of the new and of course leave
those in the comments down below and to
keep up to date on on these changes to
this app in the future and other changes
too or other new apps that do similar
stuff make sure you subscribe to our
video channel it's free and you get to
keep up-to-date and really kind of
impress your friends with your huge
knowledge of all the stuff that's going
on in the mobile marketplace for Joe I'm
