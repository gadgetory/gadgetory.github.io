released three iPhones this year and
this is the budget option the iPhone 10
our I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the unboxing of the iPhone
10 our but before we get started this
video is brought to you by the geniuses
over it wakes alright so here we are
with the iPhone 10 are I actually opened
up this box already because I had no
clue what this was when it came I had no
clue what was actually in it I didn't
know when it was coming who it's coming
from or anything so let's just get a cut
out of this so there we are
I full mint in our of course this comes
in the standard Apple packaging it
always looks saying this phone is very
very very similar to the 10s or the tin
but it's just cheaper that's one of the
main differences and you'll see some
design cues that are definitely a little
different because this to make it
cheaper they had to sacrifice some
things and as much as I wanted to use my
knife to cut this open Apple makes
removing plastic a little too easy this
is the 64 gigabyte version and I'm not
entirely sure what color it is I imagine
this probably tells me that I could be
wrong because this comes in five six
different colors others that we don't
normally see on an iPhone designed by
Apple in California the standard stuff
and of course your paperwork and some
stickers are inside the box here hello
this will just tell you a few things
about the gestures and the way the
iPhone 10 works still happy to see there
including SIM tools as some
manufacturers don't do that anymore
here's take a quick peek you got your
charging brick here it does not support
fast wireless charging but this home
does support the wired be hardwired fast
charging but like the other iPhones they
do not include the brick of course they
wouldn't with the budget option but that
is one big complaint why create a phone
that has a feature such as really fast
rapid charging and not include that in
the box very frustrating of course have
your
in here lightning connector and your
lightning poured down in the very bottom
the box literally nothing different here
for many that you've seen in the past I
don't know four five seven ten years I
don't know however long they've been
doing this I always look the same so
here is the actual phone the 10r it is
heavy it's much heavier than I expected
it to be which I had heard that it's a
heavier version and there are reasons
for that the old plastic off nice and
silent static so you can't see the major
difference here but the big difference
between this and the 10 or the 10s is
the screen so this one comes in at 750
other $749 to the next storage or double
the storage 228 gigabytes that's another
50 bucks over 800 bucks and then to go
up to 256 ago White's
you were looking at $900 you're still
under $1,000 for this home which that's
insane to say that the budget phone is
still under $1000 that's that's just
Apple that's how it is already you can
see one of the major differences between
this and the other iPhones especially
the ones with the notches the bezels
though it's called the liquid retina I
believe and that that means that you are
not getting or bezels or closer to edge
to edge the bezels on this let me take
the case off the iPhone 10 there are
much larger bezels on the 10r
and that is because this is an LCD it's
not an OLED panel and that means that
it's bigger heavier it's actually also a
lower resolution but what you are
getting with this phone is better
battery life it's got a bigger battery
slightly better battery life than the
others and and of course you're missing
your cameras you only have the one
camera so you don't have the two lenses
you don't have just a wide-angle and
telephoto you have the standard believe
it's a wide-angle it's an F 1.4 lens on
the back here is a quick size comparison
I have with all the iPhones on hand I
have the iPhone 8 this is the iPhone 10
I don't have the 10s or 10s Macs on hand
the iPhone 10 R and
the iPhone 8 plus so you can see it
Nestle's really nicely between the 8
plus and the 10 there not only is this
phone a little bit larger than the
iPhone 10 it also has a lower res
display so it's lower res it's also
lower contrast it's like 1401 instead of
a million-to-one which you get on the
tin and the 10s and 10's Macs these have
these really high contrast OLED displays
in the LCD on the 10r
is just not gonna have as much contrast
it doesn't have the resolution but the
benefit you get from this foam is better
battery it has a slightly bigger battery
but also this lower res display is gonna
be a little easier on the battery it's
not gonna take as much push those pixels
so you get a little better battery life
and I actually made a video yesterday
about how the best budget iPhone you can
get is actually the 8 plus and not the
10r and that's mainly because this one's
$700 buy it new this one 750 but this
one has most of the features that you
get out of the newer bigger phone so
there are a lot of different choices now
you can kind of choose your own poison
choose what matters most to you before
we've reached the conclusion of this
video let me interrupt for just 30
seconds to tell you about our sponsor
wigs if you're interested in creating a
professional website blog or online
store without any coding knowledge Wix
offers an insane portfolio of tools for
you to design something that's right for
you and it's all drag-and-drop which is
so practical or you can choose any of
the hundreds of templates they offer
learn more about Wix in the link in the
description so there you have it that's
the iPhone that 10r this phone is
Apple's budget option sort of I mean I
say that reluctantly cuz 750 dollars
it's still pretty expensive for a phone
there are many many cheaper options out
there but this is the budget option from
Apple unless you go with older phones so
it'll be interesting to see how this
thing stacks up in the real world
whether it can hold a candle against any
of the others out there or whether they
you should go with an older phone like
the 8 plus so stay tuned for that be
sure to subscribe to pocket now if you
haven't done so already and follow up on
it now in all the usual places go to
pocketnow.com for your
sore from all things mobile if I meet
