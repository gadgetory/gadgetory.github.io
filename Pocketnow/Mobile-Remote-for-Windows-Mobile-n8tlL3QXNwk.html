now calm and today I'm going to show you
a new application that's going to allow
you to use your windows mobile device as
a bluetooth mouse keyboard and remote
control for programs like Windows Media
Center and windows media player so the
program is called mobile remoteness by
mobile SRC and these are the same people
that make G scroll for the touch diamond
and touch pro and the first thing you'll
notice when I pull this program it's
going to want me to pair up with my
device because it's through a Bluetooth
connection so we need to pair it up and
have already assigned it already signed
my laptop to pair up with this but you
can also choose many other devices and
you can click them under that scroll
there so I'm just going to click on the
arrow and it will turn on you can see
this little bluetooth icon right here
and it will show that it's working it's
paired together the first thing you'll
see is a keyboard and this keyboard
works pretty well actually it was just
an on-screen keyboard and I think the
best feature on this device is actually
the mouse the the touchscreen mouse so
if I click on something I can go in here
and if you see and you can see the mouse
in the background if you can see that it
works very well and it has a right and
left key and another great feature this
is actually as a scroll bar if you can
see this black bar right here this is a
scroll bar that will allow me to scroll
up and down on pages okay and there's
also another there's also another mouse
and it uses the d-pad it's a little bit
more cumbersome it's a little bit slower
it only kind of only goes left right up
and down but you can kind of get it to
go sideways but it doesn't always work
and even on this phone this one has an
optical optical joystick and I can still
move the mouse a little bit with that
but it's pretty slow so I for the touch
mouse this touchscreen mouse it works
really well it actually works better
than the pressure pad on my laptop and
the next feature is a remote control for
windows media center or windows media
player and I'll show you that in just a
second on my projector another cool
feature about
program is allows you to record your
movements on screen and have them played
back so I recorded one and I'm gonna
load it real fast okay here we go it's
called calculations and I'm just going
to play it and if you watch the screen
behind I'll move the I'll move the phone
over and you can actually see that mouse
moving by itself and it will open a
program and start doing certain things
and it closed it as you can see if you
saw that and that will play ok so here
we are in windows media center and I'm
going to show you how easy it is to play
stop go forward and all that good stuff
ok so I have my phone here with the with
the mouse and I'm just going to click on
Mars Attacks right here on the projector
so click on that I've already played it
a little bit so just getting it resumed
same on the mouse okay it will continue
to play and now if I go into this other
menu I can fast-forward and as you can
see I fast-forwards and I can continue
to go through and I can also increase
the volume or decrease the volume with
the volume settings the volume buttons I
can pause it and play it and that's
pretty cool for windows media center
because not many programs will allow you
to have Bluetooth connectivity on device
like this well i'm danny webster with
pacquiao calm and thanks for watching my
review of mobile remote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
