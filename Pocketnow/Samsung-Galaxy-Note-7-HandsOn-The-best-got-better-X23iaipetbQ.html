least 200 percent year-over-year the
company that defined the category is
back for some more
I'm hi meri behna with market now here
in New York City with our hands on of
the Samsung Galaxy Note seven samsung
claims that its approach to the galaxy
note 7 was to provide us with a phone
that works the way we live and not just
the phone with a big screen to achieve
this the company has matched a lot of
what we saw in this year's galaxy
flagships and improve the functionality
provided by last year's note 5 the
changes aren't as significant as the
skipping of the number though visually
the note 7 follows the trend that begun
last year with glass on glass panels
matched together by 7000 series aluminum
this March the return of a curved
display to the note lineup but the
implementation is rather different this
5.7 inch AMOLED panel is protected by
Gorilla Glass 5 but Samsung had to
reduce the curve found in the galaxy s7
edge in order to not shatter it and also
for the s-pen travel to not be affected
more on that in a few seconds now if you
haven't heard the rest of the
specifications that's because Samsung
really downplayed the topic we're still
rocking the same snapdragon 820
processor with 4 gigs of ram and ip68
waterand does resistance that we find in
the galaxy s7 in addition to she and PMA
wireless and fast charging this is also
the same camera that we see with the
galaxy s7 which is to say it should be
just as awesome we're the no defers
aside from the Wacom digitizer that
enables the s-pen is that storage starts
at 64 gigs and there is a larger 3500
milliamp hour battery when compared to
the note 5 or the galaxy s7 not the
galaxy s7 edge and finally the arrival
of USB type-c this new s-pen is actually
improved now with 50% reduction in the
diameter of the tip to just 0.7
millimeters to provide a more natural
Glide when writing it's also ip68 water
and dust resistant meaning you won't
have to worry about it whenever you pull
it out of the silo
and then there are the logical
improvements like for example the fact
that you can now hold down the side
button to erase whatever you've sketched
and I like in the past where you had to
select the eraser and speaking of
software Samsung has made a couple of
changes that are rather significant on
top of the same layer of Android
marshmallow there's a new icon pack
that's more cohesive with the rest of
the UI and the same can be said about
the new settings menu in addition to the
drop down menu
Samson even went as far as to kill its
suite of four note applications that
were really confusing and instead just
built one app called Samsung notes for
the masses features that we loved from
the galaxy note 5 like being able to
write with a display being off is still
available but now you have the advantage
of being able to use these notes as part
of your always-on display which adds
extra functionality so make matters even
more useful the S Pen is now even a
translator allowing you to hover over
words and getting immediate translations
and for those of you that are wondering
exactly how the s-pen works over the
edge well it actually doesn't what does
work on this edge is that the launcher
features the same Galaxy s7 edge
features which allowed quick shortcuts
the contacts and even tasks
Samson even when is forced looking into
its TV business and bringing this very
interesting new MD nie chip that in a
nutshell allows you to playback HD or
quality video without affecting your
battery life something we will
definitely have to prove in our review
and if you remember the whole Vulkan API
thing that we heard with the galaxy s7
well it's now implemented with a galaxy
note 7 allowing you to enjoy better
graphics performance with games and
Samsung's game launcher continues to
save the day by allowing you to play
your game without worrying about the
capacitive keys now the main course meal
here is this new iris scanner call it a
gimmick if you want but if you think of
it you don't really need it but I found
the implementation to be rather accurate
and it can also come in handy when using
gloves or if you want maximum security
by being the only user register as
apparently you can only register one
pair of irises here Samsung has also
improved Knox and take advantage of this
by offering a new secure folder which
allows you to fit all your personal
stuff in here and then allowing you to
lend your phone to whoever you want and
Samsung is also leveraging this new iris
scanner technology with banks as well
though that partnership might take some
time this new samsung galaxy note 7
should launch on August 19 with
pre-orders beginning over the next
couple of days and with four color
options black onyx silver titanium gold
platinum in this new blue coral which is
gorgeous yes you could say that it's sad
that this phone no longer pushes the S
lineup and features but we can't really
say that that's a bad move either the
Samsung Galaxy s7 continues to be one of
our favorite phones of the year and we
can't deny that this note 7 is
definitely a compelling aggregation to
the lineup whether it lives up to the
hyper not will be determined very soon
