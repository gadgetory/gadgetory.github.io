aluminum of the HTC One m8 and the
unique look and feel it gives the device
but in its quest to broaden its device
offerings and also prove it's still not
a one-trick pony HTC is offering another
choice meet the one e8 a high-end
Android smartphone made of polycarbonate
and packing a few added features for the
global market we'll have a full review
up shortly but for now let's take a look
at the differences between these
flagships this is PocketNow I'm Michael
Fisher and this is H tc1 e 8 vs. HTC one
m8 this is one of those comparisons
that's almost entirely aesthetic because
HTC has done a pretty good job at
maintaining feature parity between these
smartphones the only significant changes
on the spec sheet are band to support
differences for various markets dual SIM
support in some v8 models and the
reduction in onboard storage and removal
of the IR transmitter on the e8 that
leaves out the biggest Hardware
difference the camera but we'll get to
that in a second looks may not be
everything but here they're the most
obvious difference between these phones
from the front everything looks about
the same here from the boomsound
speakers to the 5 inch full HD displays
to the 5 megapixel wide-angle selfie
cameras but move around to the sides and
let the metal versus plastic wars begin
the e8 is slightly thicker and less
massive than the m8 and while we love
the color palette of our electric
crimson review device its glossy finish
definitely lends it a more toy like feel
than it's aluminum counterpart it
accentuates fingerprints and smudges
much more readily and generally feels
cheaper than the m8
despite its unibody polycarbonate
construction fortunately HTC offers
different colors with matte finishes as
well so you do have a choice here and
the e8 dual curved design does make it
at least as comfortable in the hand even
though it does make tabletop use a bit
more wobbly some folks think the e 8s
camera automatically outclasses the m8 s
camera because of the mega pixel gap
which we grant you is signal
but the e8s camera is the same module
found in HTC's One mini two which has
faced off against the m8 in another
comparison and it didn't turn out too
well for the one mini two despite the
added resolution the same is true here
this has nothing to do with the MH duo
sensor whose faux bouquet photos can
easily be replicated with an app like
Google camera and we also don't think
many will care too much about the
downgrade in the LED flash rather this
is about color sharpness and low-light
performance all areas in which the m8
beats the pants off the e8 yes the e8s
photos are much higher in resolution so
if it's zoom ability or after the m8 is
not the choice for you but the e eights
photos are flat washed out and dull
while the metal machine offers much more
vibrant colors and sharper results
without crossing the line and looking
over processed the m8 also has the edge
over the e8 in shutter speed and
low-light performance is no contest
regardless of weather night mode is on
or off on either phone and finally the
m8 offers greater field of view so you
can fit more into each frame something
which surprisingly goes for the
front-facing camera as well we'll have
thoughts on the e8 s video performance
in our full review but the wide and
tight of the camera angle is this unless
you place resolution above literally
every other aspect of a smartphone
camera the One m8 is the superior choice
here the e8 does get a chance to shine
in other areas notably Wi-Fi reception
where it slightly edges out the m8 it's
also more comfortable to hold for longer
periods of intense gaming or other high
demand activities as the plastic shell
doesn't get nearly as hot as the m8
aluminum cladding and oddly the eh
display is also slightly easier to see
through sunglasses
if those seem like small distinctions
while they are and everywhere else from
voice quality good to battery life good
to the slick and responsive Android
build great the e8 and m8 are right on
par just as you'd expect from
smartphones which are supposed to be so
similar so if you already own a One m8
is the one I ate a device you should be
drooling over unless you really like
plastic over metal no we don't think so
from its industrial design to its camera
performance on the front and the back
we very much prefer the One m8 but the
e8 wasn't made to lure people away from
its metallic counterpart it was made to
deliver a similar experience at a lesser
price point and that it does quite well
as to how well it does on its own as a
complete package you'll have to wait for
our full review coming soon be sure you
don't miss it follow PocketNow on social
media and tune in for the PocketNow
weekly podcast this Friday at 2 p.m.
Eastern where we will have the HTC One
eh live with us on the air we'll be
answering your questions until next time
this has been Michael Fisher with
PocketNow thanks for watching and we'll
see you real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
