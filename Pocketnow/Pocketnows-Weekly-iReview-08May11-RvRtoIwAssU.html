works on your iPhone iOS 4.3 point 3
gets released so it's just a buck killer
that's already been jailbroken and Apple
explores the over-the-air updates for
iOS 5 all this and more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm high Meadow
iveta and welcome to the park and now I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
well iOS 4.3 point 3 just got released
which is iOS 4.2 point 8 for Verizon
customers though you guess that there
aren't any enhancements the only bug
killers that are included are the ones
that deal with Spygate so if you don't
want to be tracked you might as well
just go an update now well the only
reason this really made it to the cool
section is because well it got
jailbroken just a couple of hours later
and it is untethered jailbreak so happy
jailbreaking and well that's pretty much
it for the iOS update if you can call it
an update and well speed of jailbreaking
fun a new hacker community called
infinii dev team and yeah they're all
called dev team it's just announced that
they'll be releasing a CD alternative
called Lema which again will offer you
hacks and services to your iOS device
now why is this cool first of all it's
web-based so you don't require
downloading an application for to work
and second of all well it's really cool
to see that there is competition for
Cydia or that there will be because
things are getting kind of expensive in
cydia it's kind of ironic that some
hacks are actually more expensive than
applications in the App Store and while
the amazon cloud player was a lot of
news because of the fact that it beat
Apple to the fact that Apple was working
on bringing itunes to the cloud and
Amazon just did it out of the blue not
telling anybody about it now the tougher
luck was the fact that amazon shows to
only support android devices with an
application for android now kind of
interesting though is the fact that at
first it didn't work on iOS devices but
recently even though it tells you that
your browser is not supported just hit
continue and then you'll notice that a
lot the application or the service is
now working on your browser and well
it's kind of ironic considering that the
application for Android
currently only available in the US but
still I can actually upload music from
my itunes library to the amazon cloud
player service and play it on my iphone
when I'm not in the United States kind
of cool and well speed of competition
let's talk about two companies that are
making some interesting moves lately
first of all Microsoft which just
announced that their big maps is going
to be compatible with iOS devices in the
SDK this interesting because developers
are now going to be able to use bing
maps and services instead of google maps
which were all stuck on right now and
it's kind of cool because even though
people say that it's a wrong move from
Microsoft because they're competing with
iOS devices think about it Microsoft's a
software company even if they bring out
Windows Phone and Windows their core
business is software and there's no
point in them selling software if it's
not going to be compatible everywhere
second of all well room is just
announced that their blackberry
enterprise server is going to be
compatible with iOS devices meaning in
the past their enterprise server would
only work with blackberries and now it's
going to work with iOS devices and
possibly also Android now call it a
weird move from rim but yeah they're not
in the business of only selling phones
and if their devices are not relevant
anymore kind of a smart move to have iOS
be part of their deal because they're
CEOs out there everybody is using
iPhones now almost everybody now rumors
have Apple working on over-the-air
updates for Iowa spy which is cool
because everybody else can do it instead
of Apple but then again things aren't
that easy first of all iOS updates take
more than 500 megabytes so apples not
going to do that through 3g they'll most
likely use Wi-Fi which is not cool
because it totally defeats the purpose
of having an over-the-air update you can
have to do it on a hotspot or home and
it's going to take a year for that to
happen if you are moving around so why
not just use the pc and then well second
of all Apple could probably be
considering you know just giving you
fragments of updates to what requires an
update which can make the OS bigger and
taking storage away from your device and
then again also think about it backups
happen over the PC rumors have it that
Apple is not going to be bringing these
backups over-the-air so it's not going
to be an easy update if things go wrong
you're gonna have to go look for your pc
to get things working
so we're getting close to the
not-so-cool section so things are making
sense right
lepus it for the coolest continue on
with the not so cool if you're with us
on the list of people that are waiting
for Apple to release a next-generation
iphone in june or july well thanks for
getting kind of rocky in the past well
we have heard a lot of rumors but we
were still waiting for confirmation now
an ATT representative told a customer
over the phone that they do have
confirmation that apple will be pushing
the device to later not june july it
could be September for the ipod event
but again bad news not really sure what
to expect and well as funny as it may
sound the current debate out there is
whether the white iphone is thicker than
the black iphone and well a ruler says
that it is thicker Consumer Reports says
that it is thicker but then comes
Phillips sugar and says that it's not
that people are elucidating now first of
all find something better to the beta
fill I mean if a ruler and Consumer
Reports says that it is thicker just
accepted buddy you told everybody that
took so much for you to build the iphone
it made sense for it to be thicker so
why make it any worse with news anyways
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high Meadow
be leather armor to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
