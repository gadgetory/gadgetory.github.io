this season we've talked mainly about
hardware today we're going to bridge the
gap I'm Joe Levi with pocket now here's
what you need to know about the hardware
abstraction layer begin with this topic
is well let's just call it very geeky
it's an interesting concept to
understand but it's a concept that's
been deployed in various different ways
and different methodologies across the
various platforms from iOS to Android to
Linux windows and as/400 computers not
all of the terminology is a one-for-one
match but the concepts are trying to get
across today so if I say hardware
abstraction layer versus kernel level
versus device driver know that to a
certain extent in this context those
terms can be used interchangeably we'll
do that a little today in the video so
far we've talked primarily about
hardware and that's great because
hardware it's wide its varied there's a
lot of it and even when we're talking
about say an SOC there's a whole bunch
of stuff to consider today we're going
to talk not about software but the thing
that's in between the hardware
abstraction layer the API the drivers
the kernel no no those are not all the
same thing and I probably just made half
of you I may be your brains explode by
lumping them all together depending on
the platform that you're using this
hardware abstraction and we'll get to
that definition in just a minute this
hardware abstraction can happen at any
one of those different locations or a
few of them combined kind of confusing
so let's get into it
hardware is hardware it's physical
components it's stuff that you can look
at and see it's a chip it's an antenna
it's a screen it's a digitizer it's
tangible software on the other hand is
the stuff that we use we write code and
it makes stuff happen it has
instructions that tell that display I
want you to make
button that says this and looks like
this and put it right here when you push
on it it does this when you unhook it it
does that that's essentially a computer
programming in a nutshell there's a lot
more to it of course but that kind of
gives you the gist of things let's step
away from mobile technology just for a
minute and go back to kind of the
ancient days when we had das and we had
mainframes and we had a s for hundreds
if you wanted to write a program for
those environments you could write the
program but if you wanted it to do
anything you pretty much had to write
the driver interface yourself you want
to be able to print you've got to write
a lot of what that printer needs for
your software to say here's this letter
that I just wrote to mom and now I want
to translate that from dots on a screen
to dots on a printed page HP printers
well you had to talk to one way and all
of the other printers you had to talk to
another way and NEC printers were a
different way and every one was
different it's kind of a pain because if
you wanted to get a really good word
processor the developers that were
writing the code for that had to take a
good portion of their time and not make
a good word processor they had to write
print drivers so that you could print
the stuff out onto paper for thousands
upon thousands of pieces of hardware
doesn't sound very efficient right it
wasn't moving forward to today even in
computer technology we have this
abstraction layer so when I want to
print something I say file print there
send it off it translates all of that
stuff and puts it into the hardware into
a head moving across a page putting dots
down or putting toner down however it
may be and you get a printed sheet of
paper out the other side the driver
there is written in this case by HP HP
makes the driver for their printer so
that the word processing person doesn't
have to okay so let's come back over to
mobile technology
I'm gonna use Android as an example here
primarily because it suits the the
illustrative point but the same thing
applies to Windows Phone simply comply
some blackberry same thing applies to
Apple the reason I'm using Android is
there are a lot of people a lot of
different manufacturers that make
hardware for Android devices and Android
is kind of the one unified operating
system there's some differences in some
nuances and whatnot but let's pretend
for this example we have two different
pieces of hardware made by two different
companies let HTC and Samsung let's say
both of them running stock Android not
sense not touch with stock Android so
the operating system is quote identical
there are some nuances there but those
usually come in drivers in that hardware
abstraction in the kernel any one of
those places can do certain types of
hardware abstraction so now when I touch
the screen whatever hardware it is that
I have powering my screen capacitive
Hardware if I've got super LCD or AMOLED
or whatever kind of display I had to be
able to see it all of that has to come
through this translation layer
essentially as a developer I can say I
want a button to appear on the screen
that's this big this color says this
word and when I push on it it does this
that's all I have to do from there the
operating system says this is what a
button should look like and it talks to
the driver it talks to the screen and
says here put these dots here in this
configuration and listens for that touch
pad that touch input to feel my finger
press on that button and once that
happens it does something else entirely
and it goes on and does its own thing
the developer who put that button on the
screen doesn't have to know if your
capacitive or resistive or super LCD or
AMOLED it doesn't need to know any of
that because all that has been
removed to this separate layer an
abstract layer where you just have to
say give me a button that looks like
this and when I press it make it do that
beautiful now behind the scenes that
button may be saying report my GPS
location on the screen it's got all
these different pieces of hardware
behind that API that can find out where
you are from your altimeter to your
digital compass to Wi-Fi to help
triangulate your location to its
cellular to help you trying the other
your location to to GPS whether that's a
GPS or glass notes or anything else and
who knows what else we're going to get
in the future but all of those are made
by different manufacturers so you need
another layer to go out and get that
information translate it back pass it
back through the location API and back
into the app that's a lot of stuff
that's happening and if the person who
said I want to know where you are had to
write the code to do that for all those
tougher pieces of hardware their
software wouldn't be that great they're
spending all of that time at doing all
of this other work so that's really the
purpose of that hardware abstraction
layer again whether it's a hal proper or
drivers or api's or even in the kernel
or various combinations of all of them
the hal is becoming a much more abstract
concept it's becoming much more useful
much more powerful and its really what
enables us to bridge the gap from
hardware and software and brings the
whole thing together thank you very much
for watching if you liked the video and
think you learned something please give
it a thumbs up and if you want to make
sure you don't miss out on anything that
we're going to do in the future hit that
