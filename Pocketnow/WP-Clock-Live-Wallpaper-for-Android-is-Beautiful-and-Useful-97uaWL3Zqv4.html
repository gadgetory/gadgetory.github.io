pocket now calm in this video we're
going to show you a really cool live
wallpaper called WP clock it's useful
it's pretty and it doesn't take up a lot
of batteries so let's get to it okay so
WP clock shows you a bunch of
information in that type of the feel
like look and it's really cool right now
I've got a few things showing you I've
got the time here with a little 0 there
and it kind of flows off the screen
that's on purpose it's the look that's
trying to convey the day of the week the
date the battery percentage which just
went down to 33 to 32 my SSID and I'm
not connected to Wi-Fi so it says n/a
because there's no Wi-Fi and the year
and there's a lot you can change about
this by the way there's a free version
which is obviously free and then there's
a $1 version which gives you some
advanced functionality I definitely
think that the $1.00 version is worth it
so we're going to go into the settings
take a look at what you can actually
change so right over to settings and
over here in font you can start by
changing the opacity of the font if you
want to have some translucency you can
change the font color which is cool I
have it blue because here with the
Galaxy Nexus blue and black work very
well together very contrast II can also
turn on an outline if you'd like so you
can make an outline a little white
outline and the outline width you can
make it 2 pixels so let's actually see
what that looks like real quick so there
you go a white outline to add a little
bit more of contrast go to background
you can actually specify what image you
want to have in the background if you
don't like the solid color but I think
on an AMOLED screen if you have one of
the galaxies as our galaxy s2 or Galaxy
Nexus or a droid razr the black
background helps to save on battery life
so you can change the background you can
even have a slideshow run of your
favorite pictures you can change the
appearance here's where you turn on and
off the various things so I've got SSID
showing I'm gonna turn that off I can
have it say t-mobile for my operator and
have battery status on or off you can
even specify what the battery status
should say so I'm gonna make it say
juice because that sounds a lot colder
than that so we can see how much juice
we have and you can add a zero to single
digits as you saw it's at zero nine
for the time because it's nine o'clock
change the time format position a lot of
really cool stuff let's see what we have
so far okay so it says juice 32% it says
t-mobile at the top it says 913 without
the zero it's getting getting there kind
of don't like the outline so turn that
off got animation so we can specify if
you want an animation when you go from
screen to screen I like to keep all of
this off because what you get is a
stationary background that just kind of
hangs out back there and just shows you
information so you don't have to dive
into a battery widget to see your
battery you don't think on your calendar
to know what day of the month it is and
so on and so forth again it's called WP
clock we'll put a link in the
description so you can download the app
there's a $1 version than a free version
one of the coolest you've most useful
and and best of looking live wallpapers
that we've come across in a while if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
