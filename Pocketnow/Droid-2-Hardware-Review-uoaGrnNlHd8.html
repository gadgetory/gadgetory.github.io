pocket now calm and this is the hardware
review of the motorola droid 2 on
verizon let's get to it okay so before
getting into the characteristics of the
device let's talk about the
specifications it's running with a 1
gigahertz texas instruments omap
processor compared to a 550 megahertz
processor found on the droid 1 so you're
getting about double the clock speed
there you're also getting double the ram
so on the droid two you have 512
megabytes of RAM compared to 256
megabytes on the original droid inside
in terms of storage space you get 8
gigabytes and you also get an 8 gigabyte
micro-sd card although you can of course
expand that to 32 gigabytes so a lot of
storage on the droid 2 which is quite
nice you of 802 11 n assisted GPS the
camera is 5 megapixels with dual LED
flash although oddly it doesn't do HD
video it can only do 720 x 480 which is
technically 480p so let's take a look at
the hardware on the droid 2 first you
may be noticing a green blinking light
so you do get that green notification
light that let you know and you have new
emails very handy the screen is the same
size as the original droid 3.7 inches
and the resolution is 854 down by 480
across so that's the highest resolution
that Android can support and if you put
this device next to the droid x which
also has the same resolution but a much
larger screen the screen on the droid 2
looks a lot crisper because the pixels
are smaller you're packing the same
number of pixels inside of a smaller
area 3.7 inches compared to 4.3 in other
words the screen on the droid 2 looks
really really good really sharp up here
we have a proximity sensor a light
sensor no front facing camera and of
course the speaker down here we have the
standard Android buttons surrounded by
this nice kind of dark silvery chrome
that goes all around the screen it's
really attractive and if you turn the
device over you'll notice that it's
actually a dark blue it probably looks
black on the camera but the blue extends
on the sides and on the back if blue is
not your color then you're out of luck
you know it looks nice to see on a
device
has a lot of devices now are either
black grey or silver and not blue so
that is a pretty cool feature let's go
around the side here we have a micro USB
port with a charging indicator the
bottom is the microphone on the side is
the dough action camera button so you
can actually hold the phone like a real
camera then with the volume up and down
rocker and then we have the stand my
button and 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
now the camera as mentioned does not
take HD video oddly but it does take
photos at five megapixels has a dual
flash here to illuminate dark subjects
and let's flip off the battery see what
we have under there to kind of push down
and slide and here we have the battery
next to the 8 gigabyte microSD card
although you have to take out the
battery to access the card which is a
little bit annoying but most people
probably don't change their micro SD
card too often ok I'm going to pop that
back and let's talk about the keyboard
okay let's talk about the keyboard
because if you're interested in the
droid two you probably care a lot about
the hardware keyboard or else you would
have been looking at the droid
incredible or the droid x which of
course don't have the slide-out keyboard
so let's slide out the keyboard and what
you'll notice is that it's not spring
assisted like the original droid so you
can pause it in the middle or you can
sort of give it a little bit more effort
and it will open all the way not too big
of a deal although a lot of keyboards
from the windows mobile side our spring
assisted like on the HTC touch pro2 so
it's very handy to have anyway minor
Greg let's get to the keyboard now what
you'll notice about the droid two
compared to the droid one is that the
entire screen entire facade of the
device moves when you slide up in the
keyboard compared to the original droid
which left a little element a little
part where it's at verizon down here so
it kind of had a sidekick like look you
know the the t-mobile sidekick devices
but this is a new design and it's it's a
little cleaner and more simple and what
we have here is a wider keyboard because
they took away this d-pad to the right
which makes a lot of sense you really
don't need to occupy so much room for
the d-pad so instead now we have a
four-way arrow key here which you can
use for the same functions you can use
it to move the cursor around on the
screen or to scroll or what have you now
because the deep
has been removed the keyboard is wider
the keys are larger so those with large
hands or medium-sized hands will really
appreciate the larger key style also
different about the keyboard is that the
the layout of the keys aren't in a grid
now they're offset in a more natural way
not as natural and ergonomic as the
touch pro 2 but definitely an
improvement and the keyboard feels
pretty good especially with some
practice if you like a clicky keyboard
the droid 2 is not for you because the
keyboard go you can hear that doesn't
make that much noise when you type it's
kind of a little bit numb feeling but it
also won't bother people around you when
you're typing out a text message so if
you look closely you can see that the
keys are slightly raised not too much
though the numbers take place in the
upper row here instead of embedded
within the letters which can be annoying
so of course if you want to access one
you hold down alt and you press the
number we have a quick shortcut to the
voice command feature and that's really
all you get on the keyboard it's a very
simple keyboard without any keyboard
shortcuts or things like that which may
be a good thing for you now what's great
about the droid x and the original
droids that it's well balanced and it
has a good amount of weight so that when
I'm typing I'm rescuing my fingers here
behind the screen and it just feels good
it feels like a messaging device and
actually let's turn over to the back
here unfortunately this area back here
if you touch it enough it's going to
pick up a lot of fingerprints they used
a very very glossy plastic behind the
screen which is kind of silly but not
that big of a deal so that's the
keyboard definitely an improvement over
the original droid and it will appease
those who like to have a hardware
keyboard on their smartphone so if you
are a fan of the original droid and you
like the way the hardware looked on how
the hardware felt you're really going to
like to drew it too because it builds on
what made the original droid great again
if you want something sleek slimmer the
droid incredible and the droid x are
probably better solutions for you coming
up soon we're going to talk about the
software on the droid to see how fast it
is with froyo and the faster processor
and more RAM please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
