phone specifications get leaked the
first one plus one invite contest begins
but man the numbers are nuts and the HTC
One m8 Prime might bring some special
materials I'm high memory that I and my
personal trainer says that I shouldn't
drink for a full month and I'm gonna
fire the guy this is parking out daily
let's begin today with what's official
as Samsung officials are already talking
about the feature of biometrical
scanners for the company and the company
is considering bringing fingerprint
scanners to even very affordable
smartphones but aside from that they're
also talking about bringing retina
scanners and every other biometrical
scanner that they can in order to be in
front of everybody as obviously a touch
ID has proven to be much more popular
and reliable that with Samsung is
brought with the galaxy s5 let's see
what we bring now let's talk about
Microsoft in the surface pro 3 as for
those of you that didn't think that the
product was going to be announced
tomorrow apparently it is and we got
some leaked specifications and pricing
and we're talking about ranges between
eight hundred dollars and a styrene two
thousand dollars for a tablet yeah great
specifications and all licks inscription
full details but two thousand dollars
for tablet is crazy now let's talk about
HTC and it's HTC One m8 Prime aside from
any other crazy smartphone name
apparently the company is working on
bringing us something unique with this
phone aside from probable 2k
specifications on the display and other
specifications it seems that they are
bringing composite aluminum and even
liquid silicon to this thing so
obviously we have to wait for this to
happen we have no specifications on
dates but would be cool let's see what
we get now let's talk about Android
silver as we don't really know if we
should be talking about this as the
nexus 6 we have some first leaked
specifications of what to expect from
their first smartphone and apparently
we'll get the first 64-bit Snapdragon
810 processor powering this product
that's pretty much all the
specifications that we get so far
obviously it's kind of hard we still
don't know exactly if Google is going to
ditch the Nexus 6 or not are probably
the Nexus 6 will be part of Android
silver stay tuned for that
and finally for the news that have all
of us with mixed feelings today once
bless has just announced their first
contest for you to win a 64 gig 11 plus
one yeah I know the name is crazy but
still the company is going to have this
contest for the next four days where you
have to you know follow them on facebook
and do a couple of steps in order to be
eligible and they will choose a hundred
and fifty winners no I did not say 1500
or 15,000 i set a hundred and fifty
winners just 150 people could get this
phone which is crazy out of so much
demanded this company could be garnering
right now with this phone but you know
that leaves you the question of the day
do you think that this one plus one
launches a marketing stunt because
clearly a company has to make more than
150 phone something must be wrong here
