not like if we haven't seen the phone
already we get leaked images of the
front of the 1 + 5 t in addition to
teasers and the new quirk of the Google
pixel to excel seems to be audio I'm
Jaime Rivera and my schedule it has 10
videos this week so I apologize but I
don't think the daily will go live by
9:00 p.m. Eastern all week this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with good news if there is one
company that has caught a break this
year it is definitely a Nintendo with a
Nintendo switch up to the point where it
sold seven million units over seven
months which definitely is not breaking
records but it clearly has performed a
lot better than anything that Nintendo
has ever done after the Wii the point
being is that definitely the Nintendo
switch is probably one of my favorite
gadgets of the year though I have so
much work that I haven't been able to
start playing with Super Mario Odyssey I
need to make some time off now let's
talk about official and non-official
information those of you wondering what
the 1 + 5 t looks like there is a leaked
photograph of the front of the phone
fried none other than famous tipster
having blast so yeah that's pretty much
set in stone and we even have the
company CEO Carl Pei showing us a photo
of sort of a portrait shot I guess and
we can only assume that it comes from
the 1 + 5 t we can't wait to hear what
the improvements are now so about
Microsoft and an interesting patent that
we weren't expecting from the company
because it's no longer making
smartphones point being is that there is
a new way to bring back the headphone
jack to mobile devices though the idea
here is that the module will get smaller
with an expandable membrane whatever the
case may be whether this happens or not
we hope that companies pick up on it as
a I don't think the worst news of 2017
have been anything but the lack of a
headphone jack and speaking of bad news
now it seems that people are complaining
about the Google pixel 2 XL and its
speakers and I'm gonna add myself to the
list interesting enough the speakers on
this device are so loud that there comes
a point where you have to drop the
volume in order to avoid the store ship
because they do distort now keeping
the original Google pixel had distortion
as well so I guess I'm just used to it
it's just funny how many problems the
pixel to Excel is having apparently
there was a software update to fix that
very soon and finally the very
interesting news today to a certain
degree disappointing as well are the
fact that Apple has just fired an
engineer for allowing his daughter to
film a hands-on of the iPhone 10 and
this is weird I mean it was a full vlog
that she posted and in addition to that
she went to the Apple campus with her
dad that worked at Apple and filmed that
he had an iPhone 10 and he allowed her
to use it for the video because well if
you think about it well everybody has
already seen the iPhone 10 a hands-on
videos are already out there so it makes
no sense in the world for any reason why
he got fired for this but definitely it
seems that this is an Apple policy that
leads me to the question today do you
think that Apple overreacted with this
or do you think that hey it's a rule and
the engineer should have just followed
in my case man just having somebody
fired for something like this like
seriously I mean do that whenever your
phone is cylinder embargo but anyways
