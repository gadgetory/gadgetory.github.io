about today's SmartWatch is is that once
their batteries run out they're pretty
much useless now what happens if a
company approaches things differently
and offers you a SmartWatch that you
don't need to recharge I'm Jaime better
with pocket now here at MWC 2015 in
Barcelona and let's talk about cocido
Hong kong-based cachito is actually not
new to the SmartWatch game and neither
are some of their products still we
couldn't avoid our geek curiosity and
understanding how this company manages
to sell you a fashionable SmartWatch
that you don't have to recharge starting
with the basics this company is very
clear in the fact that this is a watch
first above everything in a SmartWatch
second so fashionable design and
materials and even color options are
what you see most at their booth you can
replace the 22 millimeter watchbands
just like you can with every regular
watch and it even sports an analog
display just like every regular watch as
well it's even powered like a regular
watch where you don't really have a
rechargeable battery pack and it doesn't
even include a charging module all you
have to replace as a cr2032 battery
every six to nine months through a
stainless steel coin module at the
bottom what makes this a SmartWatch is
that it does support bluetooth LE
connectivity to any iOS 7 or above
device or any Android 4.3 device or
above the internal portion of the
display is actually a black and white
liquid crystal at the top and it also
includes icons for mail messaging phone
calls calendar and even smart phone low
battery notifications at the bottom if
you get a phone call the phone icon at
the bottom lights up and the SmartWatch
will either vibrate or beep depending on
your settings and the caller ID is shown
at the top display similar functionality
works with calendar appointments
messaging and others but the secret to
keeping a six to nine month battery life
is by limiting the amount of information
that's transmitted between the watch in
your smartphone so what you'll see on
the display is fairly limited the
display later gives you options for dual
time display or just your current time
in a digital format
the functionality works through an iOS
or Android application with a bevy of
customizable options from what the
buttons on the sides will do to giving
you the ability to control your music so
even triggering the camera and even
finding your smartphone or finding the
watch a recent update being demoed here
at MWC is their new activity tracking
service which is also part of the
application and which gives you your
step count among other fitness tracking
information so yes this definitely is
not a pebble nor an Android wear device
but for those of you searching for a
fashionable watch with added
functionality like the Martian notifier
that we reviewed recently but in a
better way we could say this is actually
a very competitive option there are
various models already on sale with
prices ranging between $200 and 129
depending on the configuration you
choose and trust me we can't wait to get
a review unit to test everything out
because yes six to nine months of no
battery recharging has a some peace of
mind included for now this is high
memory that I will pocket now here at
MWC 2015 in Barcelona
