handheld computer communicator sensor
device like the tricorders on Star Trek
The Next Generation
and while smartphones have done a good
job on the computing and communicating
ends of that spectrum they've left
something to be desired on the sensor
front until now I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is a quick look at
the seek thermal camera for Android
smartphones somebody's gonna say it so
I'll say at first this isn't the most
timely video in fact the hardware I'm
working with here is last generation but
I asked to borrow one they sent me one
to borrow and it was just too cool not
to do so if there's enough interest in a
follow-up I'm happy to ask for the new
seek thermal XR let us know in the
comments whether you'd be stoked for
such a thing
the seek thermal hardware is a tiny
peripheral that comes in both Android
and iPhone compatible versions ours is
the former it comes in a waterproof
carrying case and plugs into your
smartphone using micro USB unfortunately
that means if your phone uses an
unconventional location or orientation
for its USB port you're gonna be in for
a weird time it'll be pointing right at
you fortunately there are adapters
available to fix this if you've got a
galaxy s6 se or a moto X you're good to
go
plug the camera in download the seek
thermal app from the Play Store and the
next thing you know you're seeing the
world through the eyes of a t800 or a TR
590 if you get either of those jokes you
can be my friend the seek thermal
viewfinder is a lot like that of a
typical smartphone shooter the picture
dominates the screen with the shutter
release and toggles for camcorder
gallery and shooting mode select down
below the picture itself is just what
you'd expect a false color
representation of the thermal spectrum
within the camera's 36 degree field of
view wander around taking thermal
pictures and you can hear the hardware
quietly clicking away as it
automatically recalibrate in addition to
the simple color map you can also set
the camera to constantly display the
temperature around the center of the
frame or show the extreme highs and lows
in a shot or show only temperatures
above a certain threshold yes you can
choose Celsius or even Kelvin if you
like this makes it a pretty good
stand-in for a dedicated thermometer and
a pinch but the seek thermal didn't
always agree with our in
house infrared thermometer so if it's
absolute precision you need well to be
honest I didn't have a third thermometer
to cross-check so you may want to do
some calibration yourself there's also a
dual camera mode that displays both
thermal and visual outputs in the same
frame sadly because the seek lens will
be so far away from the standard camera
on most phones you're gonna run into
aspect problems with close-up shots
making this more novelty than anything
to be sure there are plenty of practical
uses around the house like determining
if your coffee is too hot to drink or
your cells or is close to freezing
seeing what's running hot in your home
entertainment system or determining just
how warm your smartphone gets when it's
on the charger but being able to see
beyond the visual spectrum also opens up
your perspective in a very cool way I
mean there's the obvious if you think a
camera flash makes your cat's laser eyes
creepy check her out in infrared and yes
you can see in the dark as you can see
here in this pitch-black bathroom go
beyond that and you start to learn some
cool lessons about the world around you
for instance glass windows reflect IR
even when it's too bright outside to see
a visual reflection with your eyeball
you're invisible shadow is still
bouncing off the glass and can be seen
by the seek your thermal signature
stretches back in time to look how much
heat is left on a chair after you get up
from it ever wonder how hot a candle
flame gets how about the water heater
and furnace in your basement and if it's
just cool photos or videos you're
looking for toss something in the
freezer for a while then bring it out
into the world to make some crazy
infrared artwork you're limited only by
your imagination and you can share your
creations on seikhs dedicated social
community to be sure there are
limitations here exported photos are
only about half a megapixel and
resolution and their water marked by
default unfortunately you can turn this
off in the settings also the camera
takes its power from your phone battery
so you'll want to watch your power
consumption finally even this last gen
hardware comes in at $249 while it's
understandable given how much tech there
is in such a tiny package it's still
pretty steep for an accessory
that said it's an accessory that brings
my smartphone a little bit closer to
being the tricorder I've always wanted
it's really conducive for gotten lessons
about heat exchange and it's let me see
the world in a new way
whether that's worth the price tag will
be up to you to decide personally I'd
wait for the price to come down before
snatching one up for myself but if
you're looking for thermal imaging on
Android it's pretty much the only game
in town at least at this size and yeah
I'm gonna say it I think it's pretty hot
wacka-wacka let us know how you'd use
the seek thermal camera drop a comment
below and give us a thumbs up if you
enjoyed this video until next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
captain to phones on Twitter and I'm hot
blooded check it and see I've got a
fever of a hundred and three all right
that's enough thanks for watching see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
