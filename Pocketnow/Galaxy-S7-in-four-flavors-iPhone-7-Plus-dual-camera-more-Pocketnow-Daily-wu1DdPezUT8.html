galaxy s seven variants get rumored for
a launch Apple might consider the option
of dual cameras with the iphone 7 plus
we have more expansion rumors on the LG
g5 I'm hi meri behna and let's continue
playing along how about if you take a
shot of vodka / every time that I say
but then again this is bogging out daily
the official news today begin with
Samsung those of you interested in the
Samsung gear s2 and it's either rose
gold or platinum variants well we've got
some price points that are not
necessarily nice you'll be paying
apparently four hundred fifty dollars
according to the recent listing that we
found on amazon and to make matters
worse you'll have to wait two months for
that watch just in time for the Apple
watch to write Samson and when it comes
to other oddities in the mobile space we
recently heard of mr. Joe Belfiore a aka
the mastermind of windows 10 mobile and
Windows Phone 8 Windows Phone 7 etc
using an iPhone and in his response to
Twitter very kindly he said number one
he's on leave of absence and he will be
for the next few months and number two
he would have loved to be using a palm
pre instead and we don't blame him we
loved that phone as well but yeah see
that they're testing new waters or
probably his leave of absence means
other things and then moving the
spotlight over to the phones that make
headlines for mwc we know the g5 is
going to be one of them we've heard that
the company is planning as many as two
flagships this year the g5 or whatever
name they're going to give this phone
for mwc and we continue to hear from
more trusted sources that we will be
getting expandability there are major
design changes with this phone but
apparently there will be a slot to
remove the battery and expandable
storage at the bottom of the phone this
will be major innovation we can't wait
to see this phone in the flesh you bet
we will be covering it live at mwc
whenever it happens and now let's
continue talking about the iphone 7 now
we hear some very interesting rumors
regarding the phone's camera mainly if
we talk about the plus variant
Apple has differentiated the plus
bearing when things like optical image
stabilization ever since the iphone 6
plus and it seems that now we are
getting either of two things either a
dual camera which is what we hear in
rumors and the other sources claim that
we're getting a zoom lens that will
enable you to somehow bring optical zoom
somehow we've seen patents for this and
it could just be that there will be dual
cameras that enable Apple to give you
this feature so stay tuned as it seems
that the company wants to differentiate
this phone a lot more but you know what
the very hot news today are back to
Samsung and the Galaxy s7 we are just
stays away from mwc and we hear that
we're not just getting one nor two but
either three or four variants of the
galaxy s7 we've heard about the regular
variant we've heard about a possible
edge variant that's the same size as
that then we've heard about the 5.5 inch
edge variant tablet and we also hear
about the galaxy s7 plus which could be
a flat device that looks a lot like the
galaxy s7 or note 5 without the s pen
sort of speak it's really hard to
predict exactly what we're getting but
it leads me to the question of today if
you have to pick from either of these
four variants which one would you take
in my case I would go for the 5.5 inch
edge variant of the galaxy s7 so long as
the changes are major when compared to
the galaxy s6 edge+ and before I get a
tongue twister here leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know what you
would pick friends as always you know
the drill if you want to get the news
