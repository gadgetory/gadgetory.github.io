we're taking the newest or current
cameras of each phone ecosystem to see
which company produces the best photos
and videos I'm Juan Carlos bag now for
pocket now and it's time for a good
old-fashioned grudge match an Android
and iPhone and a Lumia walk into a bar
and I don't have a good ending for that
joke while we're prepping to tackle the
lg g5 we thought it would be fun to take
a look at the current state of
smartphone cameras the galaxy s7 is the
new kid on the block the iPhone 6s is
Apple's current flagship and the SE will
likely perform similarly and we're
rounding out this test with the
megapixel monster lumia 950 and before
we get a ton of comments complaining
about how we should have picked
different phones or waited for new
phones to come out we got to start
somewhere we will get to LG g5
comparisons Nexus comparisons note 6 and
iPhone 7 comparisons when those phones
are actually released now first a little
housekeeping this trio represents the
smaller sized flagship from each
respective company all three shoot
native four by three aspect ratio frames
the iPhone and Galaxy both have 12
megapixel sensors while the Lumia saves
a 19 megapixel image the Lumia sensor is
the largest at 1-over two point four
inches with the Galaxy a close second at
one over 2.5 and the iphone a much
smaller third place with a 1/3 inch
sensor to keep things fair we're
sticking with stock camera apps and the
JPEGs delivered directly from each phone
so we'll see what each manufacturer has
chosen to focus on for producing
pleasing images starting with outdoor
brightly lit shots we instantly run into
a small issue with the Lumia 950 there's
a lot of image processing happening here
and Microsoft is warming up the color
quite a bit more than what the scene
really calls for Apple is warming the
scene up a little too but it's closer to
reality Samsung actually lands the
happiest balance between i pleasing
saturation white balance hue and an
accurate depiction of the scene another
bright light test using UHD video and
with a red subject in the landscape
shows similar results from lumia to
Apple to Samsung we go from warmest
color tone to the most accurate
moving to a shaded shot the Lumia 950
surprisingly swings the coldest apple
remains in the middle and Samsung stays
the warmest reality is somewhere in
between the iPhone in the galaxy s7 both
landing on either side of the balance
between warm California Sun and cool
shade we like to keep the lighting in
our homes comfortable and this is an
area where the galaxy s7 ekes out a
victory producing the brightest image
the lumia follows in second with a
dimmer image but a little less smudging
from noise reduction and the iPhone
trails with the darkest shot and the
smudgy estoy reduction especially when
pixel peeping but night shots are where
the galaxy s7 absolutely excels we see
noticeably brighter images over the
iPhone 6s and they tend to be less noisy
than images from the Lumia though it
produces the dimmest images at night the
iPhone showed the least amount of
distortion or chromatic aberration look
at the uniform brightness of the
streetlamp
the Lumia came second though you can see
some flaring and some color fringing
issues with chromatic aberrations
Samsung's lens on our review unit
distorted the most and the wide aperture
contributes to even more aberration
looking at a zoom cropped test the Lumia
950 scores a win but not by as much as
the numbers might lead you to believe
matching the view on the galaxy there's
more sharpening going on but it's not
losing by as significant a margin in
pixel level detail as we would have
expected the iPhone is a little more
honest in its reproduction and doesn't
rely on as much sharpening but it still
performs fairly well here too falling
only slightly behind the Samsung for
video zoom shooting UHD clips Samsung
and Apple will both push well beyond the
resolution of their respective sensors
Microsoft on the other hand prevents you
from zooming into image degradation
territory but that doesn't leave you
much room to get closer to your subject
at night the Lumias resolution
advantages are minimized further still
as we have to incorporate more noise
reduction all three cameras see
significant image degradation and the
iPhone is the poorest performer of the
pack moving to ultra low light
situations both the Lumia and Samsung
are able to lock focus here in almost no
light
we're we're unable to tell if the iPhone
ever does properly lock on to the
subject as its continuously hunting
through this test of course for a
situation like that we should be using a
flash and all three phones perform
pretty well surprisingly the galaxy with
only one led doesn't seem to be trailing
that much behind the iPhone or Lumia
using two and three LEDs respectively
the iPhone had the most difficulty
focusing but ended up with a brighter
image than the galaxy the Lumia again
exaggerates color but if shooting with
rich capture on you are able to
manipulate how much of the flash to use
this is the only time you can reliably
deliver multiple exposures but we'll
talk about that more in the HDR section
for colour reproduction the iPhone finds
the happiest balance between lighting
and subjects this gate is lit by a
really ugly orangish yellow security
light Samsung is varying a bit more gold
than what this scene really looks like
and Microsoft absolutely nails the white
of the gate but almost entirely ignores
the lighting information just for
reference this scene looks more like
this in real life it was an
uncharacteristically windy day in LA
while shooting so we couldn't deliver
great audio samples but on the whole the
Lumia will offer up better audio in most
situations
Samsung follows in second with more
aggressive noise reduction dulling the
nuances of a scene and Apple lands last
as it still only produces a mono audio
track for video which is supremely
disappointing for a flagship phone a
macro performance takes an interesting
turn getting up close to a small subject
Apple smaller sensor and smaller
aperture is more forgiving and produces
a longer depth of field making sure
these flowers are in focus the Lumia
follows close behind the larger sensor
producing a shallower depth of field
lastly on the galaxy with a large sensor
and widest aperture has such a
razor-thin
plane of focus that these flowers look a
bit softer hazy in my not so humble
opinion the galaxy produces the most
pleasant bouquet followed by the Lumia
and the iPhone produces the busiest blur
objects in the background of your photos
will be more identifiable and can be
more distracted looking at focusing
performance Apple is the slowest of the
bunch and occasionally missed the ball
to focus on the tree or bench behind the
ball a Lumia was quicker to move back
and forth between these two objects but
the galaxy s7 absolutely smokes the
other two with the fastest focus lock
and react juez ition we've ever seen on
a phone moving to HDR the iPhone still
reigns for the best image processing not
only does Apple find more info and
shadows we also see them rain in details
in highlights Android HDR is really more
of a shadow brightening mode and
highlights are more likely to clip the
Lumias rich capture mode is only in
automatic mode and almost never triggers
a true multiple exposure in fact looking
at the incredible amount of image
processing applied to every photo we
think HDR style color processing might
be applied to every shot regardless of
the rich mode is activated or not
another fun feature slow motion video
Apple continues to dominate with the
smoothest output and fewest drop frames
Samsung and Microsoft battled to
something of a tie here the image is
crisper on the galaxy s7 but the Lumia
slow-motion produces one of the coolest
matrix style speed ramps we've ever seen
nearly stopping time before sliding back
to speed
lastly looking at camera apps the iPhone
has the most familiar setup for any
phone as it's changed very little over
the years that's good for consistency
but there are some frustrating aspects
to controlling things like video
resolution which requires you to leave
the camera app and head to the phone
settings controls like HDR and flash are
slightly more difficult to use as the
option pops out tiny pieces of text on
your viewfinder and while there's a
whole separate mode for shooting square
photos there isn't one to crop
widescreen which is just silly in the
year 2016 the windows phone camera app
is terrifically elegant it can be as
simple as a shutter and flash controls
or a quick slide pops out manual
controls for users to operate happily
additional settings don't require you to
leave the camera app nor do they
completely block your viewfinder it
could use a little updating though as
options like white balance or slow to
respond and don't offer the flexibility
found on newer Android devices Samsung's
app is the busiest of the bunch but
still offers a reasonably simple auto
mode and fantastic controls for people
who like to dig deep so let's wrap this
up between these three we see an
excellent representation of the pros and
cons of comparing different imaging
solution looking only at the camera and
not the rest of the phone attached to
that camera our rankings overall placed
the iPhone in third place the Lumia 950
and second and the galaxy s7 wins the
day the iPhone offers very consistent
color processing a best-in-class HDR
mode and super smooth slow motion but
represents the worst-performing flagship
for low-light situations and the slowest
focusing performance the sensor size and
optics onboard also deliver the least
photographic stills especially when
looking at depth of field and bokeh the
Lumia 950 will better satisfy resolution
junkies audio files and has a tack sharp
lens
they'll this app is ageing poorly
opposite competitors image processing is
difficult to control and offers the
least accurate representation of most
scenes plus we didn't even do a panorama
comparison because this phone's camera
app just doesn't have that option
included now the galaxy s7 displays the
weakest macro performance of the bunch
and more aberration in night photos but
otherwise demonstrates a terrific
balance between light and resolution in
almost all shooting conditions the
galaxy s7 takes the lead for
yeah but it soon faces the LG g5 now
we're sure you have thoughts on this
comparison so drop us some comments
below and hopefully we can get into some
fun debates as always thanks for
