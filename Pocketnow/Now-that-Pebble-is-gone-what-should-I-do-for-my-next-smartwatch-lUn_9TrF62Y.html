pebble is properly dead and we have word
from the company as to what's going on
for all of us folks who have pre-orders
that have still yet to ship on devices
like the pebble time - in the core for
fans of this brand it is a sad sad turn
of events after about a week of
speculation pebble finally posted on
their official blog that the company is
being bought out by Fitbit and that the
DNA of the pebble brand is going to live
on in servicing the future Fitbit
products and that blog post answered two
critical questions what's going to
happen with the pebbles that have just
recently shipped and what's going to
happen with the pebbles that have yet to
ship the company is being dismantled so
quickly that if you recently acquired a
pebble you might not be able to get it
properly refunded
according to pebbles blog post only
refunds processed before December 7th
are really going to be eligible for that
full refund we don't have proper
confirmation yet on anyone who might be
looking to return their pebble past that
date and if you have a Kickstarter or a
pre-order that is yet to ship all
refunds should start being processed by
December 16th of this year always super
Exim that they can take money from my
credit card nearly instantaneously but
processing a refund can take up to ten
business days and for those of us who
are still using pebble hardware
functionality should be maintained for
the immediate future though they say at
some future point the features that are
more server side on your pebble will
probably start to go away they are
looking at ways to maintain some of that
functionality
maybe localizing it more to your phone
or to the watch itself but they don't
have any hard confirmation on what's
going to keep working and what's going
to get the ax and lastly as the final
twist of the knife there's no more
warranty support sure if you're having
an issue you can go to some help forums
and some third-party companies have been
stocking pebble replacement parts but
for the most part if your pebble goes
Bork you're pretty much done I've been a
big fan of pebble smartwatches I
routinely Rock my pebble time in a lot
of our videos this is the worst possible
way for this company to be acquired by
another entity and then being dismantled
right in front of our eyes personally
this move is aggravating it completely
leaves me in the lurch
I really don't
what to do have this pretty bad habit of
picking losers products that I get
really passionate about case in point
the quad come talk I was a huge fan of
this watch but I had to properly retire
this year as it was becoming more and
more evident that Qualcomm was not going
to continue supporting this device not
providing it with new features and
support for other apps was becoming
woefully slim never could get it to
properly work with Google Hangouts not
that that'll matter in the future with
Google trying to devalue hangouts now
this watch properly started me off on a
conversation about outdoor viewable
displays and really long battery life
even near the end of its run on my wrist
I could still count on a solid four to
five days on a single charge and living
in an area of the country which gets a
lot of sunshine having a display which
is easy to read in bright light with
that super long battery life is a huge
benefit the pebble has always been a
part of my device strategy for similar
reasons but it wasn't until the pebble
time and the colored display technology
that's on this watch that I really felt
I could properly let go of my Qualcomm
talk and this is what totally sucks
about finding solutions for your own
personal use and then watching the rest
of the tech industry sort of overlook
things that are important to you it's
not that I haven't tried other
smartwatches I've been in the game since
the very beginning I've got a Martian
around here somewhere but I've got a
Huawei watch I've got my first
generation asu's n watch I've got
numerous gears including the gear s2 I
may took the gear s3 I've played with
numerous fitness trackers like fitbit's
and Microsoft bands and I'm wearing a
misfit but nothing is really tapped into
the feature set that I enjoy from my
pebble in trying to anticipate consumer
responses we start taking some things
for granted and then act like that some
kind of objective truth or that we
shouldn't ever have to accept any kind
of compromise even though every single
gadget we pick up is a series of
benefits and compromises and for every
time I see an editorial or someone
writing a review about the pebble time
and oh the washed out colors on the
screen you should use an LCD or AMOLED
display the pebble became the perfect
complement to my phone my phone looks
amazing indoors I don't need two screens
that look awesome inside but I drive
around a lot in California and so while
an ePaper e-ink I can never remember
or what type of display the original
pebble had in black and white is useful
and it's really easy and clear and high
contrast to read outdoors when I'm
driving it's nice to be able to just see
a little blue pop from my watch for an
alert a little red pop for an alert from
my watch a little green pop those little
green pops are text messages maybe those
are more important than the little blue
pops or the little red pops I was more
aware of what was happening in my
digital sphere of influence because of
the color display on the pebble without
it distracting overly from the task at
hand namely operating a motor vehicle I
was happy to accept the compromise of a
watch face which just looked okay
indoors for something that looked
incredible in direct sunlight and
provided multiple days of battery life
on a single charge without ever having
to play that trick of turning the watch
screen offer dimming it to a point that
I couldn't read what was on the display
I'm just really disappointed in pebble
IP going to Fitbit just not as
interested in a Fitbit fitness tracker
and I'm hoping that what we'll see is a
proper Fitbit watch I totally be willing
to give Fitbit a shot there and and I
hope we do see some cool hardware but in
the meantime I'm proper stock I'm not
really quite sure where to turn to next
years ago before I was a member of this
PocketNow team I tried an experiment
where I completely muted my phone and I
relied on a Martian to give me all of my
notifications and alerts from that first
experience with the Martian I have never
turned the volume or ringer back up on
my phone because of smartwatches my
phone will never interrupt a
conversation and I refuse to look at my
phone unless I know I'm looking at it
for a purpose if it buzzes or beeps I'm
not going to sit there and obsessively
check notifications until I know there's
something worthy of my attention in my
notification tray and that really seems
to bother a number of people who watch
our reviews because I'm not often
clearing out my notifications especially
while I'm shooting those reviews man
seeing all those little tiny icons are
really seems to piss some people off I
still like my qua way watch this will
probably be what I turn to for my
Android wear experience until at least
some newer Android wear devices come
along I've never been the biggest fan of
Samsung gears I totally understand why
some people like that smart phone on a
wrist experience but for me
I like a watch to be serving me little
pieces of at-a-glance information that
then I can choose to delve into further
the more I feel like I'm navigating
screens and swiping and dialing and
stuff more I feel I should really just
be doing this interaction from a proper
phone I'll personally be looking to
explore this topic more over the next
year is I just try to figure out what my
own Smart Watch strategy is going to be
and I know there are some couple fans in
our audience we're probably in the same
boat what are you guys thinking right
now pebble is dead are you going to move
to Android where are you looking at an
Apple watch you're looking at some sort
of third party or hybrid solution like
what Scoggin and the fossil group are
doing with purely analog notification
systems drop us a comment down below
this video I'm really curious to hear
your thoughts on the matter because
it'll probably help point me in the
right direction for what I'm going to do
as always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
more rambling vloggy videos like these
and help us out some sharing on your
favorite social networks for PocketNow
i'm juan carlos Bagnall some gadget guy
on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next video as a
quick tangent you guys in the comments
are always talking about how critical I
am of different technologies but if you
want to see true tech optimism this is
Mike welcome talk charger and you can
see I still have the inserts from when
Qualcomm was talking about their truly
wireless earbud technology that would
charge in the same cradle as the talk
but ultimately proved to be vaporware I
still believed I still held on to it I
wanted it to be real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
