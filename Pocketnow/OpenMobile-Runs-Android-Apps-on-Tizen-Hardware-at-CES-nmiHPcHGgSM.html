calm still here at CES 2013 in Las Vegas
here at the Open Mobile booth this is a
lot of fun we stumble across this quite
by accident on our way between things
Open Mobile is a firm that is developing
something really really amazing and
that's the ability to run android apps
or apps from much larger app ecosystems
on much smaller platforms
the possibilities include things like
webos things like the Tizen things like
sailfish seems like Mozilla Firefox and
ubuntu mobile and it go on and on so i'm
here with kevin and with lee left from
open a mobile we're going to show us I I
believe it's the Android version of
angry birds is that correct right
running on Tizen lunchbox hard here
right so this is a prototype device that
was given out by Samsung quite a while
ago with reported our product ACL onto
it and ACL allows android apps thrown on
other operating systems in this case
Tizen so I'm going to fire up Angry
Birds
you can see it's an android app to the
shortcut yep there's a soft keys this is
a super prototype phone so prepare with
the glitch is a little bit but it it's a
place pretty well this is just to be
clear this is the Android versions the
Angry Birds written for Andrew it but
not running on an android of correctness
actually perfectly amazing soup there's
an intro video that we don't mind that
he's not a good player of this game as
you can see and there are things that
are they technically I need to be ironed
out like hardware acceleration on
various devices I'm sure and yeah so we
do have it we do support full graphics
and media framework an arbiter
acceleration and not on this device
because it's just not available but I
was sure to ask before whether we were
running in some kind of emulators and
like that run in an old some kind of
sandbox I right to the right to the
hardware so we're talking directly those
sensors support officers rotation GPS
nfcu narrator the way that we've
developed our product is that we've
really tightly integrated it with the
target operating system so while you
might see other folks out there that
have run android on other operating
systems there are no other folks out
there that have done it in the way that
we realized the target operating system
run and our apps will run within that
frame this is the Tison application
manager you can see through this what we
just write it takes axilla ties it up it
just answers like a native n exactly we
believe that that's sort of the
experience of the device is that you
want to run into shouldn't care i just
want to absolutely right what a loser
shouldn't care about what the app would
is underlined what's driving the app
experience well that's fascinating we
obviously there's a lot we can't talk
about here but they're the future for
this that you guys are in our speaking
tour or thinking about speaking to you
obviously OMS and manufacturers and
things of that sort is very any new
device operators out there that are
launching a new device or a new platform
and
would like to be talking to them that is
big stuff and exciting stuff and we
thank you very much for speaking with us
would thank you gotta stay tuned for a
lot more on this and a lot more from CES
2013 michael fisher pocket now thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
