better seller than its predecessors
carrier leaks put some rumors to rest in
the case of the iphone success and more
android wear offerings are coming very
soon I'm high-mettled iveta wondering
why today has been harder it could be
because yesterday was lik day at the gym
this is parking out daily the official
news today start with HCC there is no
better time to buy an HTC One m9 as the
company is not only offering its o
protection plan but you can also get a
hundred dollars off or a hundred dollars
of credit in Google Play Store which is
great so buy an HTC One m9 and then you
can use those hundred dollars in
applications music or whatever good news
but it won't last for long I'll sorry
about the galaxy note 5 and galaxy s6
edge+ we've got good and bad news on the
positive front well it seems that it's
selling far more than it did in the past
Korean carriers are saying that it's
selling a lot more units now which is a
great start but the sad news is that
people are already complaining that
they're having issues with the s-pen
when tucked in backwards we still don't
understand why it could have been tucked
in backwards but buyers beware let's
will this fallout over to Apple is a
China Telecom representative has just
come on record to give us good and bad
news regarding the iphone 6s rumors
first of all the good thing is that most
of the rumors we've heard are the same
it's the same design with better
specifications which is great but the
problem is that apparently there will
not be a rose gold option or it seems
that it is not on their radar initially
then the baits were pretty much
confirmed soap stay tuned for that and
even though we were very disappointed
because of the lack of an Android wear
update at Google i/o or new hardware it
seems that we've got a ton of OEMs that
are preparing for Aoife seems that the
new Moto 360 in addition to a huawei
offering and a sous offering and even an
LG update to the watch urbane LTE that
will now run Android wear are things
that could happen in Eva we obviously
don't have a confirmation yet but we
will be covering the show for and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day depending on how you view it
we've got leaks on the price points of
the two variants of the new mode
360 because yeah apparently there will
be a smaller one at a larger one and
listen to this price points begin at
three hundred and thirty dollars for the
smaller variant and almost three hundred
ninety dollars for the larger one which
is just twenty dollars less than either
Apple watch variant depending on which
one you pick so this is really
interesting it seems that the new Moto
360 will be extremely pricey up to the
point where yet you would have to pick
between that or the Apple watch what
does lead me to the question of the day
what do you think about these probable
price points would it make you want to
buy a moto 360 update or when you think
that it would be better to just stick
with an Apple watch in my case oh I love
the Moto 360 but it just gives you more
reason to buy the current barian for 150
bucks leave us a comment down below what
do you think friends as always you know
the drill if you want to get the rose
earlier before this video is filming a
photo was on Parker now calm subscribe
