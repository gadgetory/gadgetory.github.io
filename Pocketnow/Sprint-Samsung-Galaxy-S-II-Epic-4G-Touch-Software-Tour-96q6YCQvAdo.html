pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look at the software on the
samsung galaxy s2 epic 4g touch for
sprint so sit back relax and enjoy the
show so let's start off with the lock
screen it's not a normal slide to unlock
like I prefer it's this picture unlock
so you have to drag the picture off the
screen to unlock it and if you're used
to being able to swipe very quickly it
doesn't tends to get stuck so you have
to make a concerted effort to make sure
that you just swipe it all the way off
the screen the first world problem
obviously so and then we move into the
TouchWiz application which the samsung's
default UI and frankly it's very quick
and normally I like to replace the UI
very quickly but this has been
outstanding and if you tap and hold on
the numbers down here the dots you can
actually slide back and forth very
quickly between the screens to choose
which page you're going to be on you can
also add pages if you like so you can
add more icons to your screen if you so
choose to move an icon around on the
screen you tap and hold and then you can
slide it back and forth will show you
another method here in a few minutes
which is kind of a neat functionality of
this particular device the app drawer
has the ability to be sorted view type
you can do a customizable grid and then
lay out the apps as you see fit at
alphabetical grid or an alphabetical
list so that you can kind of slide back
and forth here between the apps in the
alphabetical grid list and the
customizable grid this when you move to
the and restart the beginning you swipe
backwards or forwards respectively you
actually move right through the apps
again so no moving to the end and then
stopping then scrolling all the way back
to be able to get to your previous app
which I really do enjoy if we go into
the display then there is a screen mode
here and I've noticed on some people's
comments
this particular device they complain
that the skin tones are to read if you
have it in dynamic mode you can see that
change there it does make the Reds much
more bright and brilliant which could
affect skin tones whereas a movie it's
almost dulls the picture a little bit
i'm live left non-standard because so
far that's what i like another
functionality that's different here on
this epic 4g touch is the power saving
mode where you can enable and turn items
off and on depending on the battery
level so if your battery is getting low
you can tell it to turn off the Wi-Fi or
turn off bluetooth gps you can change
the brightness you can change the screen
timeout and also have some power saving
tips another item down here is motion
settings and this is where i was talking
about some of the new functionality in
the sense UI you have turnover which
allows you to turn the device over to
mute it which is not terribly new tilt
so to reduce or enlarge gallery pictures
you can actually put two fingers on the
screen and then tilt the device forward
and backwards to zoom the pinch to zoom
still works panning allows you to tap
and hold an icon on the desktop and then
twist the device back and forth to move
that icon to another screen and then
DoubleTap allows you to set the device
into the voice command mode and then tap
twice on the top of the device to
activate the voice command mode will to
cover that in just a second there are
some tutorials here to show you how
those each individually work which are
really helpful but if you leave the
notifications on some of these devices
it will also show you for example when
we open up the internet browser it was
going to pop up and tell us that we have
the ability to touch the screen and tilt
it back and forth you can turn those
notifications off thankfully it's got
swype it's got the samsung keypad which
I don't really care for and I installed
the gingerbread variant of the keyboard
which is the one I actually prefer swipe
as I find it works just fine the Samsung
keypad was frankly just annoying some of
the apps on this device all share is
pretty typical for devices these days
although I
don't really use it myself Google Books
is on here the gallery is the Samsung
default gallery as one would expect the
internet browser will come back to in
just a minute key is air or keys there
however you want to pronounce that it's
kind of a neat functionality because it
gives you the ability to connect to this
device via Wi-Fi to move data back and
forth rather than having to connect a
cable which I appreciate media hub is
pretty typical of Samsung you can rent /
movies and content there Nova 2 HD is
actually the full version not a demo you
do have to download about a 350 Meg
add-on afterwards to get it to run but
it brand very well nascar app is part of
the bloat but you can uninstall both of
these which is really really nice some
of the other functionality or software
applications got the social hub which I
just don't like using because i find the
default apps are usually better Polaris
Office for your office viewing apps
Sprint ID which we've seen before and
again thankfully doesn't lock you into
Sprint ID some more of the like the
music plus print radio TV and movies
some of those you can uninstall on some
you can't voice command is vlingo
wrapped up for samsung and that's how
that double tap works for doing some of
the voice command options and then
you've got visual voicemail as well
which is a nice addition if you look
over here here's the the voice command
button and in a driving mode as well so
here's the default camera app we've got
a series of buttons over here and your
Settings button here can actually change
those shortcuts to items that you would
like to use instead all of those
settings are available listed right here
in this settings menu but if you have
some that you like to quickly change for
example the autofocus type or the
exposure you can customize those to your
heart's content then a slider over here
to switch between movie and camera mode
which will show in just a second this is
for the front-facing versus rear camera
tap to focus on areas and it does have a
notification tone
and then you can tap to hold to get
ready to take your picture to set the
focus and then when you move your finger
up it will take the shot if you move
your finger to the interior of the
screen like this it won't actually take
the shot for you which is nice when
you're trying to actually take a photo
without having a dedicated camera key
switching over to the video camera mode
will automatically pop up and ask you
what mode you want but tapping on it
doesn't actually do anything if they
click the back button in order to clear
that there is the option to turn the
flash on for videos but just simply
tapping it does not turn the flash on
until you tell it to record and then you
have some additional options here as
well to change some effects and the
resolution video quality etc so I got it
loaded up to the mobile pocket now but
you can see right here it popped up this
message learn about tilt tap and hold
two points on the you can tilt the
device back and forth and shows a little
demo and you can tell it do not ask
again and it won't prompt you again
after it's done but I'm going to scroll
down here on the metella to open up the
desktop version of pocketnow.com and we
can see we're on Wi-Fi here and it's
already loaded up most of the page I'm
gonna go ahead and just start scrolling
or zooming in here scrolling up and down
it's very quick and snappy I'm not
having any trouble scrolling up and down
if I go into video content here scroll
here there's our video content that we
can actually tap and view if we wanted
they have the ability to open up
multiple windows if you like stop you
can change your browser brightness
outside of the normal screen brightness
which is awesome as well another way to
change your brightness is the android
version you hold tap and hold the bar up
here for a few seconds and you can slide
your finger back and forth on the
brightness if you don't already have it
set again as mentioned in the hardware
review since this is part of software I
haven't had any troubles with the device
locking up due to applications I really
don't have to close the apps really with
the task manager other than when I was
trying to do some speed tests like
quadrant or smart bench I
closing apps at that point that it
already been launched by me such as
touchdown which didn't need to be
running as part of the quadrant test so
overall it's been a fantastic device and
an admirable upgrade to the epic 4g line
across the board also in regards to the
camera and the video cam we have a photo
editor app and a movie made video maker
app both of which I found to be rather
depressingly simple while some people
might have fun tweaking their images a
little bit with these apps I didn't find
it terribly useful and rather would use
something like retro camera to take more
interesting photos if that was what I
was wanting to do that wraps up our
closer look of the software on the
samsung galaxy s2 epic 4g touch for
sprint give any comments or questions
