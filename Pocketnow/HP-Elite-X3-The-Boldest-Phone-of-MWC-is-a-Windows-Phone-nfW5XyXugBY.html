fan of Windows Mobile is probably about
to blow your face off i'm michael fisher
with pocket now and this is a hands-on
look at the phone formerly known as the
HP falcon before the gushing starts i
want to point out that the elite x3
isn't perfect the industrial design
doesn't immediately stand out and it's
kind of pillowy and generic and the only
element that really pops is the
speakerphone at the bottom whose dot
grille pattern i love but won't be for
everyone otherwise almost everything
about the elite x3 is a dream come true
for spec starved Windows Mobile fans
snapdragon 820 processor check four gigs
of ram yep a six inch quad HD display
you bet and it's OLED to boot there's
windows hello iris scanning and the
phone will spawn a fingerprint scanner
by the time it gets to market the same
one the Nexus 6p has in the same
position under the 16 megapixel camera
speaking to the camera HP tells us it
will have optical stabilization on the
final product the phone sports USBC fast
charging and dual mode wireless charging
but you won't need to charge it too
often because the battery is a beefy 40
150 milliamp hours oh and the phone is
water and dust resistant to ip67 and
it's rated to milspec 810g for
durability because why the hell not
right
even continuum has gotten upgraded here
with a fancy new dock to connect to your
desktop workstation instead of the
no-frills consumer edition and HP is
also introducing a mobile extender
essentially a laptop version of
continuum with ports to connect to the
elite x3 and a big battery to charge
your phone while it's connected this
smartphone is targeted squarely at
enterprise HP is touting its cloud layer
for corporate app compatibility and it's
built a Pogo USB interface into the
phone so it can accommodate a handheld
sleeve for retail transactions down the
road so it probably won't be showing up
at your local Best Buy when it launches
this summer is what I'm saying
but with so many outstanding specs many
never-before-seen on a Windows 10
smartphone the elite x3 is generating
buzz among the Windows Phone faithful
that Microsoft's own Lumias can't yet
touch quite a coup for a company with
HP's spotty history and may be a sign of
things to come in the Windows 10 space
going forward to see what's happening on
the lower end of the Windows 10 mobile
spectrum here at MWC 2016 check out our
Lumia 650 hands on here on YouTube and
follow all the breaking mobile tech news
at pocket now until next time this has
been michael fisher from barcelona

watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
