when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappears
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's take a look at
a Windows Phone that's not so fresh and
so clean anymore the Nokia Lumia 920 I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is episode 12 of after the buzz the
Lumia 920 was Nokia's chance to fix the
shortcomings of the earlier Lumia 900
the screen size and resolution were
bumped up taking advantage of the
support for HD screens in Windows Phone
8 some build quality issues were
addressed and the lackluster camera of
the 900 was replaced with an optically
stabilized PureView super camera in the
920 so how of all these enhancements
held up over the intervening months
let's take a quick dive into hardware
and software to find an answer we
covered this model's physical
reliability in an earlier video called
Lumia 920 durability report which you
should check out in short our in-house
unit has held up excellently over three
months showing only a few scuffs and
scrapes despite never being protected by
a case and being dropped on hardwood
floors repeatedly on its face despite no
longer being the hottest ticket in town
the Lumia 920 continues to draw curious
glances especially our white version
here the design which straddles the line
between practicality and artistry
continues to serve the phone well
proving that a Windows Phone doesn't
need to sacrifice aesthetics for
functionality the battery still holds up
fairly well
under moderate use and the camera
continues to do a wonderful job more on
this in a minute in terms of hardware
we're only worried about two things as
the 920 gets a little gray around the
temples the first is the dead horse
issue of the devices weight while we
like the substantial feel of the 920 the
fact remains that anyone coming from
another modern smartphone will
absolutely feel that 185 grams of the
Lumia 920 and not everyone will like it
especially if the trend toward lighter
smartphones continues in 2013 which we
expect it to the other issue is the
display which is lovely but at 1280 by
768 it's not poised to keep pace with
the 1080p resolution screens it's
Android competition will be bringing
this here that's not a huge issue now as
Microsoft still needs to enable 1080p
support in Windows Phone 8 but the 920
will quickly find itself knocked down a
few pegs once it does happen
on the software side Nokia's flagship
Windows Phone has aged much more
gracefully than any of its competitors
thanks in large part to its suite of
Nokia exclusive apps the company has
made some titles available to all
windows phones like it's hit or miss
Nokia Drive beta navigation app but many
can still only be found on Nokia devices
that includes apps ranging from the
useful Nokia transit and Nokia express
to the fun cinemagraph smart shoot and
panorama camera enhancements as lens
plugins those last few titles really
enhance the shooting experience on the
Lumia 920 further extending the ability
of its already excellent camera when
we're using other devices we really miss
the Lumia 920's camera it's probably the
component of the phone that will age the
most gracefully going forward the app
fun isn't limited to the Nokia
collection either Windows Phone 8
recently got its own flavour of Spotify
after a long wait and we expect other
big titles like Pandora to come to the
platform in the first half of the year
and the core assets of Windows Phone
that make it a pleasure to use it's
fluid responsiveness stability and its
modern interface design have remained
unempioyed by software updates and our
ever growing collection of apps and
media on the device it runs just as
smoothly as it did on day 1 back in
November the Lumia 920's launched buzz
was harshed by a sudden surprising wave
of windows-based competition from HTC
followed by a less impressive but still
significant set of offerings from
Samsung
while Nokia still needs to keep an eye
on those rivals the differentiation it's
brought to Windows Phone 8 in both
hardware and software has served it very
well Nokia is still the manufacturer
bringing the most value to Microsoft's
ecosystem and building the devices with
the most staying power as of now there's
no finer proof of that than the Nokia
Lumia 920 thank you folks that's gonna
