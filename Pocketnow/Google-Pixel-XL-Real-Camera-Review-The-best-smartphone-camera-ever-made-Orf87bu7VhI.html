best smartphone camera anyone has ever
made so let me just put that score in
the context this isn't only the best
camera we've ever made it's the best
smartphone camera anyone has ever made
that's a tall order so it's time to put
the pixel XL to the ultimate photo and
video test in our real camera review
buckle up folks we have a lot of ground
to cover and I'm gonna move pretty quick
first for you specs junkies you can
pause the video here to see what
hardware we're working with with that
out of the way jumping into some outdoor
daylight shots we're going to upset some
in our audience the pixel is largely
designed to be used in some form of HDR
or auto processing mode but keeping our
samples consistent against the other
phones we review most of the samples
here were shot with HDR disabled and
we'll discuss high dynamic range in the
appropriate sections of this review we
want to keep this in oranges to oranges
comparison opposite our other real
camera reviews looking at exposure the
pixel is working to produce bright vivid
contrast II images which will look
incredible on the phone's AMOLED display
as such one left to decide every photo
setting on its own the camera routinely
pushes a little brighter than it needs
to blues and greens look very good
there's a juicy color saturation
happening here which is ie pleasing the
uniform sections of the sky have a very
fine pattern grain which is appreciated
and won't distract from your subject
likewise Browns and earth tones arrive
appropriately warm but avoid that
exaggeration which might push them into
orange territory we are starting to clip
some fine details on these yellow
flowers though which is a shame not an
area HDR could have helped save the shot
and Red's are difficult to capture on
any digital sensor but they're even
trickier to get a handle on here as this
camera aggressively adjusts exposure for
where you focus many cameras employ some
kind of spot metering but focusing on
different parts of this abyss 'kiss we
arrive at very different metering values
which produce very different results we
do better than most in retaining fine
detail but warmer colors on the pixel
can start to sizzle and a white flower
and direct Sun the pixel does a great
job of retaining
peddle detail with only the brightest
sections of the flower starting to blow
out moving to white balance the pixel
airs on the side of satisfying a
consumer more than delivering accuracy
but the camera avoids pushing too warm
in California afternoon light nor does
it drive too cold and shaded shots I
think we're finding a very happy balance
in these finished JPEGs it's a good
thing too as well the pixel has
rudimentary white balance controls there
are only four presets here which aren't
particularly useful given how wide a
range they're trying to represent now
the pixel does not have the ability to
natively capture RAW files but it will
support raw capture and third-party apps
so we're breaking our rule here using
another camera app to take a look at a
raw file purposely overexposing we can
want the image back about two and a half
stops to recover some information in
this blown out exterior considering the
pixels penchant for punchy exposure it's
a shame we don't have raw capture built
into this app speaking of the app layout
it's a simple google camera view shutter
on the right modes available on the left
through a swipe gesture and settings on
the top of the viewfinder to change HDR
and flash options it's a nicely
simplified view for no fuss photography
though we wish there was a little more
meat here for people who do enjoy
adjusting settings so checking out the
zoom re ran into some issues what you
see is not always what you get first
though the pixel limits the zoom range
more than some competitors might there
isn't a lot of resolution to play with
on the sensor so at maximum zoom expect
some image degradation but thanks to
that limit results here are competitive
for a software crop zoom the problem
stems from the crop factor applied to
the image on the sensor and how that
does not line up with your viewfinder I
was not trying to cut off the top of
this palm tree according to my
viewfinder I framed
close to the upper edge of the screen
but the output was saved a lot lower
than what I was seeing we would consider
this to be a significant software issue
not being able to trust that what the
camera is showing you while shooting is
not what you will save when you finish
recording we're really hoping this will
be addressed in a future software update
macro focusing distances are also
competitive and you can get pretty close
though
stuff to always tell it macro distances
whether your subject is really in focus
or not you don't get a lot of feedback
from this circle focus indicator it
would be nice if it would turn red four
times that your subject is not in focus
thanks to this one over two point three
inch sensor though it's not difficult at
all to blur your background and capture
some tasty bouquet and while the focus
reporting can sometimes be a bit wonky
the focusing action is lightning fast
pixel is the closest competitor this
year to the galaxy s7 and we'd be
hard-pressed to declare an outright
victor here for speed and accuracy very
well done by Google damn and you thought
flaring on LG cameras was bad
unfortunately the lens on the pixel will
not go down as one of our favourites
it's very much prone to flaring like JJ
Abrams flaring and color flaring and
producing this ring halo flaring google
has already acknowledged this is a
hardware issue and one they won't be
fixing while manufacturing this
generation of pixel instead they'll try
to address a hardware issue with a
software fix but that image processing
correction will only be available if you
shoot in the HDR plus mode extremely
disappointing as it's one of those can't
unsee kinds of defects and your eye is
instantly drawn to it when it pops up in
one of your images so now we get to the
HDR mode and it really is Google's
catch-all mode this is where Google
fixes over exposure issues washed out
color issues and will be where they try
to fix lens defect issues hdr+ has a lot
riding on it so we're happy to report
this is a phenomenal HDR mode Google
takes top marks for balancing highlights
and lowlights bringing down the
brightest areas of your frame while
filling in any underexposed sections of
your shot looking at numerous test
photos we feel this image processing
just edges out the iPhone 4 producing
those punchy colorful bright shots that
people tend to enjoy Google really did
land something special on this iteration
of HDR plus but it's still an HDR mode
so for those people who don't enjoy the
processed look of high dynamic range
there are very few options available out
of the box to help you achieve the shots
you want looking at how good HDR
processing is just makes panorama
stitching all the
more disappointing seriously we're still
doing the line up the dots thing
I love taking panorama shots from
iPhones galaxies LG's wall ways which
all scan smoothly through your scene
I've yet to complete a panorama like
this where there weren't some big gaps
or stitching errors so you should all
know by now that I hate selfie cameras
but the front shooter on the pixel is
better than most we do run into
processing consistency issues though
letting the camera decide everything
doesn't always mean it will make the
choices you want also in shade there
were some metering issues about one out
of five the camera would expose more for
the background even though I was
occupying the focus video is nicely
detailed and the software does a very
good job of adjusting to changes in
exposure but it still is shaky it would
be nice to employ some of the crop
stabilization to the front shooter to
moving to low-light this camera is
utterly fearless at cranking up the ISO
to produce bright images again pushing
brighter than the scene usually warrants
hdr+ contain some of that noise
but HDR shots take significantly longer
process in dark condition so this won't
be ideal if you or your subject is
moving our creepy tunnel is a perfect
showcase for the issues with lens
flaring and overexposure the auto modes
here are a bummer when trying to correct
for that brightness this was as dark as
I could go it's a much better
representation of the shot but I had to
max out the exposure compensation to get
here and if I wanted a darker or a
moodier shot I can't do it in the camera
app our walkway fared better with
terrific color accuracy between these
two white bulbs though the clip sections
below each light are a touch larger than
I'd like to see pixel does very well
with our creepy gate getting pretty
close to the ugly yellow light which
washes this alley but the white balance
adjustments in the app are pretty poor
looking through the four presets there's
no way in camera to correct for the
yellow light three of the four presets
look nearly identical and a flower in
almost total darkness it's blurry from
noise reduction but this thing cranked
the ISO to an astounding 4500 to pull an
image out of almost no light by
comparison the highest ISO and LGV 20
will let you shoot is 3200 and moving to
video the pixel captures a respectable
though
class-leading 40 megabit per second
bitrate UHD file which eats around 300
megabytes per minute of video likely a
compromise on file sizes given the
pixels lack of expandable storage
options video for the most part follows
the same aesthetic as stills punchy
contrast II and a touch on the bright
side we can get a better look at the
metering here left to its own devices
these Bougainville blossoms are
overexposed but dropping the exposure
down one and a third to one and a half
stops we get a better look at the
flowers and pull more info out of the
surrounding area focusing on the tree we
get a bright vivid scene output from
competing phones like the V 20 might
seem dull by comparison but there's more
info to work with on the LG so we can
get pretty close to recreating the look
of the pixel with a quick boost to
brightness and contrast the pixel on the
other hand can't replace the info which
was lost in clipped highlights but what
about that shake that shimmy Google's
software image stabilization is terrific
shots where you and your subject are
still it almost looks like you have the
phone on a tripod walking is also
handled really well avoiding the lens
wobble of hardware stabilization and
easily competing with what Apple has to
offer here it isn't difficult to get
this phone to twitch though back to our
tree scene because the tree is moving in
a medium breeze we see the phone trying
to adjust where it probably doesn't need
to also panning movements can sometimes
produce abrupt shifts in stabilization
lastly longer shutter speeds will
produce ghosting in some of these
Corrections we've never actually
traveled down the creepy tunnel at night
have we
that's pretty spooky in although this is
one of the better implementations of
stabilization we've seen on any
smartphone but what do we hear on some
of these video files now some have
declared the pixel Google's iPhone and
when it comes to audio that's an apt
comparison as this phone only records
mono audio while shooting video
thankfully the noise reduction is
even-handed preventing any overt
destruction while minimizing constant
background noise
you don't get stereo information from
the environment to shoot in which is a
bummer in our transition test moving
from dark to bright and back changes to
brightness are handled very well it's a
very pleasant blooming effect and it's
really subtle but the white balance
shifts with a bit more of a pop panning
shots are tricky on most phones but
moving from bright back to dark as the
shutter speed changes we see a bit more
of a shimmer than we'd like and slowing
things down for a second Google
absolutely nails slow-motion video this
is the best
slow-mo footage I've seen from any phone
and I'm very happy to see how easy it is
to switch from 120 frames per second to
240 frames per second right in the app
without leaving the viewfinder while
composing your shot consider yourself on
notice Apple this is terrific
so let's wrap this up where does that
leave us with the camera on the Google
pixel excel is it the bestest camera
ever no we can't say that it is but it's
pretty darn good for the folks out there
who want a streamlined shooter
especially those who prefer to not
manipulate settings the pixel delivers
very good results you point you hit the
shutter you get good vivid color on the
fly like that this really is a fun
camera to shoot with philosophically
though we just can't declare a camera
the best if it ignores the shooters in
our audience stepping up to more
advanced composition the people who do
enjoy adjusting settings as they're
trying to capture something specific
like how out of the box I can't show you
a long exposure freeway shot from the
pixel there's no option for shutter
speed eivissa really disagree with any
statement in a review made along the
lines of but most people don't shoot
that way I find that to be reductive and
more than a little insulting there is a
wide gamut of people using phone cameras
and I think people will rise to the
quality of the tool they're given the
pixel offers precious little room to
grow in that area until someone is
motivated to stray from Google software
I personally just won't trust
auto modes to achieve my vision until I
can telepathically communicate with my
cameras the pixel is a fun camera but I
can't rely on it for work like I might
some of its competition
adding to that philosophical issue a
viewfinder which won't always properly
frame my composition mono audio when
capturing video and some of the worst
lens flaring we've seen on an expensive
flagship device and the pixel falls
short of Google's boasts we'll give you
an A for effort Google but in execution
there's room for improvement as always
