free media rumors have a microsoft
surface 2 in the works and Nokia's new
job posting points to Android I'm high
Meadow ravenna wondering what a note get
Android device would look like and this
is pocket now daily that's right if
Nexus devices are your thing this
holiday season google seems to be
offering free media to new customers the
reason why I say it seems is because
even though the movie is being offered
are not jaw-dropping it's always great
to have a free copy of Transformers Dark
Side of the Moon but the problem is that
they made this same offer when the Nexus
7 was launched and I never got my free
movies so check out google play and
leave us a comment if you really got the
movie or not because i didn't now
android 4.2 seems to have more glitches
that we expected I for one created a
family account for the Nexus 7 and now I
can log back onto my old administrator
account because it doesn't remember my
password other people are complaining
about opacity and applications meaning
that they're running a game and they can
see another application in the
background for some reason so leave us a
comment if you're having these issues
and Android 4.2 points something to fix
these issues couldn't come soon enough I
can't even wipe my tablet now and that's
right we're going to talk about more
Nexus devices excuses new listing has a
new tablet called the me172v and even
though the specs are nothing to smile
about they're actually mid tiered the
specs show that the device will cost 99
bucks rumors have it the masseuse is
working on a new cheaper version of the
nexus 7 to be sold sometime next year
now even though cheap is not necessarily
good assumes did a really good job with
the Nexus 7 so let's see what they bring
Microsoft has already rumored to be
working on new surface devices for next
year though this time instead of
launching two tablets that look the same
but don't have the same operating system
microsoft apparently will bring an eight
point six inch display for the windows
RT variants and then they'll bring the
11.6 inch display only for the pro
version rumors also have a surface book
in the works with fourteen point six
inches into this place so let's just
hope that this time these devices do cut
break to Microsoft because sadly the
surface RT was in that hot or at least
not good enough and finally for the
unexpected news of the day Nokia's new
job posting points to them looking for a
Linux engineer and we all know what
androids made of now some of us believe
that all this has to do is with no Kim
apps but others are speculating that
Nokia is becoming tired of waiting for
Windows Phone to take off after two
years and we don't blame them so that
leads us to the question of the day
would you think that Nokia would
actually ditch Windows Phone to move on
to Android in my particular case I would
love for them to do so I would love to
see a nokia beautiful device having
Android stock Android hopefully but
leave us a comment down below and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet will make sure you follow us on
Parker now calm please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
primarily better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
