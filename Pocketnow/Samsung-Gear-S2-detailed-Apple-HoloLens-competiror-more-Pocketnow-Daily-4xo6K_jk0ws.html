of the gear s2 we see some interesting
trademarks of LG's super premium phone
and it seems that the next Apple TV will
not be launching alone I'm hiding out or
iveta and i'm actually not heat or even
though you see me here but it's a long
story just trying to explain it this is
pocket out daily official news today are
not really yet official sort of as Apple
has begun hiring talent for microsoft's
hololens team because apparently they
want to work on their own augmented
reality product to compete with the
hollow blends and for those of you that
are wondering how serious Apple is in
this arena well they've pretty much
acquired two companies that focus on
those over the last two years so this
seemed the Cupertino is working on
something we just don't know exactly
when we should expect something to
compete with the UNAC system hollow lens
yet and speaking of Apple another
product that we were waiting for to the
announced in September of apparently
will not happen until October now is the
new Apple TV apparently Apple will be
launching to Apple TVs winning the newer
one and then the existing one again
because apparently if you want the new
cable type service that Apple wants to
announce at some point you'll need the
newer Apple TV and then you could just
buy the older one that will give you
everything that it can currently do
mainly because the new Apple TV will
apparently cost close to two hundred
dollars so stay tuned as we learn more
and for those of you that are wondering
if there will be an LG super premium
phone as the company CEO teased well
this is the second time we actually land
on a trademark name that pretty much
hints everything as we now hear of the
LG g4 note apparently this is the name
of a new device to come and we're not
expecting this to be a stylist phone or
whatever but it could be just a new name
for the pro lineup and the new revamp
we're not exactly sure what to expect
here but you can bet we will be looking
forward to it and speaking of LG it
seems that the LG Nexus will not be the
hot LG g4 like the Vice that we heard
rumors got some trusted sources claiming
that apparently LG will tone down
everything with this device starting
with the fact that for example it'll
have a 1080p display instead of a quad
HD display apparently you only get
32 gig options that are probably not
expandable in addition to a
non-expandable battery and yeah it seems
that everything else is just the phone
that is watered down because apparently
the focus here will be the price tag so
let's see what we get them in and
finally for the very hot news of the day
even though Aoife is a pretty much
happening at the moment or let's just
say starting Santa has already unveiled
its gear s2 smartwatches because they
are too we've got the sport variant than
the classic variant both devices are
pretty much the same and internals
you've got the same display the same
processor the same everything I'm not
going to bore you with those details
because they are in the links of the
description but what makes these devices
different is obviously the rotating
bezel user interface and the fact that
obviously this is the new type of tysons
might watch the samsung is launching now
we are still yet to confirm the price
tag or how cool these watches are but
you can bet that we will be covering
this life-form Aoife but it does lead me
to the question of the day if you had to
pick your ash to sport or the gear s2
classic which one do you like most
because in my case I actually like the
classic more but if I have to pick from
either of them because I really don't
like any of them leave us a comment down
below is it just me or are these two
ugly friends as always you don't the
drill if you want to get the nose
