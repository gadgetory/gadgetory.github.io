market share to Apple Galaxy sales are
solid but competition is fierce
blackberry is done updating the Prive
Amazon finally brings back chromecast's
and Apple TVs and TK Bay dropped by the
gadget lab to discuss the future of the
Internet
after the FCC's net neutrality vote
we've got a lot to talk about so make
sure you're charged and ready for
episode two eight three of the pocket
now weekly recorded December 15th at
around 11:30
hmm this is the weekly podcast where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets wearables it's all the stuff you
wished existed when you were a kid and
you would just binge watch all of your
favorite cheesy sci-fi shows over the
holidays and for me it was usually like
a Babylon 5 marathon Stargate ok I'm
kind of debating like what what is it
that I'm gonna do I think the wife is
probably going to be down for next gen
ok yeah I think we'll probably do like
you know maybe seasons 5 through 7 just
on in the background constantly
definitely I gotta get it got to be
selective maybe some Star Trek for
action just to shake it up with some
little comedy yeah so as you may have
noticed mr. TK Bay a gadget aficionado
here to share his thoughts all the top
news stories of the week and we've got a
lot like I said we've got a lot to talk
about so I think we should just jump
right in oh and for those of you
watching a live stream you can jump into
the conversation using the p-n weekly
hashtag on twitter that's where we're
gonna be pulling comments and questions
from and then if you're one of those
audio listeners after the fact you're
not catching us live definitely send in
those questions and comments to the
forgot our email address no it's a pot
it's podcast podcast at pocketnow.com
there we go and we'll be wrapping up
everyone's everyone's questions in our
month May
back at the end of the mailbag episode
at the end of the month you'll pardon I
usually have Jules here as a producer to
help me out so a lot of a lot of new
parts here some I shows go because I'm
Jules the producer but he's actually
covering an event for us on the East
Coast so he couldn't join us this week
which I'm again thank you for joining us
so we can chat about this stuff I want
to jump right in on a story that because
because we're gonna be talking about
Samsung we're gonna be talking about
market share yeah but one of the things
I think is impacting that on the global
stage is the intense competition coming
from companies like Huawei Oppo Xiaomi
and this is something that we've we've
been getting little hints of for a while
now but again this isn't full
confirmation we don't have an official
statement from any of the carrier's or
Huawei but the continued notion that
Huawei is going to be making a bigger
play in North America especially in the
United States and that we can see
evidence of that negotiating coming from
18t and from Verizon no no definitely I
mean we've had the the last couple of
CES right we've had events from them
they actually do come to the US release
they brought in like the mate 8 a couple
years ago the mate 9 it was a mate I
started they were they were getting a
radar yeah actual like the hardware and
how it actually kind of gets tailored to
the US you got actually US hardware with
a u.s. charger you get the technology
and last year we had one of the first
devices that had Alexa built in and they
truly did that they did deliver on that
on that promise a few months later we
got the update we have the LexA built
into their phone and they're still to
this day I think like one of two devices
maybe two or three devices other than
the HTC I think it's just HTC and why
wait yeah wait that habit so they've
been in the market Oh Motorola if you
count their dock okay so if you buy a
phone and then like a $200 speaker then
you can also have the end result of what
we're seeing now is obviously they're
seen is that there is there is interest
in the market yeah and if we don't want
to forget also the fact that you know
they're here also in another brand which
you know the honor brand we've had the
honor think six the 5x the 6x and then
you know we just heard about the 7x I
just got released and
I think those guys are already and you
know been introduced into the US and
then 7x is coming here this this is I
think the interesting play right now is
we keep talking like what can a brand do
how can you build up some market share
you obviously can't right out of the
gate out advertise Apple no right you
can't out advertise am some Samsung yeah
the advertising question probably
eclipses a lot of other manufacturers
own making budget exactly but what we've
seen from folly is they've made a
concerted effort to start playing in the
unlocked space the mate nine was a great
addition to the North American lineup at
the end of it was the beginning of this
year actually it took a while for a
solid performer massive battery oh yeah
one of the very few places have like a
four thousand milliamp battery all the
performance you know the screen is very
nice great audio on it still had a three
and a half and one of your headphone
jack you still have those yeah it's a
feature now it's not a requirement yeah
and I think that's really why and then
of course if you've had any chance to
play what they may tend to make them Pro
I had an opportunity when I was writing
a few weeks ago and yeah because I
wanted to I'm going to talk about that
yeah definitely so looking forward to it
makes perfect sense and I think people
will be very surprised because they
don't know the bird I think that's what
it right the US we haven't seen a single
commercial or an ad for while we but you
land in the UK the first thing you get
to after customs is a massive billboard
while we found a mate I wrote I was you
know like I mean I know I wasn't in the
US but I was totally shocked like cab
drive my first cab drive in Germany for
Aoife yeah
drivers turn-by-turn navigation and he
pulls out of May 9 I love that phone I
know you know he became that like that
nod so in in addition to them making
that play for the unlocked market we saw
with the I have you here on the table
the six eggs actually making it into
target for example so we know this is a
company that's really trying to push
those boundaries but it seems to me that
Kwame is backing off this mole
the tiered strategy and focusing more of
their resources on the carrier
partnership the carrier relationship oh
can you scoot the mic just a little
closer to you I know you were kind of
cropping your no no problem I mean
actually right there you go but with um
with that shift cuz because I feel like
the honor nine became the phone in
transition mm-hmm we didn't see as
cohesive a release strategy with that
phone making it into different markets
it really never made it to the United
States though I think it is available in
Canada it's available on Amazon but not
in the same way that we saw with the
owner II like the on rate they made like
a replay for its for it to be this was a
this was a North American exactly they
San Francisco event he presented it they
provided everybody the information then
he was available I Amazon of course
right after that people could buy it and
use it the honor and I never made it
although the honor nine is extremely
well built of a device I would have
loved to see more of the that line of
devices because they're small but
they're perfect in the sense of screen
to body ratio camera performance where I
had a really good hardware there but
yeah I think the the tenets getting it
into the carriers obviously for any
brand for any OEM is always gonna be the
best way because you get that mass
distribution it's kind of like getting
Amazon to accept your Walmart totally
you get that you know Cosco yeah you get
that market penetration you get you get
people to be able to see your device in
the store in front of plate your hands
on till you hold a mate ten or a Maine
tonight or even an honor eight you don't
know how good quality is because that
honor eight that displayed the backup
you've ever said the site we met there
in the the glass the 5d glass on the bag
and blue shimmer really nice phone and I
still have that device and I still like
pulling it out on occasion too because
you you get responses from people shiny
blue you know is the pixel it was last
year's pixel and it was the the honoree
where the two most publicly asked about
phones that I would walk around with now
often it would be hey what's the case on
your iPhone but people were still
curious they would still ask about that
we've got a question here from Andrew
Wallace using the ple hash tag what does
while we need to do in the US market in
2018 in order to successfully go
head-to-head with Samsung and
Apple so carrier carrier launch strategy
I think makes a lot of sense for people
if it follows the mate nine strategy
we're probably gonna be seeing a May 10
announcement early first quarter 2018
something like that hopefully to
undercut some of the the pre buzz on LG
G 7s and Galaxy S nines and exactly I
think it's I think that would be a good
step to start if they're able to work
out their negotiations as the rooms that
we're hearing right you know with either
you know ATT Verizon I think those would
be really good markets the fact that
they have unlocked that means they
already kind of work on t-mobile and
some of the other carrier the GSM so you
could technically just pick up your own
device I honestly think it's it's gonna
take time I don't think it may not be
2018 where they become oh my god this is
the best brand but it's gonna be where
people start saying oh I know what while
we is I know what the mate 10 is yeah
and I think it's we could just get that
name recognition and seen in more front
of people dining areas over yeah do you
think that there could be a marketing
strategy where they talked about how
worldwide they're the number three and
they're just not as recognized in the
United States do you think that would
resonate with North Americans it's hard
to say I think it's tough right I was
trying to wrap my brain around that is
hard to say because you make too big a
play they're like whoa I've never heard
of you exactly why if you don't bring it
to the discussion then you're missing
out on an opportunity to say like hey
we're not just some new startup exact
we're an established mega brand
worldwide years of experience years of
performance of devices and many lineup
and I think I think it may be a good
thing to say but I don't think it's
gonna be a selling point especially not
in the u.s. we were typical yeah we you
know and we always want the best and we
always think that we are you know
discerning consumers technology starts
here always and it's not always that way
I mean there are a lot more than just
Apple and Samsung which is what we think
is the top number one while we makes
amazing hardware and I swear to God I
mean eight nine Porsche Edition so that
was the reason with that one but they
had that on the show floor as he has
yeah and that was the closest
resemblance that we got at that whole
curve glass on the side where every you
know really had that really nice as I
never saw it in the US never made it
into the US market but they never even
talked about it but the Porsche design
was really a very nicely
designed phone that kind of even came
ahead of the si si si plus totally so
they have the hardware you just need to
see it and I think this is the right
move
is it gonna be sold on you know we're
number three in the world I think what
we need to see is more value for the
dollar and performance and as time goes
on and people use their devices
especially with the honor brand because
that's that's doing also much better
penetration in the market here yeah
let's let's shift gears on that because
that as a two-prong strategy I worried
that there could be a little confusion
with Huawei and honor in North America
as you're kind of launching both you
know the honor is a little bit more
established you can find them and target
but you know Huawei only about a year
behind and make the same kind of plays
with unlocked retailers but you know I
don't think they have an expectation
that consumers are going to understand
that they're the same umbrella
corporation and but that's still you're
sort of dividing your resources in
trying to market products here but um
you got to spend some time we've got it
here on the table
um the honor 7x I have my 6x next to it
just so we can compare immediately when
when you pop is the case off of off of
it it does have that kind of HTC meets
Apple curved antenna banding exactly and
what I really liked that they're finally
getting rid of these panels exactly they
got rid of the panels on the mate nine
for the May 10 and now honor is finally
following suit where we have the 18 by 9
aspect ratio
NAD+ but the the tech for the price I
mean this is $199 yeah you cannot beat
it that's where honors really succeeding
it's getting you really good hardware at
a very affordable price you go to pick
it up for 200 bucks and not have to
worry about it SD card support screen a
half a millimeter headphone jack you
know a lot of good things some things we
still need to see improved I mean it's
almost what 15 days to 2018 right little
cranky yeah but that's me but but they
seem to be making a really smart play
with the honor brand opposite say like a
Moto G 5 but I feel like Motorola got a
little confusing with their strategy
there's the g5 the g5 plus
five s too many g5s too many G fives and
G fives that started encroaching on like
moto Z plays exactly when you're talking
similar chipsets and battery capacities
and and it's just I think the the
marketing strategy at that point it is
just almost like yeah we just need to
create so many variants so people can
find what they want and reality is you
just need to find the right ferry in
just calories yeah give it is that
balance give us a good decent size
battery good display and a good camera
people will buy that at 250 or 200 was
the price one will even that much
difference right they were going 150
dollar increments increments and I think
Motorola just I think I just trying to
bring bring something back of the old
days yeah reality is we just have just
too many devices at this point yeah
and I think the sea force of the that
line is very very well established is
very good top-notch hardware is slim
design
latest specs great cameras yeah and then
the motor mods and all of that stuff so
those are really nice I like the gaming
lot on the motor sea force but it's one
of those things that you gotta realize
you know why we needs to really just
work on providing the great hardware the
great price I think the way their
approaches going into it I feel like
it's almost like similar to the way
Apple does it's not animal has the
high-end site and then they all set the
seaside you know the lower end side oh
yeah yeah and they realize that people
want both right they want that small
form-factor the nostalgia factors right
there the the best built iPhone exactly
from the five mile ban all around you
can throw that thing in the land and
straight into you want to do that it's
perfect perfect one thumb navigation
perfect and then but they realize that
people still eat meat that so their name
you know take that away and they provide
you of course with new designs and new
things they just approach it differently
they did honor take care of all the
budget great online retail and you know
budget phones and they're doing well and
I think as time goes on then they can
draw that line so you look at them you
love our brand you love our budget side
but if you ever want that little extra
Wow is right there and we can we can
exist up you up in with the view 10 if
you look at the view 10 some of the
specs from the you 10 are very close to
the may 10th yeah they took the Karen 9
70s in there that's that's you that's
their best chipset today
yeah so we're talking best chipset you
know camera set up really really nice
you're getting some of the best stuff
out of Huawei into their honor devices
at a great budget price that's what I
like them and they're doing really good
like
it just takes time mm-hmm and we're
seeing some of the stuff so you've spent
about a week with it what is the chip
chipset that they're using in the
seminary 659 security light it's a small
bump from last year we had the 650 year
that's being on the yum so 659 in the
European model we had the 464 and then
the US models 332 as far as the internal
storage and ok ramen rim so yeah there's
always gonna be slight variation between
the US and the European which there
shouldn't be sorry I can understand that
can only link to the price point though
because we when we look at the price
difference between the two DRP model
runs closer to 300 bucks where the US
model is 100 bucks yeah and again super
super premium feel the display is very
very nice it's 1080p plus you're not
gonna lose anything 18 by 9 aspect ratio
great for me a consumption and I've
actually gotten couple updates on it
since I've had it so it's really really
nice I like the fact that it works very
well and I think the US market would
love to display because again they
finally matched what you were having to
pay you know so much more money to get
totally because even with one plus your
$500 phone yeah yeah
so again less than half that price did
they just because I'm gonna pick your
brain real quick I cuz I know sort of
thinking Qualcomm land if we're talking
like 625 Snapdragon 630 that started to
enable things like 4k video recording
has hallway managed to make that
transition for the 7x unfortunately no
so okay so okay and the front-facing
camera it doesn't do 1080p so you get
yeah you got you have that is a
compromise there there's a compromise
yeah you could definitely see how the
line goes from where they went and what
they took out right but again it keeps
it within a certain you know price point
you realize you're not buying something
that's gonna do 4k but you're gonna be
getting that really good quality picture
on it but not gonna get you know the
dual sensors in the bag that their book
gave is it's good it's not bad I'm gonna
say it's yeah you have to get the right
lighting and as long as you get you get
your subject centered correctly to be
able to get a good picture nice yeah
alright let's shift gears um we've got a
couple other news stories coming in and
one of the biggies that I think just
from sort of a media and entertainment
standpoint is Amazon so Amazon is
bringing back is finally bringing back
chromecast and Apple TV so you can buy
those apparently it's not that confusing
for consumers if they have multiple
options for buying streaming devices
because I thought it was strange that
like David sell Roku's yeah and fire TVs
and fire sticks but it was too confusing
to have chromecast's an apple and Apple
TV so apparently we're smart enough now
to figure that out in Amazon I just like
got you don't want to rush don't want to
rush and it maybe has something to do
with the fact that Google pulled the
plug on YouTube Amazon devices they're
supposed to be according to some sources
at least they're supposed to be working
some details to see if they can keep it
or bring it back yeah they had a stay of
execution on a couple devices yeah that
was well especially one of their main
ones right the show yeah we need you to
be came on that was from YouTube on
video does not have that library access
on their selection of all the content
that people would ask of you know Alexa
Earth sorry yeah I'm not gonna call the
Amazon assistant anything
I've been practicing not to call out the
the keywords hey Alexa how much is
hemorrhoid cream sorry that's terrible
oh I don't have any L X's and my Google
home Mini isn't even plugged in right
now so it's it's amazing that well I
think it's great that we finally had the
the luxury with ultra be able to
purchase those and you know we have a
great lineup and you know Amazon makes
great fires you know yeah
it's nothing against the individual
ecosystems it just kind of feels like
this is an alien vs. predator
you know choice you know whoever wins we
lose it's like two major forces economic
forces like Amazon sort of dominating
retail Google dominating sort of
trafficking and personal information
clashing with us as the poker chips on
the table and it feels a little unseemly
I'm always gonna be happy when we have
better interoperability and better
service penetration between these
different ecosystems I don't like when
like the early days of having a box
under your TV and like well the
PlayStation 3 II can do Netflix but the
Xbox can
you're like well no it's a computer yeah
it's a computer I should be able to
choose what goes on there and so for the
longest time I just ran a Windows XP
computer under my ttae pcs yeah it
wasn't even made oh man it was just it
was an old ATX build like I don't need
this motherboard anymore and it still
got a chip in there I I can put 16 gig
of ram in our hard drive and just have
it run up there and collect dodge mouse
it worked so so now it's like I feel
like we still haven't quite Crested we
still haven't quite learned from those
mistakes of early like exclusive
features or exclusive lockdown resources
a Romanian entertainer the exclusivity
for a certain amount of months before
people can see it somewhere else yeah
yeah we remember the Apple the AT&amp;amp;T
Apple love relationship for so many
years exactly
yeah and and I want these companies to
do better in part because I feel like
the more we kind of let a Google or an
Amazon dictate what because this also
kind of ties into like the net
neutrality yeah stuff a little bit yeah
what what I'm worried about from those
companies perspectives the Amazon in the
Google perspective is more FTC
involvement not FCC involvement but this
this becomes like if you can arbitrarily
decide one service gets your content and
another service doesn't and you can use
that as leverage for favorable retail
space on on an organization like Amazon
that starts to crest into any trust
territory and that's not where I want to
see a Google go because then the
government needs to get involved same
thing like I don't want the government
involved in gaming but if they're gonna
teach my kids about gambling mechanics
in a Star Wars game and Disney isn't
gonna do anything about it yeah then the
government needs to get involved I would
rather the video game industry police
itself
I would rather Google and Amazon
negotiate behind the scenes not use us
as bargaining or as leverage similar to
how cable companies now have to do
with a lot of like you know NBC or CBS
when they're you know they're deciding
the boycott certain challenges
negotiations didn't go and then there
starts flooding TV with you'll start
getting ads from from your carrier price
if you want to be able to see this you
need to do this and so on
it's a visit the Comcast was like
intercepting traffic yeah eating people
ads exactly it was just basically saying
was it you're right it wasn't even that
they were feeding people ads they were
saying you need to upgrade your modem
and then nothing was wrong that's wrong
it was a it was it's that story got
buried that's how crazy news has been
yeah that a story like that cop berry is
a lot of things going on with you just
have to realize you're right they should
have taken care of it I think it's great
that we have them back on them on the on
the market itself on Amazon and the fact
that matter is that people want an
Amazon fire stick they're not going to
go and pick up a Comcast they're not
gonna go pick up your Apple TV because
it does different things than what those
other things do and that's why you buy
you buy for the integration with Amazon
and people that want chromecast I'm not
gonna look at Amazon and they're not
gonna look at an Apple TV and you know
what's what's frustrating too is I feel
there are a number of us out there and
we all you know and if you're watching
this if you're interested in this kind
of technology you probably have a family
mixed ecosystem of different operating
system iOS and Android and everything
else too
we can make an impassioned argument to
say hey Amazon I'm Amazon Prime I would
like to be able to consume Amazon
content I'm paying for that service but
you withholding it from chromecast as my
my preferred option for connecting my TV
to my phone means I'm going to use your
service less and if prime becomes less
of a good deal for me then I will stop
using prime if someone has an Apple TV
you can use their Apple TV to still
fulfill your service exactly holding it
as some kind of leverage that we're all
gonna have like five different dongles
sticking out of our TV four different
Wi-Fi connections is a foolish business
notion they're trying to leverage their
their retail presence in the living room
which doesn't make any sense to me at
all I would say get Amazon
video Amazon Prime Amazon music on
everything that you can and we started
seeing at the co2 with the mystical
within video right and video came out
with the shield TV they had Amazon video
built into it so that's that's one thing
that you realize but again they did they
struck that out is like a proprietary
partnership for one and you're like yeah
don't do that don't make me have to go
and figure out how to splice an apk I
like installing Zeigler to do something
else no no I think you're right I think
it's fine the man at the end of the day
Amazon needs to realize this is a source
of revenue if they're not looking at it
correctly you're you're basically
pushing people out by telling them look
I don't want to support your devices but
at the end of the day the market will
get what the market wants so if you
don't give it to them they'll figure out
a way to get it to work or they'll just
give up yeah no no you know we just
started streaming what is it the
marvelous miss Mazal it's a show about
like 1950 stand-up comedians that's on
Amazon as from Amazon Studios it's a
really charming show but my wife wasn't
happy figuring out how to jump through
hoops to get it on on a TV screen even
though we have a vizio smart connected
TV it's the wasn't I mean she gets
chromecast she gets Apple TV we don't
have an Apple TV but you know we have
enough Apple family hell you just go
boop boop and it's flying
Oh chromecast I hit the little square
thing in the corner and it's playing
alright Amazon how do I log in look for
it and then search and use if you don't
have the right remote
you can't talk to it the right way let's
use the keyboard so first a lot of
things and then you know with their but
if you notice actually nothing else
Amazon did kind of copy chromecast with
their latest fire TV mm-hmm that was a
straight copy you just got the square
over a circle kind of thing you know oh
I see it's totally different cuz the
icon that's our goal not the same
they're getting into that market I think
that's probably also why they're kind of
conserving look we can sell their
products we can keep it and you know I
think chromecast also hasn't been
updated for about a year or so so we're
probably due to see something new and
hopefully will be some new stuff we can
we can move the needle on that um two
quick stories that I just kind of want
to touch and we don't spend a lot of
time on them i vivo actually made a
little news recently
really
that we posted this on pocket now pocket
calm and it seems like they will
actually be the first manufacturer to
properly integrate the fingerprint
sensor under the display the display
glass and this is something that I've
been kind of running into some
frustration like iPhone 10 and you spend
time with a knife I just kind of laid
with that I had it for about a month
it's it's a nice device okay I'm gonna
say it's a nice device so 20 2017
represented ones cranky spectrum of
change for change sake where we get the
Galaxy SAE and there's that pulse
vibration motor this or the home button
but we didn't have the fingerprint
sensor so it moved it off-center to the
back same thing with the note kind of
bugs me still just because I want that
spectracal design then Apple coming up
with I feel own an akward set of
gestures to replace functionality that
really wasn't broken especially for how
good their their haptic feedback is that
the their vibration motor is they
already were training people about force
pressing in the screen or such and it's
still there you can still do four starts
which is the weird part about it so they
didn't take that part away no but they
took the fingerprint sensor away so it's
like in the home button which was
already a virtual button anyway yeah it
wasn't really a yeah you haven't been
able to click on an iPhone since the 6
and the 6 plus was the last ones they
had a probably a like a full-functioning
button and the 7 way would that yeah
it's basically just a touch it's sensor
it's a Sony yeah yeah it's a great phone
it has it has a lot of good things going
forward the form factor was a little bit
too small for me I appreciated the 5.8
inch display but I didn't like the fact
that it was the size of an iPhone 7 or
an 8 for that matter I like the bigger
devices bigger phones everything I carry
I like the you know I want to have a
bigger screen and I think probably next
year we'll see something a little bit
bigger I think overall the iPhone 10 for
what you get from the difference between
it and the 8 plus I think your ne VA
plus is the better I think I think
honestly at the end of the day you get
the same performance you get the great
camera in the back you're not gonna lose
on the bouquet effect and you don't have
any Mochis but I think that's a time
thing we'll see that on the road it's
it's really software there's nothing
special about it
that's the there really is no reason for
it to stay on the 10 I think
right other than the again exclusive for
a certain amount of time so really it's
a great phone great cameras the portrait
mode gets better as time goes on and the
gestures it doesn't it just doesn't feel
right but after a couple weeks you get
used to it like the I did like a whole
series of videos how I thought every
company screwed up on my personal
channel screwed up sorry exactly and and
people were like oh totally you're used
to it it's $1,000 phone yeah I should
not have to get used to change for
change sake at that price this should be
a device that adapts to how I wanted to
infuse it natural evolution and Apple as
a company is built so much of their wrap
on I'm used the word intuitive that
familiarity hmm yeah we've never changed
how you operate an iPhone just for the
sake of changing something and there was
no reason especially picking up a galaxy
there was no reason why we couldn't have
emulated the home button experience for
iPhone users in a similar way but this
kind of full circle and really
roundabout way I ramble getting us back
to vivo and again being one of the first
companies to accomplish the familiarity
of that front home button you're in
sensor yeah because we heard also that
iPhone was trying to do it as well oh
yeah many rumors about it trying to be
part of the 10 but that never made it
there but and I love forget who it was
how crud it was one of the top Apple
executives coming over god no we were
never working we always meant to just go
straight to face ID because we're Apple
and we don't make mistakes that's a
discussion for a different yeah it's a
whole whole server by dad but so vivo
again not that the top not that the most
recognized a reputation in the United
States but a very competitive force
internationally especially in Asian
markets do you think these features will
move the needle like do you think
consumers are gonna appreciate I now
have more screen on the front face and I
still have my normal fingerprint sensor
gesture or do you think it's well my
favorite brand moved it to the back so
obviously that's the preferred way to do
things now
the fanboy ISM is gonna win or do you
think that the acknowledgement of that
muscle memory is gonna help sell more
it's gonna be it's gonna be an
interesting so I think the best thing
that's the way they look at it is the
the way it gets implemented people
implement it in the right way and does
the navigation around it correctly yeah
because the big problem about this is
it's behind the display where your
finger generally will rest so if you
have it there but you don't put a home
button behind it meaning it's just
sitting there behind the fingerprint
sensor yeah and it's activating certain
things so that's gonna be kind of like
the UI and I think the weird part about
it is and I'd hate to bring back Apple
into the discussion Apple doesn't
necessarily bring the new tech into the
market right a make it right it's the
best way to explain it is I think they
polished the edges ology edges enough on
it so that it makes it into a functional
thing so this idea even though has some
concerns the implementation is very nice
I think vivo being gen1 should be really
looked at as Jen one expects some
growing pains expect some kind of some
concerns out of the door but they're
going to be the ones to bring it to
market so you need to appreciate that so
I think there's gonna be the fanboy ISM
and where we go in and jump in we take a
look at it and we may be super critical
about it but at the end of the day we're
gonna appreciate that they started it
and they're gone especially with some of
the stuff that we're seeing also with
as9 and we're not seeing the fingerprint
under the classroom I've seen it in in
the back and it much you know maybe
Pleasant placement so I would appreciate
I would love to try it out check it off
and see how how it's done and then you
know dream of how it can go upwards from
there that's the best way to and then
also just kind of interesting that this
is a Chinese manufacturer leading the
way on one of these yeah I mean normally
when we're talking about I'm here in the
United States we have a perspective on
companies like oneplus very reactive
companies after a new technologies been
out one plus five to the five T you know
for example yeah we don't see them so
ahead of the curve or on the pulse
because they're making they're they're
making their market in a completely
different way which is about like cost
savings and cost savings you can't do
this exactly and so seeing a VEVO
branded phone lead with a feature like
this I think it's just kind of an
interesting commentary on what I think
the changing shape of the international
market is going to look like over the
next year's
let's save that for when we're talking
about Samsung yeah um one other just
quick story before we hit that Samsung
block I even took me a couple minutes to
even pull it out of the crazy case yeah
I blackberry proved dead does I know
dead dad end-of-life no more updates
go on it's pulling the phone out it was
it kind of it's always nice revisiting
this this build it's an amazing build I
die it's love I love the device I love
the slider the the mech the mechanism is
built in perfectly they displayed a body
ratio you had that perfect display size
right in front of you you slide it up
you got the keyboard you don't want to
use the on-screen keyboard you have to
worry about it and it kept it you know
reasons we get to go yeah exactly you
didn't have to get that bulky extra
attachment case like you know Samsung
sometimes will sell sometimes they
generate a version of most of us don't
see it but there's the you know keyboard
case that gets released with I really
hope that the the kids who said the
development community does actually take
this on and start helping you know give
it some life although with the fact that
blackberries so kind of locked and the
way they do things I just it's I think
some of the security stuff on there
would probably get in the way yeah well
that's the first things unless you were
to do is completely gut it exactly lose
a lot of don't worry about blackberry
you know you just want to get the next
update on this you can move forward
there is always gonna be a risk
obviously but yeah security stuff
whenever you safety net you know you
brick safe unit that's not much you
could do they're relying on safety net
they do set it up correctly but if you
want the hardware you want the you know
new software there's no reason why not
the report isn't it's a physical
keyboard it's not software so you gave
me that really the the big problem with
that phone was it had nothing to do with
blackberry it was they entered the into
the android market during the Qualcomm
8:10 8:08 era and then there was yeah
the whole man that phone ran hot that
phone see this is like one of the few
this phone was scary if you had it on
and plugged in and it started updating
your apps oh man yes battery would crank
and it would still lose charge oh yeah
yeah it was just it didn't have enough
because you had so many things drawing
power and this charge wasn't fast enough
Oh scary the last ones to have you know
micro-usb sorry this microUSB I get
cranky when I have to charge like
bluetooth headphones now how where that
something else got come on yeah I gotta
get myself a big pair but that's also
why I've just been happy to see the
other pathway the the resurgence of TCL
manufacturing with the key one I can't
wait to see what key to brings I again I
saw my first key one out in the wild oh
wow okay
I again it was it was another sort of
just like I'm at my my daughter's
pediatricians office and some dude just
pulls it out starts to happen it's like
how great is that keyboards again I know
it was just like the mid nineties just
like yeah yeah I'm sad to see that but
hopefully we'll see some new things and
I'm hoping they do generate generate a
new design or at least bring something
familiar familiar to this yeah or
similar to it because it it's very nice
it's very nice it feels great in the
hand and literally if it had better
internals maybe you'd love it better as
far as the power consumption and as well
charging could do a lot better I I would
hope so and especially just for its it's
one of those nostalgic companies I don't
understand a world where blackberry
doesn't exist I want to see them just
you'll continue you know exactly and
exciting when they do something well
like you know our expectations are so
low and then a phone like the q1 comes
out and people will make I was on set
for a new egg now yesterday now I was
talking about it and they're like well
yeah but I mean like keyboards like you
don't know until you use it we've had
that much time since the keyboards went
away yeah you but you go back to
something it's so awkward for the first
day and then without even thinking about
it looking you start typing you start
it's you pull it out of a pocket and you
hold down one button and it
automatically starts calling or
automatically launches an app and it's
there waiting for you before you're even
looking at the screen and you're like
and then I'm looking at like $1000
iPhones like I have to hold it up to my
face and then it unlocks and then I can
use it Apple and that seems backwards
yeah trying to use
you have to get and then he actually had
it was about 80 maybe 90 percent success
rate with the with the camera it's not
being able to do face ID but yeah trying
to get in when you're in the store you
just do this to kind of look at it make
sure it unlocks then you double press
and again it just looks like it's it's
gen1 it's it's change it's changed so
wanna change looks great yeah but it's
it's a change for change sake so I'm
gonna take it we're gonna take a quick
break here just to hit our sponsor block
if I can pull this up I have way too
much I'm actually running this from my
laptop and it seems to be doing okay
that's right now but it's it's a little
over work it so I'm gonna go to the
phone screen for this but this episode
of the pocket now weekly is brought to
you by the number one New York Times
bestselling author James Rollins the
thrilling new novel the demon crown
often compared to Clive Cussler and
Michael Crichton Rollins combines real
science and history with cutting-edge
military action off the coast of Brazil
a team of scientists discovers a horror
like no other I have problems with that
word horror they didn't discover a never
mind an island where all life has been
eradicated consumed and possessed by a
species beyond imagination to save
mankind's future the members of Sigma
Force must make a devil's bargain and
join forces with their most hated enemy
is that so awesome
even if it means sacrificing one of
their own it's great place join in on
the wildly successful Sigma 4 series
Roland's latest Sigma first novel is one
of the best of the series says book
lists and publishers weekly calls it
bone-chilling and we might be using this
as a future episode for my book podcast
the geek book club but I think we're
gonna be adding this to our calendar so
get started with videos audio and more
james rollins comm definitely check out
the website if you're interested in the
Sigma 4 series he's got a lot of other
things on there that kind of helps
supplement the the stories themselves
some really cool audio files interview
stuff like that so definitely want to
check it out once again James Rollins
comm and check out the demon crown and
we thank them for supporting the pocket
now weekly
okay um so how you wanna you want to
talk about some Samsung I do want to
talk some Samsung but I do want to take
a real quick circle back oh yeah I made
a small mistake
I'm not we do have four million you've
got a clarification we do have four K on
the grabby hands so it's switching back
to the back camera
you got a yet and then going to the
settings so it does have 4k four by
three aspect ratio you have to learn
that okay where's the video and swipe
and he came come on man what are you
doing I know I know I'm slipping now I
really you had me you had me wondering
so I like it I mean hey let me double
check I have the phone sitting right
there but this is the European model so
that's Susan I just want to see on the
boat game mode we're gonna hire this
this is this is like literally the worst
audio for the people listening to the
podcast is watching two people I think
use the camera to listen to two people
using the camera actually the bouquet on
this did really well like I said what I
found that as long as you get your
subject centered correctly and you have
enough of a contrast between the
foreground the background it does
presume here's like one of the problems
is behind you right now is an open
window of the whole bunch of trees and
leaves and light yeah it didn't mess up
the stitch the cutting yeah you can cut
you out well it it actually did that and
then look at the microphone in the
foreground it didn't blend that into you
know that's surprisingly good yeah 200
on our phone I wouldn't have expected no
I keep calling them stitching errors no
cutting cutout errors and we're even um
my my pixel had a few issues yeah busy
backgrounds like that I would just look
a little bit around the top part there's
a little bit of it's a little um a
little stair stepped yeah white again
for when you try to post as a social
media for in $200 exactly I'm pretty
impressed but yes let's jump into
Samsung right now so I want to kick this
off first just again another short
little news blip I do you need another
smart speaker in your home yes you do
because he is coming to a smart speaker
rumored to cost around $200 we'll
probably be getting more news on this
around CES
it's actually pretty pretty decent but
again we question is this really the the
killer app because I think what Bixby is
done well on Galaxy phones has very
little to do with like The Voice Actions
that I rely on Guk for Google now yeah
no different you get different exposure
the Bixby sort of macro is actually
pretty compelling that that has actually
become a use that I happen to and that I
like yes is automatically controlling
and switching settings and stuff its
built-in exactly it does exactly what
does that really hasn't been able to
reach and so I wonder what does a
speaker bring to the table that you know
an echo or a Google home yeah isn't
already trying to bridge that gap
between IOT manufacturers smart home
manufacturers and tying all these things
together is is that Samsung's in is it
that is just it's so raw right now for
smart home that they can maybe do their
what is it they're smart things mark
things is there there a built-in help
and which works really well with Google
home and even with the Lexus systems I
think that's probably what they're
trying to tie into it's it's pretty much
just as straight we haven't been able to
basically give our users access to you
know the smart things outside of you
know install an app on your phone or you
and integrate it with you Google home
they want to have that ability and say
look we can control your entire home
with that one hub yeah they just
partnered up with Nvidia to be able to
bring that over you can just bring the
smartthings hub to the Nvidia shield so
you can okay you don't have to even buy
the entire hub you just buy a dongle you
plug it into the back of the shield it
uses the internals for power and you run
automation you know turning on lights
setting timers and all of those things
and I think that's gonna be their
approach is it gonna do more than what
Google home or Alexa can do right now I
don't think so I don't think there's
much for them to do because their
ecosystem isn't set up that way but
that's he lets you set up macros on the
fly and then I think we've got
interesting because right now we
couldn't do that that's where I mean
that we don't have like you can tell you
know your speaker to say hey I want
light XYZ to turn on every day at 7:00
p.m. and turn off at and every you know
next day at 6:00 a.m. if you could do
that or the office is right there doing
it then dad would be there a little bit
of heads-up I think that's what they
need to focus if they have automation
ahead of what the other guys are doing
because right now Google home can take
two commands at the same time gotcha
and that's a you know Amazon can't do
anything like that and just ability when
I go into the office and I start my
shoots in the morning I go and I say
turn on those lights and turn off these
lights and I have the Mac the the
configuration set that these are the
main lights and then turn on my desk
lights and my camera and all that stuff
I don't have to touch anything as I'm
setting up things and putting things on
the table and getting rounds done I
think that's what gonna be there now do
you think Bixby might be a part of a
grander ecosystem strategy when we look
at all the other like Samsung appliances
you know again tapping into washer and
dryers later introduced didn't they
introduce an AI component into one of
their washing machines I really want to
believe that I that that was it like
Aoife that they had yeah I don't think
they did it as see us I think LG did
something like that last year CES when
they were trying to bring into their
little robot and they try to bring their
there they talked more about their home
home devices but I think well yeah but
keeping my also they have their
refrigerators they have that you know
then tablet with it a refrigerator in
great things be there but it wasn't easy
but it was a big B III I'm spacing on
this bad and I probably should have
looked it up for our show notes but I
really believe I think it was something
like hey I special AI system just for
their washing machine I'm gonna have to
look that up like your washing machine
will know what to do washing machine
knows all about your dirty drawers so
you gotta gotta look out literally but
like in a creepy way
two of the bigger stories Samsung this
year I think we can kind of combine
these in a way to galaxy s 9 renders
yeah not a lot of surprises no no it's
it's gonna be a small I say yeah it's
gonna dual cameras the one thing I was
happy to see in the renders headphone
jack there were those rumors that maybe
Samsung was thinking about walking away
I think I think they've had a good
recipe for hardware the dual lens was a
natural thing we see it every year right
whenever the road that comes in that
small speck bump that you got in the
note comes into the next version of the
s and the S kind of brings in the next
CPU new RAM
configuration and then we'll always kind
of push the envelope with Laroy anymore
I think the fingerprint sensor if they
if the renders are true would be nice
yes very nice finally something that
makes perfect sense because to this day
I can I've mastered it on the right hand
which is weird but if as you guys know
we use our devices in many different
positions a lot of times I actually use
my vise with my left hand actually I got
better at it typing even I always
confused with a fingerprint sensor is
analytical for the lens because my mind
always thinks the lens you have to reach
where where the finger is and it's the
mirrors the same message tells the left
hand to do what the right hand is so
learning and relearning and trying to
reconfigure it oh dude you're making a
big deal out of it you know always just
totally get used to it
I do tend to yeah definitely yeah that's
we're not saying you I mean I'm saying
if you're if you're persuaded to leave
angry comments on YouTube videos about
people who don't like the fingerprint
sensor location that that might be a you
problem yeah but um no I really happy to
see that vertical stripe in general so
moving the cameras vertically and having
the fingerprint sensor live underneath
makes perfect sense for a bone is that
it's lean long tall water since we'll
have to we'll have really good internals
and you know curved display
yeah sure they're not gonna lose that oh
definitely not but I just mean like it's
it's it's an awkward aesthetic I look at
the note and I see that horizontal chunk
for the camera sensor camera module on a
phone that's long lean and tall and so
seeing them switch that if they go
vertically like that like Huawei's gone
with their cameras again so I got a lot
of people hating on the fact that I
called the may 10 pro the nicest
designed phone 2017 and it's all because
of symmetry so even the the the
autofocus sensor and the flash bridging
the cameras an identical oval no cutouts
with the vertical mounting of the camera
sensors directly above the fingerprint I
mean like every every fraction of a
millimeter of that phone is on point
and while galaxy doe I'm not saying
Galaxy devices look like garbage I'm
just saying there is this asymmetry
happening and that knocks it out of
we're talking about $900 phones we're
yeah
we're all ready for it the most critical
and market some tiny little details even
just a little bit off it will be the
determining factor why it's a bigger
deal that if you have $100 burner and if
the rumors are and they're able to work
it out you could potentially have that
comparison yeah early 2018 oh definitely
before the you know the note 9 or
whatever the next iteration the note
comes in you could potentially have the
ability looking at both the device and
say which one you think looks better
yeah nuts again not knocking on Samsung
design they make beautiful phones great
design but I am knocking the finger it
ya know I'm a big fan when I was at the
UK for the honour of and I streamed for
Anna 45 minutes to the livestream you
know date follow device yeah audio
quality picture quality back facing
camera front facing camera everything's
switch and it was just a champ that's
why I like them but I'm you know at the
end of the day when you have so many
this you know selection all running the
8:35 or comparable processors you know
when you talk over to the care inside so
your own you you have to kind of figure
out whatever you feel like it looks
better in your hand alright but I think
we can we can definitely point to the
fingerprint sensor being the absolute
objective cause of Samsung's terrible
market slip um it's really the
explanation is they mess of the
fingerprint sensor and people aren't
buying their phones and that's that's
yeah crash and burn that's and you know
it's it's probably worse than what
happened to the note seven last year and
we're obviously being facetious /s I
don't know like what else to say to make
sure that you guys know we're being
sarcastic no it's um this is a story and
we were talking about this a little
before the podcast I started the
frustration of the click Beatty headline
we were even at pocket now we played the
same game where it's like Samsung's
market chairs totally slipping against
Apple and Chinese manufacturers when we
actually look at the sales data though
Samsung sales have been remarkably
strong considering what happened them at
the end of 2016 cuz you gotta keep in
mind you need to look at as a whole not
necessarily just Samsung the phone
manufacturer yeah because that's not so
when we think of Samsung to us we think
note and San gallons just think the fact
is they're hardware and it was trying to
make mine very quiet
I just whenever I went very smooth on
the side this podcast not brought to you
by Lucroy no but ya know what we have
here essentially is the presence of
their hardware and other manufacturers
yeah and you need to realize that they
make great panels a lot of people
realize are the sensors okay that the
panels that we have on on this on our
devices and that's really where you're
noticing a lot of the increase you know
how are they being you know are there is
there other manufacturers on the market
that are basically you know starting the
game market chair yes
it's an evolution every year every once
in a while when you don't change you
know your design you're gonna have some
companies they're gonna creep up a
little bit and then you know they'll
have their own or they'll carve up their
own market I think well I was doing
great so this is this is the frustrating
aspect of focusing in or overly focusing
in on one ill-defined metric yeah market
share is a very fluid way to describe
the smartphone ecosystem and looking at
the worldwide numbers of sales so it can
totally be true because I think Samsung
sales are still growing like they're
they're facing some of the high-end
plateau that Apple has faced but we're
still seeing an uptrend we're not seeing
a downtrend so it can still be
completely true that Samsung sales have
never been stronger but they're still
building their user base yeah they're
actually user base is still growing but
in facing more competition from Chinese
manufacturers emerging LTE markets
around the world that high-end premium
and even their mid-range options are
gonna face a wall up of competition from
Huawei Oppo and jemmye oh no definitely
yeah you know a lot of a lot of they
actually they really so many devices
every year most people don't talk too
much about them but yeah they're a line
devices I mean it when you go to CSU see
all of their devices and you see that in
the main top and the esses and they you
know denote line but it just that's what
it is yeah I mean there's there's more
options and I think that's what this is
what's going to be within 18 we're gonna
see a lot more resurgence or not a
resurgence but like a flurry of new
manufacturers coming into the market
with great hardware comparable prices I
mean may not have the same you know the
run with the kitchen sink kind of thing
but you'll you'll see some good
competition I think that'll be really
good I'm hoping that'll bring a new
market into that middle ground because
we have the budget devices that Alex
500 bucks price point right I mean how
crazy is that discussion right now yeah
and I am like a thousand dollars off to
$600 is now the mid-range
the lobster it wasn't even a lobster pot
effect it's two years where we flip the
switch on well now a top-end phone is
$1,000 yeah but this discussion wasn't
even we weren't even talking this way
the beginning of the year which is the
weird part about this is a state here
well it's sinking that Apple was gonna
do something big it was always on the
radar but it was I was like oh that's on
the horizon and then it snuck up on us
really yeah and the iPhone 10 was
released and nobody was surprised there
was a thousand bucks but the reality is
yet no you'd expect Apple to do that but
then you see the note come in at 950 I'm
like whoa and then you know and then so
with tax both of these in the US and you
know some of you guys are not in the US
may not realize but $1,000 isn't just
$1,000 like 1,100 bucks after you factor
in tax yeah and even with the note no
this is over $1,000 when you fact that
any meaning unless you have some kind of
subsidy with your carrier which not that
many carriers they're not really doing
now most carriers are doing zero
interest loans they're still gonna pay
yeah yeah just okay no full price of
that phone they're just gonna carve it
up for you and not turn interest yeah so
you're still gonna pay $1,000 that's 500
550 to 600 to a thousand that became an
open market now yeah there is a there is
a gap now that's called I think that
will be what it's like maybe not
flagship but like a premium premium I'm
just I'm still I'm still gonna do this
and it's gonna piss off so many people
that watch our videos but I look at the
market and I say you have a reasonable
smartphone experience from around 150
dollars for his entry level now and the
end player the base model version of the
top-end phone is a thousand yeah in
between a hundred and fifty dollars and
a thousand is somewhere around that five
to six hundred dollar tier that's the
mid-range razors luck about 700 and so
it's now when we get to like seven $800
we are cresting into flagship territory
or the high-end market and at that like
3 to $400 word that blurred line between
just entry-level fare and the beginnings
of what could be called your mid
repeated range yeah but if 500 you're
smack-dab in the middle like it'll be
just
see what time sometimes with the s-line
the price point because if they're
bringing the the features that you had
on the note 8 that were justified to
basically get you into that 900
something you may be seen
yeah and against Apple you can't
undercut your price too much because
then psychologically people are gonna
look at that and go oh well it's not as
good yeah so because apples made this
play to a thousand dollars and because
the note was already priced above 900 I
really don't see where you can launch a
Galaxy s8 the little s 8 below 7 maybe
750 like there's no way you can make
that that pricing argument because then
people are gonna look well the iPhones
$1000 so it's $300 more better than a
galaxy s 9 which is so frustrating that
that's kind of the emotional impact of
consumerism on our tech space but I
really think that I'll be surprised if
the galaxy s 9 the smaller galaxy s 9
punch is significantly below $7.99 meet
you know definitely especially in the US
because they can also release with 64
gigs of internal storage you're gonna be
yeah I think we are we are moving
forward and hopefully we'll see the 845
but we'll see
I'd be surprised if they I mean I feel
like the same thing will probably happen
this year is what happened with the 8:35
where Samsung sort of sucks most of the
wind out of the market for the early
batches of that just pretty much what
they did yeah and then but everybody
else ended up getting the well but but
again Samsung had that being first for a
good chunk of time yeah you know because
their only other competition was the g6
with the 821 that was the thing yeah but
the GC C Series is always a year behind
so you never expected geez seriously
just come in there the last few the t5
and the g6 both came wood last year CPUs
the g5 was in 820 it was the 821 we came
in on the b20 so the eight meet you know
the V 20 was in 822 yeah so it's like
the g6 was the first one that actually
interrupted that the g5 launched a
little bit after the S but it was also
an 824 that I mean every every
manufacturer was trying to get as far
away from the a-10 as they could and so
that's right
that's right that's right the 810 was
the one people wanted to run away from
and so and so LG made the play on the g5
it was just they they sacrificed build
quality for modularity hilarity and and
that's you know I know a lot of people
are talking boot loops on V tens and g4
is the LG that gave me the most problems
with the g5 I went through three of them
and the one that I had that worked for
the the wrap-up on our review now
doesn't work so I've gone through three
and I have three bricks now in g5 land
and I know they're modular but they're
modular met the friends modules were to
the United States we've got our via no
DAC but not for you know I'm so like I
literally couldn't be happier with my
b10 right now but it's it's still it's
like I've got to call them out I got a
call LG out on like you've got to work
on that I've got to work on your
distribution and especially your couple
markets still good
not in the US but not in at least South
America did receive them I put out a
video and I was like my one cry because
we got vno headphones last year yeah and
this year like nothing though I got
headphones tumor serious the US is the
one that you don't give it to because we
don't like music or something I don't
get it when especially when the one of
the biggest selling points that you can
really market it's so rare that you have
a phone where you can point to a feature
which is objectively the best yeah and
LG has one feature that is objectively
better than any other manufacturer on
the market that these and they're not
advertising it and now they don't even
include something in the hardware in the
box to take advantage of it include the
DAC like you want a blog you want to
open the phone it's that new box I've
got to find some earbuds but ya know I
hope I hope definitely that we know
we'll see we'll see some new new
surprises it's gonna be obviously an
incremental upgrade yeah but you know
the 8:45 would be nice just to see that
and I know you guys know some comforts
on that as well yeah with the summit
over I may have made the trek out - oh
poor guy had to spend a week in Maui I'm
sure
I was jerk oh my vixen - camera takes
amazing sunset photos with its hdr+ mode
weight and the warm sand
oh this is the warm Pacific Ocean waters
there was nice although I have to seal
for them it was very windy poor guy yeah
poor guy I know I love Hawaii my Maui's
my favorite but yeah no definitely 8:45
looks almost my name is travelpod casket
is a channel podcast let me tell you
about port Empire ah let me tell you
about London in December no it's a
beautiful place I lucked out I didn't
actually make it their windows snow
alright stop snowing a few days before I
got in there and after I left
it's too brown a little California which
I brought some little bit of heat and a
little stand there looking like freezing
force I'm from Southern California 85
degrees out right now guys I'm actually
overdressed for the weather right so
yeah
it's December that's beginning to look a
lot like September so galaxy s 9 rumors
I hope that these are on point these are
the kinds of changes that I think makes
sense for the Galaxy S series and I
think they fulfill a lot of the
evolutionary issues I've had since the
SX
okay so s7 I think was probably the
perfect 16 by 9 smartphone yeah I still
don't like glass back devices so I I'm
pretty much I just have to give up on
that fight because I don't think any
other manufacturers are really gonna
come back we're gonna get quite a few
especially with wireless if you're gonna
try to bring that in well cuz I was like
you know you could make Kevlar or go
back to leather or something interesting
and call it a premium man so you brought
the g4 back in my mind all right
yeah nice motox moto x - moto maker
yeah I mean these people have heard me
prattle on way too much about my Captain
America Moto X - over there but anyway
these types of things finally I think
fulfilling all of the little issues in
the the final design language for that
phone we have a problem in Samsung land
though that I think
Apple users can commiserate with in very
expensive premium products top of the
market
can we still count on consumers
following Samsung's I think
manufacturers are hoping that a
significant chunk of their user base are
gonna follow yearly mm-hmm we know that
the average amount of time that someone
holds onto their smartphone is now past
two years which means there are
significant chunk of people who are
holding onto their phones probably out
to three years now yeah that's galaxy s6
territory yeah so do we think that those
people are looking at the s9 the same
way that iPhone 6 users might be looking
at an iPhone aid that could be the
pretend that could be the reality and
actually it's weed that you brought it
up because one point I changed my
devices a little bit more frequently a
little bit when I talk to people at
stores and I talk to people and I say
like I switched me my permit from the
Samsung LG to a huawei 2 and they're
like you spent some time with the razor
phone an amazing phone and it's you're
right people are carrying their phones a
lot longer I do see or walk around I see
s7 even as 5s I even I know person was
on set with the sound guy he had a fight
on iPhone 5s and he's like I'm not
getting rid of it yeah there's really
not much it's crazy we're hitting that
point with the hardware that the
hardware realistically is just still
good yeah there's no reason that the you
know these Snapdragon 800 it's warm I
mean there's nothing you know it'll
still keep up with most of things that
you're gonna do it may not have the
right thing as a sensor or the camera I
still revisit my v10 you know that well
the v10 is I think it's a point in time
that a lot of us kind of need to
appreciate it's a beginning of a line
for velji that brought in durability
audio quality and just a great combo mm
and they kept on it and they're moving
forward it's not I mean we varied a
little bit on the 20 and the 30 like
varied a lot but I think you know this
is this will be the basically the point
where people want to upgrade they want
to say oh it's a big enough of an
upgrade from what you have you know
you're getting that you know the much
different display if you're from the s5
going in you're getting glass first time
you're getting a really good battery in
the s6 and
six plus I think they had some concerns
with battery well they went been over
battery the battery's kept getting
smaller but they're getting better
processors now better operating system
to give you longer battery life so it it
would be good hopefully people can you
know be Hulu and recognize loriel to her
brand it's a big jump because if they
remember what the pays for the s5 and
then they're like what no that upgrade
is not the same in that multiple layer
you know so well and I know from
Samsung's perspective I'm sure if they
were looking at like s5 users they would
have hoped like okay well s7 would have
been their upgrade yeah and but that
still it doesn't quite jell like you do
the s5 to s7 to s9 jump or you're like
my mom's still on her s5 the screen is
starting to flicker like the phone is
starting to die she doesn't want to get
rid of it the idea of an iPhone upgrade
is just stress like it's just she's it's
it also goes back to the data transfer a
lot of people are concerned with the
amount of data they have on their phones
yeah when you care that's why about a
year year and a half their concern is
how do I transfer they're not really
familiar now that transferring data from
a not Samsung to a Samsung pretty easy
oh yeah
extremely but you don't know that until
you take up line exactly it was really
hard to get do a whole video on that so
it was a part of my video coverage for
the note 8 where for the first time I
didn't set it up fresh like I actually
did one of these data transfers
literally the very first time I've ever
I've really ever played with that cuz
any time I've tried and I just I want it
clean I want it new I want to like take
me out of the box and let's see the
horsepower that's your horsepower
without any of the box but then also
realizing like so many of the people
watching aren't gonna be first-time
smartphone buyers they're not gonna
they're gonna want to just transfer over
as quickly so I think so I finally take
the plunge
um but your point about price is
actually is actually legit too because I
think one of the things that that is
scaring my mom off I mean using her as a
specific example is she got her s5
towards the end of the first year of the
s5 life got it on a great deal because
it wasn't as popular as on the phone as
previous ones and it had things that she
cared about like
the the more grippy durable backplate
there's a lot of resistance even though
I had a flap it was still first like
it's a true for a in the water
resistance for a flagship and then she
picks up and has set in sae and it's
curvy slippery glass it's it feels less
durable it feels more brittle it feels
like it'll break if it hits the ground
for two second and so she was really
interested in maybe going I say active
that was yeah until she saw that it was
gonna be a $900 price tag and then it
was like well I'm just gonna stick with
my s5 and you're like well unfortunately
the more you wait the more expensive
your options are gonna get the less the
last updates you're gonna be getting the
more vulnerable you're gonna be running
your device those are the things that
people keep in mind yeah you can keep
your device for a certain amount of time
but once you start getting updates
security updates patches and stuff like
that those are the things you want to
keep in mind there's a security factor
that is you put a lot of your personal
information there so you keeping yeah
keeping it up-to-date keeping it with at
least something that's reasonable within
the last two years keep it within an
update cycle that most manufacturers was
thinking to I think is a benefit to you
as a person so I think she's weighing
benefit against what activity she does
put on and a $900 price tag for her to
have that brand exactly again and so you
know I recently did a trip to the UK and
I sent her with a 6 X mm-hmm unlocked
because we were having some issues with
her carrier just making sure she could
do like a local SIM if she wanted to I
didn't have any problems the honor the
hunter 6x was a heady competitor for her
she was way less concerned if that phone
got broke because she knew like how much
it cost and it didn't actually cost me
anything because it was a review phone
um but this is also one of those things
we're looking at through the impact on
the market and what these companies are
doing to try and I think keep the
emotions running high the wow factor
running high at a time where I feel like
consumers are kind of cooling off I
don't feel like you know we're in the
were quite there yet I've we've had the
conversation before over dinner
the post smartphone world like what
comes next and we're not there yet but
we're really stinking close and I think
one of the things that's that's a
difficult challenge for companies trying
to talk directly to their customers
you can't keep selling this wow factor
when we're all really well-established
smartphone consumers exactly these are
commodities now and so how do you
command a premium when there isn't the
same kind of lifestyle argument it's not
exclusive everyone has one most people
are probably looking at a top tier
option or solution and then just Lobster
potting how much they pay per month to
lease it essential yeah exactly so so
how do you make someone excited you know
like the s9 isn't gonna make people
excited whereas even the SAE people
looked at him like wow and it's really
clean then he had a bunch of people on
s7 edges going nah I'm good exactly
because they had that that's all the Ani
monk factor they changed on the s8 over
from last year's they did the curve
display they no longer have no flat
display and the curve version of it you
had that on every device and I think
that was a good move for them but that
was yeah that's kind of about it if they
move to fingerprint sensor from the back
to the middle lemon people will be
excited about that but are they gonna be
like well is it worth that extra selling
my phone that's probably gonna be and
you know there's gonna be an SM and edge
guy going yeah my fingerprint sensor is
still in the front I'm good so why do I
need an S now why would I need that's
one of those yeah the camera sensor
hasn't really changed much for them
that's the other thing they ever really
changed this dramatic thing right may
have gone down in the aperture of maybe
one point seven or four point six think
I've poured seven for a first listen s7
was one point seven also yeah but that's
what's mean is when they went down when
they went with that 12 megapixel sensor
on the back they haven't really gone and
saying oh my god this is a 16 they
stopped playing that game yeah they
focused it there and then now they
brought the dual sensors in the back so
again they're they're banking on what
works there they're reading their
metrics they're working their numbers
they know what works they know what
people want but that wow factor I know
what is gonna be that next wow you know
is it gonna be that dual display the
phone or is it gonna be that phone that
does you know what the you know orders
you know order something for you without
you and and to a point where someone
might take a risk on straining from the
manufacturer that they know yeah so like
I'm I'm a little nervous about my
mom leaving the Samsung ecosystem like
I'm not gonna recommend an LG for my
movies yeah she's so well acquainted
with what the s5 can do in the samsung
apps exactly but by the time she
upgrades Samsung software is not gonna
resemble that at all so already that's
true Samsung's as they change so many
things just for the sake of changing
things and they don't bring those
changes to older devices and so there's
really no point for her to have that
kind of brand loyalty like I could say
like maybe it is time to look or maybe
you do want to go to an iPhone if you're
facetiming with Grandma a lot maybe this
is a solution that you want to take a
look at cuz you're gonna have to relearn
everything anyway it is that's that's
the one thing that I've I've that iPhone
has had and that was it was a good and
bad thing on the I content that I found
that it's they even though they did some
innovation with the moving and the
gestures but do you I still look the
same looking at the same grid I'm still
looking at the same things we didn't get
that much different there but you're
right going from an s5 to no date or an
SI plus or even an SI it's a different
device yeah it is different there's some
resemblance in the background that we
all that kind of but it's a very little
that you can't hide and yes God will
probably have a new version of you know
with you you know Sam Sonya what what is
it called
no they don't call it test person with
Samsung experience variants the UI yeah
the UX so it's like Apple watch edition
it's something that they keep wanting to
fine-tune and make less jittery you take
out some things and fine-tune I think
it's been always a fine tuning process
but they need to bring it back bring it
back to the older devices they need to
give that access to people say look you
know we care about you
this isn't that hard for us to bring in
a launcher from one device to another
yeah at the end of the day but for me
all devices look pretty much the same
yeah we're getting Sam point where I'm
kind of phone blind yeah this entire
year it could be marker okay it could be
basically just a subtitle 8:35 four gigs
gigs of RAM and tall screen all screens
name your device that's you'll any
flagship that pretty much answers all of
those so we're getting there so we need
to see something you need to see
something different and you're right
razor for me was there was a breath of
fresh air great in the midst of all of
these 18 by 9 aspect ratios and all of
those things hundred twenty Hertz eight
gigs of ram beautiful sound yeah
speakers in the front yeah yeah that was
to me a WOW factor when I held that
phone it was like wow but I you know
again we're we have a little bit more
access to things to be able to pay
around but at the end of the day when
you're looking at all of these things
you're looking at numbers the price
factor is gonna be a big thing I think
that's what it is people have to have a
way of being able to kind of gauge and
not really get to compromise yeah no no
totally so like my dad my dad has so
they this is so funny like they bought
phones in the same era and they're still
holding on to him my dad has a galaxy
what is it it's the mini note 4 the
galaxy alpha do you remember it was the
super super skinny one that had the
metal edges and then the rubbery back
plate just like the note 4 yeah man that
was and he wanted a little phone and
you're like that was for that year the
best small form-factor
Android device but again it is starting
to go to he's got a crack screen like
they're kind of he's actually looking at
going blackberry I don't know that he's
gonna go key one but I think he's
waiting to see if he can keep his phone
running long enough to see he doesn't
want to go first-gen he wants to see
what they follow up you have Android
ecosystem isn't that different 2017 I
think started us off on a conversation
of like it's okay to maybe specialize
maybe you don't need to try and fight
Apple and Samsung with the best
all-rounder soft around the edges does
everything generally good but doesn't
excel in any one area phone and key one
I think is I am Blu Matic of one of the
best examples of that I think the rate
there becomes another great talking
point on we we are really willing to
make compromises in some areas so that
we can focus on making sure that this is
the best that it possibly can be exactly
key one we're not gonna try and impress
you with the best multimedia device of
all time and SIA but we're gonna give
you two and a half days of legitimately
two and a half days of battery life and
the best communication features that we
can pack into a phone today we're gonna
see a lot more of those I'm really
hoping that that's maybe how we can
diversify the conversation of it I think
that works to Samsung's detriment
because I still think that that Samsung
is most successful when they have a
target in mind for their demographic my
favorite phone of theirs this year was
the active they knew exactly who that
phone was for the features were built
specifically for that phone
and if you liked samsung's aesthetic mmm
why not go with the Samsung that also
has the biggest battery I was gonna say
it's the only one that has the biggest
battery he has a bigger battery than
even the know date yeah wow that's huge
exactly with the smaller the smaller
screen so it's the best of both worlds
you've got the more rugged device you
don't have to slap a case on it you've
got all of the same features there's
life that the UI is actually oh you can
run that phone a lot longer you know
Andy and supposedly people care about
those things until they found more than
one carrier this year - that was the
first year I saw that exclusivity die
and we finally are able to pick it up on
t-mobile which it's a big thing for a
lot of people because you at least now
have that option
the only gripe that I always had with it
is they always released it somewhere in
the middle a year after so many people
have invested into the s8 yeah so unless
you started with active from before it's
hard for you to justify the it's that
weird timing of the yeah I really think
like the timing on that also worked
against them because they were looking
at how they could stray from 18 t
exclusivity yeah so 18 T didn't make any
noise and we were expecting that AT&amp;amp;T
push alongside Samsung and then it never
came and they just sort of one day when
oh here it is yeah you're like okay well
that kind of shot them in the foot but
I'm hoping that means that for next year
it's part of like a three-prong you've
got like your your s9 the s9 active
splits the time between the s and the
note and then we have like a three tier
strategy coming there's a perfect time
it's a perfect time yeah summer because
that's when you want to have that super
rugged phone where you go into the beach
you're going outdoors your phone drops
you don't want to worry about that you
want to be able move forward to not have
to worry and not have to worry about
getting a case which the first thing you
have to do I mean like it's I'm not
gonna tell people not to buy the iPhone
10 but you absolutely should not buy the
iPhone 10 unless you're getting a case a
screen some kind of screen protection
and Apple care so you're a thousand
dollar phone is really Apple care $1400
glass cost you $400 the back that's
ridiculous okay we got a couple comments
here on Twitter this is using the PM
weekly hash tag from Peter Hayden
there are more options with Samsung but
oh wait I'm sorry I've got his tweets
reversed I do believe there's potential
for Bixby especially with the deep app
integration
that's an excellent point the issue is
the availability and continuity between
devices I think if Bixby were made more
widely available in Samsung could
probably properly commit then it would
compete with Google assistant there are
more options with Samsung but I'm not so
happy that they have stopped releasing
so many phones in our market where they
used to release a phone because it's
Tuesday and this made it really
difficult for a purchasing decision to
be made um I know they still have Galaxy
a series and other sort of lower end and
mid-range devices I'm kind of surprised
they didn't piggyback on the Apple
strategy of you could buy last year's
phone for cheaper cheaper yeah that
would have been that would be kind of
away from that III there's a part of me
that kind of likes that brand cohesion
of the one year old phone is still
plenty good so let's use that as our
mid-range err ya know why not because
Apple always does a really good job
about the fact that they don't ignore
their history they reduce it they lock
off a hundred bucks and the people were
like yeah nothing's wrong with the
iPhone 7 plus it looks exactly the same
just doesn't have wireless charging like
ok great ok I'm we're pretty decent cool
it you know to apples detriment this
year they also have what they're still
selling the SE the 6s the 7 the 8 and
the 10 so you've got to you've got eight
active iPhones that consumers can shop
between the different screen sizes that
I think is probably a miss its it's
gonna be something I think Bixby coming
to other devices we're gonna face
similar issues of the way Alexa had
refused
finding out because of that deep
integration of the assistant built into
your Android device that the way Bixby
is built into your Samsung device and
they have to put that button there
otherwise you wouldn't really know how
to initiate it because more initiation
only works on Samsung but when you bring
it to another ecosystem where it's not
baked into the OS you're gonna have to
push a button and I think that will be
where the smart sphere gonna make sense
right that makes a lot of sense but I
think if they can do automation on the
fly with it beat beat the other guys
automation process to add their game and
then jump the gun because they already
have smart things are things is actually
one of the best two hubs that you can
get on the market right now it's
comparably priced and it has a lot of
support from many technology and he also
supports z-wave technology it's just
really something I don't know if you've
used so knows that stuck one of the
first things we started getting when you
got into automation
you have a big ecosystem of it
well-established people like maybe used
to Vera home or some of the older yeah
and they can upgrade to a Xia to new
smart things and then the speaker can be
your gateway your hub for that I mean I
just feel like you know your speaker
could also be that for a google
assistant for a go it is there now it's
the potential of whether or not
Samsung's timing on the market makes
sense then I also have this tweet from
Andrew Wallace PN weekly my dad
literally buys replacement HTC One m8 to
cannibalize parts when he's when he has
one and he's using it and it dies I
don't know how we're going to get him to
upgrade and again like I'm kind of in
the same boat with my mom like if you
like the phone keep getting the same
phone and you're watching it just get
cheaper and cheaper and cheaper every
time so um you actually have to get
going here pretty soon so I want to wrap
us up talking a little about net
neutrality um we didn't want to make
this the main focus of the podcast
because we've obviously spent a lot of
time I think on our various social media
blogging writing and talking about and
so um the vote was from the time of this
recording the vote passed yesterday the
FCC in a three-to-two vote on party
lines the Conservatives out number
because we have a conservative president
voted to repeal title 2 regulation of
the Internet and obviously there was the
flurry of activity a lot of like dank
memes posted on Reddit you know about
how much edge a pie the current chairman
is obnoxious and has a punchable face um
I think what gets lost in that initial
fervor is one so this is policy this
policy's been voted on we we should
expect that there should be a legal
fight yeah happening do you think do you
think that if lawsuits hit that they'll
be able to enact a stay so that title to
regulation is kept while there's legal
proceeding the legal proceedings while
this is being taught in the course put a
pause definitely we've seen the legal
system being able to actually put a lot
of Hulk's on policies and things within
the content of an issue it just it
literally means that Yui as a user or us
everybody that is concerned about this
needs to voice their opinion it's not
you know we didn't lose the race
not like you just crossed the line and
that's it it's all over you need to
still be able to bring up the subject
and understand what's going on what
needs to some of the things that we've
been dealing with for so many years I
mean just the fact that matter is is
this was there to help us get a fair
experience that we don't have this we're
you know my YouTube keeps getting really
bogged down every time on AT&amp;amp;T they're
in the middle of the day it's it's funny
how like when I canceled my expanded TV
package with spectrum that my Netflix
doesn't stream as well even though my
internet download speeds have actually
gone up no I mean it's it's correlation
it's not causation no so and but those
are the things that we need to keep in
mind reality is we depend the Internet
is no longer this thing that we'd like
to have access to we depend on it on a
daily basis this is things using it it's
becoming a resource like water or power
exactly yeah you have the smartphone is
no longer this luxury thing or do you
want to get a phone with a display it's
pretty much what we most look at I mean
the feature phone or flip phone is no
longer a phone it's like you still have
you can you can you make a legitimate
argument that you could leave the house
without your wallet wallet or keys but
you might not be able to leave the house
without your smartphone exactly I will
go home I've done it in the past where
I'd left I forgot my wallet I went over
to my brother's house we had breakfast
and we were kicking it and on the way
back I forgot and I had my cars running
out of gas I didn't panic I'm I have my
phone and I didn't have my nobody I went
inside paid with my with Samsung pay got
gas and went home I didn't care about it
and the reality is it's a resource and
what they're doing right now is they're
saying as though we don't want to be
able to you know manage it like a
resource they're thinking okay this
isn't it no but it is a utility yeah
well and I think they're blurring the
line I've mentioned this before too the
difference between a telecommunication
service and an information service yeah
and it's like just because Time Warner
has an investment in content doesn't
mean that the pipe that gets you onto
the Internet is also an information
service that's like the same as having a
phone yeah or having running water or
electricity at this point that's that's
the real access this is the access this
is the the way you get to all of those
things and what they did this this week
or with the decision that went through
which
it's a really really kind of get
immunity at the core is didn't listen to
the users no they in fact it was it
wasn't even that they disregarded us is
that we can find videos of their actual
deliberation where they're laughing at
the comments that they have received
from from the FCC website and then we
had a edgy PI's ridiculous video things
you can still do on the internet I still
bought a burrito like you just its
rage-inducing but I feel it with purpose
because I feel if we're just directing
our ire at how much he's obnoxious then
we're not actually being productive and
how we can fix the problem exactly and
so focusing on on chairman pie is a
waste of energy because he has obvious
contempt and disdain for the actual
citizenry citizenship that are trying to
join the conversation in earnest he is
not an agent of actual functioning
government he is a occupying a position
to kind of prove the hypothesis that
government can't work right it's it's
something that yeah the playground was
not a fair playground yesterday I mean
you totally basically saw the train
wreck and you're just watching it as
opposed to chairman wheeler we we had
the expectation that Tom wheeler was
gonna well for the telecommunications
industry because he came out of telecoms
and instead what we got was a fairly
well reasoned individual who I didn't
agree with all of his policy but when it
came to things like basic consumer
protections we were in agreement on a
lot of how he enacted Title 2 hmm
especially how we fought for title 2 so
I think moving forward what do you think
are some of the outcomes that people can
turn to like actually investing energy
in some kind of positive outcome um I I
know there's we need to have this
catharsis where we stomp our feet and we
yell and we shout and we make art our
tasty memes about how much Egypt pie
sucks
um but once we get through this sort of
weekend or something else will come up
and you know and we know that there's
gonna be other news it's going to be
crazy out of politics it's gonna eclipse
this for the general populace out there
this is what keeps happening to the net
neutrality debate is
know that the tax bill is gonna occupy
you know healthcare is gonna occupy
media those are like topless fear that
they're together situations but net
neutrality deserves to be on the list of
things people pay attention to what do
you think are some of the things that
people can invest their energy in for
hopefully a more positive outcome I
think it's just be more mindful of what
things are going on understanding what's
going on with the internet with with the
services that you're going if you seem
concerned you seem like you see issues
with providers you see you know we start
seeing that whole you know certain
packages for certain speeds right and
these things where they're basically
flat out and one comment it kind of got
me yesterday at during the when they
made their announcement is the fact that
matter is they can get away with it
mostly now by just changing their in
terms of agreement it's totally legal
because if they say this is what we're
offering then they're sticking to what
they're saying so there's a problem and
they they publicly disclose it then the
only agency that can fight for consumer
protections is the FTC which is totally
separate and not only that and all they
need to do is disclose we are going to
throttle this service that's part of
their terms of service
it's like saying unlimited 4G internet
but then in the fine print yeah after
four gigs or five 250 gig and that's
totally legal and it's totally
acceptable from the purview of the FTC
because the FTC can't set policy they
can only respond well to those kinds of
abuses so there's no response is that no
it's no longer where we can actually it
now it needs a bigger group of people to
be really upset about something you're
attempting to be so bad for us to be
able to go in and try to change it this
was such a backwards step process that
they took us here that it's a lot it
took a lot of work to get us to where we
were and then we just yes it was out the
door I know we keep bringing this up in
very limited segments but the open
Internet was a fight in the courts I
think for over a decade
yeah and so now that we've taken this
huge step backwards we could be looking
at another multi-year process before we
can even try to find something
comparable to what we had so I'm hoping
that the top some good legal minds will
be able to convince a judge that this
this order needs to be stayed until it
has its day in court exactly I'm not
confident in this current administration
in this current especially at the
circuit court level it's
a little bit harder because yeah yeah
you need to realize that yeah there's a
good part of the population that doesn't
won't even notice it till it's too late
by the time didn't realize what has been
done because it'll it'll start coming
out small amounts it's not gonna come
out first like next Monday we're like
congratulations your packets have been
changed now you have Friday based here
you'd like to add
although yeah you look at people in
xfinity markets you know you're already
dealing with data caps oh man you know
like a streaming package or you know
what we'll just have a special Xbox
plug-in and now like this traffic isn't
going to count against your data cap so
why stream Netflix when you can use your
Xfinity and it's one of those things for
free you need to keep the subject going
I think that's the main goal I think if
we keep talking about it realize what's
going on and you know bring it up bring
it up and those sound hall meetings
bring it up to your Congressman being
enough the people that you work with
yeah because those are the people that
need to realize when you know and he
sits on the board and says I ordered a
burrito on my phone from last week and
nobody kind of looked at I'm like so
what that's the dumbest thing I think
anyone's ever said that's not what we're
worried about is your burrito
consumption mr. Reese's mug Oh God he's
stating that all of his sources were
ISPs oh my and I talked to the little
eyes be in little town and you're
talking to the companies that do want to
be you want to be able to upsell your
own market on packages talk to the
consumers people that use the Internet
the people that don't want to have or
then deal with YouTube you know spinning
wheel of death never about loading
correctly those are the people that get
do you think that some of these state
initiatives might have some teeth like
we saw Washington Washington state
governor saying that they were gonna try
and enact a local version of net
neutrality a state senator I think it's
Chris whiner or Chris Weiner is talking
about trying to pass a bill in
California that would be so there's
gonna be some big concerns there because
you have to keep in mind of how that
bill gets passed now it depends on where
you are in the state's
whoever owns the poles or the landlines
yeah that's a big problem for a lot of
communities the infrastructure that a
lot of us don't look at you don't see
obviously you know the tower but those
towers are owned by companies
I'm AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and so on share share
towers your eyes and all of those
carries they sometimes if they don't own
it they're leasing
from other companies around paying a fee
and if they do own it obviously they're
getting payment from other companies to
unanimous state government yeah exactly
so when we see things like that done at
the state level we'll see some benefit
from it it's not gonna have the same
impact that's the big guys at the end of
the day it's a small market for the big
company you know Verizon sort of just a
new and even in Californians have to do
business with entities outside of our
state exactly so interconnect fees still
still exist exist yeah so it's something
that we need to kind of if that happens
I think we start being able to kind of
like to move forwards toward it it'll be
beneficial for it right but at the end
of the day I think there has to be a
solution where we get back to something
somewhere it may not be this global
exactly or not go I mean a nationwide
agreement say this is at least the bare
minimum this is yeah exactly and you
know I'm not gonna try to knock on it
but t-mobile has there is something very
similar that they do right if you're
using their binge on the men or all
right you know all of that is included
doesn't count against your data and but
your cap to a certain speed but that's
the standard you know what you're going
into Ronnie turn in their disclosure
yeah it is right there and but it's not
it's not a bad experience we are talking
about literally loading not loading or
even getting bad quality pictures and
not enjoying a service or intercepting
traffic exactly like what we've seen
with Comcast yeah let me tell you about
how you need to buy a new modem even
though you don't because you were able
to do this just fine but it's mandatory
and we're gonna intercept your web
traffic and serve you this ad so you
need to keep it open I I think this is
now especially the time we're continuing
to join the conversation continuing to
reach out to especially local and state
officials is mandatory because we need
to set a consistent precedent that this
is something that people care about as
soon as you let the pressure off they
can go OC no one cares anymore I guess
it was fine and then they can go on with
whatever other policy bad policy that
they want to enact so I think that's
gonna wrap it up for us especially
because I want to we ran a lot longer
than I thought cuz like having these
conversations in person so um before
before we make the jump um where can
people find the content you're producing
or some project that you're gonna be
working on I know we're also wrapping up
the year to if the exactly so there's
gonna be wrap up going on
