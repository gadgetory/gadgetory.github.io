new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device after a couple of weeks after
release and when it's not shiny and new
anymore I'm high I'm gonna be late I'm
with pocket now and this is the Sony
Xperia Z oh this is episode 20 of after
the buzz you know when I reviewed the
Sony Xperia ZL back in April I amends
everything I said on its own this device
is beautiful and quite capable but with
the buzz of the HTC One and the Samsung
Galaxy s4 and no US carrier picking it
up I know that wouldn't stand a chance
and sadly it didn't I still loved going
back to this phone every now and then
it's but almost four months since I have
it and I still feel that the phone looks
brand new even after some real-world use
I can tell you that I don't see it aged
at all and that's me without using a
case it may not be the slimmest or the
lightest but it's one of the most
handsome phones that I've ever used in a
long time at times when gloss and glass
are all over the market I can tell you
that I enjoy the fact that this phone
has a matte and textured back that I
don't have to be wiping off to make the
phone look clean it's just awesome in
its own way the only thing standing
between my true love and this device is
the display and it's not really because
Sony didn't figure out how to fit this
five inch display in such an impossible
frame it's more the fact that the
viewing angles are bad and you don't see
that problem with other flagship
smartphones that cost the same amount of
money so when you think about the fact
that you have the prompt of the display
and the fact that the specification czar
really focused on last year's hardware
and you get to think that the price
range is not really adequate for this
phone when you can buy another device
that
doesn't have these problems overall I
guess you could say that this phone has
aged well when it comes to aesthetics
but not necessarily when it comes to
specs now one thing that has aged well
with this phone is the software and I
think that Sony knew that we were gonna
film it after the buzz on it right now
because well they just launched the
Android 4.2.2 on this device and it was
very necessary over-the-top the UI looks
Sony in every way you can't really tell
the difference between the past version
that we had but now we have support for
lock screen widgets which is something
that's well received and it just looks
smoother all around the view play around
with the device I do hate the fact that
Sony has disabled the new settings tar
goes that pretty much every other OEM
has embraced with the new version of
Android but at least the buttons that
are there find for me though I know that
your thoughts may vary the multitasking
UI has a couple of more Sony small
applications which is cool you know
those little apps that can hover over
whatever you're doing like a calculator
really cool and all you can now access
them in a smarter and faster fashion but
other than that the UI looks almost
exactly the same as we saw in April
which is good just not great if you're
after something like really fancy like
air gesture or air view or blinkfeed or
whatever well Samsung and HTC is your
best bet sadly the sony UI is adequate
it's unique but it's not better than
anything else that's already in the
market and day to day use the Android
4.2.2 update that serve this phone well
in some places and not so well in others
I mistakenly omitted to tell you in my
review that this phone had terrible
sound quality through the headphones a
complete irony for a sony phone running
a Walkman app this was so annoying that
I actually stopped using the phone for a
while but thankfully the problem is
solved with the update and even though
it's not better than any other phone it
just works well which is awesome now on
the negative side the battery isn't
really enjoying the update one bit I
priced it in our review for going beyond
one day with one charge which was good
but don't expect that same performance
now hopefully Sony will iron that out
later and probably some other update but
don't expect something great now and
even though the performance doesn't seem
any either better or worse it just seems
the same
just a little more fluid but I think
that's more of a UI tweak the camera is
well the same the Sony Bravia Engine 2
makes these photos and videos look
amazing as long as you keep them within
the display but neither the Photos nor
the videos look amazing when you pull
them out and the reason why I make this
a statement is because not every phone
uses a 13 megapixel sensor and well
these photos and videos aren't any
better than any other phone that has an
eight megapixel camera for example so
bottom line what I still recommend that
you buy a Sony Xperia ZL after three
months of use well this is a tough one
on my opinion this is a beautiful phone
that would have been amazing last year
but this year it's just too little and
too late it lacks that wow factor that
many devices bring to the table in 2013
and for those of you that are looking
for something like that well I would
sadly have to recommend that you look
somewhere else
so far Sony I would say that you still
need to step your game up when it comes
to catching up to what current OEMs are
doing that you should be doing better
that's it for episode xx after the bus
