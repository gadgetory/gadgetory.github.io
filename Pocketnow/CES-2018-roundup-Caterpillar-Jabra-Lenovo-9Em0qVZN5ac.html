Electronics Show and there are a ton of
consumer electronics out on the show
floor and while we can't dedicate a
video to every one of them we do want to
just fit a few more things you should
look forward to or not in 2018 with
Jules Wang on camera I'm hey Matt we got
our with pocket now and let's dive in
let's start with the perennial
manufacturers serving a particularly
hardy niche caterpillar the company has
new s 31 and s 41 models out usually
these phones don't run on bleeding-edge
in terms of software or specs say for
the 3800 million power battery on the S
31 and the five thousand milliamp power
cell on the S 41 but for active
worksites explorers another outdoor test
these heavily rubberized phones should
do the trick the S 41 in particular is
IP 68 and no spec rates and has
underwater camera and glove hand modes
to make the screen work or not as needed
one of our favorite go twos for
Bluetooth headphones is Jabra it's
building on top of its recently released
elite 25 e which maximize battery life
for the buck at $79 with the now elite
45 e it has a more premium feel IP 54
proofing two microphones for better
noise cancellation during calls and
eight hours of playback for $99 that
ain't that at all and then there is the
elite 65 t wireless earbuds with four
microphones up to five hours of battery
life with 10 more hours through the
charging case and all of that for a
hundred and sixty-nine bucks at another
20 dollars for the elite Act of 65 T and
there's better liquid protection with
the warranty specifically also covering
not just water but swept furthermore new
software for all these products will let
users adjust the EQ of the drivers
themselves and native connections to
either Google assistant or Siri with the
option for Amazon Alexa as well Chapra
has really stepped up its game this time
around pre-orders for the 65 t are going
on while the 45 eat will arrive at the
end of the first quarter finally we took
a look at Lenovo stable of products for
a quick look at its new smart display
running Google assistant to s the device
which goes with off the shelves
those vacations comes with eight to ten
inches in display and is supposed to
bring music videos calls and more such
fun a new standalone Google daydream VR
headset called The Mirage solo also made
its debut and just like its name says it
operates on its own without the need of
the phone to slot into it and then
there's the mix 630 and I hope I'm
pronouncing mixed right a convertible
tablet running Windows 10 with a
qualcomm snapdragon 835 processor it's
one of several always connect at pcs
with LTE capabilities to come over the
next year like others of its type the
mixed 630 has a stylus a decent keyboard
in a very sleek profile but is able to
deliver on anywhere above 20 hours of
battery life per cycle expect it to come
out in the springtime for $800 tell us
