projects to improve smartphone image
quality Sony is reportedly also working
on improving display quality for the
future and Gorilla Glass has just
decided to embrace glass on glass design
I'm hi Mary van a still from jen jen
still from see in china this is
out daily the official news today start
with corning the makers of gorilla glass
as a well the company has just decided
to bring this new vibrant glass
technology with the whole idea of
allowing OEMs to be able to print
high-quality artwork in their designs
meaning you can see glass on glass
designs in the future that allow more
than just branding we will keep you
posted as we learn more other official
news come from google the company has
just pushed its new camera viewfinder
application on the google play store
even though android and it's still not
out yet the way this is different is
that now you can take photographs at the
same time as you're recording video
you'll also notice that slow motion
video is available in a different spot a
good update obviously there could be
more by the time that google i/o happens
and then talking about Apple other
official news have to do with a new
macbook or shall we say a refresh to the
current macbook you still get the same
just one for USB type-c it is one of the
slimmest computers in the world but you
get the option now for a faster
processor but this is a better battery
life and the rose gold color option if
you wanted that for your laptop and then
Sony is apparently working on a new
technology to bring HDR video
reproduction to LCD displays currently
you can shoot HDR video but apparently
LCD displays aren't really fit to take
advantage of that and this is rather odd
as the company has been doing HDR video
for years so yeah barely that is
something that's coming to future xperia
x smartphones we just don't know exactly
when and finally the very hot news is
they have the wood samsung as the
company is apparently finally bringing
its departments together when it comes
to digital imaging currently the galaxy
s7 is probably the best smartphone
camera in the market but apparently the
company is working on bringing their
department for imagery to work together
with a smartphone department aren't
bringing larger camera sensors we don't
know exactly when to expect these
smartphone cameras hopefully for the
galaxy note 6 but it does lead me to the
question of the day
I do feel that the galaxy s7 has the
best smartphone camera out there but
what other improvements would you want
Sampson to bring to the table because in
my case I feel that with the boosted
image quality I would just love to see I
don't know optical zoom or other sort of
technologies but it was a comment down
below we would love to know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get these news earlier before
the video is filmed hello was I'm
 out calm and hit that subscribe

this one but that she could also catch
our videos on vessel vessel calm /
