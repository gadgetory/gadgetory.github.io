quick tip all right so this is a
t-mobile g2 it is running cyanogenmod 7
which is an open source android rom but
you don't have to have all of that in
fact this may work on some other devices
even those powered by iOS or Windows
Phone 7 you'll have to experiment and
let me know in the comments below but
what you will need to have is a web
browser in this case I'm using the
browser browser which is based on Chrome
you're also going to need to have an
internet connection and you can see down
here I'm connected to Wi-Fi why is this
on the bottom you'll have to come back
for my next video to find out so
subscribe to the video channel if you
haven't already done that and last
you're going to need to have GPS turned
on now you'll see why in just a minute
you're familiar with Google Places right
we're going to team that up with a
little something so here's the scenario
you are out and about you are on the
road you're in a another city maybe even
another state and you need to report
something to the police it's not an
emergency so you don't want to call 911
but you still need to report it how do
you do that well you could look up in a
phone book the local phone number you
could bother 911 or you could fire up
your web browser go to google and search
for police now that's going to give you
a list of police-related results we're
just going to search that and you can
see you know we've got law enforcement
and all kinds of stuff right well here's
the fun thing you go over to places or
local you do that and now all of a
sudden you have a list of local police
related places near you for example I'm
in Syracuse City and right over here I
have the phone number to Syracuse City
Police well clear a field is the city
right mixed by and sunset and Roy are
next to that so not only do I have a map
and a directions button where I can use
Google Maps Navigation to take me right
there I can touch that button and I'm
not going to for obvious reasons and
that will then open up the dialer and
ask me if I want to dial that phone
number and connect me really fast so are
you going to use this frequently well
first of all I hope not but the reason I
bring this up in the reason i thought it
was worthwhile is verizon has recently
had some problems connecting 911 so when
people are in desperate need of calling
for help they can't because 911 for some
reason doesn't work and that's because
911 isn't really a phone number but a
concept it goes to your local carrier
and from there your carrier routes it to
the closest emergency response handling
dispatch center so if something goes
wrong in that chain help isn't going to
come using this tip as long as you have
again a web browser and internet
connection and gps turned on you can
find the phone number the real phone
number to dial to get help just in case
911 isn't working again i hope you never
have to use it but it's there now if you
didn't know about places or google local
search let's go ahead and do something a
little bit less emergency related let's
search for pizza just to end kind of on
a light note and right there you can see
i have all the pizza places near me and
i can very quickly and easily the pizza
factory tap to dial there you go one
more button and i can call an order
pizza so really kind of cool if you like
seeing quick tips i'm in need of hearing
some of yours so please leave those in
the comments down below that would be
fabulous what do you do with your
android that's quick and easy but
something that you couldn't have done

of stuff to give it a thumbs up of
