quick tip all right so this is a
t-mobile g2 it is running CyanogenMod 7
which is an open source Android ROM but
you don't have to have all of that in
fact this may work on some other devices
even those powered by iOS or Windows
Phone 7 you'll have to experiment and
let me know in the comments below but
what you will need to have is a web
browser in this case I'm using the
browser browser which is based on Chrome
you're also gonna need to have an
internet connection and you can see down
here I'm connected to a Wi-Fi why is
this on the bottom you'll have to come
back for my next video to find out so
subscribe to the video channel if you
haven't already done that and last
you're gonna need to have GPS turned on
now you'll see why in just a minute
you're familiar with Google Places right
we're gonna team that up with a little
something so here's the scenario you are
out and about you are on the road you're
in a another city maybe even another
state and you need to report something
to the police it's not an emergency so
you don't want to call 9-1-1 but you
still need to report it how do you do
that well you could look up in a
phonebook the local phone number you
could bother 911 or you could fire up
your web browser go to google and search
for police now that's gonna give you a
list of police related results we're
just going to search that and you can
see you know we've got law enforcement
and all kinds of stuff right well here's
the fun thing you go over to places or
local you do that and now all of a
sudden you have a list of local police
related places near you for example I'm
in Syracuse City and right over here I
have the phone number - Syracuse City
police well clear field is the city
right mixed by and Sunset and Roy are
next to that so not only do I have a map
and a directions button where I can use
Google Maps Navigation to take me right
there I can touch that button and I'm
not going to for obvious reasons and
that will then open up the dialer and
ask me if I want to dial that phone
number and connect me really fast so are
you gonna use this frequently well first
of all I hope not but the reason I bring
this up and the reason I thought it was
worthwhile is Verizon has recently had
some problems connecting 9-1-1 so when
people are in desperate need of calling
for help they can't because 9-1-1 for
some reason doesn't work and that's
because 911 isn't really a phone number
but a concept it goes to your local
carrier and from there your carrier
routes it to the closest emergency
response handling dispatch center so if
something goes wrong in that chain help
isn't going to come using this tip as
long as you have again a web browser an
internet connection and GPS turned on
you can find the phone number the real
phone number to dial to get help
just in case 911 isn't working again I
hope you never have to use it but it's
there now if you didn't know about
Places or Google local search let's go
ahead and do something a little bit less
emergency related let's search for pizza
just to end kind of on a light note and
right there you can see I have all the
pizza places near me and I can very
quickly and easily do the pizza factory
tap to dial there you go
one more button and I can call and order
pizza so really kind of cool if you like
seeing quick tips I'm in need of hearing
some of yours so please leave those in
the comments down below that would be
fabulous what do you do with your
Android that's quick and easy but
something that you couldn't have done
otherwise if you like seeing this kind
of stuff give it a thumbs up of course
head on over to pocketnow.com so you can
read other articles and subscribe to the
video channel so you can see other
Android quick tips for pocket now I'm
