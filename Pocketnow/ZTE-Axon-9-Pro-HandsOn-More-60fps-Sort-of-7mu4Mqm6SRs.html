successor to the exon 7 that we praised
very highly a few years ago for those of
you joining me and wondering why the
company has jumped to use the pro
moniker this video is for you reporting
for me--for in Berlin I'm high metal
event with pocket now and let's go
hands-on and advance the new ZTE X
online pro looks well it looks like
pretty much every other 2018 smartphone
we've got a tempered glass finish that
the company claims can withstand the
level of 7 and Mohs hardness level we're
gonna have to ask Zach a jerry-rigged
everything about that there's a metallic
finish on the trim and a very glossy
blue color accent it wasn't too easy to
keep clean during our hands-on time
there's a very significant notch at the
top and also a significant chin at the
bottom which again is a trend that most
phones are following so why pro well a
couple of reasons
this is not your common 6.2 inch OLED
display there's a dedicated chip built
in being dubbed acts on vision and that
makes the frame interpolation in HDR
that we see in high-end televisions
meaning video is up scaled to up to 60
frames per second no matter the source
this means smooth video and smooth
gaming developers don't really have to
do anything to screen just a depth of
the content the notch includes an RGB
sensor that determines room temperature
to adapt to the display as well sort of
like what we see with iPads in true tone
and yes I know you're gonna ask you can
disable the knotch
to assist in content consumption we've
got dual speakers with hi-fi audio one
tucked into the earpiece and the other
to the bottom each speaker has its own
amplifier and now supports Dolby Atmos
yes it is sad to see the move to USB see
instead of the headphone jack
but according to ZTE the improvements in
audio required to move the digital
internally we have a new Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 6 a good bytes of ram 128
gigs of expandable storage a whopping
four thousand milliamp hour battery ip68
water in dust resistance which is
actually new to the axon lineup and
because we have glass there's also she
wireless charging
we've got Android AIDS oddone Oreo
nearly stocking the device but the
advantage that even the Google feed is
supported by the launcher there's really
very little ZT differentiation here and
the experience is really smooth over all
the cameras made an interesting move
that I'm gonna phrase as well
primary shooter is of 12 megapixels with
oh is and 1.4 microns the secondary is a
20 megapixel wide-angle camera at 130
degrees yes we finally get another LEM
supporting Hawaiian angle photos Thank
You ZTE the selfie camera is of a
whopping 20 megapixels which is capable
of pixel bidding to 5 megapixel shots in
low light and also brings face to unlock
capabilities and yes for those of you
that don't want face to unlock there's a
fingerprint scanner in the back pricing
starts at 650 euros launching in Europe
and Asia and we're hoping that the
United States becomes part of it at some
point in the future let us know what you
