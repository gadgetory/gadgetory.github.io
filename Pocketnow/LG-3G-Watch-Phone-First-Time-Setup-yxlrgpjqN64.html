Pocket NomCom and this is a look at the
first time setup on the LG gg9 10 watch
phone this phone even makes video calls
very futuristic technology let's take a
look okay so the first thing I want to
do here is pop in the sim card here I've
got an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card and I've got this
tool here which I think you use to open
up the back which is where the SIM card
is and so I'm going to insert this tool
here and twist it ok I should be able to
pop it off now in what you get there
inside the watch it's a SIM card holder
now definitely this is not a watch that
you're gonna go want to go swimming with
because it has some pretty pretty water
sensitive electronics inside of here so
I'm just going to pop in the SIM card
here slide it it should fit pretty
nicely and then I'm going to attempt to
get this back on but it's a little bit
tricky because there's this rubber
gasket here and so it's going to settle
it down and there's another side to this
tool which is hopefully a Carroll focus
just kind of like tweezers so that you
can actually pull off the backing if you
can't do it with your fingers so then we
twist it to close all right there we go
and by the way the the device will turn
off when you take out this back battery
cover to kind of protect itself from any
sort of damage so let's let's look at
software all right SIM card in let's see
what happens next so I press over it
would be more convenient to use after
connecting a Bluetooth headset I'm sure
it would be I don't have one on me right
now so I'm going to go to US English set
the date was hoping it would do it with
the on the network okay so we can set
the date here this is in a different
date format
so we're at 11:06
2010 okay
and I think this little hmm and how do I
get back
I think this over here yep okay good
enough set 24 hour time I don't want
that good enough we'll just uh well
we'll come back to this later just
really want to see what happens what
it's like to make a call
deal that savings is off okay
feature usage or a little tutorial here
how you access the various functions
pretty cool animation
so you can have a digital clock or an
analog clock I mean at its core it is a
clock after all it's a watch and you can
have a contacts list which is nice the
screen just went dim on me
okay so I'm just going to keep going to
the right and it has a bunch of
additional tutorials that show you the
indicators so you can silent the phone
you can put into flight mode messaging
okay it's got a a memo book all right
let's see what else we have in here and
actually use the phone settings okay I
get the point
dial message first when I'm sure you can
come back to this tutorial so it's done
a new SIM card inserted copy all sim
context ends I'm saying no there are
none which I could imagine it being a
pain to to have to input in contacts so
I'm going to try to make a voice call
here so I'm just gonna call it gets the
local library around here see what
happens pretty easy to touch the numbers
so it's calling I wonder if I actually
the call end button will probably do
that so it's right now call held and I
can hang up the call by pressing over
here I've got a lot more to learn as you
can see just going to take you through
the first time set up here please give
the video a thumbs up if you like what
you see it will be back soon with more
with the LG gg9 10 watch phone pretty
cool so far that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
