that I should compare the galaxy s 10 e
to the iPhone 10 s I mean sure the price
matches the 10 R but feature wise it
seems to be most fit to take on the more
expensive 10 s but then I realize it
that's precisely the reason why this
should be a comparison against the
iPhone 10 R if your budget is $750 which
entry level flagship gives you most for
your money
I'm he might leave it out with pocket
now and let's dive in
those of you in search for a better
fabric comparison have a look at Joshua
regards Galaxy S 10 plus vs. iPhone 10's
max this particular comparison is all
about devices that aren't at the top of
the food chain really all you need to do
is stack the Galaxy S 10a against the
iPhone 10 are for you to see a
completely different approach while
Apple believes that budget-minded
consumers prefer larger phones Samsung
addresses the desire of many and
offering a powerful flagship that can
fit in your hand the iPhone 10 R is nine
millimeters taller 6 millimeters wider
four millimeters thicker and a whopping
44 grams heavier ya 44 they're both made
of aluminum and glass so don't attribute
the added heft to any sort of higher
quality materials the 10 R is pretty
much like the Galaxy S 10 II thanks keep
getting interesting when you compare
displays the Galaxy S 10a is able to
cram a large 5.8 inch display into its
footprint while the added size of the
iPhone doesn't see it screen go beyond
6.1 inches this is mainly due to the
more advanced dynamic AMOLED panel on
the s10 a when compared to the IPS LCD
on the 10r the s10 he also has more
resolution at 1080p plus vs. a weird 828
P on the 10r
has an always-on display versus none and
don't even get me started about the 10
r's knotch
Samsung's infinity o display isn't just
far less intrusive but also has
developed quite the cult following given
its awesome wallpapers both devices have
dual firing speakers which are plenty
loud I can't say either one wins over
the other but the s10 II includes a
headphone jack so I will give it the
content consumption crown and if we jump
into internals this is another galaxy
territory both do ty with their powerful
7 nanometer processors but the galaxy s
10 east arts at double the RAM double
the storage that's also expandable has a
better IP rating has a slightly larger
battery includes faster charging in the
Box supports the latest Wi-Fi standards
has more LTE bands etc etc etc even if
we were to measure authentication sure
the iPhones NR includes
Apple's famous face ID which is far more
secure than Samsung's face on lock but
those of you looking for a more
conventional fingerprint scanner the
side-mounted option on the s10 a is
quite awesome when it comes to hardware
sure the iPhone 10 R is no slouch but
there is not one category where it
defeats the Galaxy S 10 II now software
is a different story that's less
quantifiable and more of a subjective
matter of taste
iOS 12 may not be everyone's cup of tea
but buying an iPhone offers the
significant value of not letting
customers wait for software updates it's
also easier to use for most consumers
with a simple app launching paradigm and
one of the most complete ecosystems
known in the tech industry those of you
already owning Apple products might as
well stick to an iPhone and have a more
practical experience the eseni on the
other hand brings samsung's new one UI
on top of android 9pi if i had to pick
between them I prefer androids more
flexible approach with a launcher you
can fill with either apps or widgets or
fully change altogether I also have to
praise Samsung's new approach where
buttons are now moved to the bottom for
better one-handed use I even love the
fact that the edge menus are now
supported on the s10 II even without a
curved display seriously the only
problem here is that Samsung has one of
the worst track records when it comes to
software updates and you care about eco
systems Samsung has been hard at work at
building its own but certain products
don't really talk between each other as
well as they do on iOS now the
experience of both is quite comparable
their user interfaces are both fast and
fluid and so long as you disable VIX be
home on the galaxy you'll find no
opportunities for stutters on either
device I find one UI to be more logical
from a user's perspective but there are
some things where iOS shines like in not
showing your notifications until your
face is detected and where the galaxy
still doesn't offer this now where the
iPhone 10 are beats the pants out of the
galaxy s any is in battery life see the
SNA is good you will get through the day
but then the 10r has no problem in
handling heavy use and giving you enough
juice to start the next day if you have
to
but then we make the jump into the
cameras and we once again returned into
galaxy territory and really it's not
because it takes better photos in the
10r but instead because it's a more
versatile camera colors are good on both
with each device having its own kick of
HDR boosting the highlights and shadows
and with some really great results for
the es10 a wins is in that added
wide-angle lens
giving you more epic shots whenever you
need them it also enables more accurate
portraits with the advantage of either
fully removing the background blurring
post or adding extra effects and where
the 10r has some good results but you
have to either pick portraits or not
this also gives the SME added benefit
when doing video both devices are
capable of 4k video at 60 and other
tricks and stabilization is great on
either the s10 II just has the option of
helping you switch to a wider lens when
you need to which also enables a super
steady video option at 1080p that's
nearly gimbal like and then I also have
to praise the s10 Neve for its selfie
video given its better crop and the
option to record 4k video where the 10r
is still stuck at 1080p and even selfies
in general are more pleasing on the s10
II given the added resolution the 10r
has the benefit of more accurate
portraits but that's really about it
to conclude I think you can tell where
the theme of this video is heading to
the iPhone 10 R is not a bad phone if
you're looking for a less expensive
iPhone 10 s this device hits a lot of
buttons right for those of you looking
for a smaller price tag the problem is
once you stack the 10 R against almost
any Android flagship even at lower tier
prices the Galaxy S 10a is easier to
handle has a far better display better
specifications and it includes features
in the camera that the 10 artists can't
beat if your budget is around 750
dollars this is honestly the better buy
it's clear that Samsung is not just out
to compete but also when redefining how
much you get for what you pay for when
it comes to the essentials
what about you which one would you pick
