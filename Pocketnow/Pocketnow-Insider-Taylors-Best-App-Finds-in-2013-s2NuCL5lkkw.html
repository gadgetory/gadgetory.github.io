mobile platforms in 2013 was the sheer
number of new apps and services that
arrived for each platform I Taylor
Martin this is pocket now and these are
my best app fines for 2013 ask anyone
2013 was a great year for the mobile
industry a lot of companies hit a ton of
milestones such as Google's and apples
respective digital contents towards
hitting a staggering 1 million
applications each being the app hoarder
I am of course I picked up a handful of
new applications and services myself and
these are my best app vines of 2013 I do
the vast majority of my shopping online
while Google now does a decent job of
keeping me up to date on the shipping
status of most of the things I ordered
it's severely limited in functionality
so I sought out a mostly automated
method for tracking packages via mobile
eventually i stumbled upon package buddy
pro it's available on android for a
dollar ninety-nine simply drop any
tracking number in the application at a
memo with the name of the item and let
the application do the rest of the work
from within the app you could view
detailed tracking history the courier's
website as well as a map showing the
route you can also see the package
history which syncs with your account as
well as a hoard of settings to tweak
most of you already know I'm a huge fan
of action launcher it's one of the most
unique and straightforward launch
replacements for Android with one of the
most clever developers around behind the
project it implements things like quick
drawer and covers for one of the most
no-nonsense experiences yet it's only
getting better with each update and I
look forward to seeing where the
developer takes it in 2014 another great
Android find this year was dashclock
widget created by google's own Roman
Nurik the widget itself is very plain
and simple a different take on the
standard digital clock widget but nerik
added a very useful feature which has
become the highlight of dashclock
extensions they range from battery stats
and weather updates to storage and CPU
information and much much more a few
months ago I created a video dedicated
to the best dashclock extensions so
click the link below for more info on
dashclock clipper plus is easily one of
the most useful utility applications I
found in 2013
one thing all mobile platforms are
missing is a clipboard history Samsung
includes this on its Galaxy devices but
stock Android Windows Phone and iOS are
missing this incredibly useful feature
clipper plus is a solution for that on
Android devices copy all the things you
want or need to copy to later access
those clippings simply pull down the
notification shade tap the ongoing
clipper notification and select the
clipping you need to paste your
immediately shot back into the
application you started in ready to
paste clipper is free though the upgrade
to clipper plus costs 199 and include
sync across multiple devices as the new
social media manager for pocket now and
with some of the social accounts I run
on the side I'm a very social guy the
only way I've been able to manage is
through using buffer it's available on
Android and iOS and it allows me to post
multiple accounts on various social
platforms simultaneously you can also
create an automated individual schedule
for each account schedule future post
manually and even see analytics for
those posts after they go live this
application is a must for anyone who
uses multiple social accounts and has
the habit of sharing a lot of links and
pictures speaking of links I try my best
to keep up with the happenings on the
internet through the new digg
application it's a simple yet very
beautiful application there I find
popular stories to Vincent a buffer I've
recently fallen in love with podcasts
but several months before finding some
great podcast so listen to i discovered
pocket casts through a colleague it's
easily the most beautiful podcast
catcher out there but more important
than that is the mess of features found
inside create a pocket casts account and
you can sync your subscribed podcasts
along with your position in any casts
you're currently listening to across
multiple devices both Android and iOS
you can also create smart playlists
which will download certain types of
podcasts based on the criteria you set
it's one of the more expensive apps in
this list at 399 but it's well worth the
cost of a cup of coffee if you're a fan
of any podcasts I take a lot of photos
and I also edit most before I share them
on any platform Snapseed is my choice
editor for quick edits but if I want to
get more involved to make edits which
are typically only done on a computer I
break out photoshop touch for phone it
was released in early 2013 and it's
incredible
there's a learning curve to it but if
you're used to any professional photo
editing software you should be able to
figure out this app relatively quickly
and once you do the sky is the limit
this one is well worth the 499 price tag
there are many other applications I
found in 2013 but the list has to end
somewhere please feel free to share your
favorite apps from last year in the
