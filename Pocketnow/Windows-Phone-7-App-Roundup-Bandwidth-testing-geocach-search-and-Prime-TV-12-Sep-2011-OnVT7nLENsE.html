nada calm and this is another episode of
the windows phone 7 at roundup and which
we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get to it
bandwidth test is a paper application
built on the windows marketplace so all
I have to do is click here and begin the
test and it will use over the Wi-Fi
connection that I have so in this test
is showing me my time here and also my
transfer data as well as my download
speeds and kilobits and megabits per
second and here we can be the upload
test and it's a little bit slower of
course because we are using an upload
over a Wi-Fi connection and now I can
just click down here to see results and
it will show me the test results and
date and time geocaching is a paid for
application available in the windows

you to do is to find various geocache
sites around the world so right here it
shows that there's around 1.5 million
geocache sites available for your of
entering need so I'll just click on here
and it shows the difficulty is pretty
moderate and the terrain is a somewhat
ok so wat we can just click on here so
here it can view the summary of this
geocache site and we can also click down
here on the map and it shows that this
site is 30.4 nine miles away from my
location got news is a free application
to build on the windows marketplace that
has many different news sources
available directly from the app and it
uses an RSS feed source so let's say I
want to click on the USA today so I can
click on here it will show me all of the
main headlines and if I wide and click
on one of these no show me the entire
article I can open it an Internet
Explorer and it can even share it with
other people so I can just go back I can
view other topics of the news just by
clicking over here get gossip money
sports tech favorites and headlines
Prime TV is a paid for application to
tville on the windows marketplace as a
lot of information about your favorite
show so here I have a couple shows that
I'd like to get some information on so
if I want to view upcoming schedule for
one of these shows i can click here and
it will show me a little blurb about
what the episode is about and it will
show me some youtube videos and i can
click over here to view some pictures by
clicking over to this side I can also
get news about other shows and another
cool feature about this is if I just
click on here
so I can view some of the top shows a
lot of people want to get some
information on danger wing is a free
game that go on in windows marketplace
arch to the game is to edit or all these
other ships so this is a sugar style
game in which you control this
spacecraft and I want to shoot these
other aircrafts and hopefully we can get
through this level and if we're able to
do so we can also use other weapons here
so here we reach the boss and we want to
destroy the boss without allowing them
to destroy us first and it shows a
parameter at the top which it courses
their life oh no and it looks as though
I'm going to be destroyed so this has
been another episode of the windows
