customer satisfaction but not for much
the one plus three event goes official
and the company finally plans to play
nice with invites and deals could make
the purchase of the galaxy s7 more
compelling again I'm hi Mary vera and
why is it that every time that I'm on
the west coast the time zone just
completely flips me over this is parking
our daily the official news today begin
with deals those of you in the market
for the Galaxy s7 this is probably the
time to buy as of today and up until
june nineteen as the company is bringing
back their gear VR deal where you get it
for free the only thing is it's her
father's day and I would definitely not
by a gear VR for my father but then
again if you're getting it for free it
just makes the deal more compelling you
can learn more about how to get this
deal done Alex in the description among
with dates because those are a bit weird
and even though the 12.9 and chai Pad
Pro is not my favorite device ever the
device is currently on sale on eBay I
know a lot of professionals that
actually prefer the ipad pro 12.9 for
drawing and if you're in the market the
128 gigabyte model is currently
available on eBay for eight hundred
dollars which is almost three hundred
dollars off the price the ebay seller is
trusted and again I would prefer the 9.7
inch iPad but that's just me that 12.9
it's not necessarily bad I'm not saying
cheap I'm saying not necessarily bad and
speaking of apple one of the news that
we've been waiting for is when is the
WWDC keynote happening so for those of
you that didn't know set your calendars
for jun 13 at ten a.m. pacific time that
is when apple will have its event
usually WWDC is all about software we
can expect iOS 10 or whatever they're
going to call it among with the next
version of OS 10 and watch OS as well
hopefully TV OS as well but it would be
a nice time for Apple to announce some
hardware as a it is in desperate need of
a change even though the rumors are that
the iphone is not changing any time soon
and speaking previously of samsung and
now of Apple for those of you that are
wondering which company does a better
job when it comes to customer
satisfaction a recent poll from a
significant sample in the United States
reveals that well Apple is currently at
eighty-one percent Samsung follows at
eighty percent and then
other companies like motorola HTC and LG
follow later you can read more about
that in the link in the description it's
obviously easier for Apple to have
better customer satisfaction their apple
store services simply the best there's
just no room for comparison but then
again that being said let's just say
that samsung launched a far better
product this year let's just see how
that continues as we move forward to the
fall and finally the very hot new stood
they have to do with the one plus three
as we've got two announcements from the
company one is that they will be
announcing its new product on jun 15
which is great second that you can
expect the one plus three shortly after
the event but no official date was
provided and third which is most
important believe it or not there will
not be an invite system with the one
plus three now obviously we assume that
there will be a shortage in the man that
is just the way 1 plus handles its
market and it's understandable this is
probably one of the best non budget but
budget hot black ship smart phones out
there and it leads me to the question of
the day with the fact that there is no
invite system make you want to buy the
one plus 3 or are you considering other
smartphones in the market right now
because in my case I really want to see
if that six a good bite I one plus three
is available because of that will be a
compelling product but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get these news
