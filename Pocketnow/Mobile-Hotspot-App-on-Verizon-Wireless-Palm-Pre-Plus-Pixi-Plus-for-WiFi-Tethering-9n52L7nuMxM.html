calm and today we're going to be taking
a look at the mobile hotspot app for the
palm pre plus ND palm pixi plus for
verizon wireless theoretically this app
should work with also the sprint network
on the palm pre because the pre also has
Wi-Fi however operating the app may
require additional carrier provisioning
and charges on verizon wireless the app
is free but to use it it will cost forty
dollars per month for five gigs of data
transfer overages will run you five
cents per megabyte so let's go ahead and
download the app from the palm app
catalog since we're using the palm pre
plus prior to release the app is an
indie a pata log officially yet but we
were able to men are to get it on
through a special backdoor link from
Verizon Wireless so we're going to go
ahead and download the app also I should
be noted that with the latest version of
webos you can download multiple
applications at the same time or
simultaneously which was a feature that
was missing from previous versions it's
relatively quick to install we're going
to go ahead and tap to launch and now
the app is asking permission to restart
the phone which then you can go ahead
and launch the app after the phone
reboots I'm going to go ahead and shut
off the camera now and wait for the
phone to reboot and then we're going to
go ahead and pick it up after the phone
reboots again
so it did take some time for the phone
to restart itself but now we're back
with the verizon wireless palm pre plus
we're going to go ahead and launch the
mobile hotspot application by going into
the launcher and then this is what the
app looks like the network information
shows the network name so now it's webOS
network VA 7371 you can go ahead and
change the name of the network if you so
desire by tapping on it and then
deleting what was written before we're
going to go ahead and call it as VZW
Creed plus net and then you have 32
characters we're going to go ahead and
hit done so now that's the new name and
we're going to go ahead and change the
passphrase since you only have five gigs
of data transfer per month you'd want to
keep other people off your network who
are authorized to be on it so that you
can protect the Lao instead you have on
a monthly basis for your forty dollars
we're going to call it just abcdefg each
it has to be a minimum of eight
characters and maximum of 63 so
everything is all configured now we're
going to go ahead and turn the network
on and it shows here that there are no
device is connected if you're in card
view at the bottom notification area you
should see an icon here for the mobile
hotspot app tapping it right now shows
no connected devices we're going to go
ahead and set this aside for just a
second I'm going to go ahead and pull
out the iphone which is on airplane mode
and is connected only to Wi-Fi this is
connected to our whole network right now
we're going to go ahead and connect it
to the VZW pre plus net go ahead and
type in do password which is all
lowercase a b c d e f g h then we're
going to hit join and now it's alerting
us on the pre that the pre plus that we
have one connected
device and if you tap in sight the car
to go back into the application it shows
that the 3gs white which is what we
named the iphone is connected and in the
card view it shows one connected device
as well so let's go ahead and go back to
the iphone and try to navigate to Deepak
now home page which we had loaded
earlier but we're going to just go ahead
and refresh that and see how long it
takes
so it does take a while for the pacquiao
calm home page to load on the iPhone and
that's probably due to the fact that i'm
downstairs where the verizon wireless
signal is weaker had i been upstairs on
the network coverage would have been a
little bit better and the page would
load a bit faster but already you do
have access to the text and information
on the home page so you can go ahead and
already start browsing and on that's in
short a quick tour of the mobile hotspot
application here and if you're done
using it to conserve battery life on
your palm pre plus all you have to do is
turn it off the application should be
available in the palm app catalog
beginning january twenty fifth when the
palm pre plus ND palm pixi plus are
available for purchase through verizon
wireless it should also be mentioned
that if you purchase a palm pre plus or
a palm pixi plus between january twenty
fifth launch date and februari
fourteenth you can get a pixi plus for
free I'm Chong win for pocketnow.com and
this has been a quick tour of the mobile
hotspot app which turns your palm webos
enabled Wi-Fi device into a wireless
router thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
