the pixel 3 XL but part of the reason
why we are so anticipating this phone is
not just because it's the next pixel but
it's because we start to see that people
actually have them already someone
explain to us what's going on here I
mean it seems like the phone is already
on sale but before we get into the pixel
3 XL we're going to talk a little bit
about Huawei's a little bit of a flub up
in terms of their future phones and how
they take their selfie photos after all
an ad came out and there's a little bit
of controversy around it also on this
show we're going to talk about what the
iPhones might be able to do this year
considering that the iPhone 10 seems to
be becoming popular again and there's a
Nokia phone the best one you can get out
there these are all questions that may
or may not be answered but there is one
thing that we can't answer for you it's
how we feel so far about the poco phone
el Poco Loco as it were
hello everybody and welcome to episode 3
1/9 of the weekly brought to you by
pocket now and xda-developers on this
day the 23rd of august 2018 from
smartphones to tablets to wearables and
so much more these are all the things
that you dreamed of having since you
were a kid so let's go ahead and get
talking I am your host for the weekly
it's Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and joining us today is as it
says here in my jewels written scripts
mr. positivity himself Brandon minimun
how's it going Brandon hi why am i mr.
positivity you kind of hard to be honest
mr. power of positivity over there I've
never seen you without a smile on your
face personally awesome I appreciate
that and I try ah exactly on this
episode as well we have uh also a pretty
special guest who is celebrating his
10th anniversary at pocket now this very
week and Tandy Negi how's it going Anton
it is us and thank you very much for
having me good morning good afternoon
and good evening everybody
it's been a little while since we've
seen each other huh it's been like three
or four months we started to talk about
that before we went on here whenever we
were in in Korea for the g7 launch yeah
exactly that was a really fun time too
it was and finally we have our producer
back in the booth we missed you last
week
so yes I'm glad to be here and I got
that polka phone just as much as you do
Josh so we're on the side and like I
said this is my Jules written script
here so it says here the poco pushing
podcast producer Jules walk come on yeah
all right so we're gonna we're gonna
check in with our panel more in the
midpoint of our show so we're gonna get
straight into the news right now there's
actually quite a lot to talk about and
as usual with every week in the world of
smartphones there's quite a bit of
speculation but what is interesting
about this first story is that we're
actually getting some examples of what
we're speculating on and that either
pisses us off or it makes us more
excited the pixel 3xo just keeps
appearing in the flesh and people are
taking pictures of it on subways and
then this new piece of information came
out from Russia Russian site rosetta I
really think I've said that wrong
apparently obtained a fully furnished
pixel 3xl package and of course it was
from an anonymous source but we're gonna
just say Google probably and they claim
that Google lost track of an entire
shipment of finished devices but this is
the one that they've gone ahead and
unboxed we get a really good look at
everything that is in the box with the
pixel 3 Excel as well as the phone
itself now we'll talk about the design
of the phone in a little bit but I want
to get some quick reactions or rather
just some reactions from all of you
about just this phone in general why you
think these leaks are happening so much
and if you're excited about not just the
phone but also the content contents of
the box because I have a couple things I
want to say about that let's start off
with Amazon since it's your first show
back in a bit
thank you and the being my 10th
anniversary can I allow can I be allowed
to be off script just for a couple of
seconds Jules could you do me a favor
and and lock the camera on you for a
second on me on you yes so so this is
this is what I see when I'm looking at
Jules now can you lock the camera on me
please you're getting one of these and
it's not necessarily for your hair my
friend yeah this is the we're going to
shave they were going to have this
what's the brand on that
hashtag she that my my freakin camera
here now it's huge I get it's lovely but
I like I'm talking right over it and I
have to put those plosives out there and
without this dead cat then they'd be
just flying all over the place and your
ears would be boggled so I mean if you
were necessities sake but I totally get
it I would love to have that Gillette's
blade come over and just this spot guest
is not being sponsored by Gillette so
let's move on to the pixel free I don't
know if the reports are true and there's
any indication that there might be true
apparently Google has lost an entire
shipment of pixel free phones finished
phones I'm not sure how one can misplace
or lose an entire shipment that's that's
the rumor out there if it's true we
might see these of course pop up on eBay
or on other sites which are selling
phones and we might see even reviews of
a phone which has not yet been announced
at all or it will be announced in a
couple of months as of whether I'm
excited or not about the pixel 3 XL or
the pixel 3 at this point in time I
think it's too late for me to become
anything you've similar or close to you
excited because we feel or at least I
personally feel that I already know this
phone so well I've seen it I've seen it
I know what's what's inside it and no I
don't like that huge notch but I can
live with it that's not the problem I
have that feeling which I usually have
after using the phone for a couple of
weeks or months that this brings no more
joy and excitement to my life because
that particular period of no honeymoon
phase is over and it's funny because it
was a honeymoon without actually being a
honey like that phantom feeling of
knowing a phone without I mean you've
seen obliques who's going off the
rumours benchmarks and whatnot but it's
just you don't have in your hand and you
know but we know enough from past
experience because of course rosette CAD
decided to take a whole bunch of photos
and publish a sample online
looks pretty similar to what the pixel
two was able to put out and from what
we've been able to say about it that's
been very nice single click on the back
mm-hmm yeah single camera on the back
but we mentioned the notch a little bit
and what I kind of wanted to ask in
terms of just the design that we've seen
through these leaks and through these
spotted in the wild photos that we've
had so you have the pixel two and then
you have the pixel two XL it seems that
the XL is though if you correct me if
I'm wrong but of course we don't know if
I'm wrong because the phone's not even
out yet but the pixel pixel 3xl
potentially is the one with the notch
while the smaller ones just gonna retain
this design more or less how is that why
not put the notch on the smaller one in
order to get a little bit more screen
real estate that's something that kind
of perplexes me I think they're trying
to I'm not sure who is manufacturing the
pixels this year whether it's LG HTC or
somebody else but they're definitely
manufacturing them by Google's
direct and strict instructions I think
that Google is trying to cater to both
audiences I mean the the notch the notch
has been the most polarizing topic of
the past two or three years in the
smartphone business and there are people
who love it there are people who hate it
and there are people who just go with it
regardless and I think that with this
and I'm not sure that there will be any
other difference between its you can say
for some minimal aspects they're trying
to cater to both audiences and as such
booster sales before I head into the I
was actually gonna go to your Brendan go
for it yeah yeah it's so funny because
in the last like two weeks I've been
messaging people in the industry and
saying like hey Jaime I've been feeling
very upset about the design of the pixel
3 Excel I think that not just too big
and then it occurred to me and and I and
I mentioned this last week that there's
probably a reason for the knotch
being so big and for the pixel 3xl
having it in the pixel 3 not and I think
the reason is face ID I think that
Google is copying the future that Apple
introduced last year and in order to do
that you need extra hardware whether
it's an extra camera or an infrared
flood illuminator
and it makes sense that they would put
it on the Excel model and not the
regular model because that's a more
premium feature so I think that the
knotch
is big for a reason I think it's a touch
ID competitor not touch ID face ID so
that's what I think about the the big
notch but it does upset me but it's for
a reason better idea I mean in Google
picks law already wins it because the
iPhone 10 doesn't have it and yeah this
would happen which is probably the
number one thing that I really missed
from the iPhone 10 personally but we're
not even getting into any of that
hopefully the face ID competitor is
going to be pretty compelling especially
coming from the Google side of things
though face unlock has been around in
Android for a little while already so
it's not as if there's a huge leap
happening there there's just gonna be a
bit of extra technology that makes it
better I suppose but there's one thing I
wanted to mention before I move on to
our next topic if you look at the
contents of the box am I the only one
that absolutely adores the fact that it
comes with pixel buds style ear buds
that are USBC I just I really loved the
rope hook design of the pixel but I'm
probably the only one but I like this a
lot I mean well it's kind of hard to
tell from the picture here that we were
provided it's white so anything kind of
or slick if it's white but I mean the
general bud style of that extra hoop
with the plastic little plaid thing like
I don't know how that feels for you it
may have been the best fit for you but
I've been hearing a lot of critical
response against that design and so I
mean you know take your pick air pods or
anything else that are on the market
just kind of you never really get a win
a definitive win in this category I was
frightened I'm sorry good
I'll just go say Brandon's gonna
Brandon's title of mr. positivity I'm
giving it a run for its money cuz I I
loved it liked it a lot that's to me
that's such a quirky and interesting way
of creating a hook design in an earbud
and I just that's the reason why I liked
it so much and it didn't it didn't hurt
me at all I know some people found it
uncomfortable but anyway Tony you were
saying I was locked on this picture ever
since I saw it
and I was looking at the email address
on those headphones and I was just
checking literally whether the
google.com domain actually exists its
redirects to Google so somebody is
either toying with us or somebody made a
huge typo I'm not sure what's going on
there but if anything from that picture
that particular email address
I found fishy because if that's a Google
email address and it's a typo then that
person is going to be probably in in the
beep or if if it's not then somebody is
really really playing with us yeah
definitely and speaking with speaking of
people just playing us all over the
place okay so we do have to move into a
huawei story that might seem a little
bit familiar I I love what this happens
because it gives you sort of a sneak
peek and see like the marketing 101 that
these companies have and whether or not
you're actually very upset about the
fact that Huawei seems to have doctored
in a very very obvious way the
front-facing selfies of their phones
there's an ad that came out in Egypt for
the huawei Nova 3 and in the ad there's
someone taking several selfies with the
phone and their significant other
well that's significant other this
lovely lady who went on to social media
and posted some behind the scenes photos
of how they did this ad kind of gave the
forum away like just just remain with
this selfies looks so good didn't they
this is the part that that is so
incredulous to me because I looked at I
watch the ad and obviously the ad is
available on YouTube you can see it for
yourself and it's also available at the
Oracle pocketnow.com
but what you'll see is this photo on the
person's Instagram showing behind the
scenes of the gentleman holding his hand
out with nothing in it and his hand is
right next to the actual camera lens
kind of like this if you're watching the
logo that's that's a nice that sets a
nice selfie judgment so somehow it takes
on this one but also like yeah okay we
we obviously understand smart phones
being reviewers but also as consumers
don't we also understand as general
consumers that no selfie looks that good
so why is it that some people would get
upset at this real
without realizing that it's a marketing
strategy why would you suspend disbelief
that this selfie looks that good when
none of them ever looked that good in
the first place even on a pixel but
anyway general thoughts on this little
controversy you know how they have how
Apple has billboards on the side of
major roads and in like Times Square
billboard the size of it's really really
big you know what I mean yeah exactly
do you really and it says like shot on
iPhone and it's like a scene of a
mountain do you really think that that
picture was taken on an iPhone there's
no way it's not it needs to be like
hundreds of megapixels right so like
this happens all the time I don't know
why people would get upset about it I
mean I'm sure the front-facing camera on
the Nova 3 is quite serviceable
especially if you have good lighting and
you're not ugly but like this is just so
common why is it a surprise yeah it's
all about add traits I mean we've seen a
lot of this you know behind the scenes
for food where you stick a cotton ball
soaked in water and you heat it in the
microwave and then they place it behind
a bowl and then it begins with steaming
ball food like they use these little
tricks to demonstrate or vocal ''tis of
the product or to demonstrate a feature
of that product in in lieu of actually
having the product for one reason or
another maybe the production unit has
not been made available to the ad crew
or something like that so you make do
and I don't think it's entirely fair
that every single time we go after a
company for these tactics like there
there are some things that should be
scrutinized like if they're making a
specific performance performance points
and they're using comparatives
one-on-one comparisons of devices like
that should be really taken into v that
should be looked at very very closely
other than that I really don't see
anything here
yeah well Anton you you wrote you broke
the news on this one and you also got
updates from Huawei themselves yeah
seven format sure but I want to just do
a short no trip down memory lane it was
2012 and I was back then just a senior
editor at Pocket now I was covering
Aoife in Berlin for for the 2012 edition
and it was late in the evening because
my post went up at 3:00 something the
Eastern Time which translates to like 10
p.m. in in Berlin when I saw the first
Lumia I'm not even sure what kind of
Lumia and that was when there was a
clear reflection of Nokia or Nokia's ad
team using a professional camera rig to
film a video presentation or a video and
which was claimed to be filmed on that
particular not yet and if my memory
serves that was the first instance where
we saw either a company or an
advertising company mislead us this way
and ever since then it's become a trend
now I'm not saying I'm not saying I
approve this I'm in the post I even said
that I'm not even sure this was who
always decision maybe just yet
production company went the extra mile
he wanted to make a great ad and and
that's pretty much it but yes Huawei
reached out to me just like minutes
after posting a particular article and
they sent me two updates first one was a
translation from arabic arabic i'm sorry
to english which was a disclaimer at the
end of the ads saying that let me not
misquote that the product images and
contents are provided for reference only
and then the second update was that the
purpose of this advertisement is to
demonstrate how consumers can use the
features so it's basic marketing talk of
a company that knows they messed up even
if it's not the direct mess up but
they're now trying to just sue them or
change the conversation a little bit yes
they did it people didn't before people
will did it after them I'm not reading
too much into this but I personally
disagree with this kind of
advertisements hmm yeah I think I think
that there are very valid arguments for
why this this level of I'll use the word
trickery is is used and wasn't there
another wall we won cuz I was I was on
it I was on a different show
other day and they has talked about how
huawei used it was while we write that
you just stock images and doctored those
that actually kind of made me mad
because when I when I when I see that
like you're literally taking someone
else's work and making it your own like
that's something that really upsets me
as a creator in this case yes it's
deceiving because it's not the phone
itself but they go through the actual
process of creating the ad which to me
is okay that part is okay there's a
creation aspect to it but in the other
in the other case where they use the
stock photo that's just straight copying
that's just straight taking away that
that one I really didn't like and this
one relates to this kind of thing yeah
definitely exactly so while the the
trickery is deceiving and it's not
something that we're all I would say
probably everyone here is not really in
support of this kind of practice at the
same time like I really the only person
I really feel bad for is the actress who
now no longer will ever work with Huawei
ever again
that's really my one my one piece of
sadness from this oh my be so sadness is
a little bit bigger larger it it can be
basically summed up to a simple thought
we are in the business and we are
watching the business closely so we know
what we're talking about and we spot
bullshit when we see it but my my mother
your sister is watching an ad on TV or
on YouTube says oh my God look at the
selfies this photo is creating or
snapping and they go by that phone and
they snap selfie after selfie after
selfie a hundred selfies later they
return the phone because it's bad to get
a new on a replacement and it's still
bet now should I sue the company for a
misleading ad or should I never buy
anything from the particular company or
should I just give it a pass this is my
main dilemma because we cannot be
influenced but a typical average not
well informed user can really be
influenced by this
well you know grandma who just bought
the Nova three should have asked her
grandson who is in the industry grandson
what phone should I get I like Nova
three looks great should I buy
and I saw the ad and then you'd be like
grandma no why don't you get an iPhone
or a Samsung Galaxy S 9 which has a
fantastic front-facing camera and
regardless of what phone you get make
sure there's enough light on your
beautiful face before you take the
picture or else it won't work
no sir leave it you can create a better
phone than that just by alchemy also
grandma what are you doing in Egypt all
right so yeah thoughts aside on
advertisements like this maybe we will
end up seeing more of this happen
because there is another phone that
while we is slated to announce in the
coming months and we are getting as
usual leaks galore on this kind of thing
so the meet 20 in May 2000 made twenty
light whatever you want to kind of
speculate might be getting announced or
released the guys over at xda-developers
commissioned and published renders of
them a twenty based on new details and
photographs that the outlet that you
guys obtained from an anonymous source
now the device itself does have what you
might be able to call a teardrop knotch
it'll be more like the essential phones
where it's really only housing the
camera and then speaking of cameras on
the rear there is an l-shape of three
different cameras so you're still
getting three much like on the p20 pro
but they're in a different configuration
now any thoughts or any excitement over
the mate twenty especially considering
what we've seen in the p20 earlier this
year
Antone's really yes i'm really always
super excited about the full flagship
from Huawei because that sets the tone
for whatever we're going to see next
it's gonna have the new Kiran processor
is gonna have advancements and it's
gonna probably reuse all the cool stuff
from the people he Pro I agree with most
of the renders which have been published
with a tear drop thing with with
removing the fingerprint scanner and
button finally from the front of the
phone what I do not agree with and I'm
gonna argument it is the back of the
phone and that particular placement of
the lenses I'm probably 100% sure that
the main 20 in its Pro iteration not
maybe that not the 20 or the 20 light
but the pro will have three
cameras but just think about it for a
second there's a reason why why cameras
have to be aligned because regardless if
they are horizontal or vertical there's
a difference in the vantage point in the
angle at which the camera is looking at
you and if you're looking from this
perspective and the other camera is
looking just on an X or Y axis from a
different point that can be corrected
but if the vantage point is different on
both axes that's hard to correct because
you're gonna have one snapshot from here
and one from here and that cannot be
corrected so that's that's the only
thing that I'm objecting to the I'm
excited yes of course I'm excited I hope
I get the chance to go to the unveiling
which historically happened in Germany
for the past two years and I'm really
close yeah oh yeah that would be really
fun I think I agree with you on the
parallax situation it's going to be
harder to correct for nonetheless I mean
Google and other tech companies are
finding new ways every single day to
figure out what to do with their cameras
so perhaps we might see that correction
to the future so but I don't think
that's we're here at this stage right
now in any case I don't think in in
terms of that like that line of thought
would be really for a hybrid product
like if all three cameras were used that
wants to take a picture and I don't see
that happening with this setup I think
it's gonna be most useful if we see that
41 Magus or whatever like large-format
megapixel sensor as the sole kind of
that odd one out as opposed to the
whatever the traditional ones that might
be on one side because like we see we
see about me 10 no P 20 Pro the
opposition with regular and then we got
the big biggie
like you know like a hero well there you
go
I'm showing it off yeah let me take it
out of the case it's AB less than me to
put a case on this it is I saw one
recently the by the way
the Ukraine with one of my friends like
he was turning around he was as lovely
and we had some great beers with it too
in any case yeah like I don't see that
going into a hybrid product for imagery
that's all I don't know I feel like I
feel like there are some instances where
multiple cameras or multiple lenses
multiple sensors whatever you want to
call it are use together and I agree
Anton that that the just even just the
millimeters of off access could end up
making things a little bit difficult but
and but maybe like a slash huawei's
engineering is gonna find a way to make
that work i thing is though I don't like
it either but not even just for that
reason I just don't like how that looks
yeah they're in an L shape but then you
have the flash right there so it's like
I don't know it's just as big and you
know what these renders great that they
even exist it just makes it seem like
it's gonna be this bulbous back it's
gonna be moto Z like almost and I don't
want that at all like this you you're
required I'm just gonna pop up the Moto
zz3 real quick which my review is almost
done by the way it's gonna be out on
PocketNow soon so stay tuned for that
but this this humpback here like you
need a style cover to make this make
sense and I don't like that and if the
if the p20 Pro or whatever the case may
be has this large hump on the back I'm
not gonna be happy about that whatsoever
the Brandon any thoughts on this it also
has by the way speaking of high-end
features for the flagship from Huawei
forty-two hundred million power battery
I mean I just saying that could be a lot
that could be amazing
um yeah I'm also kind of made
uncomfortable by the l-shaped triple
camera system but actually you know what
I'm starting to realize this triple
camera thing is like a thing and it's
gonna stay I don't know if you guys saw
the leak for the v40 that's another
triple camera system arranged
horizontally which actually I think
looks awesome very badass I don't think
that through the fact that the cameras
are arranged like an L are a problem for
taking pictures I can i they can fix
that probably very easily with soft
just compensate for the for the distance
but this triple camera thing is a thing
and I just hope that you know the OCD
and me wants them to be aligned
vertically or horizontally not in an L
shape I mean why don't they put them in
a triangular shape can you imagine
looks like Brainiac
yeah the Lightning l16 has been
mentioned many times in this podcast oh
my goodness
I am NOT going to go further than that
also you know what would have been
helpful here if we got on George
Georgia de Burgh Dooley who wrote up the
original article on this but
unfortunately but I think I don't think
he's available right now maybe I'll talk
to him later
oh sorry go for it I was just about to
say one thing to your point Brendon yes
I I agree with you and apparently
analysts agree with you as well I posted
something yesterday it was analysts
reports industry sources all the kind of
pieces I hate writing because I don't
trust analysts and Industry sources but
the trend has been set and I think that
as you mentioned everybody will follow
and as that particular report mentioned
triple cameras will become and standard
moving forward on flagship smartphones
just like double-double cameras are now
is yes sir and it took the first double
camera that mattered was the iPhone 7
plus which was 2016 so took about two
years just like the fingerprint sensor
with the iPhone 5s took about two years
for you know all of the major
manufacturers to follow that so what's
interesting about the triple camera
thing just as a final note about that is
that it's not it's not Apple leading the
way it's it's Huawei and Huawei has a
lot of influence but then again when did
Apple lead the way in in in
technological advancements but is it
doing it it's always Apple doesn't lead
but it does it better and yes has it
been able to argue this points in recent
times with its double camera feature it
makes a lot of sense yeah it makes a lot
of sense to be the second person to step
on on ice just to see if it breaks under
the first person so it makes sense to do
it that way and it doesn't
means Apple is a follower but it has
been proven that whenever Apple does
something second or third they not
actually do it better but they find a
way to make it more exciting and useful
more appealing to the public that's more
mainstream yes maybe one of these days
we'll do a deep dive instead like what
we would prefer out of our smartphone
cameras I will just put down two quick
things number one more wide-angle please
and speaking of which if we're going to
put a lot of work in the rear cameras
and even adding more cameras to the back
why don't we put this level of work into
the front-facing camera I can't the
number one thing that I hate in any
smartphone is a too narrow front-facing
camera I'm a blogger and if you can only
see this when I take a photo on the run
facing camera I need to be able to show
more like this that's all you need to
see and that's not like this little of
format of like the face if the vlog
actually just masked my face and tracked
it and normalized its motion it's a
video log not of not a perfect solution
for you Josh I got the perfect solution
back in I don't know what it was I since
I've reviewed most of the Sony Xperia
phones and pocket now I of course
reviewed the Xperia z5 premium which was
the first 4k smartphone and I had the
mirror finish it was a breeze to take
selfies with the back camera because it
was mirror on the back so you basically
come easily freeing herself
that's your that sort of the logging
phone my friend yeah I would love to
check I would love to try that out and
and little things like that little
details like that just me just matter to
me and I like phones that actually pay
that attention
just a little a little bit of trivia
what was the firt what was the first and
only phone do have oh is on the
front-facing camera HD haha which you
know what I loved like that level of
detail it's it's it's something that is
very did something that's not really
found in front-facing cameras too often
these days and it should ok we were
talking about dual cameras earlier and
we were talking about the iPhone let's
talk about the iPhone 10 a little bit so
some analysts in the tech world can can
usually see when a phone is going to get
really popular especially when it's at
its release but it seems like a lot of
them were
the most part a little bit wrong about
the iPhone 10 it did not sell like
hotcakes like they expected however it
seems that the sales of the iPhone 10
are kind of on an upward trend which is
kind of the worst time for it to happen
because a new iPhone is slated to be
announced in the next couple of months
the whole situations that no one can
agree on what's actually happening with
iPhone sales because we see the supply
chain reports say oh you have so many
parts left in these bins what are we
going to do with them and then you have
Apple which goes on you know every
earnings call to say the iPhone 10 has
outsold every other model every week
in your entire life that's the
dissonance that we are seeing here and
it's kind of crazy to be talking about
this especially as the numbers might
have disappointed analyst a bit but the
general kind of feeling and flow of the
iPhone 10 has been that it's fairly
popular and to hear this new street the
research house analysts talk about how
this popularity of the iPhone 10 which
is said to be going out of production
sin and to make way for the new iPhones
is going to have this popularity bump is
going to have a negative impact both for
the currents well the upcoming year as
well as the year after that so in the
2019 fiscal year for Apple which starts
in the holiday quarter they I believe
the number is 10% lower revenues below
the consensus consensus of Wall Street
and then for 2020 earnings per share is
gonna go down 6% below average
projections so that's the summary for
that um I don't know how to really feel
about that I mean could this be a good
could this be a strategy moving forward
that when you release a phone you're
expecting a year later for it so it
actually it know because our smart we've
been saying that our smart phones are
getting really good so obviously like
people are still using the let's say
Galaxy s8 to great effect you know and
the iPhone 10 could be a very relevant
phone
it just takes a while for it's actually
stick obviously this is wishful thinking
on the part of the company to be able to
do that kind of strategy but maybe
that's what's happening with the iPhone
10 I think I think there's there's a lot
of logic and common sense behind what's
happening with the iPhone 10 which I
cannot say for what the analyst says and
let me address both of them I think that
the iPhone 10 is selling well
particularly at this moment in time
because of two reasons number one we
knew from the get-go that the iPhone 10
will be an anniversary edition it will
be the 10 year of iPhone and Apple will
probably discontinue it after producing
the initial batch which instantly
boosted its resale value number two
since we are so close to the new iPhones
the iPhone 10 is becoming cheaper and
cheaper to purchase so more and more
people who wanted to buy them the first
place are looking at the iPhone 10 now
so that explains a boost now towards the
end of the cycle for a phone which Apple
will no longer do ever the iPhone 10 is
unique that's the explanation as far as
the analyst and the report is going it
doesn't make sense in my mind to say
that the new iPhones will not sell
because the old iPhone was popular it's
like saying the note 9 will sell less
because the note 8 was popular it
doesn't make sense in my mind that my
logic and my brain is just breaking into
if somebody can explain this to me
please go ahead but I don't find any
logic in this I mean you know it depends
on how many how many people in the
upgrade pool the eligible upgrade pool
have been able to say alright this is
what I want and I'm gonna go with it for
the next 24 to 30 months or whenever the
next upgrade is and whenever that never
kind of you know it always goes up and
down but you know if there's been an
average if there's been an aberration in
the trend going up then that's kind of
what they used to tell so perhaps that
might be the situation we're dealing
with I'm not exactly sure in terms of
the iPhone 10 itself I mean we've been
looking forward to the iPhone 9 I've
been calling it some people have been
calling it the iPhone a 10 ass or like
no no the LCD model is what we're
talking about here and
no I'm sorry I'm just confusing myself
here because there let me let me take it
over so the we've had the 8 and the A+
it will make sense knowing Apple to have
the 8s and the 8's plus but Apple
already has an iPhone set so the
discussion is whether we will have an 8
s and we will have a 10 s we will have a
9 it doesn't really matter these are the
2018 iPhones regardless if it's gonna be
the iPhone 25 or the iPhone 44 the
question is why shouldn't people
purchase the new iPhone because the
iPhone sin is popular and again I'm
stressing this no I was about to say at
the 5.8 inch model has been told by many
many sources rumors and otherwise that
it will be the exact it will be
identical even down to dimensions to the
iPhone 10 if there's a poet screen if
they're 5.8 inch screen it's gonna have
new internals of course which but like
does that really a what's the meaning to
that though what is everything except
it's not the iPhone 10 it's not the
anniversary edition and it's not a
so-called limited edition phone which to
many including to me means a lot because
just the same way I've held on to my 808
PureView and my 920 and I might 2010 20
all the phones which are milestones
means something to either their owners
their users or the company so I think
that the iPhone 10 is in a situation
Apple is it a situation with the iPhone
10 where they can say years and years
later that that was the 10th anniversary
and people loved it not because of the
AMOLED screen or because we remove the
touch ID home button but because it was
the 10th anniversary of the iPhone
that's the one that's going to get into
the glass case right Brendan yeah go for
it yeah just to jump in real quick one
way to understand the popularity of a
device is to very simply look around you
and I don't know about you guys but I I
noticed that when the iPhone 10 came out
of the end of 2017 and the first half of
2018 I barely saw the phone but now I
see it pretty frequently
maybe because as Tony says the prices
are going down people are realizing that
it's a special
addition but I think it's just because
people were waiting to see you know if
it's any good so the early adopters kind
of picked it up in the in the end of
2017 early 2018 and now they're out in
the wild enough for like Grandma to be
like oh that looks cool and and I
haven't heard my grandson complain about
that phone so I'm gonna get that phone
and so sales kind of accelerate as there
are more phones in the field and more
people buy them because it's like
advertising and one more thing when when
the iPhone sent launched Brendan it was
the first and the only mainstream phone
which had a one thousand dollar price
tag now there are at least your three
others so the shock factor the the wow
factor the surprise factor is no longer
a deciding factor on whether I'm going
to buy that or not of course I'm going
to go for an iPhone ten one year later
to just purchase it for 750 instead of
1,000 at launch day but it is no longer
the only 1000 dollar phone out there and
I'm not talking the about the
Lamborghini enroll suite citizens and so
on in the world one more thing and
that's you know even price has less to
do with it these days I know that so
very few people unfortunately go buy
phones that are on sale just for the
fact that you know sales only have an
end resort period but like they're
looking for bargains they're looking for
depreciation because that's what time
does and they might be searching you
know like different markets or even
market places such as swap ago to swap
calm to trade if you look at the replug
that blog or no plug you're right I mean
even before we looked at swap Oz
listings
I have personally written about a report
saying that the iPhone 10 is about the
only phone which is retaining more than
75 to 80 percent of its resale value so
that that's and that has to mean
something and not necessarily to those
who own it but to the rest because I can
easily ask $400 for my phone if nobody's
gonna pay that but if somebody's willing
to pay 80%
of its original value then it means that
the perception the wide perception is in
agreeance with that and whether you have
an iPhone 7 8 or 10 when the iPhone the
next iPhone gets announced the prices on
all of those will plummet so like you
know it is a good time to sell yeah
definitely
wouldn't it be nice though if we were
having conversations as deep as this
that we have with the iPhone that we
have with the Samsung's of the world
wouldn't it be nice if we had these
conversations about a brand like Nokia
it would be great if we could get a
little bit of that love on there because
the Nokia 7 plus is actually getting a
bit of that love as we move on to our
next story where apparently the Nokia 7
plus was awarded the best consumer
smartphone of the year by the expert
imaging and sound Association now if you
don't really if you're not really
familiar with that association don't
worry neither am i so the nokia 7 plus
if you could forgive me for not
remembering the library here at pocket
now but did you guys do a review of the
Nokia 7 plus here no we had a hands-on
at the MWC but we never got to review
the phone ah gotcha apparently there are
certain aspects of this device that are
very special there's a reliability
elegant operating system it does get
some marks because it has the fastest
but one of the fastest update cycles but
the reason why is because it's using
Android one in the first place and
apparently in an event in India the
Nokia 7 plus is going to get the
official PI image in September so it's
actually going to be
Android Pi as well one of the few by
September any thoughts on the Nokia 7
plus I I think I do remember it was MWC
that we saw it I did like it a lot I
will admit but is it enough to call it
like the best phone of the year I'd like
I'd like to go last because I have some
notes which are not related to the Nokia
phone itself but 2e is a so please take
it away oh okay um did any of you other
guys Brendon and Jules as you take a
look at this phone at all like have you
been able to like hold it or anything
like that
I like the construction on in and it was
just fine for let's say like a 250 to
300 dollar wish though and it's great I
mean it was no Scirocco yeah it was no
siroccos no you know stock software fast
updates this has been the tech
enthusiasts dream they've been clamoring
for this kind of thing and they have
finally got it and it seems like this
validation has come from Issa so like
this is what they've been hoping for for
all along and someone has come to save
them it's not a savior has come Brendon
what was the last Nokia you've ever used
[Laughter]
a few years ago through was I wanted to
try Windows Phone one last time and
there was like on Amazon they had like a
hundred and $49 Nokia cheese I forget
what it was it was some Nokia Windows
Phone and I returned it because there
were literally no apps for it but the
seven plus I think the seven plus looks
really nice and I haven't had one when
it's good to hear that Jules says that
it has good construction it reminds me
of the note 7 the way it has like a chin
and a far head and just like a immersive
display in the center I think it's a
really beautiful design and the fact
that the Android updates are fast make
it really compelling mmm and now Anton I
feel like you're gonna blow the lid off
of this story oh yeah oh yeah so again I
have the utmost respect for eisa and
according to Wikipedia it's a
collaboration between different
multimedia magazines that offer tests of
cameras video cameras and so on so
they're fellow journalists but I would
like to ask you guys one thing what's
the difference between a consumer smart
phone and a smart phone I mean I'm
looking at their website now and while
we do see the Nakia 7 plus the best
consumer smartphone the best smartphone
is the Huawei P 20 pro what's the
difference between a consumer smartphone
and the best Mart phone that's question
number one and the only reason why I'm
in doubt about this again with all due
respect to e is a
number two and this is probably another
thing which makes my mind just crack
into and my logic just go out the window
it's the same thing like in the USA with
the cars you're talking about a 2019
model in 2018 how can you a is a or any
other publication for that matter call a
smartphone in 2018 the best product for
2019 because it's best product 2018 2019
I mean there's so many phones to come
out even this year it's the pixel it's
the iPhones it's you name it you cannot
call a best product 2018-2019 for a
consumer smart phone the Nokia and the
best product 2018-2019 as a best
smartphone the huawei because the two
categories don't make sense in my mind
and it doesn't make sense for you to
call a phone the best phone for next
year this year that's the lid there we
go
Wow it's the season I was about just
about to say this does feel like yeah I
love the automobile industry analogy
there because maybe that is where we're
going because literally in the car
industry you have a new model every
single year and it could be this car
this model 2019 this car this model 2020
that kind of thing and that's kind of
where smartphones have gone in the last
few years so this trend might be
starting this might be a sign of that
starting and whether or not that's a
good thing I mean it depends on how much
weight you put on the wards like this
but anyway Brendan yeah Tony you're just
asking what's the difference between a
consumer phone and just a regular phone
and I think it just comes down to price
like consumer more price friendly just a
regular phone is like kind of more like
if you're using your phone front for
work you will spare no expense and
you're willing to pay more money and the
you know the p20 Pro much more expensive
than the Nokia I'm totally with you but
wouldn't have been easier and more
transparent to call the Nokia 7 plus the
best mid-range or budget or affordable
smartphone and the b20 Pro the best
flagship high-end expensive smartphone
it'll have been in my mind in my
a lot more straightforward
I agree but that's not how people on the
street talk like my brother that has the
iPhone 10 isn't like hey check out my my
high-end my flagship and hey hey pay
buddy over there you got the mid-range
err don't use the best street talk I've
ever heard known fact about Philadelphia
so there is an intersection that I have
wanted to visit and this has been
pointing out by the Facebook group new
urbanist memes for transit-oriented
teens there is a intersection
I believe it's 69th Street and Dix
Avenue 69 AMX I talk about Street talk
right okay so not to really cut anybody
off Brennan if you had one more point I
wanted to make sure that you had it now
that's it I'm gonna next podcast I'm
gonna go to 69th and Dick's just for
truth all right so um we do have to we
are going to get into our deep dive
topic in a second but we are going to
have a tiny break one thing that I do
want to mention though is that Anton has
a bit of a harder out on the show so in
about five minutes he's gonna be on his
way out which is perfect for me to SQ
and this little break that we have
before our final or final portion of the
show can you give us like it's been 10
years that you've been here a pocket now
and are there any sort of stories or
memories that you want to share from
that long history that you have with
this company oh there's there's plenty
of stories we don't have enough tonight
for those stories starting from the
first the message I have received from
Brendan when I was an active user and
xda-developers to come and write for a
website all the way through working with
Evan blasts of leaks to becoming
managing editor and then to taking over
PocketNow and then to take a step back
and focus more on content now all the
way through everybody with whom I've
worked with whether it's a client a
partner a colleague and my colleagues I
mean I don't know all the people that
that
we're here with us even on the path
guests I mean if I come to think about
the podcast I've bought guested with the
Evan glass and I'm talking only about
hosts now Evan bless brandon minimun
Michael Fisher Stevens shank Jules Wang
and now Joshua Vergara and I've been a
host myself several times and not even
gonna go into all the EFA's where I said
that it's gonna be my last Eva and the
MWC so it's it's been a long it's been a
long and interesting ride and as I said
in my tweets and then my Facebook
updates on social media I am so so
thankful to everybody who has been here
with me in these 10 years because it's
been it's been ten interesting years
there have been challenges there were
good signs and bedtimes but what matters
is that we are here a community talking
to our big community and that makes me
feel like I'm home whether I'm talking
to Brandon what I'm talking to you Josh
who are the newest member of my family
that's that's how I feel every time I
talk to you guys that I'm I'm home
where's my Kleenex okay thank you for
that that was really awesome and you
know what it's it's gonna be great
because like no matter no matter where
you might be in however many years down
the road like I feel like anybody who is
new to the team and right now I'm the
I'm probably the newest member I would
the newest members would come to you for
like the history and for a lot of like
the old stories and just ways of knowing
like the history of a place like
PocketNow and I didn't realize that the
the the the symbiotic relationship
between PocketNow and XT a was so strong
even way back when yes I sorted off as
as an xda-developers senior moderator
and that was a popular rom chef back in
the day so yeah it back then it was
pocket now in some other media outlets
which started off really really early
and there was xda-developers
the only place where somebody could talk
to somebody else who was probably
interested in the same things as you
were and have a normal debate about
something
which was usually how to take out your
stylus and tap on a huge icon on a 320
by 240 screen yeah I always remember
those those ROM talks on next day
developers back in the day well it's
it's speaking just as the newest member
and one of the younger members of the
team like it's it's an honor to be with
someone who's been such a veteran here
so thank you for all the work that
you've done as well thank you for making
me feel I'm older than I am I was trying
to think of the right like word and
crazy and the order that could come up
was like I respect the seniority but
then that's kind of like all right
awesome so uh yeah I do want to continue
our check in a little bit thank you
again Anton and here's rather than any
more tears and whenever you feel like
you need to pop off feel free to do so I
wanted to check in with Jules and
Brendan how are things been since our
last episode Jules I think is who I
really want to hear from because we
really missed you last week okay and we
tried our best very glad that you did
and you put a very good show in my place
I mean I've been checking the ratings
for that and it's been doing
exceptionally well so lovely guys in any
case my travels have been going well
after leaving New York a couple weeks
ago so I'd go to Dublin well I didn't
decide to go but I planned out a trip
centered on wedding in Kiev that I had
to attend I was honored to be invited
and I was glad to be able to you know
call this guy friend he's actually the
CEO of Eve tech which made the eve
computer the crowd-sourced spects
computer that was also crowd funded it
got backing from Microsoft and whatnot
so like you know for him to have invited
me the only meeting like media guy the
only us guy that he really you know
knows like that was interesting and I
made sure that I did this whole
operation as cheaply as possible so that
meant integrating the note 9
thing going on there and then making
sure that I haven't had places to stay
in Dublin or in London that were cheap I
actually here this is actually all my
friends work from my childhood friend
who happened to be planning a trip to
the London anyways and wanted to be here
for the first time so like he just gave
me this Airbnb for free so I'm very
fortunate to be doing this right here
right now and the sky internet here this
guy's doing pretty good for this podcast
so yeah it does look pretty good and
you've been you've been just literally
touring Europe and it's it's awesome
that uh it's awesome to see that so
thank you for being able to join us
despite being out and about right now
oh there you go we'll have a good trip
and Oh Anton those way out yes thank you
very much for having me and one last
thing
Jules hashtag shave that mic all right
Brandon quick check-in from you before
we get to our main topic for today yes
so I got the note 9 here I got it
yesterday and pull the trigger man I
just yeah I had to that's right yeah
what was the phrasing that you did the
world something wins again or whatever
like I just had to anyway people like
both Jaime and Josh were trying to
convince you not to jump from the 1 plus
6 because you had already made the
investment so I feel like this was a
surprise hey check out how my recent
look oh my God look at that parallax
growing it's so cool
so um I just made a video that I have to
edit and it takes me four times longer
to edit a video than you guys on how to
speed up the note 9 because there's a
bunch of things you could do to make it
faster but there's an app that so many
people forget about it's called good
luck 2018 which lair which like has been
so much improved that it allows you on
the note 9 and any Samsung phone to add
gesture control from the side so swipe
over and down goes home swipe over goes
back swipe up
goes to your recents which is great
because you can hide the notifier on the
bottom and still use gestures it also
lets you change the look in the feel of
the recent switch is what I just showed
you until like a carousel like thing and
I know it's kind of foo-foo but it's fun
and different
it lets you customize the lockscreen and
do a lot of other like deeper like UI
changes to a Samsung phone and it's
called good good lock 2018 and if you've
got a note 9 or really like any Samsung
phone it's really worth checking out
there's a lot of cool stuff you can do
that bit about the swiping would have
made the perfect segue but like I just
had one more thing to say and that's
like going to like you tap on the
developer settings are the kernel
whatever they can get to developer
settings and then you go into all the
animation logs and then set that to
either like scale or halftime or no
animation and that's another cool way to
just you know get rid of all that fluff
when you and that's one of the things I
mentioned the video but if you go to 0
animations because this system needs
time to draw the app on the screen it
can actually feel more laggy so that's
why I think point 5 is good and actually
if you know how to use ADB with Android
developer tools you can change these the
animations to any variable so like if
you want to go 0.25 you can do that and
that's super fast but not not zero so
you're right that's a very good one that
a lot of people also to forget about
screen animations well speaking of
tweaks we are moving into a phone that
has a pedigree of software tweaks and
software enhancements speaking of
launchers and whatnot it's a little bit
of the me UI in a new brand new brand I
love that phrase I keep using it it's a
brand new brand from Xiaomi it's called
poco or poco phone it's a little bit
different because in India I because I
kept hearing that the brand is just poco
it's not poco phone
so there's a little bit of a mix-up here
but I mean your phone just as well as
mine has the tramp stamps that there's a
poco phone on it
yeah exactly yeah oh they can go like
straight up over here but the thing is I
have to refocus the polka phone f1 and
Jules and I as we have just revealed
have been using this phone for a little
while I unfortunately just no cards on
the table I haven't been able to give
the phone the quality time it deserves
but I did do a first impressions video
of it over on my channel meanwhile Jules
wrote an article about it at
pocketnow.com so I'm going to go ahead
and pop it over to you Jules and give us
your reactions on this really
interesting device specifically can you
show me how long have you been waiting
to do that can you talk about the camera
please because no one's no one's really
talked that much about the camera and it
seems like such a good lower priced
phone if the camera is good note that
note I will say real quick sorry Jules
um that that's the reason why I didn't
want to give my final thoughts on the
phone yet because I do want to give the
camera as much time as possible so I can
actually see how it would perform but
anyway Jules I'm gonna ensure we have
final supper yet because I believe this
was supposed to be launching with me UI
10 and what we have on here is me UI 9 6
yeah and the other thing too is that
they have an infrared camera selfie
camera 4 on facial authentication that
has not been activated yet so we can't
use that feature yet we would love to
although at least a consumer launch time
that features that will be available so
I guess we could do Apple samples on
that but in any case I've been using
this phone with multiple Sims from
Ireland and even project 5 right now
it's on project 5 for the past 12 13
days it's been providing great
connections for me with that Snapdragon
a 45 that integrated Snapdragon x.x
money bone oh yes correct
Qualcomm thank you for that and it's
been performing just well I mean this
this this does have the analogues to the
no.9 that galaxy no nine because it has
it outs a liquid cooling system with
that copper stripe going somewhere I
haven't seen tear downs at this device
yet so it's anyone's guess how that
exactly works or how you know what kind
of numbers they produce but I haven't
seen any hang-ups on this six gigabyte
model six gigabyte RAM so it's been
doing alright for me and yeah like
there's a whole bunch of other stuff in
terms of me UI that we talked about a
lot of the changes that they've already
made even though it's not final software
or what have been baked into nine six
this version this poco launcher here and
it does have those full screen gestures
so that you remove the navigation bar of
course you can still have it it's an
option but you can swipe up to go home
swipe and hold and then you'll get
multitasking and then swipe from the
sides for back either way you just go
back um which I really got used to
quickly I'm dual wielding with the pixel
two and I found myself swiping from the
sides and you're trying to why not it's
like that felt very very natural for me
it does suck though that it does
interfere with a lot of the side menu
interfaces on yes yeah I was about to
say like when I when I use a keyboard
and I want to swipe from the back space
button in order to remove full words
sometimes I hit back on accident and
it's you know you have to be kind of
careful about that and again you know
I'm going to be there are certain things
that in the tech world people understand
me as I'm the Smart Watch skeptic for
one and number two I'm also the guy that
hates full screen gestures so it's just
gonna be my hot take on those but but
speaking of hot takes like here's here
is one angle that I wanted to ask you
guys and Brandon Brandon from being from
being on the outside looking in since
you're not using this phone you see the
spec sheet you see what's possible here
I suppose it's not going to be the
biggest surprise that Xiaomi is able to
put all of these high-end specifications
on phones that are supposed to be more
portable they've done it with their me
series quite a bit and even with a phone
that has ceramic even with phones that
have ceramic it's still probably better
priced and most other flagships
generally so Xiaomi is they know what
they're doing in this case and with poco
phone with the f1 they're actually
undercutting it even more with the phone
that's $300 and it has the 845 so my
question to you guys is this hot take
that people seem to have at least from
the preliminary outset the flagship
killer killer like does this does this
strike you as at all even close to that
type of moniker that's why I wanted to
know what you guys thought about the
camera and I appreciate that it's too
soon to give your take on the camera
because my my thinking was that for
awhile for most of this year the best
budget phone if you care about camera
build quality performance and that kind
of thing was the honor sephadex which
you could get for like $1.99 the camera
on that is very good for the price and
so but but but I think the
specifications of the poco phoner are
very impressive and so whether it's the
full package
you know relates to whether the camera
is any good and I've never used a xiaomi
phone so III don't know how they perform
like I used the vivo NEX recently and I
was just super impressed with I've never
used a view of own super impressed with
how that phone this camera was so I
wouldn't be surprised if I and you guys
were surprised by the camera so in terms
of the camera let's we'll go with the
selfie camera first 20 megapixels I have
thoughts on this run in the first
impressions article that I put down and
I also have some photos which some of
them are in the wrong orientation and
they can't do anything about that
because the back end is acting up weird
so thank you know WordPress for some
reason but in any case 20 megapixels
there are still a lot of the features
that you would expect out of a me UI
things such as beautification a I sort
of thing you got the portrait mode
or extra bouquet features and in terms
of you know being able to execute those
features it does a mediocre job on that
I'll be honest there there is kind of an
Asian Syndrome thing going on too
because of the beautiful mode at all to
any level you'll get whiter skin and get
softer but more portly whiter skin and
that's uh I mean I understand at least
initially that we're dealing with the
Indian market and you know as much as we
don't like it or as much as there are
ethical questions that's a trip that's
in high demand look at that look at that
Josh look at that yeah like oh look how
light skinned I am in this photo like
this and the thing is like as as
American users as Western users this is
like the whitest Wow as I attempt to
refocus on myself over here there you go
the the thing is that this is something
that if you've ever used a Xiaomi phone
before you come to expect and any Asian
phone in general and you know far be it
for me to be that Western user that says
it's not what I want out of my selfie
cameras but you know what it's it is a
marker that they're hitting and that's
almost to their credit because they're
they're managing said put a 20 megapixel
camera on here that gives the users in
the markets this phone will be coming
out in exactly what they want which is
softening which is lighter skin beauty
modes and stuff like that so I can't I I
want to knock it but I still understand
why it's there you guys know why like
this might be a really stupid question
but why do these phones that tena come
from the Asian side of the world have
this very heavy skin smoothing beauty
mode what's the story it's the simple
answer is demand and for a lot of the
users who are on that works like we
chats or I'm trying member what the name
of some other networks are but we chat
is like one of the biggest one in China
if you look at any photos of a user on
WeChat they what they're looking for is
too is too soft in and to remove
blemishes or anything like that like the
beauty industry in Asia is so prevalent
that it even bleeds into our smartphone
in the digital space oh good blog -
followed by the way is the Shanghai
they've been personally lots of photos
lots of a video like time-lapse videos
from Weibo showing off these girls that
you know start off you know bleary-eyed
like they've just woken up and then they
go through a whole transformation
process like those videos have been very
popular recently and leave them just
popping up like wildflowers yeah then
this could be this could be in and of
itself a deep dive that we could do on a
different show on a different episode
because it is a big topic and it's
something that I think Western users
like myself have had to struggle
understanding a little bit and I
wouldn't know this if I wasn't dating
somebody who is from the Philippines who
was from that market who understands
that because whereas people like us
would review these phones and look at
like all the front-facing camera has
good detail it does a pretty good job
she would actually review it in terms of
how well it applies its beauty modes so
if if her skin was way too waxy then she
would say it's a bad front-facing camera
and was you know what people look for
that man I really need beauty mode I'm
telling you guys I'm gonna keep it on I
mean let me give you what let me give
you an example what a bad beauty mode
would be a bad beauty mode would take
away your 5 o'clock shadow and like
that's a bad beauty mode it's too much
and on the flip side of bad beauty mode
would also be too much detail because
it's not doing anything so there are
users who want beauty mode in the
front-facing camera who would probably
go for something like the poco phone who
wouldn't like the front-facing camera of
the pixel too because it's too detailed
because it's not it because it doesn't
hide its this is a very odd conversation
to sort of skirt because yes the point
of the beauty mode is to hide your
imperfections and there is there it is a
problematic phrase to use but ultimately
that is what is in demand in Asia anyway
that we've gone off tangent in this case
but this is the front-facing camera that
we're talking about any thoughts on the
rear facing camera drills that you can
share because I don't have it yeah yeah
so in terms of the rear facing camera
I'm not sure if I'm at if I was clear to
you know talk about what their internal
benchmarking standards were like so like
I was very vague in terms of
what they want to aim for we do have
what's considered something from last
year it's the center that I use the Sony
IMAX three six three I believe and you
know it takes decent enough photos you
know I think if you were to describe it
you know it's like it's firmly within
its price back bracket in terms of
camera performance a lot more HDR
activity going on then I would like to
see and low-light is kind of on and off
Fitness I was able to show off one of
the photos which was of the bride just
caught in a good spotlight and she was
like yeah she was dancing she was
healing her best so like there are some
moments where it shines but more often
than not like if you were even subject
to any slight jitter its yeah yeah yeah
it's going to be it's gonna be one of
those situations and I think this is so
common in our industry where even though
the price is is something that can
mitigate these issues that you see in
the camera we can't look past what it's
unable to do and I would implore
everybody to sort of think about this
phone in a different sense this is
probably the phone that every Android Go
user wish that they could get for that
price you know cuz $300 out in India is
just just in general that's a really
great price to have for a phone that has
the best possible specifications that
you can get right now and even users
here in the u.s. here in North America
would kill to have this phone and there
are a lot there are a lot of users out
there who actually don't really care
about the camera as much as you think it
reviews we are tasked with looking at
everything laterally like the camera is
going to be weighed upon as much as the
specifications but the thing is for a
lot of users out there it's a little bit
more weighted so I would say that the
reason why this one excites me so much
is because if I know somebody who is not
going to be taking photos that end up on
Instagram that end up on Twitter
Facebook whatever what me what what have
you but they
I found that they can rely upon for
probably the next year or so granted
they don't break it or drop it this is
gonna be this would be my first
recommendation and it would be an easy
one to make
it's also a good burner phone if you
want to keep things private I do i I do
agree that it's a little bit hard to
talk about it in final terms because we
don't have final software yet mio i-10
I'm actually excited for because we got
Jules and I were together during our
meeting with them and Mia i10 looks
pretty dope and I'm just I want that to
arrive before I give any final verdicts
on this but as of right now if this is
something that we're going to see more
often in 2019 have at it have at it I
want to see more I want to see more
cheaper phones with high-end
specifications make it clear to us that
the things that matter the most to us
don't have to be 1,000 dollars because
what you're gonna end up paying for for
a phone that's over $600 is the overall
package but if you're just looking for
very specific things to be stellar you
can get a $300 for the camera yeah
exactly
famous youtuber once said or him said
mate many times
and I very much believe this cheap
phones are getting good and good phones
are getting cheap except for like the
note 9 or the - 10 and stuff mmm yeah I
totally agree with that
like it's become clear to me after using
this phone with the note 9 at the same
time which is probably like this is the
worst time to be a totally unbiased
reviewer because we have all of these
phones at the same time the best way
that I can mitigate that bias is to say
that the note 9 is priced the way it is
because it's the package it's the entire
package you can do literally anything
with that phone and it will handle it is
that the same case for the poco phone if
you think of the if you think of the
camera in particular maybe not but then
again that's probably not what you're
paying this paying that money for so
keep that in to play smash hit four or
five hours at a time
yeah and you know would not blow out the
engine just by playing it for that long
I guess yeah exactly and I love that
this phone came out at this price point
right now to prove to us that a cooling
system in a phone doesn't have to break
the bank because I well you had the ROG
phone which had its own cooling you have
the no.9 which has its own cooling but
those are gonna be like skyrocketed
prices and people are gonna people I was
afraid that people would think that they
would have to go to a phone like that
and then here comes Xiaomi and polka
phone proving to us that it's possible
to have without having to break the bank
all right you keep chat studios t camera
is not very important for me
performances since I'm struggling with
my phone which is now the LG g4 see ouch
when you have to add extra letters to
the main model it's like you know where
you're going there ya go around petrovac
also why manufacturers don't make budget
phones with some special top feature
like the LG q 7 plus with its top audio
or that elbow with a great camera I
don't know which particular series
they're talking about there but yeah
like there are a lot of mid Rangers LG
has tried out the x-series which focused
on one specific spec like battery or the
camera or other like laser or something
I don't think anyone bought an x-series
LG but I do remember that there the X
cam and like that's a good exam
speaking of which I apologize for not
going into the chat more often one thing
that I will say is that ever the one
thing that I will say is that some
people were asking about you know like
for us to answer questions throughout
the entire first portion of the show all
the questions are about the poco phone
and now here we are so does the poker
phone have NFC says Zachary Webb I can
say no unfortunately I was not able to
use my phone to tap in and out of the
tube and yeah it's it's surprising house
contact lists has made its way across
the UK just so easily so I mean yeah us
corner stores so yeah one final one from
the Chad before we go into our final
final little thing before we close out
where is it such an rut he says slap a
skin on the polka phone and you're good
to go I would kind of agree with you
unless you get this armored addition and
this Kevlar it's pretty nice man nice
thing is it as creepy as it looks oh
yeah absolutely
there's also a bit of a heft to the
phone which which which kind of gives
you that sense of safety and which is
funny because one of the philosophies
behind the polka phone f1 is that they
think that people are gonna put cases on
this phone to begin with anyway so it
doesn't matter that it looks okay in the
box
yeah I have to call out mr. Mobile here
mr. Michael Fisher for you know talking
about the oleophobic at the lack of
oleophobic coating which I'm not sure
what you think of but I'm actually glad
that it's like people say it's yuck and
you have to deal with fingerprints like
you have an ID and deal with fingerprint
anyways with those early Oh phobic
coatings and what's more is that they
made the phone slicker so that when ever
I put my phone face down on a surface or
what I perceived to be a near flat
surface and then it ends up all of a
sudden I'm just working and all of a
sudden boom the floor is the way the
floor has met the phone and you know
what
regardless of any of that I will say
that despite the Kevlar looking so nice
the armored Edition still gets smudged
up to hell so I mean to me it doesn't
matter much because it still happens all
right so we have one less thing to talk
about something a little bit fun for
just a couple of minutes and let's I
love I love that Jules you put this as
the question has there ever been an
email that you wish you could take back
immediately so the story behind that is
Gmail has been running its undo send
feature you've been able to only on the
web have you been able to you know take
back an email
just made me mere seconds after you've
sent it like you realize oh that feeling
of dread when you might have said too
much so you're able to press the undo
button quickly and then you know in some
case in many cases if you're dealing
with a note of gmail client that you can
do that immediately if you're doing with
another like a hot meal or something
like that it might take a few minutes so
that kind of suspense still hangs around
but yeah that feature has moved on to
Android now so it's a good thing I guess
and there are plenty of emails that I
wish I could have taken back in my time
throughout my father never had I've
never had that because if I'm going to
say something that I would ultimately
want to take back it's gonna be through
a text or is it gonna be through some
sort of messaging I don't think I would
ever send something that could come back
to me in a bad way in an email I don't
think I've ever done that before he
knows very permanent well I mean for me
like it was email that you used to talk
to professor's or something and you used
to do that in a harried rush just before
class when you're sending something and
you'd send the wrong file you're sending
the wrong whatever the heck so like for
me in terms of like typing something on
my phone and just saying and not making
stuff at all because autocorrect has
screwed you over really good today yeah
that's that was the case for me so I
wish that undo send could have undone a
whole bunch of things if you get an
email from me and the word ducking is in
there I meant it for it to be in there
okay Brendan is uh it is the undo send
feature a godsend for you it is it is a
godsend except that you have a window of
like ten seconds two hundred I want I
want a window of like 72 hours because I
can't think of a particular example but
I've sent my wife emails in the past
though I I was telling her something I
didn't I I didn't agree with or
something that bothered me and let's
just say it put our relationship into a
spin and I wish I hadn't sent it but you
know there was no undo send
there was no 72-hour undo send so the
reality is is that that notification
pops up you know just 30 seconds after
you've said that thing and you know
depending on the push cycles or whatnot
like that could be even sooner so it's
like in reality you only have just a few
precious seconds so I should find her
phone and smash it it was like a classic
a classic family sitcom trope right
there is like no don't open that and the
it wasn't there a Google Labs
application in Gmail that would test if
you're sober before you can send an
email oh yes I mean I think I think
that's sometimes more useful and then an
undo send feature but in any case
there's no reason to undo send this
