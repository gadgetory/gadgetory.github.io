new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's take another
pass at one of the most universally
acclaimed smart phones ever I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow this is the HTC
One and this is episode 21 of after the
buzz the HTC One isn't just another
well-made smartphone it's the comeback
hit from a brand that desperately needed
one to survive and hit is an
understatement
the one was lauded by many as the most
beautiful Android phone ever when it
launched and it received some of the
highest scores we've ever given a
smartphone in pocket now's initial
review period but that was almost five
months ago with America's largest
carrier Verizon Wireless just now
preparing to release its own version of
HTC's comeback hit the question is it
still worth buying is an important one
but let's see how our unit a sprint
version none extended loan from HTC has
held up over time one of the big
concerns we had after first taking the
one out of its box was in how the unit
would deal with the rough and tumble
life of a modern smartphone longtime
viewers will know that we're not the
biggest fans of phone cases at PocketNow
and with a phone like this that's doubly
true with its zero gap aluminum and
polycarbonate construction machine to
speaker holes and tasteful chamfered
edges the one is begging to be seen not
covered up with some ugly silicone shell
but does that mean scrapes and dings are
unavoidable the short answer is yes but
they don't look as bad as you think our
HTC One has seen its share of drops onto
carpets car floor mats and E
one nasty run-in with hard kitchen tile
that kitchen impact was even enough to
jar the sim tray loose from the side of
the phone but the scar it left behind is
actually pretty small the beveled edges
are susceptible to Nicks and dings and
so is the aluminum backplate surface but
you need to get pretty close to see them
in everyday use the ones backside
actually looks pretty good after five
months and the Gorilla Glass 2 on the
front is holding up well also we're not
saying you should take the one naked to
the construction site or carry it around
in a pocket full of keys and coins just
that the phone holds up better than you
might expect given its jewel-like
appearance still if you're the unlucky
type who's looking for maximum
protection or if you're worried about
staining the polycarbonate side rails
with your grubby paws you might want to
consider a case the one isn't just
notable for its build quality the new
version of HTC's third party Android UI
since five remains one of the most
significant so-called skins of modern
smartphone history that's not just
because it enhances the ones usefulness
though it does more importantly it works
with the design of the phone
aesthetically and it doesn't slow down
the Android experience at all and that's
as true today as it was five months ago
the ones software runs like a well-oiled
machine now that's also the case with
its Google Play edition counterpart
running stock Android but there is a
difference here while we're normally
relieved to return to stock Android
after spending some time with a
manufacturer skin the reverse is true of
the one we actually prefer Sense 5
because of how well it plays with the
ones look and even the social streaming
blinkfeed has its uses from time to time
sense definitely slows down the Android
update process though we're still
running 4.1.2 on our sprint unit and we
wish HTC would build in some no-brainer
enhancements like system toggles in the
notification tray that said the one is a
solid example of what happens when you
put enough time and effort into building
great software and as such we're more
willing to wait for improvements on
sense than we would be with other
third-party you is a relationships with
phones are a lot like relationships with
people as time goes on the annoyances
stack
as quickly as the upsides on the HTC one
the biggest irritations in normal usage
come primarily in terms of battery life
and heat now under normal conditions the
one does not have poor endurance at all
but start putting a load on the phone
and it's staying power plummets that's
the case with most smartphones of course
but with the aluminum one you really
feel the heat the Snapdragon 600 is
pumping out as it spools up to keep pace
it's almost like you can feel the power
seeping out of the metal and it's a
frustrating reminder that you can't swap
out the battery our original advice
stands carry a power pack with this
phone if you're a heavy user we just
wish the solution to the fixed memory
capacity was as simple we've used about
half are available 32 gigs of storage at
this point so you'll probably need to
use a cloud solution of some kind if you
take a lot of photos and videos and you
opt for anything less than the 64 gig
edition of the one the last few years
have seen the importance of smartphone
camera performance skyrocket and 2013 is
no exception
since the HTC One S release Samsung's
Galaxy s4 powerhouse has debuted with a
very customizable 13 megapixel shooter
nokia has brought its PureView
technology to the masses with the 41
megapixel Lumia 1020 and LG has
announced an optically stabilized 13
megapixel camera in its forthcoming G to
standing next to these the 4 megapixel
shooter in the HTC one isn't quite as
impressive as it once was ultra pixels
or no that's not just because of the
resolution megapixels aren't everything
after all but because of the ridiculous
pace at which other smartphone cameras
are improving if you can get past the
spec sheet and the low resolution though
you'll find a camera that still performs
quite well in normal lighting and it
even beats out most of its competition
in low-light shots thanks to its own
helping of Hardware stabilization
there's no shortage of options for
honing your video and photo performance
in the viewfinder and HTC's Zoe feature
is still one of the coolest ways to
capture and share photos we've ever used
we miss it a lot when we carry phones
other than the one and it more than
makes up for the cameras downsides
another thing we miss when we use other
phones boomsound some newer smartphones
give the one a run for its money in
sheer amplitude but it's not all about
volume the front placement of the
speakers and the wide space between them
makes listening to music movies anything
better because it's clearer and it's
more dynamic we have been able to get
the speakers to crackle once or twice on
maximum volume watching a movie with a
lot of explosions so they're not perfect
but that's not enough to change the fact
that if you don't always want to be
confined to earbuds the one is the best
smartphone for media consumption from an
audio standpoint when the HTC one drops
on Verizon Wireless on August 22nd it'll
be almost half a year old that's about
half a decade in smartphone years the
point of after the buzz is to see how
well a device ages in this ridiculously
accelerated time scape and the HTC One
is doing so more gracefully than almost
any other it's basically the George
Clooney of smartphones we're still
looking forward to seeing how HTC builds
on the success of the one with its next
models and we're always hopeful the
company can improve on its software
update promptness but as of today we
have no hesitation in continuing to
recommend the one it's a great Android
experience running on stunningly
beautiful hardware and it's still one of
our favorite smartphones ever and that's
gonna do it for this episode of after
