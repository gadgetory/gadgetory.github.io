pocketnow.com and we are going to do a
little comparison between Apple's iOS
and Windows Phone mango so let's get to
it
first off we're gonna try to boot them
up at the same time so here I go we're
booting
this is gonna be iOS 4 we decide not to
use iOS 5 because it's a little too
buggy and this is a Windows Phone mango
beta this is an iPod Touch 4th
generation and this is a Samsung Focus
so here we are we're booted up goes
straight to some lap tiles this is
button mashing there and here we are
lock screen and do that okay so there's
the interface let's go back to the
lockscreen around quick hello and here's
some design differences
this one iOS has some chrome we got some
like a chrome II transparent bar behind
the clock there what that does is makes
it easier to read if you have a
distracting background image so ya
better contrast there and at the bottom
we have a big arrow bun with slide to
unlock that's written text there so you
can read it and that's a good indication
I've had unlucky when this phone on the
other hand has just a big background
picture there's a clock and day in your
next point mint and some icons at the
bottom but nothing really telling you
how to unlock it until you touch it and
a little little bounce happens so that's
that's your clue that there's something
underneath there so you should push it
up there we go so different ways of
doing the communication of what you're
supposed to do but both pretty effective
you'll see on iOS 5 you'll get
notifications on the home screen of the
lockscreen there as well which we do
have a little bit of on Windows Phone
mango already now here's where we're
really different the interface design on
Apple's iOS is very square grid of icons
there are a lot of you know glossy
little reflections there little tiny
labels for each icons and this is a very
similar to what the graphical user
interface has been since the dawn of the
graphical user interface every app has
an icon every icon is an app so we got
multiple screens of those there you can
tap and hold on the L jiggle and we can
move them around so that's your your
customization of the interface here but
it's really all about the apps okay and
there's your search alright we'll get
into that later on Windows Phone on the
other hand we see this big grid of
large square tiles that kind of look
like no uh window panes on an old house
that just aren't held together by
anything just floating in the space
there so that's that might be your
little tie to Windows how this might
look like Windows even that doesn't look
like anything like Windows of old so the
difference here is these tiles can
represent all sorts of things you know
some of them represent groups of people
some of them are represent apps or music
or pictures or you know here we have
hubs and this one is showing weather got
all sorts of different things going on
here you're gonna have a tile for a new
note you got this is a Facebook photo
album this is a OneNote page these are
apps right there with showing different
content so we got all sorts of things
and with mango third party developers
are going to be able to create live
tiles for almost any kind of thing they
want for example they could make one
that is a boarding pass for a flight and
all you do is tap in it goes straight to
the code that people can scan so there's
lots of interesting stuff here but one
thing that's we should mention this
little arrow brings us to the
applications listing over here we have
the applications listing only that's
everything is the applications listing
over here they're sorted alphabetically
that's the only way you can sort them
and we have little jump list buttons you
can go straight to the end letters and
we have a little search button so you
can find the app you're looking for you
can search the marketplace for it if
there's something you're looking for and
it's not there already and that's kind
of similar to the search on the iPhone
except this searches everything at once
so it'll serve people as well as apps
and all sorts of different things
okay so there's there's a difference
there in the search let's look at the
multitasking interface or the recent app
switching interface both of these have
that and it's implemented in a slightly
different way okay let me try to launch
the fast task switching interface both
at the same time there we go that was
pretty good
so there's another difference here on
iOS we have four little icons that pop
up from the bottom and push off whatever
you're doing both of these can be
accessed from any app so no matter where
you are you can get to the multitasking
task switcher task manager whatever you
want to call it over here we see four
over here we see one and part of another
one so right there you have four options
right away this one you don't have to
however you can see a lot of what the
other apps are in this style interface
and you can pretty easily swipe between
them over here you only see the icon and
you can also swipe for more so you get
four for each swipe so that's a little
bit less work to get to the other apps
over here but you get a little bit more
data a little little bit more of what
you're switching to in this style
interface whichever is better is your
preference so next let's look at the App
Store
okay so here's the App Store on iOS we
see some big advertisements for
different types of things that you might
want to buy and we see a little Rose of
gray and light gray Excel spreadsheet
kind of style and over here we have
categories some other thing we can dig
into different categories and we have
different categories up here as well
what's hot but what's cool what's really
neat is the genius button this is gonna
look at what you already have what
you've already downloaded and kind of
recommend other apps that you might like
so see it's recommending X blaze because
I have one two slab messenger so that's
pretty pretty cool feature you got the
top ones you got the search button right
there
so that's your App Store on Apple's iOS
and over here is the Windows Phone mango
app store we see you know a few
categories here and you got Samson zone
this is where third parties can make
their own app stores so Simpson made
this their own little App Store and
that's right integrated with the
marketplace and we have a panoramic
design here where you can see some
featured apps featured games and even
music and it's all integrated into one
marketplace and there's the app of the
day really nicely designed here here's
the search button and this will do
prediction
as well as toggling between searching
for music and podcasts and apps where's
this one
you're only going to search apps
and we can dig and go to just apps and
get another panoramic design with our
categories and the new ones let's top
same for games pretty cool looking hub
designs here now for music we have to go
to this other app there's music over
here we got that little button and go
back this is your homepage feature that
featured music there's some 69 cent
songs we've got the top ones here but we
can go to the same album over here and
you see this is very content only kind
of designed there's no extra stuff going
on all right both of these places allow
you to download music you can buy it
over here and since I have zoom pass
over here I can actually just download
it I don't have to sign in if I go here
and I want to buy that I press that
button and I got to enter my password
and I got to pay for it this one I can
just hit it and download I can also
preview it but since I have the zoom
pass is gonna play the whole song a song
actually course this is only gonna play
about 60 seconds worth
and speaking of playing song so let's
look at the music player so this one's
already going that screaming some
and we're kind of like that you can see
what this one's looking like where's
over here we have just the album cover
you can tap to go to that you can tap
that to go to the album listing and we
can go landscape mode and you get this
Cover Flow 3d kind of thing
pretty smooth looking really cool and
let's get to the music hub for this one
it's slightly different much different
Ashley this is our music library a very
different design and this has actually
some integration with other apps
if you look here some of these videos
that show up in the new section we're
actually put there by the New York Times
app and you see some other apps can
integrate that with this really easily
music we still have our categories
pretty much the same everywhere and we
also have a nice little lockscreen
integration
and the album art actually it's not even
album art it's just our work of the
artist showing up on your lock screen as
you switch songs really nice little
effect
okay so lastly let's try the web browser
they both launch pretty quickly and here
I have a site already loaded and this
has some nice JavaScript going so let's
just take a look how well these work
these have kind of a Ken Burns effect
going on see this is kind of choppy
emotion there so this is pretty smooth
so that's some JavaScript animation
let's try another site both of these are
on Wi-Fi and let's try the desktop
version
pretty quick I'm just going to finish
first
loading loading and there's the iOS
followed by i9 now how smooth of a
let's see a video
so we're loading again
this one I clicked first so that should
be finished first anyway
so we have I know seems to be a little
bit slower on the downloads but
processing certain things maybe faster
try these videos well this video came up
a lot clicker
let's try it one more site and go
Oh pretty close I'll s1 but we were
pretty pretty good speech there
i OS a lot faster over here
so download speeds we have a pretty good
advantage on iOS
that's not what I want
just try some of this html5 demos
here's our fish ie
and this is ie9 doing the fishes really
quickly but Safari is not very good at
that we'll have to look at this again
with iOS 5 since that will have much
improved html5 support and we that's our
comparison between Apple iOS and Windows
Phone mango that's it for now
hope you enjoyed this video give us a
thumbs up if you did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
