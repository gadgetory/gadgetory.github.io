device to come Google such as things a
little in its search results for mobile
+ 1 + T's is an event to happen on the
20th I'm hi meri behna and given all the
comments about the Friday jokes how
about some suggestions starting now this
is out daily the official is
should I have to do with Google as the
company has just announced that it will
be pushing a new update to its search
results as of next week so whenever you
start to search for something
particularly it'll start suggesting
applications depending on what you do
not have installed which is kind of
smart you don't have to be receiving
suggestions or applications you already
have that's cool a little intrusive
though but yeah it is useful for some
and I could say that it is for me as
well the spotlight over LG as we get
more teasers of the g4 we don't need an
event anymore we've pretty much seen the
phone but yeah that's happening very
soon and the device is very sexy that
leather back looks amazing at least in
photos obviously we're gonna have to
handle it soon but we get more rumors
regarding its processor and claim that
it's a snapdragon 808 that's the second
time we've heard it and the only reason
why we're not going to say yes is
because uh well the sources are not
really trusted and the rumors of the
leaks weren't really credible but let's
see we were thinking snapdragon 810 or
something even better and speaking of LG
we continue to get leaks of an LG stylus
and that's actually the name of the
phone really the code name is G note and
it seems that LG is working on an update
to the g pro apparently this will be a
stylist phone it'll probably be called a
stylus indeed 5.8 inch display
Snapdragon 610 processor and that's
probably the only part that doesn't
match well with the rest of the rumors
but it's pretty much all we know for the
phone right now we probably could be
surprised at the event we'll see that's
our about Microsoft as the company has
made its Windows 10 preview for phones
official again you can get it it was a
halted yesterday because uh people were
complaining about brick bones whenever
they tried to move back to Windows Phone
8.1 and it ended up being a problem of
the recovery tool they're not
necessarily the phones so yeah they have
a Lumia 520 525 526 you get
Windows 10 preview as well we're just
waiting to see when the next bill is
coming with even cooler things and
finally for the very hot news of the day
1 plus s just sent out press invitations
for an event to happen april twentieth
ya next week and they don't tease
anything all they say is anything could
happen and that is the biggest question
we've heard rumors of the 1+2 we've
heard rumors at our problem budget 1
plus phone that's even more budget
minded the one plus two which is really
interesting we're not really sure what
we're getting here we've heard teasers
of gaming and so many other things and
it leads me to the question of the day
if you could pick one product from one
plus what would it be what would you
want the company to build I want a one
plus two and I wanted to be able to be
sold now no invites know anything like
that but what about you leave us a
comment down below and friends you know
the drill if you want to get that was
earlier before this video is snow
machine followers i'm talking out our
Comment subscription to channel as well
it follow me on twitter i underscore
iveta please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw i am high
never be better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
