foldable and they hint that this might
be the final design it looks like the
honored 20 is going to look a lot more
like another really awesome flagship and
Samsung may be launching a gaming
service who that will look like Apple
arcade hopefully - I'm Jaime Matt Rivera
and that look the face of jet lag is
sort of gone still got more to do this
is parking out daily sponsored by the
geniuses over at wigs the official news
today begin with deals isn't it
surprising that there have been a ton of
Apple deals all over the last couple of
months Amazon right now has the
brand-new MacBook Air the entry-level
variant which I consider to be too over
priced at $1,200 yeah they've got $200
on discount meaning for a thousand bucks
the MacBook Air that's compelling you
can learn more in the description now
let's talk about well Apple and
headphones and particularly Beats I'm
not a fan but I do love this integration
where they're providing the technology
of the air pods and new power beats Pro
full wireless pre-order to begin on May
5th you get your devices by May 12th the
price tag is just the crazy part 250 but
then again that's what I pay for the
Jabra is that I use which I do consider
our value to 250 given the audio quality
that they have obviously we'll get a
pair and let you know if they're worth
the money whenever they come out you can
learn more about that in the description
as well now let's talk about Samsung as
a well we saw Apple's event and I know
I'm gonna take you to the topic very
soon but you saw Apple event and you saw
Apple's arcade service where they want
to give you an option to be able to
stream your games sort of like what
we've been seeing with a stadia and
everything it seems that Samsung wants
to do something similar not exactly sure
what the difference is going to be it
seems it's gonna be get called Galaxy
play link this is all patents right now
obviously it's gonna develop over time
hopefully for the time of the note and
now let's talk about the honor 20 we are
very close to having an event in London
I definitely will be covering that event
live one of the major reasons why I'm
really enthusiastic is because we've got
some new leaked images and it seems that
this device brings either a periscopic
camera or it just looks bluntly like the
Huawei P 30 pro in P 30 I have the
one of these two and for me that's an
important deal because obviously honor
devices are less expensive and for
example devices like the honor of u-20
had amazing camera technology for a much
lesser price tag so stay tuned this is
getting interesting those leaked them it
just actually make it look really sleek
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the Moto razor welcome
Motorola to the hottest news I think for
the first time in and forever it's not
the first time but the point being is
we've got some leaked renders that are
apparently final merrily these are these
come from an official source where they
show us the design of the device they
show us the box where it comes from and
it looks like a clamshell smartphone
that you can extend it comes from a
smaller phone to a larger phone oh my
god it definitely looks like the Moto
razor not the original more like the
Moto the second-generation motor razor
that came out a couple of years later I
like everything that I see let us know
in the comments down below I mean what
do you think do you think that this is a
good idea I think that this should be
the future of foldables as well surely
it's awesome to have a foldable tablet
that becomes a phone whenever you need
to but if you have a phone that's going
to be less of a footprint unless you
need it to get larger that for me is
even better but that's just my opinion
leave us a comment down below we love to
know yours
and folks as you know the source for the
bargain out daily is pocketnow.com but
boy do I wish that we had wicks back at
the time when we created it if you're
interested in creating a professional
website blog or online store without any
coding knowledge Wix offers an insane
portfolio of tools for you to design
something that's right for you and it's
