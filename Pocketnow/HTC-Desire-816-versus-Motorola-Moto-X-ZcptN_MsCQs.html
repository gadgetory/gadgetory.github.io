head-to-head against its top tier
sibling the One m8 how does it compare
to some other phones I'm Joe Levi for
Puckett now and this is the desire 816
versus the Motorola MOTO X after updates
both devices run Android KitKat 4.4
HTC's runs Sense UI 6 on top of that but
Motorola stays a bit more true to what
many would call pure Android with its
product when it comes to weight you're
gonna feel a difference the desire 816
is 5.82 ounces compared to the Moto X is
4.5 9 ounces as far as size is concerned
the desire is bigger a lot bigger
turning to construction the desire has a
nice matte border around its edges but
the back has a slippery gloss surface
Motorola went with all matte and it's
much easier to hold
what's more the Moto X felt more solid
and didn't squeak like the desire did
one of the distinguishing factors of
today's HTC devices are their front
firing speakers sound from the desire
has much better range than the Moto X
although both are fairly loud and clear
we like listening to the desire more
than we like listening to the Moto X the
screens on the two phones are really
where you'll notice the difference the
desire has a huge 5 and a half inch LCD
- 720p screen with 267 PPI whereas the
Moto X has a 4.7 inch AMOLED screen at
312 PPI both are 720 though the Moto X
was crisper and had deeper blacks the
battery in the Moto X is 2200 milliamp
hours which provided us with about 12 to
15 hours between charges with moderate
to heavy use the battery in the desire
is 400 milliamp hours bigger it netted
us two solid days of use but before you
get too excited remember that although
both devices support LTE
we couldn't test how well it worked on
the desire since it's only compatible
with t-mobile's edge bands we also
suspect that we would have netted
similar results if both devices were
running LTE as far as Wi-Fi unlike the
Moto X the desire doesn't include the 5
gigahertz band which means it can't
connect to 802 11 a or the faster AC
networks for why that's important make
sure you check out our editorial the
desire with its 1.6 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 400 and then Adreno 305 GPU
fared a bit better in performance than
the Moto X with its custom dual-core 1.7
gigahertz SOC and Adreno 320 GPU
motorola went to great lengths to build
out the ex a platform for battery saving
as well as the ability to gather ambient
information some things that the desire
just can't do the desire includes a bit
less ram one-and-a-half gig compared to
the Moto X is two gig when it comes to
storage the Moto X comes in both 16 and
32 gig configurations the desire only
comes in 8 but on an upside the designer
does include a microSD card slot so you
can add up to 128 gig more storage the
desire 816 s 13 megapixel camera is a
few megapixels better than the Moto X is
10 megapixel sensor but in practice they
perform about the same like we mentioned
in our last video the desire 816 is
missing NFC though we can live without
Google Wallet and Isis features not
being able to tap to beam content from
one device to another well that's a
disappointment there's no doubt that
both the Moto X and the desire 816 are
great phones what it really comes down
to is size if you want a big phablet
like experience with a large screen in
forward-firing speakers you want the
desire 816 if you want something more
compact and one a bit more depth and
contrast on your screen the Moto X is
the way you want to go
that's how the desire 816 stacks up
against the Motorola MOTO X if you liked
the video make sure you give it a thumbs
up if you want to see the rest of the
coverage as soon as we have it available
