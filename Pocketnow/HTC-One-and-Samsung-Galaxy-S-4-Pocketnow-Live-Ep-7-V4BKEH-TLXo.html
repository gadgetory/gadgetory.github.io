everybody and welcome to bucket now live
episode number seven I am Anton denied
managing editor for pocketnow.com and
i'm joined today by brandon minimun
editor-in-chief of pocket now welcome
brandon and over there and also with me
is steven shank chief news editor good
afternoon to you how's it going guys and
also with me is adam doubt from Chicago
Illinois who is bidding editor front
pocket now welcome at him greetings and
salutations so before I gotta hand it
over to Brandon I understand he has just
a couple of minutes to talk about
something I just want to say that the
Android world is much much happier today
because yesterday we got the samsung
galaxy or so basically the major players
all have their devices their flagships
out for this year we have the sony
xperia z we have the HTC one we have the
samsung galaxy s3 of course we're
waiting on a motorola x phone and the
other devices but with this I'm gonna
hand over to Brandon for a short Steg
way into our public hang out so please
Brendan take it away yeah so we're going
to be answering questions about the
galaxy s4 and you know Michael and I
were there and we saw the launch and
there is an overall sense of
disappointment and I've been trying to
figure out why people are disappointed i
mean the galaxy of sports thin it's
light it's got a crazy high resolution
camera and the screen is in my opinion
better than the one and yet people are
disappointed and I think they're
disappointed because Samsung did what we
were kind of fearing they played it safe
they made a business a good business
decision too I like how the verge said
this kind of take what they did before
and make it a little bit better like
kind of like a galaxy s 3 s kind of like
the iphone for us the problem is that so
many people know the galaxy s3 so many
people have the galaxy s3 that they're
disappointed that the new one looks
identical to the old one you know when
you buy a new piece of technology and
you bring it around the show your
friends you kind of want them to notice
and say hey that's different that's
interesting they're going to do that
with the HTC One they're not
going to do that with the galaxy s4
maybe you'll turn on the screen and walk
them through some of the cool features
but it doesn't have that satisfying
thing that you would get if you had an
xperia z or an HTC one so I think that's
why people are disappointed Samsung's
going to send sell a ton of these phones
um but you know people that have seen
this phone so much are just disappointed
including me and and and for me it's
kind of like a decision for this year am
I going to use the HTC One or am I going
to use the the galaxy s4 and you know I
i'm reviewing HTC One and so far so good
it's just a dramatic difference in in
design philosophy it's like this this
feels premium the galaxy s4 feels cheap
and light that so everybody who watched
yesterday the live coverage of the
samsung galaxy s4 event probably seen a
major disappointment when we saw the
first images of the galaxy s4 I am
personally a little bit disappointed
because I am sick of the design from
last year and I have to put up with that
for another year and for me it all comes
down as with everybody is it the galaxy
s4 or the HTC One but tonight we're
going to talk about your options so
without any further ado I will pick
somebody and we'll talk about either the
HTC One in case you have questions you
can ask me either the s4 Brandon was
yesterday there in New York can ask him
or you can talk to Steven or Adam so I'm
gonna talk to domenico because I know he
has been trying hard last week to get
online and I think he has pushed
refreshing our Facebook and
entrepreneurs like every second so
nobody go please unmute yourself and
welcome to this week's show I think I
actually got RSI trying to like I think
I broke my mouse so Phil tell me what do
you want to talk about uh well I've
actually got like three pages of notes
on Randy I'm not gonna go through all of
them but like damn yeah oh yeah we only
have five to seven minutes per person so
keep it to ya I'm going oh I'm gonna run
through this and first off IR blasters
when the hell did this become a good
idea to have my own ass oh my god it's
such a throwback I don't love the idea
of these things
a while ago I figured this out the
reason people like remote controls their
tactile you don't have to look at a
remote control you know where the volume
button is you know what you know the
power button is if it's on your phone
you have to like way so where is it no
it's that one and of course the remote
also also have that that slight dot on
the five key on the middle right there's
like a keyboard your composition and I
don't think I do have my mouth all over
there and i'm too lazy to go get them
but if i use my nexus 4 as like an XBMC
remote and i really hate using it
because it's there's no tactile feedback
you don't know when you're it it's just
stupid it's not good for just sitting on
the couch in with good-looking channels
but macro capability could be a big deal
you program it to you know start all
your stuff turn the cable box TV switch
the input yes like that the logitech
remotes that could do macros I mean they
were really popular they're really oh
they're getting lucky effects phasing
them out aren't they oh I had I had a
harmony I had a harmony one a while back
and they slow down so much mmm they
become near unusable after time and it's
so it's so crazy also I on these line of
sight and it's just a true but it's a
cheap feature probably cost you know a
dollar in parts and you can have it
there's room for I mean why not put it
on there so if you need it if you don't
need it no big guy that's not so much
it'll be really funny to scare with
people at work so when I was in Middle
School I had a wristwatch with a removal
on everybody had the one of those you
turn off the TV someone would get
attention because no one could ever
figure out who was it was always the car
those the guy with the watch yeah the
next gonna watch it could have been
anyone yeah the money go you can you can
ask me about the HTC One I know you
handle both the black and the white ones
or you can ask Brandon about the galaxy
s4 or you can ask Adam or Steven about
whatever you wish I I would like to ask
you about the the one Tony personally
I've got the you've got the back when
haven't you yes it's raining here right
yeah I've handled both of them is like
that's a nice time
I've Hanna Beth and the black one looks
so much better the black one looks
indeed better but the problem with the
black one is I'm gonna just take right
now for I'm gonna lock the camera on me
I'm going to take four fingers so let me
wipe it off and show you what the
problem is right now it should be clean
relatively clean okay I'm grabbing four
fingers and I'm touching it only once so
check this out yeah that is a slight
problem did you just said and if you
turn it no I haven't I'm if my hand was
in a cookie jar so if you touch the
screen the screen looks like this yeah
so that's that's one of the biggest
problems and it's the same problem with
the iphone 5 which looks exactly the
same uh what uh so I got here is it just
like like mini right sigh I personally
don't like the design of the one like
well that's something you why don't you
like it and this this might be like my
little tiny OCD things but it's like the
power button is on the other side to
where the microUSB is on the white one
or the silver one the power button is
black obviously for the IR blaster but
the volume button is white the microUSB
is not central on the bottom the
capacitive buttons are terrible worse
placement for a capacitive buttons I
ever HTC logo it's just crap it's ah mr.
it needs to die and wider HTC do this
the closest light on the camera lens is
like five times larger than the actual
lens one at a time and I have to the two
phones here which which have the power
button placement differently so we have
the iphone 5 and we have the HTC One an
angle camera again when you hold the
phone you hold it like this and of
course it's easier for you to press here
than to press here you should tell your
answer that's handed so I'm right-handed
okay you're left-handed then you will
probably find it easier to work with the
iphone 5 then with the HTC One most
people are right-handed so for me it's
easier to put to press this power button
right here then to all over that place
HTC logo is
nice touch but it's just for branding
purposes he couldn't have put it up
there because there's a speaker so
you'll just have to get used to that
yeah lucky I won't be buying one but um
uh they I I can't believe I got rid of
the multitasking but and I mean this
doubles happened then triple tap
nonsense it is true what triple tap does
something no no sorry isn't that what
happened then long tap sorry yeah long
Jeff that I wouldn't surprise me if the
next one they'd or the next art that if
her trip with that function and why not
do you know it's so funny with with the
HTC one of course they had this
multitask interface with these 3d cars
in space and it was like why are you
changing something that works and then
for the for the one they changed it
again why do you change something that
works I like I would love to hear the
conversation in a boardroom you know Oh
Google's doing a great job but you know
I think we can do better because our
customers want a better multitask
experience are you kidding me everyone
loves the stock Android multi task
experience it's a great well isn't this
what we're complaining about the galaxy
s social events change enough why if the
city is a guy Steven please what cities
with the galaxy are the galaxy s4 now
we're complaining they didn't change
enough that it's just an iterative
advancement of the last one I mean she
is the HTC One disgusting yeah I mean
you can change things you can change you
can have a relatively major upgrade
without bread like Cheney things that
aren't broken like the multitasking
isn't broken what what is the point of
changing it's fast it's fluid yeah yeah
there's and it's it's good I can see
three and a half things of my
multitasking here on my Nexus 4 and it's
like whereas on the like 1x you see was
at one and a half you can't even really
see to you see nine on the one but it's
their miniature and it yeah it's it's
not glanceable either i mean it's
signage in mod 10 that's that's that's
what I'm talking big money goes like any
any last thoughts uh yeah NFC is region
dependent ultrapixel camera is a bit meh
sense is still sense
what else mismatched colors is yeah and
beats I'm Don beats actually actually
a.g beatz is a great addition and
everybody who has followed me knows that
I'm not a fan of beads Oh was like boom
sound boom sound is good yes whom sound
is good but that's due to beat if you
disable be you will see that the phone
sounds like crap so if the beats audio
works perfectly for enhancing the
speakerphone capabilities of the HTC One
once you plug in your high-end
headphones regardless of make and model
it will just distort the music to such
an extent that you will not be able to
listen to it anymore because you're
going to throw up I mean if I was able
to drop the mic up would have just done
that when I did that but I come on it
something it's on the mic stand so it's
it's pretty impossible for this but no
yeah that's me kind of knows what I'm
saying it sounds like I'm a massive HTC
hater I'm really not i want HTC to
succeed I have owned many HTC's in the
past I'll probably are many in the
future it's there's so many things that
didn't need to be changed yeah and it's
sort of changing for change sake and the
upset I didn't like this yeah I didn't
like this with the s2 in the s3 i just
changed things not they just change them
to be different not to benefit in any
way possible any way whatsoever the only
know what yeah go ahead wreck sorry i'm
just gonna say i mean that's a good
point like with this galaxy s4 thing
they fixed problems that don't exist
never well I never thought to myself
when taking a picture I wish I could put
my head in a little heart never left or
no would ruin the picture I always think
that but Brandon didn't you didn't you
ever want to send a photo album someone
like from wherever you were already the
world how are they 30 but i want to send
one to you as just 30 bucks here you go
you know i just texted yeah there's a
hoot who's talking to who i'm welcome
fuse night i'm talking right now and i
think if you very much domenico for
joining us in a statement weekend and
the beginning of next week i will
compare the camera of the the HTC one
with the 808 PureView with the notes to
with the iphone 5 it's going to be a
killer and
Brandon's going to have his full review
up summer around wednesday but until
then we'll have lots of more comparison
so thank you very much for joining us
and please come back next week alright i
look forward to about them see you guys
but i have with this i'm going to hand
it over to brandon so that he can choose
somebody to talk to all right all right
let's go to the dream couple here hahaha
dream team how's it going guys hello
guys what's good so what do you want to
talk about HTC One galaxy s low res um
yeah that's good so what do you want to
talk about each one galaxy s not just a
one has external speakers I okay I I
will have to detect right now and okay
silence and order has been restored okay
um so yeah I mean we can talk about
whichever one I mean I mention both of
them but you guys have Kevin talking
already about kind of both my feelings
on the s4 so which one are you going to
get uh if either of them are probably
gonna get the 1i am I am NOT I'm not
horribly impressed by the s4 is there
something that the s4 has that you wish
the one would have whoa and I can help
you here it's a word which started with
CNN's bday uh yeah the camera would be
probably that camera is probably better
on the s4 i'm not sure but um I do kind
of like the whole dual camera thing if
you could actually change the frame that
it's in i think that the little stamp
thing is kind of tacky but really yeah
you can change the frame to like a fish
eye and like so you'd use that you
really would work in what situation have
you ever thought I want to put my face
on this picture of this mountain update
here you know I don't think for a
picture but like if you were it would it
would definitely be like a niche kind of
use but if you were like doing say a
video tour of some place or something
you could like use your good camera in
the back to film wherever you are and
then use the front to fill yourself
talking about the place for video chat
that would be yeah that miracles well I
know exactly where I would use the that
feature at for instance at the galaxy s4
event I will take a picture and there
will be a picture of the s4 looking like
yes free and then the corner it will be
a face of me like Victor so that's it
I'm curious to see if we're gonna see
this feature pop up on other phones you
know the XDA guys yank the Kiowa tribe
porting it it might be a hardware
limitation on older phones I'm really
not sure how they're configured but I
can see how it it might not work let's
not forget that LG announced this
feature before samsung 40 LG optimus G
bro well you know I think I think I
think 2 gigs of RAM is about the only
hardware limitation that could be a
problem with that whole that whole thing
um which I remote most flagships these
days have two gigs of RAM so I think
yeah I think they can probably brought
on with XDA supports does removable
storage and removable battery matter to
you uh yes and no I I like having the
option of removable battery but at the
same time I I never liked III never
swapped out the battery on my s3 when I
had that or anything like that have you
ever met a guy have you ever met a good
thing I just owe you so much good all
right what why did they go Steven boo Oh
is they the only time I ever actually
swapped out the battery on my phone is
when there's been a serious power outage
for a couple days straight I mean if I'm
going to be able to charge it within a
day or two I'm not gonna bother popping
in a spare it's it's easier not to have
to
gladys air battery Langer I mean they're
expensive so why did you have one uh I
had two of the same phone so I guess
pulled the battery out of the other oh
yeah yeah the only time I've swap the
battery eyes when i had my i had an HTC
Inspire for a while and the battery life
on that thing was terrible so I I
ordered a second battery from amazon
then I have a question for you last week
yeah we have talked about the fact that
you are a professional photographer and
that you don't need such a great camera
now that she's seen the HTC one sample
images and we've got a couple of
comparisons live and a couple of
comparisons coming next week and you've
seen all about the s4 what is it for you
um I can honestly say if you weren't
doing a comparison with the HTC One
camera then there's nothing wrong with
it but if you're looking at it and then
somebody else's pictures right up next
to it you'd notice a difference so
you're saying as long as you don't
compare your images with other images
you're good yeah if your goal is to be
oh my pictures are better than yours
more high-quality you're not going to
win if you're taking pictures for the
sake of pictures your camera's fine and
you still haven't answered my question
is it the one already s4 for you never
was it's still probably going to be the
s4 just because it had better colors in
it is well one thing with the HTC camera
it was really washed out in the colors
yeah and having accurate colors is a
really big factor to me it's got a
really good low-light performance so if
you saw that um right I watched Meyers
me well not that good teaser not that
good but back to you at a low light
really yep looks pretty good in
michael's videos i saw how you see
online there it's it's like back and
forth I've seen review saying as not
good low-light performance and some
saying it is the highest iso is on it
the highest iso know all the settings i
have made were automatic but i will
start waking via the camera options to a
certain extent that's exactly what the
highest iso
I know it will not come with your view I
think the highest is generally about 800
1600 should be the standard highest and
nowadays burns yeah you have to 1600 um
I have a question I just got to ask this
why does and and this might be a stupid
question about on the it is why are
people so obsessed with low light
performance do you really take pictures
at night a lot wife is so yeah I I'm
actually more of a concert photographer
so I do pictures in really low settings
or if you're out with your friends at a
bar or something and everybody knows
that bars are not very well lit and
things are going on and you need to
blackmail your friends later you need
really good evidence of that far as I go
to a warehouse lighting so it's not
Brandon everybody knows that good things
happen in the dark come on now it's one
when the world comes alive at night all
right a good answer to the to the
question yeah let me let me pull this up
if I can find it or you might want to
help here is um we went to a concert
remember this is a family-friendly
podcast yes okay just checking we went
to a concert last year and I had a
Galaxy Nexus at the time and everybody
was complaining about the camera but I
mean it we got that's not guy showed
very well on the webcam but we got a
pretty good picture that's pretty sweet
going I took that and here's some
shameless advertising dbrand made this
for me this is my logo for my
photography and they sent me three of
them and is and since since we're
talking about shameless advertising how
about we introduce the following thing
everybody who talks to us say your
twitter account for everybody to see
here and follow you so please go on I
don't you soon oh my Twitter you yeah
I'm Debbie doodle you can find it
through him he'll tag me yeah and I'm
just I had to humans my name any final
thought you guys had their um yeah
anything uh nothing necessarily other
than I wasn't necessarily impressed with
the s4 other the camera was nice in
comparison but other than that it's kind
of like if you match the note 2 and the
s3 together is what makes me think of
yeah actually is I just have one last
question for you guys so to me
throughout the entire presentation last
night it can ever everything nude for
the most part you know they think I
think they kind of brought the s3 into
2013 yeah they they put a 1080p 5-inch
screen on it like a lot of the other
flagships out there but everything else
pretty much looked like software
improvement so do you think and after
Samsung I saw earlier Samsung is going
to be bringing a lot of those new
updates to the s3 so do you think
there's going to be a real reason for as
three users to upgrade knowing that most
these new features will be on the s3
just just make sure to mention the order
in which you want this to answer um
whoever you want first it doesn't matter
that that cleats the Anarchy YouTube all
right well Thomas are you me first uh I
think that a hardcore Samsung fans will
probably upgrade to the s4 just like
hardcore iphone fans always get the
latest iPhone if you are not a hardcore
fan but you are on a contract on either
carrier in the US or around the world
for two years there's no use for you to
ditch your contract and go with the s
for sure it has a full HD resolution
sure it's higher resolution a screen
sure it's a faster processor but at the
end of the day it's it's the same phone
with jelly bean we are at the point
where you no longer need the horsepower
so I think fans will upgrade non-fans
but just the regular smartphone users
wouldn't will not upgrade right yeah
yeah i think i think the galaxy s3 was
kind of an inspirational I don't know if
that's the word an aspirational device
it was a kind of device where it was the
highest end smartphone and you really
wanted it and all your friends really
wanted it and everyone got it
and there's still that group of people
that don't have a samsung smartphone yet
and the galaxy s4 is very consumer a
very consumer focused and it'll get all
those other people interested but at the
same time is going to alienate everyone
that got this aspirational phone um what
do you think should i bend step on it in
I think it's problematic seeing the s3
get all the software because really the
s4 like we've been saying the hardware
it's a little bit better but all these
features I must have spent ninety
percent of the time last night talking
about the software stuff and when it
comes to existing devices that I think
it is going to take some of the the
Thunder out of the s4 so like tony was
saying it's going to be about whether or
not you have the opportunity to upgrade
if you don't you're not going to feel
compelled to you sell your s3 getting
this for but if you can choose between
them you're going to go with the higher
end one yeah sure and I don't doubt um i
would say i'm gonna build off of what
stephen and brandon were saying that you
know if you have an s3 since it is
ninety percent software then the s3 can
very well handle it and may very well
get those updates then I think it's more
of an opportunity to get another
flagship phone out there that isn't a
year old that people that don't own
samsung phones will want and the s3
owners will be content knowing that the
s4 isn't all that much better so you
know I don't think it's really a left
behind type thing I think it's just more
of a you know let let's get another
phone out there that's it's more
iterative from a hardware standpoint and
you're right most of the stuff was was
software upgrades and as long as the s3
gets them i think everybody wins yeah
and most normal humans don't have this
decision every year of what phone i'm
going to get the technology obsessed all
of us do but most people two years they
wait and they'll have the galaxy s3 and
say the four is not that big of a deal
i'm going to wait for the 5c what is
just one asterix i think that the
features will definitely come to
previous samsung phones but they will
not come immediately
not gonna be stupid to shoot themselves
and foot there will be a probably three
four five six months period after which
they will start delivering the the
features two older phones and this is
where the community comes in with with
your custom roms so there you have all
your answers agree yeah yeah yeah thank
you thank you very much for joining us
and please come back next week well do
that I and III have an obligation and
this is my fault I take full
responsibility domenico lamberti was
here the first one and he didn't manage
to say his Twitter account so I'm gonna
pimp him out right now if you like the
first person you talk to us he's mobile
underscore Dom on Twitter and with this
I'm gonna hand it over to Steven check
today who has not spoke yet why don't we
get what are your names here um Wilfredo
Wilfredo unmute yourself and say hi Lou
hello okay else we can hear you Howard
how's it going okay hi I'm on further
from the Dominican Republic my English
is not perfect so take it easy on me
please are you a neighborhood denisa who
is smiling ear to ear on black she's the
one who got me in here so she is my
friend yeah bring all your friends to
the hang up today sir all right okay hey
what are you been the liking more the
galaxy s4 here you think the HTC One has
what it takes I am missing the ds3 since
the launch date and I totally love it so
yeah I know that the HTC One is a great
form but I'm just some some farm boy so
the s4 is the one I'm going to get were
you disappointed at all by the
announcement yesterday do you think
Samsung did enough with the s4 I knew it
won't it was not gonna bid to
different because the history was just a
huge success worldwide but he got what
he have to to to have like this the
bigger scream the bigger battery and the
better camera and it's the same size so
for me is a win if I had a 5 inch
displays in a bigger body I will I will
be disappointed but it's the same size
so I mean I like it so are you are you
on a two-year contract are you going to
pay full price for galaxy for know I
always my false the global model
unlocked so I I'd rather have a contract
so that's why I like that the global
model because I have I get all the
updates directly from Samson I don't
have to to wait for my carrier to
approve it you know yeah alright are you
gonna sell your Galaxy s3 i'm gonna sell
it to my sister she has a galaxy that's
me man why don't bite it hurt yeah why
don't you stick with the S free and buy
your sister ds4 machines the best Russia
ha was mine before i got the s3 so she
always kept my my older devices my
others and a half twerk yeah yeah I my
other two sister also have the the gs3
and she they asked me if the gs4 was
worthy of upgrading and I tell him to
wait for the gs5 because all of them is
worse for you to buy my friend yes
because from Han is not necessary but
for me I take a lot of pictures because
I do a lot of mountain biking and I like
to take pictures and I use a lot my
camera I love the gs3 camera but I know
that the s4 is going to be a lot better
but will afraid of what you have to
consider is if you can get your sister
to buy an s4 and you get an s4 and your
other sister gets an s4 get Denise I get
her an s4 and then get like your mom and
dad as for us to you can do groups
found a big party vanessa is a HTC fun
I've been trying fight with her over the
gs3 and the HTC but she she loved HTC so
I don't know when she's gonna wondering
about the millions samsung cells from
the S devices come again and we are
wondering about the million of devices
samsung cells from every s flagship
every year if you buy one and all your
sisters by one and family buys one here
in the Dominican Republic ecstasy is is
not that popular you know here is more
of iphone and galaxies that's all you
see I'm blackberries because we are not
that rich of a country so a lot of
people here use still use back baby but
they're upgrading to iphone some
galaxies because here you don't hear
like android and iphone you hear more
like galaxy in iphone you see it's the
door i'm definitely that the brand
access who has built is very strong
compared to HTC and the other brands you
know the galaxy my father's knows the
brand galaxy you don't know that I
Android and nothing but he know that
that is a galaxy phone that's exactly
what same so I wanted to happen yeah
yeah a new galaxy are you are you at all
disappointed early weeks of the galaxy
s4 showed this kind of textured backing
which actually turned out to just be
like the optimus G where it's completely
smooth you don't use a case on your
phone it looks like does that ever
bother you how it kind of accumulates
grime and fingerprints there's another
gift I got first I caught the the gs3 in
white and I really like it and then I
saw it to one of my sister and got the
blue one and this one gets a lot of
third but I really i love the noise Oh
plastic and you hate that because you
like the HTC finish but i love how how
durable it is in and the way looks
for me it's beautiful it's beautiful
make your background what's your eye
wallpaper on there it's really nice it's
the nexus 10 wallpaper oh yeah it looks
very very good I am podcasting right now
from my galaxy tab no 10 / 10 samsung
all the way give an exercise no no I
have a nexus Galaxy Tab 7.0 tapped are
you are you considering getting the note
8.0 what do you think about that I
really like it but I have to know tempo
into 1001 so I really don't need it you
don't want to talk on the phone using
your tablet come on am I the only wanna
make sure that excuse me i want i want
to tell you something a few months ago i
got myself a Galaxy Nexus because they
were running sheep on their own ebay and
I I wanted to try the deck stock Android
sperience but once I got the Galaxy
Nexus the I mean with the latest Android
version a and the galaxy s3 with that we
know all the version I could I can do so
much more with the ds3 dun dun day than
with the Galaxy Nexus I how is a stock
and a more clean and very may be faster
but I think that we did with a gs3 I can
do out of the box I can do much more
than with the Galaxy Nexus and that's
why I I saw my my next my galaxy nexus
okay yo Fredo do you have any questions
for for either of the guys yeah I have a
question for minimum he will he do you
have held at GS for right yep ok and the
sides it looks like like metal it is
practic plastic or is it is real mail
it's plastic but it looks like metal
right it looks like no it's just like
it's like the galaxy s3 I mean if you
look at the right way on the three it
looks like matt
oh but it's not yeah it's the same
califor and VOT vest looks good on the
back okay that was my question so thank
you for letting me time no thank you
very much for joining us and please do
come back don't let the nest I drag you
in you know who work yeah yeah and
what's your twitter twitter handle Oh

already use twitter to follow you guys
but I read it on tweet and do nothing
with my Twitter account you see a couple
of followers don't hurt so take this
opportunity and pimp yourself it's worth
it would be in the end we'll thread so w
l wi l f r eb yes that's right good
thank you very much again and with this
I'm gonna hand it over to mr. Adam down
ok let's go with sim Floyd jr. stand
forth and be recognized hello you hear
me yes my 20 guys maybe we are afternoon
whatever it is where you are boring
Thank You Julius thank you I had a
question related to all this not jagan
600 processor phones out my read article
today saying that be the US version of
galaxy s4 will be snide giant 600
allegedly allegedly sure no one seems to
be saying anything anymore about the
optimus g pro which is also standard
eigen 600 are very many phones out right
now they have that processor so I heard
on the UM the webcast last night the
pocket I work live cast is not about be
as for event you guys are talking about
the camera on HTC One and the camera s4
but no one said anything about the
camera on the g pro and i'm curious as
to how competitive FL ashley is when it
relates to those are the two phones well
unfortunately we don't have the g pro
yet in our labs for a review
do so whatever we would say about the g
pro would be speculation and that
wouldn't be fair I have handled the g
pro in barcelona at mwc i like the phone
but i didn't manage to take the shots
and compare them with the note too that
I wrecked competitor so once we have the
g pro in our labs for a review make sure
you'll see a lot of camera comparisons
ok because I do remember when you were
there that you did a video on the phones
to know if you have any information
related to the similarity is a
difference isn't because I mean the g
pro Justin now so they're going to get a
lot of the same features that s for has
for his camera so they haven't even
strangely they announced it before
Samsung so it's it was announced on the
14th yesterday but like six hours before
samsung announced their their features
so no one has anything that they can
impart at all there are there are a
couple of reviews out there early
reviews I'm looking at the engadget
review i'm looking for camera samples i
don't see them but i have seen them
somewhere so there is they're out there
if you want to just take a peek at some
oh here they are um ok i guess like you
can just search google for a optimus g
pro review and gadget and see what see
what you think for yourself they're all
they're ok they're not great they're
they're kind of lackluster in terms of
color and clarity not Clara sharpness I
think that she pro in general is gets
been a little bit lackluster in my mind
it's just a stepping stone until we see
the bg2 sometime later this summer we'll
see that's what I wanted to know because
the g pro has all the basic specs that
HTC one is that the s4 has and allowed
to same features but no one is saying
anything and it's coming out at the same
time in the US i said it also i kept on
saying it that the g pro has the
potential to beat the No to at least
until August when we will see the note 3
but it has no chance against a smaller
phone like a financial 4.7 I'm not sure
they are competing in the same market
I'm sorry I think the 5-inch was a
mistake for the for the g pro if they
wanted to get the attention
at the the one and the g4 getting they
had to have a design those are really
compelling the LG really needed to stay
below 25 inch mark but see I wonder
about that because everyone has a note
to everyone has a note too so there is
obviously a market for it so I
understand why is so great I guess
because the samsung's name I guess
that's all it is that's a thing for LG
it feels like it's their phablet not
their next next high-end smartphone so
they have that and the G going forward
instead of just one really standout
smartphone-sized high-end device I think
the optimus g pro is what ever the
optimist view and view to should have
been at the beginning because those were
just failed attempts at having a valid
competitor for the note and the note 2
and now i think they're trying to catch
up in the phablet market while working
on the optimus g2 to compete against the
s4 summer and autumn or late summer so
just saving face and putting a
placeholder and basically hmm ok thank
you any any other questions you have
related to the s4 the one or unrelated
to these no that's all I have you guys
have been asking questions right which
you have anything made from a consumer
perspective you want to ask me well I
would like to ask you the following
thing what would it take for you because
obviously I've heard lots of people
saying that they are disappointed with
the s4 now I'm gonna put it this way
what would it take for you to buy the s4
over the HTC One because I'm guessing
that you're in the HTC one category 2 or
actually no i have a HTC phone and
typically speaking we were just talking
about switching the battery out I've had
to buy an additional battery for it ok
put it this way what would it take for
you to buy the HTC One against the hds
for um 30 100 million for our battery
it's expandable memory well put a 32
gigabyte accountable
let me sign in it and that would pretty
much do it because it's beautiful I mean
it's gorgeous compared to this what I
mean normally no one can deny that I
don't think it can so if they had
expandable storage and a huge battery
there will be no question everybody else
any questions no I just wanted to throw
point out oh my water I know I just want
to let you know I tweeted you a couple
of links since I yeah I have really no
knowledge about the LG for myself I
tweeted you a couple of links to a
camera pic sample and video sample from
the LG optimus pro so maybe that'll help
you out so thank you I these gateways
thank you sure and right now I have
locked my camera on you so that people
can see your door handle that's where
you can find simply jr. villain follow
him a few if you think he has
interesting thoughts and we do we think
we think he does thank you very much for
joining us and help you thank you ok so
yeah hey Tony have a question for you
yeah sure please go on so I was
surprised to know that the HTC One is
wedged in between the this top and
bottom layer there's this I think it's
plastic it's awesome echo yes I have
think you're at that okay thank you
echoes are like my kryptonite so what on
your black model what is it what is
sandwiched in in the center is that plat
like a black plastic on yours yes it is
plastic let me block camera and
interesting it's so like what's the word
it's so sneaky isn't it because you
think like this is a metal and glass
phone but it's got it was not a big deal
and it does have some plastic there it's
uh I think HTC did whatever they did
with the droid DNA were on the sides and
on the top there's that red rubbery
plastic thing and they went with the
same plastic thing it's not rubbish and
it's not red but it's definitely not
battle neither on the sides nor
the top and on the bottom Roger that
whose turn is it I think it's my turn go
on I will choose Lucien hello hello
hello how are you are you doing well
just chilling at home actually it's my
first time on a podcast I wanted to be
the first Romanian to talk to you
because to talk to you live but some
some some guy beat me to it last time
because I miss ya you are the second
Romanian to join us ya know I I'm pretty
disappointed with the the dress for me
being as free user I'm actually talking
to you with my s free I expected more
from Samsung not only software wise but
hardware wise I know what will be my
next phone because I'm a I'm a phone
geek like you guys but I think I'm gonna
stick to the s3 or now what else do you
think they could have done hardware as a
student I see you yeah I don't know use
some kind of premium material also not
as in specifications Hardware but as an
aspect yes yes yes SS I had the dice one
ds2 now ds3 plastic I I expected
something more I expected for them to
mature at that the that material wise
well let's let's talk about that for a
second the choice of a plastic and metal
why do you think Samsung keeps doing
plastic phones like what's what's in it
for them it's been hugely successful for
them they were just talking about how it
reduces manufacturer boss and let some
scale I mean it's working for that they
have the sales numbers to back it up
yeah I think that and the fact that they
want to make light slim phones not heavy
the hand you can make light and slim
pounds not heavy and here the t1 it's a
very thin phone and it's a very light
phone and did not to mention the iphone
5 similarly so you don't have to go with
plastic do you know with aluminum yeah i
agree with you told me but i don't know
what's there what's there are what their
angle I I remember reading a statement
from a samsung official they were
exactly talking about this and they
implied at one point that they are using
plastic because of yield rates because
even if they used aluminum they would
not be able to handle the amount of
orders and production necessary to fill
all the gaps in the market so I think
for samsung is probably a a solution
which is right there for them to grab
and they don't want to change anything
it's I have to have it a plastic phone
for for me to sell millions even though
people want something better this is
what I'm going with I think private
password for it yeah pregnant do you
think that that's why LG Nexus 4 is is
not available I mean they can handle the
how shall I put it they they can handle
the cell the sales you know what I mean
the sales or the production the
production the production you can find
them we Romania is very it's very hard
to find and very very expensive well
don't forget that Romania doesn't have
an official google play store yeah yeah
that's the point yeah you're right right
I also kind of wonder um you know when I
when I'm thinking back and don't get me
wrong I'm kind of the noob here so I
haven't had phones raining down on me
for like all my in my entire life but
what I'm thinking back to the phones
that I've owned you know the pretty much
pre X you know one two three before and
you know the veer and the s4 the s3 the
Lumia all of all the phones that I've
had that have had removable batteries
have all been plastic and all the other
phones that I've heard of that word
metal or glass they never had anything
removable they never had a removable
back they never had a removable you know
battery or anything like that I just
wonder if from a manufacturing
standpoint maybe plastic is necessary to
not destroy the phone trying to remove
the battery or something like that I
have no idea really but OT droid has a
removable metal battery compartment
which one has happened today the
originals or what okay that's
interesting and xperia x1 x2 right if
you're looking at those videos on on how
manufacturers are producing these phones
whether we're talking about the iphone
or the HTC one they are showing you off
that they are basically carving out the
chances of the phone from one piece of
huge aluminum so they are trying to
eliminate moving pieces because it's
easier to bring you just like with the
macbooks air or pro they're carving it
out from a single slab of aluminum and
that's probably the reason why and it's
just exactly the same case with the
Lumias they are made from one single
piece of polycarbonate and that doesn't
allow them for for having a removable
battery because they want to eliminate
the tolerances okay yeah that's a good
that's my kind of a dream but I don't
know if it can't come true Lumia phone
with android the heart the build quality
is extraordinary at luminous but that
will never be sadly I'll never that
wannabe I have a question for you Lucien
before you go um how do you think the
CEO of HTC felt yesterday as he was
hearing about the galaxy s4 I don't know
if you if you if you are scared because
I don't think the galaxy s4 is a lot
better we've reached a point where
hardware and in my opinion haha and this
stuff doesn't matter it might in my
opinion design matters now because the
technology is so high that all the
phones are the same
small differences and not really I know
you get I have the gs3 my girlfriend has
the 1x no difference in speed big
difference I mean the only difference is
in camera The One X is not really good
but I think something will win because
they have a powerful marketing but
that's all yeah Marshall marketing is
really important and it's coming down
the hardware as you say I mean the
specifications of outpaced what software
can do I mean we have octa core
processors and two gigabytes of RAM it's
kind of like it was with the desktop you
know when we had quad-core and then and
then some computers have any core
processors six core processors and
there's really not that big of a
difference between what you can do with
a dual-core desktop and a quad-core
desktop unless you're doing extreme
things like video rendering but no one's
doing your idea whispering on their
phone you know so it's it's it's a very
strange time day to day use what do you
what do we use our phones Twitter
whatsapp Facebook and I don't know watch
a YouTube video you can do that with
every every phone available on the
market high-end I mean and not not iron
with the gs2 gs3 it's no really no
difference between them from yeah very
true it is true I mean I you know meet
me and Michael always talked about this
he'll do a video comparison or her
launch a browser on one phone and then
the other and then he'll say that was
perfectly equal and I'll say bike what
are you talking about the other phone
was like point five seconds faster and
he says yeah yeah but but that's a funny
thing do you care about point five
seconds or does it make no difference to
you uh why I care because I'm like you I
I see the small small things but a
regular user I don't know the difference
between the gs3 and the the 1x in my
country as prices is 60 80 euros it's it
I don't want to pay 80 euros 40 45
seconds five
seconds nope hahaha yea big point if I'm
not a hardcore user if I'm a regular
user that that makes total sense what
you're good thank you very much for
joining us do you have any last thoughts
no I'm just happy I could talk to you
guys and I wish you a cool hangout thank
you very much you're before you go let's
know everybody where they can find you
on Twitter go back atcha 1989 asked see
like my home from our b ec e a and then
the number yes yeah one night 1989 1989
great thank you very much amazing you
come back next week have a nice hang out
like that yes thank you and whose turn
is it right now I think it's my third
what is it my turn your turn it's your
turn Tony awesome okay I would like to
talk to somebody who looks appears to be
from the UK David block please unmute
your microphone from the dog right hi
good evening where are you from chesta
in the UK great one mil to me why do you
think about the s4 or what do you want
to talk about I was going to ask really
um would you get the s4 or would you
wait till the note 3 00 those two are in
complete different markets now the s4 is
reaching a 5-inch screen so that makes
me probably think that the note free
will reach almost close to six inches so
they are in do different markets if
you're asking me personally I'm going to
choose between these two the HTC one hmm
so there's a sister but here's here's an
interesting thing what would you choose
if you have the option for something the
size of the note 2 but with this Exynos
5 octa and all the new software
well the note 3 we can anticipate that
the note 3 will have the same Exynos 5
octa processor but it will clock at
higher speeds it's like history teaches
us as free versus no to it's happened
again s4 vs no 3 it will have the same
specification slightly higher it will
have a 1080p screen a slightly faster
processor same RAM and probably some new
S Pen features and the software features
yeah agreed yeah Oh interesting a lot
actually can I talk about something for
a sec Tony 4.7 inches is going against
the grain for further for the one but
for me it's still a little too tall I
still I think everyone that is obsessed
with tech fantasizes literally as dreams
about it of a 4.3 inch phone that has a
high res display that that is given the
same premium treatment as like the one
and the galaxy s4 just that sweet spot
that smaller size how are you doing with
the 4.7 inch Tony do you think that the
I mean you're used to the note 2 so this
must be like I I have huge hands and the
I cannot use the S free the den 02 with
one hand I am stretching to use the HTC
One with one hand but the sweet spot for
me whether you like it or not is the
4-inch it happens to be the iphone 5
right now but it was a 4 4.3 inch around
there in the end the past you so that's
my sweet spot because I don't want to
watch videos like from one foot away
that for me it's most important that I
can reach with my thumb to the top left
corner I can I can show you right now
because the camera is here I want to
reach here and I cannot reach here with
the HTC One see this is my hand and I
just this is here's the edge of the
screen and I just can't reach there I
have to change this version and then
that there yeah David what's what's the
ideal screen size for you um as big as
you can get I mean I don't really mind
one hand usage anything like that I
quite like a big screen
is I'm using an iphone for the moment I
think screens just way too small I have
a question for you because I know
exactly how you're feeling right now and
why you're saying this I I've been in
your shoes in Barcelona I've been using
the note tooth as my show device and
imagine this scenario you have the note
2 or a slightly bigger or a slightly
smaller screen phone and you have it in
your left hand or in your right hand
regardless the other hand is busy
carrying a bag or carrying something
else and you have to tweet answer or
reply to an email what do you do you
have to stop put everything down free up
your other hand grabbed the phone and
then use the other hand it is a good
point actually and I don't know I just
maybe maybe 4.3 inches that there's two
or something like that yeah I guess
wanted to interject for a second here
we've been hearing a lot lately about
4.3 inch 720p screens which in the past
were a rarity I think the resound had
one but nothing else right now there's
are another HTC that's going to have it
that is a nice photo cone that Ian thing
that's quite gonna have a its main
streaming to be 4.3 720p so maybe we're
finally going to see a high-end phone
with a petite high resolution screen
someone's going to do it because people
are listening to us fishing and playing
that that's all that we want slight
topic change I got to bring this up I
know we're getting to the end of the Hat
and end of the Hangout one of the
problems with the galaxy s4 launch is
that there are so many features talked
about really cool stuff like being able
to use it with your glove on got pushed
under the rug and the Lumia 920 I think
does the the allows you to work glove
and use the phone but like I think the
the galaxy is forcing me the first
android phone correct me if I'm wrong
that has that capability aside from the
Lumia 920 you say yeah and this is a
question or sure yeah yeah is it is this
it will the question I guess the
question is is this a really cool I mean
you guys don't seem that excited about
it i think that's cool because i hate
having to take off my glove on a fruit
all day even though
brings coming is a Charlie for ya do I
care no I guess was shopping for gloves
literally everything the store was
selling or he had no special finger to
work on any capacitors for you really ya
know what that's so funny because the
last time I checked for that like the
crappiest gloves had it and then there
were like really expensive ones that had
it but now you're saying that they're
starting to like build them in I also
saw they sell tickets like a little it's
like a nail polish is paint onto any
pair of gloves and it makes it up
straight don't inhale that you'll lose a
tech years off your life well I usually
do questions um another one is I don't
really get the HTC one I don't you see
one if you do that explain as in how
don't you get it why is metal such an
attractive thing what why what what's so
bad about plastic let me answer using a
question myself have you held a Maedel
phone no then please do hold a metal
phone in your left hand hold a plastic
phone in your right hand and there you
have your answer it's all about the bill
while the ends metal speaks premium that
is it is it doesn't it has marble marble
or granite would be great I was
interesting characteristic of a metal
phone and if you use an iphone 5 you
know this when you pick up the phone
it's cool to the touch and it's just
awesome but the reverse of that when you
start using the phone because metal
conducts temperature right it becomes
really hot but then when you pick it up
and it's cool how cool is that Tony when
you pick up the one it's like a slab of
like coolness in your hand yeah it is it
is cool they are both cool but there's
also something to be said for there's
also something to be said for bulk you
know I know everybody wants thinner and
lighter but you know there is something
to be said for having just a little bit
of weight in your hand that you can
actually hey I'm holding the phone you
don't have to like constantly look at
your hand and remind
yourself that you're actually holding
something so I like metal too did you
see when I was showing you Haley Troy
yeah peel peel view yeah this this is a
huge hefty phone which is huge bulky and
it feels really good in hand and it's
polycarbonate Tony will be talking about
the 808 in 15 years as the bent always
I'm time I'm gonna retire and I will
still snap pictures in the park with the
808 PureView and trying to convince you
youngsters that it's the best camera
phone on the market David thank you very
much for joining us please tell us where
we can find you on twitter i missed a
unique 1000 oh that's a cool handle wait
nice thank you very much for joining us
and we do car next week yes by this
whoever's next please pick somebody do
we have tennis anymore we have 27
minutes left okay I'll see how about
stuttered uh-oh you're waving at me um
how about on you shin hello hey nice
nice to be here I voice try to go to her
but it was a yeast always for so it's my
first time here 60 Bob yeah I'm possibly
your youngest viewer how are you 13
probably so you probably a same family
yeah I've been watching you what since
for 2011 so it's been a long time that's
awesome as well were you actually born
in the 2000s now 1999 oh thank god okay
you can stay so what do you think about
the idea for this is do like a dinosaur
like a new bachelor image we've got a
crazy echo here Code Red the guys kiss
for
know what I mean to be honest I don't
really like it I mean I mean sure the
screen is 1080p but i don't i don't
really get some some design language of
hyper glazing and plastics I think I
much prefer a phone like HTC One X ok
Ivan actually you haven't felt the HTC
One but I'm sure it's great I mean oh I
love doing a heck of it at least sudden
you like the look of the one at least
compared to other these older than one
aksam last year's bones the HTC One um I
don't know it's sort of mixed between 95
and a blackberry z10 a lot of I don't
like either of these devices it's not my
favorite I love my one ex I mean it
looks great if you're great in the hand
and the can was great as well I was
about to ask you what do you think about
the camera I mean we can all agree here
that the camera on the HTC one's if you
ask me sucks you at linden it's mediocre
because he's more durable I mean you
know I don't really get HTC thing I've
ultrapixels I mean it's just for many
pixels plus some software I think added
absorb not sure how it will compare
against the HTC One X so I have used the
galaxy s three as well and a galaxy note
2 but i think the 1x takes much better
pictures than gia both of those samsung
devices oh then you have to check out
our comparison on pocket now where we
compared each you one x with the 60s
freeze and the iphone 4s at that and
you'll see what I'm talking about but
again what's four years if they do it's
rough for you if you argue very
important for you yeah I mean I'm not a
heavy camera user or anything but you
know I felt like to say good pictures
and I think but rather my previous film
des gardius to I think ucc's 1x does the
job much better
to all all other things being equal I
mean you said you're not a big camera
guy but just because everything else
we're seeing now expects that are so
similar Sam breast that's going to push
one model for the top not for me no I
mean if your camera's let's say well
it's not if i'm buying a phone and one
cameras eight megapixels and the other
is a 13-megapixel i don't really mind
where I go I wouldn't really mind about
how many megapixel it is you know not
sort of more care about you know does it
have removable battery does it have
microSD expansion slow sort of more
those who day-to-day things that
actually matter you see guys I can't
really understand absolutely trying to
wrap my head around this why is
removable battery important I mean do
all of you carry a spare battery in your
wallets I mean whenever you run out of
power they just grab your new battery
and you shove it in there or just
another gimmick Tony um let me tell you
one thing when I'm my galaxy s2 the
battery life is pretty good but it
started getting worse and I'm like
Michael where there's um or Galaxy Nexus
from verizon uh I couldn't get through a
day without having two batteries um but
it offers that bad and I think move
about trees of oniony you really need it
I mean you know if you compare the
galaxy s3 to the HTC One X you know HTC
says they can't include a removable
battery because if you know to make it
thinner look at more better but Samsung
does the job equally well and you know
it gives you much more features so what
do we my opinion besides just seeing it
whips off a battery out you can always
put in an extended sure it'll make the
phone thicker but we'll give you another
thousand how we have ours so much the
best that's a valid point yeah that's
that's about the only battle of coins
which I accept plus you know if you keep
using a battery i mean the life span we
eventually get short and you'll need to
buy another battery for it yes they
don't want you to my batteries they want
you to buy new phones
you know being 13 you Cory but whatever
you want that's kind of obvious that's
very fair come you review units I
mean hot swap phones all the time but
I'm stuck with this oh so do you have
any questions for anybody on the team um
yeah Brandon please don't what matters
to you the most the camera the processor
or the screen cuz I know you're a pixel
PP I found evil way to slice on about it
oh jeez i would say that i care a little
bit more about the screen than i do the
camera but they're very very close and
the processor is that so much the
processor I think it's more about how
responsive it is and if there's any lag
at all i just get extremely upset and I
cry and I go home to my mother right so
you know I'm just wondering when you
review the HTC One X you know did you
really like it that much because you're
on your full review you said had great
potential but a fair amount of Tegra 3
lakh antisense skin / they yeah in fact
that's funny you mention that I'm about
to do a HTC one vs 1 x comparison and
I'm trying to flash the newest jelly
bean firmware the official jelly bean
firmware from HTC onto it and I'm really
curious if jelly bean fixes the lag
situation because if it does that makes
the 1x still a really good phone I mean
that screen oh yeah I'm assuming you're
considering the 1x um yeah I'm yeah
obviously I do have a galaxy s three as
well comparing the screen with the HTC
One mg comp it's like comparing a
dinosaur to account you can't the HTC
One X wins 10 times over but if I if I
tell you the Mai Mai 1x is running jelly
bean at the moment and I have compared
it with ice cream sandwich and
everything is buttery smooth the one
thing i'm mike
plain about is the widgets um you know
placing widgets opening up with just
sometimes a bit laggy but most of the
time I really don't experience like it's
very smooth well that's good to hear
okay before before we part to tell
everybody where they can find you on
Twitter I don't have to answer you know
have twitter well then maybe next time
when you'll join us you will have one
and then we can pimp your twitter
account out well I need a Google+
because of you guys I don't even a
facebook control but i don't i'm not
really into social networking finally
somebody's thank you very much for
joining us i'll come back next week
thank you Tony have a nice day I festive
I see yet about ah I'm gonna go with
danessa um the neighbor you want just
you were just itching to get online well
you know I did I saw how you doing hello
guys how you guys doing I'm doing great
not too bad not too bad so what do you
think about the as far i know you're an
HTC fan but any chance we could win you
over well I've always said if I ever go
to Samsung it will be because of the
galaxy note and I other galaxies cuz i
was i was watching that your guys hang
out and then on the net on the other
window i was watching the unveiling of
the samsung and I didn't like it because
of the same thing that everyone is
saying is that the sign I was hoping for
something sit like to completely blow my
mind I mean the phone is good I like the
new little gimmicks that they have
everything is looking good but the phone
is basically the same when Brandon said
that the border that looked like metal
wasn't metal I was like oh man because i
was i was hoping for something to be
completely different but there was no
difference and it's still good for but
there's not the phone for me
what about the Xperia Z are you are you
uh oh yes absolutely I think before I
was the I was an HTC fangirl I was
one-hundred-percent sony ericsson before
it turned into plain Sony and I thought
the commune waterproof phone and the
dust proof and everything was really
great I think the phone is amazing I
will totally get it just for the phone
just for the fun of not having so way to
run into into someplace if it's training
to use my phone that's very cool what I
thought you wanted tweet from the shower
like Michael Fisher with the Kyocera
torque yes I did not want to read that
tweet when he said that was like whoa ta
I wanted to reply at one point but then
again I i deleted whatever i wrote and I
said no I'll bash yes exactly i wanted
to say something I get it what I'm over
friend to get out of the shower cuz no
just no but I'm Finnegan I think Tony is
coming out with very good phones a
tablet is the one thing that absolutely
owned me over I wanted to have it right
there right like right at that moment I
wanted to buy it but then again it's
just that little thing that is
waterproof I think the is looking it's
really smooth as far as I've seen in all
the videos but you never know it's just
this brand new technology to put that
way so come out with phones that are
waterproof and stuff so I'm not one of
the present convinced with that but I
think they're really really good phones
and tablets you can I caution you for
something up the experience z is less
organ Amish than the ZL and not many
people talk about the ZL and we're gonna
have a review soon but the CEO has soft
touch plastic on the back compared to
this glass and hard edges of the Z so
make sure you consider the ZL as well
yes absolutely I think it looks better
to be completely honest the only thing
that when we obey about the the phone it
was that it was waterproof and as Taylor
said that thing that thing actually
bothers me the way you have to like open
each for every flap yeah yeah it's I
think it's
a little annoying but okay it's nothing
that you get used to it well you cancel
email phone waterproof if you don't
cover up all the holes yeah they're
talking about it though with this like
water resistant coating is going to be
all over the circuit boards I don't know
how it's going to work I mean Liquipel
batteries and screens yeah that doesn't
seem like it's a very smart idea but
this thing no copy the technology or the
idea from this one company that was
created i think it was like a year or
two ago that you could send your phone
and having me like but have it this
haven't tried having this code of
something like Silicon agility to make
it waterproof I thought that was amazing
I was actually thinking about it but
then it's too much money and then now
they came out with waterproof long at
least resistance danessa do you have any
questions for everybody or anybody on
the team well um so Brandon what cuz I I
keep writing your tweets and you said
something about the proud processor in
the phone in general like it sounded
like you weren't so hyped and so excited
for the phone and then you just got
punched in the face with the entire
event is that really that much of a
disappointment I mean I I think that we
were all expecting some awesome amazing
surprise and we have to kind of stop
expecting that because 12 months is not
enough time to innovate to such a high
degree I made a comment about the
processor and they weren't talking about
the processor but the octa-core was in
there and I you know we got a wink and a
nudge from one of the PR guys and like
it felt exactly the same as the galaxy
s3 and so it was just you know you think
it'd be a little bit faster but it it
was pretty much which is not terrible
but I didn't blow me way I am currently
working on muting everybody who joined
ok no more echo I think you guys how we
can't hear you did I move mute you do
yes you did yeah say something ok
okay you're back okay well um yeah
that's the thing because it was so much
hype that's why I didn't want to get all
excited or read any of the rumors or
anything because I knew it was going to
blow me away or like most important
thing is that just because there's
something there were so many rumors
about it that you're your spectators
will be up here and then the reality
will be back down here with all the
rumors so I think yeah you got hit by
reality I guess and that's why I didn't
want to get all excited with this event
but still at phone but I just felt like
the entire thing which is more gimmicks
and software things more than the phone
itself it was a gimmick we were just
talking about this a few minutes ago
just because you can do something
doesn't mean you you can like they were
like have you ever wanted to record
sound with a picture and everyone was
like no and they were like great well we
just we have available within a few
months from now somebody somebody is
going to say you know what just forget
it I'm gonna do I'm create an app and
somebody on a regular Android phone or
whatever I mean OS phone is gonna
download an app and be able to take a
picture with a main camera and at the
same time take a picture with this from
camera somehow somebody's going to
figure it out and then is gonna be like
an old gaming and it was all for nothing
exactly there's going to be app that can
do that not only that but did you notice
how one of their headline features as s
translate which is an app that does
real-time translation there are tons of
apps that do that just because Samsung
decided we're going to include one all
that great but still it's something that
you already have in your phone and if
you don't you just have to like download
it from the logo Play Store and that's
it yeah and the Viking within these I
have had a very long and difficult
relationship with s voice so if s
translate is anything like s voice oh my
god Adams going to be asking where the
bathroom is when he's trying to order
his dinner seriously I mean it's like
and I tweeted this out last night I said
that kid better double-check
triple-check his tickets before it gets
into the bus to Taipei
so yeah cool well thank you for joining
us here your twitter handle is located
there Tony clicked on our luck yeah I'm
loving my screen on her right there she
is awesome there's not at the
pronunciation of my name on there next
to my name cuz people have trouble with
it what's your heart it was fine Anna
but that doesn't matter for your Twitter
handle so thank you very much for
joining us and as always please come
back next week yes take care Peppa I uh
Brandon your turn again did you hear
that it was a vibration and from the
sound of it was the HTC One yes every
time I get a notification from the one I
get a heart attack it's it's like whoa
what OH anyway all right I gotta go see
I guess I'm Brandon email now um let me
click on I don't know the order that
that these things have happened that
guy's waving his hands Muhammad hello
Muhammad unmute your microphone so you
have some music on okay hello how are
you doing how are you doing okay do you
think sing songs fall down early and are
still out look doing okay crazy okay
just for one second everybody please
mute your microphones if you are not
part of the team and if we are not
currently talking to you thank you very
much and Brandon backe we have killed
the echo good yes i was asking i mean do
you think that mmm do you think said you
know I feel like Samsung kind of started
as a brand for the enthusiast right and
they they grew fast and
with these awesome products these
beautiful products they stuck to the
AMOLED screen their phones are fast and
and and now it's like Samsung is like a
consumer brand and they want to get
phones in the hands of mom and dad and
grandma and grandpa because we're all
already carrying them does that that
bother you do you think that's that's a
reasonable thing to do according to the
brand they will only look at how number
of device will sell that's that's why
they're there a brand and they want to
sell the phone number of phones that's
what mattered to them but according to
anybody who is buying a device it's up
to their what what they want but I don't
think anything else what kind of phone
are you using now I am a phone junkie so
basically I have nexus 4 and then s2
another captain to phones but I almost
like one week back i sold my note 2 I
had s3 I had iphone 4s to whatever or
not why do you have two phones right now
this is my official phone office phone
and this is my personal device so why do
you have to get them separate this is
just you want to keep your personal
information on one and no I like
switching phones basically I maximum
life period of phone that I have is
three to six months maximum in India you
have to buy the phone outright it's not
there is no way to contract anybody the
this this there is no contract policy
here you just have to buy them really
yeah whoa you have to bite them
completely and then sell it so that's
how it works and you are basically all
on prepaid or pay-as-you-go it depends
they're both prepaid and postpaid as
well but most of them only the the new
contract policy started with the iPhone
5 iPhone iPhone series but still its way
call
what a contract to buy em hmm do you
think we were talking about ameletta
second ago samsung sticking with AMOLED
and HTC is sticking with LCD which do
you think I'm imagining by your phone
choice you like amoled a little bit more
basically in India the number of manly
Samsung's you know cell phone very fast
Urso whatever the phone that comes out
we'll come to India faster than us
basically to for example s4 will launch
exactly the time when it is launched
everywhere so it will be faster than us
and I like amyloid and i buy most of the
samsung phone I don't like HTC basically
because the then is not one you have to
processor device or anything it's also a
resale value if you like if you are a
phone junkie the resale value of the
phone also matters and Samsung has a
good resale value in India very good
what what is your next phone going to be
I am thinking of three phones still not
yet decided one is s for motorola x
series and then note 3 so i have to
decide on this 3 have you is the x is
interesting because it's so it's such
like a it's so early with the axis
probably gonna be until the summer what
do you did you see the rumors today that
the X might be a brand name for a
customizable phone yeah I checked out
the most likely fresh every hour so I
read a lot of blogs including yours
always been there so I don't know it
seems to be interesting to customize
your own phone with the whatever you
want but still it's early to comment on
it yes how I wonder how serious the
customization options are going to be if
it's just your storage or you already
have that I mean right in an iphone and
any size you want now if they give you
like the option for three gigs of ram or
something that nobody's doing yeah
that's compelling but I don't know if
that's what we're talking about here hi
cut I'm kind of nervous about that
if I mean when we review a phone there's
like one or two models if we get like a
motor elects the the two gig of two gigs
of RAM model before give your am out of
a kit yeah we're gonna like remem
everybody's gonna review one phone on
the team and there's still gonna be two
left unreviewed yeah that's right hey it
depends I mean do you have any questions
for for us so I have a common question
one is I think one is the Michael Fisher
reviewed this camera of his tc1 and
other cameras so HTC one camera was
looking lot better in terms of picture
that you have attached on your side so
that was the end of interesting seeing
to be an ultrapixel camera and then a
second one is to Mike Brandon about his
choice of why he thought octa was not
performing well kind of his review on
what he saw in galaxy s4 okay I'm gonna
answer on Michaels behalf he didn't draw
a conclusion we will draw a conclusion
in the review which will happen next
week until then I'm going to do some
more 1 comparisons against some other
phones and based on all of these
findings Brandon's going to review the
one and the conclusion for the camera is
going to be in that review and I'm going
to hand it over to brandons answer your
question yeah about the opticore
processor it's it's it's really a lot of
marketing because what you have is you
have two sets of processing cores both
quad-core ones i believe a 15 and one's
a 7 and so you're never using literally
eight cores at the same time you're
easier either using one cluster or the
other and so it's no wonder really that
the performance of the quad of using one
of you know that the the better
quad-core cluster will equal or be a
little bit better than the performance
of a galaxy s4 which had a very similar
cluster of four cores in a slightly
slower processor but like I was just
kind of disappointed because you expect
from one generation to the next to be a
significant upgrade and performance but
that just wasn't the case for
well I was scrolling around a web page
with lots of images I was doing some
pinch to zoom and for most people it
would be like extremely fast but for me
I did notice a little bit of white white
space and a little bit of the text not
clearing up you know instantly so that's
why I'm in the video that the lighting
conditions were awful because at the
events lighting conditions are awful but
did you manage to see pixels on that
screen there's no way kidding me man I I
think it will be a review in it anyway
my other question is uh I thought about
this uh I don't know your membrane email
email to one of us if you remember yeah
send an email to live at pocketnow.com
everybody who cannot join us can reach
us there I'm gonna lock my screen on you
because uh where are you you're right
here because you have your twitter
handle right there and I'm gonna thank

the floor so we kind of got into this
habit of recording these hangouts when
like we want to talk about something
anyway and something that we kind of
want to talk about on the team to help
sort of drive our editorial and just
that you know we're obsessed with this
stuff is to talk about seriously galaxy
s4 vs HTC One the pros and the cons of
each which one we're personally looking
forward to so we're going to do a
special actually closed hang out you
might open it at the end we haven't
really determine that yet
next week Tony what they are we doing
that we know it will be most probably
