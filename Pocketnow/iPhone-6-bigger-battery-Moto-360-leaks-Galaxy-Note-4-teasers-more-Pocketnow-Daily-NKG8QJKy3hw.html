iphone 6 is getting a major battery
upgrade new photos reveal the Moto 360
with its rumored wireless charger in a
metal back and Samsung teases the Galaxy
Note 4 4 eva 2014 I'm hi Mary vetta
tired hungry and with nightmares of a
cup of coffee on a Wednesday this is
pocket out daily so this is really
interesting in today's official news
we've got PC Magazine running a battery
test on the same smartphones and
different networks meaning the verizon
variant of the HTC One m8 compared to
the t-mobile Varian's and then we've got
the galaxy s5 another high-end
smartphones and legs description look at
the full report this is really
interesting t-mobile is the company that
gives you the better battery life and
it's hard to confirm if this is because
of the network because obviously
t-mobile's network is far from perfect
but the scenario was the same no wife by
the same brightness and it turned out
that you get as much as two hours more
on a tmobile variant of the smartphone
could it be that there is less amount of
bloat which is something that I
personally confirmed the leave us a
comment down below tell us your
experience on your specific network and
then other almost official news for all
of you that are wondering if we are
getting the Galaxy Note 4 at Samsung's
Aoife aventa well it's happened every
year since the original Galaxy Note but
the company has already begun teasing
and they've been teasing with new ads
that show us different features of the
existing Galaxy Note 3 that are coming
to the Galaxy Note 4 but obviously there
must be a kick there must be something
special about this new smartphone so
yeah the teaser their galaxy note 4 is
coming stay tuned and give us your
prediction now another very anticipated
product is the Moto 360 and for those of
you that were worried that this thing
was going to come in plastic we've got
good news we've got some photos showing
us the wireless charger that's going to
be powering this moto 360 which looks
gorgeous and even more interesting
bleecker confirms that the device is
made out of metal and glass so you have
nothing to worry about we don't know
exactly how they figured out a way to
bring metal and wireless charging plus
glass and the whole combination and
trust me I don't really care as long as
it works and as long as it looks great
that's what we want so yeah the Moto 360
is what we want stay tuned another
interesting leaks one of the biggest
complaints that we've had of the iphone
ever since it exists is its battery life
and we were kind of concerned as the
rumors were that we were only getting an
eighteen hundred million power battery
on the iphone 6 the 4.7 inch model now
parts of the 1500 milliamp hour battery
that we have on the iphone 5s where
battery life is terrible new reports
claim that apparently Apple was only
testing the eighteen hundred million
power battery there is a 2100 milliamp
hour battery coming to the iphone 6 and
the 4.7 inch variant apparently and even
though we don't know how the a8
processor is going to handle everything
or such it's great to see that Apple is
at least beefing up things and finally
for the very interesting and kind of
disappointing news of the day we've got
some interesting news regarding the
Microsoft Surface lineup the full lineup
as it turns out Microsoft is reporting
that they've lost 1.7 billion dollars
with the surface and this means from the
surface RT originally so the current
surface pro 3 we finally seen some
profits come to the surface lineup
apparently was like 400 million or
something which is a finally something
for the company but yeah the company has
lost so much money that with the new
microsoft we're wondering if the surface
lineup will survive with all the changes
that the company's making we know the
company is committed to the product but
that leads me to the question of the day
do you think that the microsoft surface
as a lineup should continue do you want
one or do you think that there are
better options out there because in my
particular case i'm not going to lie to
you i really like the surface pro 3 i am
willing to pay for it but my problem is
that I'm so stuck in the mac ecosystem
that's just my specific case but i know
that this is a good product i would
really buy it but leave us a comment
down below what do you think frenzy us
you know the drill if you want to get
the nose earlier before this video is
phil mushy follow us on pocketnow.com is
a sharp change channel as well it also
follow me on twitter Jaime underscore
