that you'll have to go phablet to get
the goods Samson finally decides to
unpack its galaxy note 7 event coming
soon and the ZTE exon 7 kicks off
pre-orders in the US with a bang I'm hi
meri behna and the contrary to popular
belief you can actually party on
Wednesdays I actually recommend it this
is bargain out daily the official loose
today again begin with deals if you are
in the market for one of our favorite
smartphones of the year the HTC 10 well
currently it's a hundred dollars off on
the HTC website and there are also a
deal where you get a hundred dollars in
accessories as well it's pretty much
hundred dollars off and some of these
accessories are actually rather cool so
I highly suggest you follow like a
trippy now this is another major deal I
was in China experiencing the exon 7
drums ed I gotta tell you there is a lot
of hot from this phone starting with
those speakers the fact that you get the
same specifications of every flagship
but back then the price tag for the
United States was in yet official we
have it today pre-orders have begun you
get your device on the twenty-seventh
for four hundred dollars four hundred
dollars for pretty much the same
specifications of the galaxy s7 with far
better speakers we can not wait for our
review units where I've to tell you more
about it and another device that even
though has become a little more
expensive it's still worth the money is
the alcatel idol 4s it got announced
today in the United States if you order
it pretty much now or later you'll pay
four hundred dollars as well which is
definitely a lot more expensive than the
idol 3 again this is the S variant with
better specifications but if you
actually order it by Friday you can get
fifty dollars off on that phone which
makes another compelling deal we can not
wait tell you more about that though as
well and speaking of black ships one of
the hottest news yesterday was Samsung
sending us press invitations for an
unpacked event to happen in New York
City on August second we will be
covering it live I honestly cannot wait
one of the phones that I anticipate
mostest ears also the note 7 I've been a
Galaxy Note consumer for ages ever since
the no
too and that this phone promises a lot
we cannot wait to tell you more as soon
as this event happens surely Samsung has
to pull off something hot here and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with some very interesting leaked
dummies of the iphone 7 plus 7 pro
whatever the name is going to be we're
actually inquiring to iphone 7 pro
mainly because of the smart ports at the
bottom it could just be that Apple is
going to do something special with this
larger phablet because we do notice a
dual cameras here not available on the
smaller one the smart connectors here
not only one it seems that Apple wants
to really make this phablet a more
powerful device and not just a larger
iphone which makes a lot of sense but it
leads me to the question of the day
would you agree that Apple is pulling a
smarter strategy by making this phablet
a more powerful device in my case I
believe that that's the way it should be
mainly because of the price difference
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the video was
filmed otherwise I'm ever calm
