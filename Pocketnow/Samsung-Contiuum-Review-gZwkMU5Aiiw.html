journey with the Samsung continuum in
our unboxing video from there we gave
you a look at the hardware that it
offers its dual ticker screen and very
unique design then we also showed you
this software which also does
incorporate the multitasking or the
multi notification system of that ticker
screen lastly we compared it with a
bigger brother if you will full samsung
galaxy s it was actually the i9000 the
european unlocked variant well now it's
time to give you a full review and our
final thoughts on the device Before we
jump in if you want to see the full
written review as well as this video on
one page be sure to go to pocketnow.com
other than that let's go ahead and get
started
now first off we'd like to talk about
some of the aspects of the continuum
offers that we've really enjoyed the
dual ticker screen is a very unique
concept what it more or less does is it
will bring your notifications down into
a secondary screen on the bottom of your
phone so that you can actually see your
notifications just by picking up your
phone with the built-in grip sensor what
this means is that you can pick up your
phone the phone will realize that you've
picked it up and just turn on that
secondary screen instead of having to
power on the entire device and unlock
the entire device that is very cool if
you're looking to just see what's going
on in a very quick fashion the continuum
is in the galaxy s line of devices so of
course you're going to have a beautiful
super amoled screen which does not lack
whatsoever even the ticker has great
resolution despite its smaller size we
love being able to use our continuum as
a 3g mobile hotspot as many of you know
verizon has a great network it's very
developed in the United States we're
able to get coverage in most places that
means that we were actually able to look
up the continuum to a laptop and get
great data speeds and very consistent
data speeds the mobile car dock as well
as the home car dock also lead us to
believe that Samsung might possibly
releasing a dock of some kind to use at
home on a nightstand as well as in the
car these are both a great design it's a
very cool little feature to see in your
device that really makes it all the more
worthwhile for battery life Samsung
rates this device at seven hours on a
fifteen hundred million power battery
this does hold true surprising we're
able to get through a day no problems we
were actually able to get in most cases
anywhere from six and a half to even
eight hours of talk time off our
continuum Samsung whatever you're doing
you're doing it correctly and it's most
likely the fact that this is a smaller
screen whereas most of the galaxy s
devices are 4 inch screens you solve the
same battery powering the smaller screen
it goes a long way now what we don't
like about the continuum and there's
really only two things the benefits
outweigh the costs here for sure the
first of which is the call quality or
the speaker quality callers on the other
end of the line so that we sound very
electronic or digital almost fake in
some cases and it seemed on RN that the
actual speaker or the earpiece was over
compensating almost as if the gain was
turned too far up it did sound very
digital it was almost static and poppy
in some cases and it actually almost
hurt our ear the caller's voice did seem
distorted this may be specific to only I
review unit we'll have to wait and see
lastly we didn't like the amount of RAM
the continuum s 336 megabytes were
typical galaxy s devices have 512 what
this means you're going to see some
slowdown and some hiccupping happen from
time to time the processor is fine being
a 1 gigahertz hummingbird processor but
keep in mind it's also powering that
secondary screen overall however Samsung
really has hit a home run with the
continuum if you've been looking at a
galaxy s device because you really like
that super amoled screen but you don't
like the big 4 inch size this phone may
be for you you can also use that
secondary ticker screen to see
notifications from facebook twitter text
messages emails you name it and someone
actually sends you a text message will
actually show your text in that ticker
we actually gave you an example of that
on our software overview video we can't
wait to see what the potential of this
ticker screen has for third-party
developers to incorporate with their
applications if you're not going to
doing some serious multitasking the
continuum is a great bet if you don't
mind the TouchWiz UI the continuum is
also a great bit if you don't like
TouchWiz whatsoever you'll probably want
to use one of the alternative home
launchers or a different device with
that being said we greatly enjoyed using
the continuum it's actually a very fun
device to use and it's something new
seeing that ticker screen go out for the
first time and when you pick up the
phone the ticker screen actually turns
on for you it's a new take on a mobile
phone and it's very enjoyable and fun to
use overall we give the Samsung
continuum a 4.5 out of 5 if you want to
see our full written review be sure to
check pocketnow.com you can get this
video as well as a full long page of
details on the Samsung continuum as
always thank you very much for watching
everyone please give this video a nice
thumbs up and we'll see you soon thanks
