pocketnow.com this week sprint announced
their version of the Galaxy Nexus from
Samsung which will launch on April 22nd
and it's going to launch with the
ability to use Google Wallet something
that was announced in May of last year
the app was released in September of
last year but still the feature is
unavailable on the Verizon Wireless
version of the Galaxy Nexus but that
doesn't mean it's impossible to run on
the Verizon Wireless version we'll show
you how to install it then we'll take it
for a test drive over the course of a
week let you know what it's like in real
world use stay tuned it's pocket now so
for this project the first thing we're
going to need is a computer now we're
using a MacBook Air but you can use a PC
or a Linux box any computer will do will
also need a USB cable and the Galaxy
Nexus itself in this case a 4G LTE
version from Verizon Wireless in the
United States the first thing we want to
do is jump into settings check our
Android version make sure it is either
version 4.2 3 or dot 4 if you have any
other version at this moment this simple
hack will not be supported the next
thing we're going to do is drop into
xda-developers into this forum thread
we'll drop the link in there for you in
the video description we're gonna save
the apk for a Google Wallet to our
computer save it in a directory of your
choosing and should download it
relatively quickly and then we'll plug
our USB cable into the computer and then
into the Galaxy Nexus using a file
manager we're just gonna drag and drop
the apk onto the Galaxy Nexus and then
we're gonna use a file manager I use
Astro you can use whatever you like go
ahead and locate that apk file on the
Galaxy Nexus and tap on it to run if
you're using Astro it'll ask you if you
want to browse the file open the app
manager just go ahead and hit install
Android is going to do its usual thing
and ask you for your permission to
install it showing you all the
permissions that the app is going to
have go ahead and press install
once the application finishes installing
you can go ahead and press open and
presto Google Wallet is running on your
Verizon Wireless Galaxy Nexus of course
that's not all there is to it you've got
to agree to an encyclopedia long Terms
of Service Agreement obviously we always
recommend you read the whole thing but
nobody ever does that click I agree when
you're ready and then the application
will ask you what Google account you
want to associate the Wallet account
with if you have more than one you can
select it with the radio buttons or you
can add a new account at this stage if
you like you'll be prompted with another
permission request giving Google Wallet
access to your Google Checkout accounts
and then you'll have to set a new pin
code make sure it's something you
remember because you'll use this every
time you use Google Wallet right now you
only have the option of adding a handful
of specialty gift cards to your account
or a Citi MasterCard Google while
the application tells you that other
options are coming soon of course it's
said that for a long time so don't hold
your breath the most useful portion of
the application is the Google prepaid
card which you can load with money and
use like a debit card and as an
incentive for using wallet Google has
loaded it already with ten dollars for
us they'll do the same for you as well
any new customer to Google Wallet gets
ten free dollars so that's pretty
awesome finally you'll be given a quick
tutorial on how to use Google Wallet and
then it's off to the races well I don't
know about you but I can't stand money
burning a hole in my pocket so we got
Google Wallet installed we got ten free
Google bucks let's go spend him in my
first venue for a Google Wallet purchase
was CVS I chose CVS because they're a
nationwide chain and I knew they already
had the pay pass system installed which
Google Wallet needs to operate I
immediately went to the health food
section and got myself some healthy
edamame beans okay I got candy went to
the self checkout aisle scanned my items
that I made sure my phone was unlocked
and tapped it to the pay pass pad the
phone prompted me to enter my pin code
which I promptly did then it told me to
tap the phone again to the pad to finish
the payment I tapped it again
there was a pleasant sound and the
payment was completed easy as that
the Google Wallet app then gave me a
transaction report immediately following
the transaction showing me how much I
had spent I could even display the
approximate location of the transaction
if I'd wanted to feeling buoyed by my
success at the CVS I decided to try
another nationwide chain and went to
Rite Aid having apparently not had
enough health food and with an eye
towards saving some more money I decided
to snap up some discount surplus Easter
M&amp;amp;Ms because I do what I want now Rite
Aid is where I learned that the NFC
payment pads can be a little
temperamental this one here rejected my
first attempt at a transaction
ultimately I had to turn the phone
around for it to register a second tab
but it ultimately went through just fine
now by this time I was pretty loaded
down with candy so it was time to do
the next logical thing and get a haircut
now there was a wait at the barber shop
so while I was sitting there waiting I
decided it would be a good time to
replenish my funds I noticed though that
the Google Wallet app does not appear in
the recently used apps on the Galaxy
Nexus for some reason so I had to
manually go back into the app launcher
and launch the app that way not really a
terrible annoyance just a little bug
that I thought worth mentioning as I
said I only had just under six dollars
of free Google money remaining so I
tapped ad funds and in the time it took
me to enter my debit card information I
had added $30 to my Google Wallet
account I immediately received a push
notification to that effect and presto I
was instantly armed with more electronic
money once my wait was over my usual
barber did a great job as he usually
does and he agreed to help me
demonstrate one of the limitations of
Google Wallet in that it's not accepted
in many places yeah I had to pay him in
cash as a matter of fact I was surprised
at just how many places didn't have the
necessary pin pads now you can't expect
a lot of small businesses and local
establishments to possess the necessary
equipment but I was floored by how many
large nationwide brands with hundreds of
stores across the country some even
across the world didn't have the
necessary equipment to use the NFC
payment system fortunately as anyone
who's ever wanted delicious really
unhealthy food knows McDonald's will
always be there for you and this
lemonade was sorely needed after a long
day of using my phone to pay for things
all around town so yeah that was one
week with Google Wallet on the verizon
Galaxy Nexus but really I didn't even
need a day less than a day really to
realize how awesome it feels to make
purchases with your phone we get we've
been doing it for years over-the-air
with Amazon apps and eBay absent all
that kind of stuff but there's just
something about physically tapping your
phone to a PayPass pad in a store and
watching it respond and knowing that
money is being transferred there that
makes me feel like I'm living in the
future again
and after eight years of using
smartphones it's not easy to make me
feel that way again but this is a very
very cool thing that said can we fully
recommend doing this no even though it
works perfectly in my experience Verizon
does not officially support it so you
will have one fewer person to go crying
to if something does go wrong and some
people in the industry are making the
claim that Google Wallet is inherently
unsafe in itself because of the nature
of Android we're not gonna get into that
discussion here but suffice to say it is
still an open question more important
for me at least is this issue of
adoption as I mentioned Google Wallet
has been out for almost eight months and
it's still relatively rare to see stores
out there that support the PayPass NFC
pad system now a lot of factors
contribute to that and really is
anybody's guess whether or not Google
Wallet is gonna pan out for Google or
fail like any number of their other
projects have Wow I hope it does succeed
because really this is a very very cool
product and it's one I'm really excited
about I have to say that stores that
support it right now are so rare that
it's really not worth the hassle to set
it up unless you're a geek or you know
unless you're the mayor of your local
CVS on Foursquare but by all means if
you want to make the effort and you're a
tinkerer and you want to feel the rush
of living like a Jetson for a minute go
for it
it's a lot of fun did I miss something
of course I did that usually happens
leave me a note let me know what I
missed
did you like something sometimes that
happens too and it's pretty cool when it
does give us a thumbs up or leave
