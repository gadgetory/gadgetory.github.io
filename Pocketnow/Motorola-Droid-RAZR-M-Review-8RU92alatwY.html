razors and we've got one of them I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is the Motorola Droid Razr m full
review let's get to it we took a brief
tour of the razor M's hardware in last
week's unboxing video and as I mentioned
there you could be forgiven for
overlooking this device in the shadow of
its to larger beefier siblings motorola
is marketing this device as having an
edge-to-edge display and while it's not
quite what we had in mind when we think
of that term the bezel is quite thin
they needed to make this device notable
in some way and it wasn't gonna be the
display itself which is the same panel
as on the original Droid Razr a 4.3 inch
Super AMOLED advanced at qHD resolution
with a pentile RGB jisub pixel
arrangement the screen has taken a lot
of heat for those specs but it's not
without its pluses we found the
excellent color saturation and the deep
blacks to be really wonderful and
overcoming those deficiencies for the
most part the casing itself is pretty
unremarkable from a design standpoint
the phone is 8.3 millimeters thick and
vaguely wedge-shaped without the
distinctive camera bulge that has
defined the razor line until now
motorola has brought its popular kevlar
micro weave backing to this device and
it combined with the Gorilla Glass 2
screen protection the aluminum frame and
the water-repellent nano coating give
the 126 gram razor amma solid feel in
the hand there is a notification LED up
here but annoyingly it's not used for
anything but low battery blinking for
guts we're looking at a fairly typical
spec loadout a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor is backed up by one gig of ram
and 8 gigs of storage expandable via
microSD for radios Verizon's CDMA and 4G
LTE bands are here as well as global
roaming with HSPA
the primary camera is 8 megapixels and
shoots video in 1080p and all that is
powered by a non-removable 2000 milliamp
hour battery all that hardware is put
two solid use on the software side
the razor and we tested isn't running
final software and it's not running
anything fancy like jellybean but it's
still a fairly smooth experience
specifically we're talking about Android
4.0.4 with Motorola's custom UI skin
which seems to be growing more and more
subtle with each new device Motorola's
custom unlock screen here is back with
its quick jump shortcuts and other
Flair's have returned as well like the
circles widget we know and love from our
time with the Atrix HD and Photon Q
motorola has also rethought the home
screen layout positioning the primary
home screen all the way to the left of
the ribbon it's let Motorola build a
custom quick settings pane full of
useful toggles as well as a jump link to
the full settings menu which is quite
handy importantly the Motorola keyboard
has undergone some serious revisions
while it's still listed in the software
as Motorola input the keyboard is as
close to stock Android as we've seen
with its autocorrect and responsiveness
much better than on other Motorola
devices otherwise it's typical Ice Cream
Sandwich with folder support widgets
multitasking everything we're used to
seeing from Android we tested the razor
m in the Greater Boston area and found
its performance to be better than
average for a mid-range smartphone as we
mentioned before UI responsiveness was
quite good with the device only
stuttering and lagging occasionally and
benchmark scores were close to the last
Motorola device we reviewed the photon
queue that leads to smooth internet
browsing and gameplay most of the time
and video playback is also good
considering this isn't even final
software that bodes well for the phone's
future if it gets updated regularly
camera performance was average which is
actually a step up from most other
Motorola smartphones we've reviewed
there's still the issue of the
viewfinder software being finicky when
it comes to white balance and focal
point with mixed bright and dark
backgrounds but at least Motorola has
finally included an HDR mode for photos
which helps a lot macro shooting is
acceptable the camera app launches
quickly and shutter responsiveness is
quite good
the bug that we noticed on the Atrix HD
and photon Q which causes music to
momentarily blast from the speakerphone
when you're taking a picture while
listening to music is still here but one
step at a time we suppose in line with
other Motorola hardware phone calls on
the razor and we're crystal clear and
callers said we sounded fine
reception over both 3G and LTE was
excellent
speakerphone performance in calls wasn't
as loud as during media playback but it
was plenty loud for most circumstances
speaking of media playback there are
some handy equaliser functions here that
helped music sound better through
headphones which we appreciate it
there's also automatic volume limiting
if the phone thinks you're listening to
music too loud which we didn't
appreciate at all please please please
let us do what we want one of Motorola's
big focuses with its new smart phone
line has been in endurance and battery
life on the razor M was quite good we
were able to get more than a day's use
on a single charge right in line with
Motorola's claim of 20 hours of mixed
usage and that's without using the power
saving Smart Actions rules the razor M
isn't going to turn many heads sitting
as it does in the shadow of its more
notable siblings but it serves an
important function
it's a mid-range device that doesn't
sacrifice a lot in the way of features
or performance in order to get its price
down it sits well in the hand it feels
exceedingly well made and it runs
Android like a champ the software
modifications make Android better and
not worse and it lasts a long time on a
charge the razor M is proof positive
that it is possible to make a mid tier
smartphone feel in many respects like a
premium device it does the rebooted
razor brand proud in our opinion we give
the Motorola Droid Razr m an 8 out of 10
