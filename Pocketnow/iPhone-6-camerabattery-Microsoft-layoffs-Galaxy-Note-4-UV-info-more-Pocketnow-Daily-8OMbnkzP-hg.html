bigger battery the Galaxy Note 4 is
rumored to be much smarter than you
think and microsoft announces layoffs
and with that the death of the nokia X
I'm high Meadow iveta and I'm wondering
what else is Microsoft going to launch
tomorrow and kill the day after this is
poking out daily let's begin today with
the official news that are definitely
disappointing as Microsoft Satya Nadella
has just announced that he will lay off
15,000 people over the course of the
next year most of these people coming
from the Nokia mobile division that they
just acquired and yeah Microsoft is also
ditching the nokia X project or
repurposing it to be a Windows Phone
project which is really odd as the nokia
X had some future it's really sad to see
that Microsoft is going on the negative
route to try to solve its problems as
there are other issues that are in the
overhead Microsoft that could probably
change instead of having people lose
their jobs another official news that
are actually ending some of the
confusion that we had yesterday LG is
just announced the g3 beat which is the
entry level g3 aka the mini we don't
know if they're going to use the mini in
some markets and if they're going to use
the other names that we've heard in
other markets as well but yeah the g3
beat is a reality we should expect the
phone very soon listen search for full
details HOF specifications this is
actually not a bad phone in comparison
to all the mini phones that we saw from
LG previously now very interesting
change that is coming to the galaxy note
4 actually tips a lot of things rumors
have it that the company is going to
include a UV sensor on the phone and the
wait s health is going to work now is
that whenever it detects the UV rays are
too strong it'll suggest different
things that you can use in order to
avoid getting a sunburn aside from other
features that are going to be health
oriented with this new sensor
interesting we wonder exactly how is it
going to work with a case number one and
number two does this tip the fact of the
galaxy note 4 is going to be waterproof
hopefully that's going to be the case
stay tuned I've got some interesting
rumors coming from China when it comes
to the iphone 6 first of all that the
phone is going to have a 13-megapixel
has more our sensor from sony and by the
way apple has used sony sensors for the
iphone for the longest
I'm so that was expected but apparently
the reason why they're not going for the
newer 20 megapixel sensor is the size
constraints on the iphone 6 which is
interesting when you consider that's
going to be a much bigger phone but from
that the company is also going to add a
bigger battery 1810 milliamp hours
conversion to the 1560 milliamp hour
battery that we have on the iphone 5s
and yeah that could be cool it is a
bigger battery but then again is it is
also a bigger display so we don't know
how that's going to perform though the
a8 chip might have a lot to do with that
we'll see how that goes and finally for
the very interesting news of the day Tim
Cook was recently interviewed by The
Wall Street Journal regarding the whole
IBM partnership and his answers were
quite interesting in previous interviews
he's manifested that he uses an iPad for
eighty percent of the things that he
does during the day and that he doesn't
really need a computer for him the iPad
as everything that he needs and
according to him the reason for the IBM
partnership is because they want to
bring as many as a hundred applications
that will allow this to happen as well
for the ipad for other people as
obviously other people's needs are
different so yeah the partnership has
the purpose of making the iPad your only
computer which is what they've been
advertising for years but that leads you
to the question of the day have you ever
tried using the iPad for the day as your
only product and tells your experience
in the comments down below if you've
ever done so or give it a try and leave

I have tried and it doesn't work leave
