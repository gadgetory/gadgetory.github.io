and a sizable screen Google's Nexus 9 is
a great showcase for the latest version
of Android but with a higher than usual
price tag and a design best described as
nondescript is this truly the best
tablet for Android lovers and is it
worth your money I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow here to hopefully help answer
those questions in our Nexus 9 video
review there's an elephant in the room
so let's tackle it fit and finish from
the perspective of a nexus product this
is exactly what you'd expect a
featureless slab of soft touch built to
get out of the way of the software
Google wants to show off and that makes
sense but the Nexus 9 is also the first
tablet from fancy phone maker HTC in
almost four years and honestly you'd
never know it yeah there's a strip of
metal around the sides front-facing
speakers and interesting countersunk
camera lens and some cool color options
but in terms of look and feel this has a
lot more in common with last year's
Nexus 5 with the addition of a cheap
feeling flex - its smudge tastic back
cover I mean come on guys again it's a
comfortable design in a manageable size
but we can't help but be disappointed
that HTC wasn't able to bring more of
its signature high-end design to this
hardware if you're more of a fan of the
book then the cover the story gets much
more interesting the Nexus 9 breaks up
the Snapdragon monotony with a processor
from Nvidia called the Tegra k1 a 64-bit
chip using dual Denver cores and
supported by two gigs of RAM what's that
mean for performance we'll get to in a
second but for now we'll just say that
it's a mighty powerful slab of silicon
there's no microSD expansion here and
storage options are limited to 16 or 32
gigs or 11 or 25 if you want to be real
about it another slight disappointment
what space the Nexus 9 lacks in storage
it makes up for in display area like a
perfectly sized bowl of porridge the 8.9
inch IPS panel is just right allowing
for a chassis that's easy to hold even
one-handed while providing enough
display area to actually enjoy videos or
actually accomplish work it's black
levels are nothing to scream about and
its color is fine what's really notable
here is the four by three aspect ratio
and how well the new version of android
works with it
lollipop is the real star of the show
here and not just because the hardware
is so forgettable visually speaking
android 5.0 is the most significant the
most refreshing overhaul of Google's
operating system since 2011 Google put a
lot of TLC into the little things like
the coordinated animations when
unlocking the screen or the super quick
jump to monochrome when locking it
tapping items results in ripples and
pulling on a stopped list gives you
waves the fresh paint job on important
or central items gives the whole
interface a brighter friendlier look and
feel with an almost playful attitude
reflected even in the sound effect and
all this extra personality is
implemented without compromising
performance the more you use it the more
fun little touches you discover with
lollipop Google also addresses one of
our longest held complaints widgets the
janky misaligned mass of years past has
been replaced with the responsive design
that keeps everything organized pretty
well in both portrait and landscape
modes but you probably won't spend much
time in widescreen
because lollipop looks great in portrait
Google now and settings are prime
examples using a two column format to
display more info at a glance which
means you don't have to scroll as much
and the added area also gives apps like
the new Google calendar room to play
lest we praise our jobs away here there
are a few knits to pick the new
multitasking card view is nice and
portraits but feels like a waste in
landscape where a horizontal ribbon
seems the better choice
double tap to wake is a great add-on
given the mushy side keys but sometimes
it takes a few taps to work auto
brightness is so slow and indecisive
that you're better off disabling it
testing display levels manually and like
all mobile devices there are some
sluggish bits on this one multitasking
takes a few seconds to load sometimes
rotating from portrait to landscape is
also sometimes languid affair stress the
thing with a bunch of high demand games
in a row and it'll take some time to
redraw the homescreen minor stuff like
this doesn't really take away from the
slick bright beauty of the OS as a whole
but it is a tad concerning given all the
power under the hood here of course
we'll keep an eye on it for the next few
months and report on how much lag creeps
in in our usual after the buzz re review
sadly but predictably slick bright
beauty is not what you'll get from the
Nexus 9 camera on either side whether
you're using the 8 megapixel primary
camera or the 1.2 megapixel front faces
aren't likely to get much better than
fine Google's camera app is great on a
phone but it's clumsy
on a tablet manual exposure swings are
too severe focus drifts too easily and
the shutter doesn't fire until a few
beats after you hit the button while you
can get the occasional worthwhile photo
out of it the end results are never
consistently impressive you shouldn't be
relying on your tablet as a camera
anyway and the Nexus 9 reinforces
exactly why for some an Nvidia processor
is synonymous with gaming so we tried
out a wide range of titles on the Nexus
9 we're so used to snapdragon powered
phones and tablets that we get thrown
for a loop when one of our preferred
games doesn't work this isn't the Nexus
9 s fault per se
it's just a symptom of some developers
not coding for particular hardware but
compatibility is always something to
keep in mind if you're excited about
running a particular title on a new
device and oddly some games which ran
fine at first refused to run later on in
our testing so we don't know what to
make of that
the good news is that the Nexus 9 runs
many games with no trouble at all some
of these are showcased in Nvidia's Tegra
zone 2 app a clunky but useful way to
curate candidates when you've got a long
flight coming up and a bunch of game
buying money burning a hole in your
pocket
we tested flying games like shadow
strike and Red Bull Air Race adventure
titles like Iron Man 3 and Space
simulators like galaxies on fire - and
interstellar pilot most of these are
elaborate and demanding and we had to
restart the tablet between titles to
avoid crashes but as Spock would say
sauce for the goose that kind of thing
is par for the course with any mobile
device and when games ran gameplay was
excellent Google seems to have solved
the overheating issue with its latest
software update to the tablet does get
warm to the touch but not the finger
sweaty hot we experienced in our first
impressions pass during gameplay we get
a really nice earful of audio from the
twin boom sound speakers flanking the
display and that crosses over to
movie-watching - front firing Audio is
where it's at and HTC as usual has
delivered that we wish these were
machined speaker holes as they are the
slots gather a lot of dust as for how
well sixteen by nine media plays on a
four by three screen well yeah the
letterboxing is a little annoying if
you're paying attention to it but put on
a good enough movie or turn the lights
down a little and you probably won't
notice too much
sauce for the goose mr. Saavik the odds
will be even finally how many movies can
you watch before you'll need to plug in
HTC claims up to nine and a half hours
on the 6700 milliamp hour battery and
while we haven't had the time to watch
the full Daniel Craig James Bond trilogy
to test that promise it's an easy one to
believe we got over six hours of screen
on time on our first charge and even
more on subsequent cycles most of them
with very heavy use with more judicious
use it's easy to see the Nexus 9 lasting
two or even three days between charges
longer if you use the new battery saver
built into Android 5 when I first laid
hands on the Nexus 9 several weeks ago
my initial thought was this is it it
seemed like a huge missed opportunity
for Google to use HTC as the builder but
shackle it to such a dull and
predictable design like calling in a
world-class chef to cook you Kraft
macaroni and cheese and I still feel
that way about the hardware it's
powerful it's comfy and the boom sound
is great but overall it's absolutely
nothing special as others have said the
real star here is Android 5.0 and where
the hardware is a letdown the software
is just brilliant lollipop is the first
version of Android I'd feel comfortable
recommending to both a tech reluctant
parent and a tech obsessed colleague
it's friendly yet powerful unique but
familiar and on a four by three screen
it absolutely shines given that strange
combination of stellar software and
ho-hum hardware the end result is worth
buying there's more positive than
negative here and this is a solid
advancement of the Nexus family but even
though it's priced in line with other
high-end Android tablet 399 is a steep
price to pay for the compromises you're
getting in design display storage and
even performance so you'll definitely
want to wait for the price to come down
