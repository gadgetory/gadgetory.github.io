pocket now calm and this is a software
review of the Samsung Focus a windows
phone 7 device on AT&amp;amp;T let's get to it
so in this video we want to focus on the
software hardware interplay and overall
how Windows Phone 7 feels on the Samsung
Focus we're going to be covering windows
phone 7 in detail on pocketnow.com but
in this video we're going to stick to
just the samsung focus experience for
windows phone 7 so this device is all
about the screen it's got the same four
inch Super AMOLED display that you'll
find on the Samsung Galaxy S series of
devices what that means is that colors
are extremely vibrant blacks are super
rich and outdoor screen visibility's
fantastic when you turn on this phone
for the first time before you even get
into the operating system you're going
to be impressed because the quality of
the screen is just top-notch and the
sensitivity of the screen is top notch
in fact when we went to New York to play
with all the windows phone 7 launch
devices we found that the Samsung Focus
had the highest screen sensitivity of
all the all the devices which means that
it's effortless to go from side to side
to pinch to zoom which we're going to go
through in a minute to jump in and out
of applications and the device feels
fast despite having 256 megabytes of RAM
the other launch devices have around 512
the samsung focus seems to be one of the
fastest devices that is coming out for
windows phone 7 so let's talk more about
the speed of this device I'm going to
jump in and out of a bunch of
applications and you're going to see how
the focus doesn't sputter or slow down
so I'm going to go into internet
explorer jump back out swipe over here
go into Adobe Reader I'm not even
letting the applications load fully and
things are just moving really really
fast here we go into the pictures
application this is really where things
get super fluid and I've taken a lot of
pictures so we go into all camera roll
turn it over to the side so we get the
landscape orientation or actually in
this particular view you don't get
landscape orientation only when you dive
into an actual picture so let's go into
this picture it's already in landscape
orientation we can slide to the left
here and we can zoom in
swiping panning moving around on the
screen on this device is buttery smooth
thanks in part to the sensitivity screen
and thanks in part to really good
software optimization windows 17 is fast
and this device has the power to make it
feel fast so let's swipe over here find
a nice picture zoom in super buttery
smooth the picture clears up very fast
it's got a lot of power especially when
you're looking at pictures and even on
the web so let's go to pocketnow.com see
what it's like to browse around on the
site there so this is the mobile site
and we're going to go down to the
desktop view and let that load up well
that loads up a little note on Windows
Phone 7 in terms of system notifications
it's really interesting because
Microsoft has hit in the system
notifications at the top the only way to
see them is to tap then you get Wi-Fi
cellular and battery status it's an
interesting idea because you have to
stop and wonder do I actually have to
see that stuff because at first it's
really weird not seeing your battery
status all the time it's kind of a nice
feeling it really lets you focus on what
you're doing a little bit more although
we nice to have a setting to keep that
stuff displayed all the time and to have
a percentage battery meter so you know
really where you stand on battery life
so here we have pocketnow.com loaded
flick scrolling is super fast you never
see checkerboard and Windows Phone 7 or
at least I cabin and this is a very
graphically intense page there are
probably a dozen or more pictures if we
go over to landscape we get this really
fantastic full screen view and the only
way to access the controls in the
program would be to go back into
portrait but you gotta really appreciate
that this full screen view covers the
whole screen there's nothing on the
dislikes of the website and a little
scroll bar once in a while so here we
can tap on another story and it's going
to load it and you do get a loading bar
as it goes across on the top and as
mentioned we can go into portrait screen
rotation speed isn't the greatest but it
really doesn't matter because while the
page is loading you're probably going to
want to switch it into landscape there
are a few options that we can choose
from here so we can go to settings and
some of the options appear after the
site has
loading so we'll let it finish loading
reaction to force it to stop and now we
can do a few things we can share page we
can search within the page which is nice
pin it to the Start screen or go into
settings and settings there really isn't
that much you can change you can tell it
to choose the mobile site or the desktop
site delete history and things like that
tab management is fantastic we talked
about this in previous videos you can
load one tab while looking at another
for example the iphone doesn't let you
do this and to close the tab you just
tap on it to open it it brings it
forward very very quickly so we can be
really fast at launching different
websites here we go to engadget then we
can go back to the tab manager we can go
to say gizmodo or say there we go and by
the time because moto is done loading
and gadget has already begun and it will
continue to load in the background
because moto is finished while we were
looking at engadget just a really smooth
browsing experience yes it doesn't have
html5 or flash support but that's not
the biggest deal in the world you can
get around the internet quite fine
without those technologies supported now
by the way there will be a YouTube
player in the marketplace so the idea is
that when you go to a website that has
an embedded YouTube video you tap on
that and it opens the YouTube player
like you know the iphone or like android
2.1 and below so you will be able to get
flash video in terms of youtube there
now let's talk about the typing
experience because obviously the samsung
focus does not have a slide out keyboard
or any sort of keyboard so the on-screen
keyboard really matters let's go into
messaging i'm going to start a new
message here now with this 4-inch really
sensitive display keyboard the keyboard
experience is quite good on the samsung
focus so if i do a little test here with
a little bit of practice you can get
really fast in fact I find this keyboard
to be better than the iphone's keyboard
which in my personal opinion is the best
on-screen keyboard that there is so now
Windows Phone 7 in my mind takes the
place or takes the title is the best
on-screen keyboard experience and you
can go into landscape to get keys there
are a little bit wider although what
you'll find is that it doesn't actually
take up the entire screen you still get
a little Black Bart here in a little
black bar here that is kind of to keep
things symmetrical it would seem so we
go back into portrait and
have you know the taller keys here now
something that has been interesting to
get used to is the emoticon button I've
actually been using it a lot more than I
thought I would this gives you a wide
variety of smiley faces but it's really
handy to have it there because in a text
message an email you really can't
express emotion obviously and you can do
so with a one of these many many
emoticons some of which you probably
have never seen before but it's quite
handy to have that button there in
Windows Phone 7 now samsung focus
includes a wide variety of AT&amp;amp;T
applications which are removable by the
way and the way you remove them in case
you want to you know free your device
here as you tap and hold and you go to
uninstall and it goes off the screen
within a second I don't know if it's
actually uninstalling or if it's just
taking it off the start screen and
writing a part of the disk as you know
free but it happens very fast and we're
going to cover all the AT&amp;amp;T applications
in a separate video but you get the
Navigator you get u-verse mobile which
is like a mobile TV service you get
family finder and there's several other
different ones that you can uninstall if
you don't want them beyond that the
samsung focus has the typical windows
phone 7 application like alarm calendar
and calculator and they all work as
expected what is a little bit different
here and I'll get to it down here is the
now application which is basically a
samsung hub a kind of like HTC hub it
gives you the weather and it actually
has a sub weather application you can
swipe to the right to see your forecast
you can swipe to the right here to see
news and change the settings if you want
to really determine what kind of news
you want and one more time you get
stocks now most people are going to not
use this application and have a separate
application for weather for news and for
stocks because it doesn't really make
sense to put it all under one roof but
the marketplace right now doesn't have
that many or any news weather or staff
app so it's a matter of waiting this is
a good way to start and it has a nice
interface to it has the nice Metro
interface and if you pin it to your
Start screen it's actually a 2 tile wyd
item and unfortunately it's
live tile it doesn't show you any
information so you get this kind of wide
tile taking up all the space on your
Start screen what it could very well
have been just a single size tile like
those other ones so overall the samsung
focus is one of the fastest windows
phone 7 devices it has a very pleasing
to the eye screen with the Super AMOLED
has fantastic colors great contrast
fantastic outdoor spring visibility and
the device itself is really fast I
haven't run into a situate into a
situation where the device has become
slow or frozen it constantly keeps up
despite having a little bit less ram
than the other launch devices for
windows phone 7 so that was a look at
the software experience on the Samsung
Focus with Windows Phone 7 if you liked
the video please thumbs up and check
pocketnow.com for the full samsung focus
review we will talk about battery life
more on performance camera quality and a
lot of other stuff thanks for watching
