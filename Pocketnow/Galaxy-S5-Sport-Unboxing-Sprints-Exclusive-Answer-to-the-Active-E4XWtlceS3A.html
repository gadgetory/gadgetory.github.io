review on the galaxy s5 galaxy s5 active
and galaxy s5 prime and now it's time to
start the clock on another review cycle
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and
this is the Samsung Galaxy s5 sport for
Sprint let's unbox it and see what's
inside it's been a while since we've
unboxed a sprint device and their new
branding approach is interesting whether
you dig the color scheme or not is up to
you but there's no question based on the
messaging here that the galaxy s5 sport
is being pitched to active people but
even sporty folks need a straightforward
unboxing experience and that's exactly
what you're going to get here the phone
is the first thing you see of course and
if you happen to catch today's PocketNow
weekly podcast you already got a sneak
peek no screen protector to peel but
there's plenty of packaging in the box
as always everything from the Quick
Start Guide to the included earbuds
which we always love to see by the way
to the charging and data cable and the 2
amp charger is protected by a glossy
layer of new feeling plastic truly it's
just like the galaxy s5 unboxing
experience but with a very different box
the device itself doesn't stray far from
established norms either on the spec
sheet it's much the same as its stock
cousins like the active it's got a USB
2.0 port down below instead of the 3.0
jack on the regular s5 and it's got
physical home back and menu keys but it
doesn't carry over the convenience key
of 80 and T's beefy model that said the
s5 Sport is significantly heavier than
the stock s5 and it's dimpled back plate
is very rubbery and much easier to grip
than any s5 we've handled the bigger
differences are in software sprint
hasn't been shy at all about loading the
sport width and shall we say bonus apps
and features while it's not uncommon for
Galaxy s5 devices to arrive with only
about 10 gigs free of the 16 gigs
onboard you really feel it here with
Sprint's liberal slathering of bloat
there's nothing subtle about it but
we'll try it all out and report back
with our thoughts on what's useful and
what's not in our video review coming
next week
let us know what you want to see in that
review leave a comment down below with
your questions about the galaxy s5 sport
