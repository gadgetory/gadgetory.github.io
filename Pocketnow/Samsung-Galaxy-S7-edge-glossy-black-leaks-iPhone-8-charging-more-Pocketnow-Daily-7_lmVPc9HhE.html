edge and glossy black in its full glory
other leaked images have Huawei
investing heavily on curved displays and
believe it or not the iPhone 8 might
bring a change in its charging
technology I'm Jaime Rivera and thank
you for your feedback over yesterday's
animations on the video we would love to
know more about your feedback for
today's as well there's a sparking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals we did not like Verizon taking
over the exclusivity of the Google pixel
but this deal is compelling you can get
the 32 gigabyte variant for just $10 a
month if you sign up to a leasing
program for 24 months and if you go for
the hundred and twenty-eight gigabyte
variant that's just the theme dollars a
month that is insane and during those
two years you will be getting Android
software updates galore so I would go
for it and speaking of Verizon other
deals that are more focused on Best Buy
include the Moto G foreplay which is the
prepaid phone the Verizon is offering
for just $50 and there are a ton of
Samsung tablets on Best Buy right now
that are starting at 70 bucks $90 that
is just crazy and even though these
tablets aren't great hey a tablet for
your kids that's a really good deal now
even though we don't believe that Apple
is going to make the move into wireless
charging KGI securities is famous for
their rumors and tips and the cording to
trusted sources the iPhone 8 will
include some sort of wireless charging
now if you think of it it makes a lot of
sense people are really hating on Apple
over the whole dongle mentality so that
would make a ton of sense if also Apple
would figure out a way to not force us
to leave our phones that have had that's
the part I don't like about wireless
charging now let's talk about Huawei the
company has made an amazing splash this
year with some really great dual camera
phones and that all started with the p9
in its whole like a branding but that is
moving forward we've got some leaked
images of the Huawei p10 we see the dual
cameras but what makes this phone
awesome is the dual edge display we saw
it in the Porsche design of the mate 9
so it does seem that that is the way to
go for a while way going forward and we
love it and finally the very hot news
they have to do with Samsung and it's
glossy black Galaxy s7 edge we reported
the news yesterday today we have leaked
images of the phone and the changes are
mainly the fact that it's true black in
both glass variants and then on the
Border's everything is a matte black
just like in the iPhone 7 plus or iPhone
7
and this is interesting mainly because
well it's weird for Samson to be
announcing products so late we still
don't know when we're getting this
product but it does lead me to the
question of the day even that's a full
glossy black glory would you go for this
galaxy s7 edge or would you wait for the
Galaxy s8 in my case I would wait for
the Galaxy s8 but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
