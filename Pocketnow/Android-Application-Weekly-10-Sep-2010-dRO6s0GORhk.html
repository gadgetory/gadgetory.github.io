Pagano calm and this is another episode
of the android application weekly in
which we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
application is called jewels and it is
free on the android market and it's kind
of like a bejeweled clone for android
device so we can just go to a new game
here and we have three different modes
we can play normal mode a timeout at
infinite mode so i'm just going to go to
normal mode and the object of the game
is pretty simple what you want to do is
arrange these jewels in either groups of
three or higher to get points and this
progress bar at the bottom will move to
the next level when you've reached the
correct number of points this game is
called raging thunder too and you can
either play multiplayer by signing up
for a free account or you can play
single player by yourself of course and
there's two versions those lite version
which is free of course on the android
market and the full version which is
four dollars and ninety-nine cents so
let's get started here and the controls
are pretty simple you can either select
to use the accelerometer or the
on-screen controls of course you also
have to use the brake and boost if
you're gonna use the accelerometer and
this is a pretty advanced game so you
will need to check with your device to
make sure it's capable of running it
this application is called ringdroid and
it does a free ringtone maker through
the android market so it's pretty cool
because you can select exactly where you
would like your ringtone to start and
where you would like to end you can also
zoom in on the sound file if you like or
you can zoom out the cool thing about
this is it allows you to select exactly
where you want it to start so I have
don't stop believing by journey and the
best part about this song is the ending
so we'll just play that and that's why I
like my ring from start saw like to just
pause this and save and now i have my
ringtone on my device Google Shopper is
a free application on the android market
and it's a great program if you want to
compare prices of products or if you
want to search for things online so you
can either search by image voice or you
can type your search I'm going to select
voice search cocoa puffs and now it's
found my item that I liked and I can see
it as many different local stores here
I'm a search for another item will go
back and we search for image this time
and it will scan the barcode or you can
also scan the photo in there we have it
so now I will now bring up the item and
I can either purchase this or look at it
more online tunein is a free radio
application for your android device and
there's hundreds of radio stations on
this applications so if I want to look
for local radio I can go here and if we
use my gps or the cell phone proximity
to find the radio stations in my area i
can also go for music and select my type
of genre let's say I wanted to select
metal and rock and now I can listen to
any one of these radio stations for free
on my Android device and there are even
talk and sports stations so this has
been another episode of the android
application weekly and we'll treeview
five applications in 30 seconds each so

comments down below we like to hear what
you're saying and to get the download
