details for the Galaxy s8 the iPhone
accessed it to include some curves but
conservative ones and there are some
interesting deals if you get the LG G 6
I'm Jaime Rivera and if there are any
volunteers help me shovel the car out of
the snow that'd be nice
the sparking Hut's Haley the official
news today begin with deals those of you
in the market for one of the best
smartphones of 2017 so far the LG G six
well LG is currently offering one very
sweet one you're still gonna pay the
same price for the phone but it seems
that the company is also bundling a
Google home in the box and that is a
very very good deal considering the
price tag of the Google home so I would
suggest you learn more on the link in
the description so remember those rumors
of the 1 + 3 T in black they happened it
was announced today it's 1 + 3 T in
black in conjunction with Colet or kolay
or however you pronounce that in french
as this phone is going to be exclusive
to the french market there will only be
250 units that makes me just scratch my
head because if there was one thing that
I would have loved there's a black
variant of the 1 plus 3t please want to
listen and all those rumors of a
possible Nokia flagship might take
longer than we expect we hear some
positive rumors or should I say credible
rumors that claim that there is a Nokia
7 and Nokia 8 in the works the problem
is these devices apparently will stick
to full HD displays and snapdragon 660
so if you are planning to wait for a
very hot nokia flagship would specs in
the whole nine yards
yeah oh and now let's talk about the
iPhone X iPhone 8 iPhone edition
whatever you want to call that thing
thing is there are some trusted sources
that are claiming that even though we
heard rumors that the phone wasn't
getting a curved display a few days ago
apparently it will Samsung will be
providing curved oh let's think about it
is apparently they won't have the
aggressive curves that we currently see
on the samsung galaxy s7 edge meaning it
will be curved but for no particular
reason whatsoever it'll just be curved
that's interesting and finally the very
hot news is they have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy S a we've got two very
interesting rumors but the company kind
of confirms first of all apparently this
phone will have some sort of 3d touch
force touch it seems that whenever you
press the home button since we're now
going into software buttons
apparently the harder you press or the
lighter it will have different
contextual options just all great the
other rumor is that apparently the name
of the digital assistant will be big
speed why is it going to be called that
way I have no clue but it's better than
Siri which actually means something in
Japanese
anyways bixby is going to be the
probable name the question for today
would be let me know now that you have
the option to get a digital assistant
from Google the Google assistant pretty
much in any Android phone at least the
current ones what would you pick would
you try Samsung's bixby or would you go
for the Google assistant in my case
because the Google assistant is still
not ready it's still half-baked it still
doesn't talk to a lot of third-party
services meaning it doesn't really
assist you for anything more than just
the task or mapping you somewhere I
would totally try Samsung services but I
feel that Google's has more promise
leave us a comment down below we'd love
