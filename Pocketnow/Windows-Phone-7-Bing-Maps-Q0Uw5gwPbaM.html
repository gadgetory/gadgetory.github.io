pocket now calm and this is a look at
the big map application in Windows Phone
7 let's get to it ok before getting
started we have to mention that this is
not final Windows Phone 7 hardware or
software we're just showing you how it
is now so let's talk about the Bing Maps
application this is a very similar
application to what you get on other
platforms from Google Maps and from Bing
so it allows you to search for places
nearby and allows you to navigate it
allows you to see traffic and all that
sort of stuff so let's talk about that
now
on the most basic level it is a Maps
application so it lets you see you know
the roads around you and what's going on
and how to get to certain places we can
also turn on an aerial view just like
you can do in Google Maps and in Bing
Maps on other platforms so here's an
aerial view we'll go back to the area or
we'll go back to the maps view and turn
on traffic although traffic's already
turned on so just like you get in the
other maps applications you're taking a
road trip you can take a look at the
major highways and see green which means
that there is no congestion and then you
get red which means that there is
congestion in certain areas so let's say
you want to search for a certain
location within this area that you're
looking at on the map you can also dial
down by your location by pressing on the
diamond - right here but we're just
gonna search within the confines of the
Harrisburg area here I'm going to press
the hardware button and search for
pharmacy and this uses the talmy voice
recognition pharmacy so it's thinking
and it gets it right pretty much 100% of
the time which is quite nice so now Bing
Maps is going to drop different flags or
labels you could call it showing where
the different pharmacies are in this
area on the map of course we could have
done this for my location but we're
doing it in this area now there's a few
things you can do from here you can tap
on any of the results and you can see
the pharmacy name if you tap on that
you're taking into the information
screen and this would work great for a
restaurant because you can actually see
reviews within the application of that
particular area and there's probably not
going to be
a review of a pharmacy although there
seems to be one right there we can swipe
to the right here's another cool feature
you can see nearby places to the place
you're looking for so if you're looking
for hotels and you want to know okay is
there a grocery store nearby it's that
are there restaurants nearby you can use
this screen to determine that and then
if we swipe to the right again and that
metro like interface we are back to the
beginning back to about now another
really cool thing that you can do with
the Bing Maps application is pin places
to your Start screen down here there's a
little pin icon if we pin it we now have
a new shortcut on our Start screen so
this adds to the list of things that you
can pin to your Start screen you can add
contacts links to programs or
applications and also internet favorites
pretty cool so let's go back into that
particular location that we just saved
another thing you can do from the screen
is send the location via email or text
message so let's go back to the Maps
application okay so we just searched for
pharmacy now another way you can look at
this information is through the results
for you so we can go to results list and
it'll show you a nice comprehensive list
of all of the pharmacies in the area
without having the map view just another
way to look at things so let's say we
want to go to this location we go back
to the previous screen and we can
navigate to that area so let's do that
we're going to hit the little navigation
button here and it's going to start in
let's start in Philadelphia and we're
gonna end up in East Berlin pharmacy
near Harrisburg so it's computing the
directions and here we go in a really
cool display for navigating it's not
voice-guided navigation but it works
quite well what you do is you tap along
and it will show you with this nice
animation how you should be going and
the map will actually change and you can
zoom in and zoom out from this little
map tile up here really cool so we're
just moving around on our way to the
pharmacy you can also change from
driving directions to walking directions
here and of course it'll take a lot
longer to walk across the state then to
drive let's go back see if there's any
other options we missed there are
couple of settings we can determine if
it's using your location or not so that
was a look at being the maps for Windows
Phone 7 of course this is not fine I'm
sure there will be other features rolled
into this application when the platform
actually launches but so far so good it
works quite well it's fast it allows you
to pin locations to your Start screen
which is pretty cool
so please thumbs up this video if you

smartphone videos thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
