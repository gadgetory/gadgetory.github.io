now calm and this is a look at the bings
map application in Windows Phone 7 let's
get to it ok before getting started we
have to mention that this is not final
windows phone 7 hardware or software
we're just showing you how it is now so
let's talk about the Bing Maps
application this is a very similar
application to what you get on other
platforms from google maps and from
being so it allows you to search for
places nearby and allows you to navigate
it allows you to see traffic and all
that sort of stuff so let's talk about
that now on the most basic level it is a
Maps application so it lets you see you
know the roads around you and what's
going on and how to get to certain
places we can also turn on an aerial
view just like you can do in google maps
and in bing maps on other platforms so
here's an aerial view well go back to
the area or we'll go back to the maps
view and turn on traffic although
traffic's already turned on so just like
you get in the other maps applications
you're taking a road trip you can take a
look at the major highways and see green
which means that there is no congestion
and then you get red which means that
there is congestion in certain areas so
let's say you want to search for a
certain location within this area that
you're looking at on the map you can
also dial down by your location by
pressing on the diamond to right here
but we're just going to search within
the confines of the Harrisburg area here
I'm going to press the hardware button
and search for pharmacy and this uses
the Talmud voice recognition pharmacy so
it's thinking and it gets it right
pretty much a hundred percent of the
time which is quite nice so now bing
maps is going to drop different flags or
labels you could call it showing where
the different pharmacies are in this
area on the map of course we could have
done this for my location but we're
doing it in this area now there's a few
things you can do from here you can tap
on any of the results and you can see
the pharmacy name if you tap on that
you're taking into the information
screen and this would work great for a
restaurant because you can actually see
reviews within the application of that
particular area and there's probably not
going to be
a review of a pharmacy although there
seems to be one right there we can swipe
to the right here's another cool feature
you can see nearby places to the place
you're looking for so if you're looking
for hotels and you want to know okay is
there a grocery store nearby is that are
the restaurants nearby you can use this
screen to determine that then if we
swipe to the right again and that metro
like interface we are back to the
beginning back to about now another
really cool thing that you can do with
the Bing Maps application is pin places
to your Start screen down here there's a
little pin icon if we pin it we now have
a new shortcut on our Start screen so
this adds to the list of things that you
can pin to your Start screen you can add
contacts links to programs or
applications and also internet favorites
pretty cool so let's go back into that
particular location that we just saved
another thing you can do from the screen
is send the location via email or text
message so let's go back to the maps
application okay so we just searched for
pharmacy now another way you can look at
this information is through the results
for you so we can go to results list and
it'll show you a nice comprehensive list
of all of the pharmacies in the area
without having the map view just another
way to look at things so let's say we
want to go to this location we go back
to the previous screen and we can
navigate to that area so let's do that
we're going to hit the little navigation
button here and it's going to start in
let's start in Philadelphia and we're
going to end up in East Berlin pharmacy
near Harrisburg so it's computing the
directions and here we go in a really
cool display for navigating it's not
voice guided navigation but it works
quite well what you do is you tap along
and it will show you with this nice
animation how you should be going and
the map will actually change and you can
zoom in and zoom out from this little
map tile up here really cool so we're
just moving around on our way to the
pharmacy you can also change from
driving directions to walking directions
here and of course it'll take a lot
longer to walk across the state then to
drive let's go back see if there's any
other options we missed there
a couple of settings we can determine if
it's using your location or not so that
was a look at being the maps for windows
phone 7 of course this is not fine I'm
sure there will be other features rolled
into this application when the platform
actually launches but so far so good it
works quite well it's fast it allows you
to pin locations to your Start screen
which is pretty cool so please thumbs up
