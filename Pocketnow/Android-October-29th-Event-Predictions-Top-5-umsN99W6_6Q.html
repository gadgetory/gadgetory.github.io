just a couple of days of wind there are
tons of rumors in the internet so far
I'm high meloetta for Parker now calm
let's round up our top five predictions
and what we expect google to launch on
October 29 number five is a read them to
the nexus 7 line some of her that Google
is going to drop the a gigabyte Nexus 7
and others have heard the Google is
going to drop the price on that nexus 7
just 100 bucks others have heard that
the 16 gig model is going to drop its
price to 200 bucks and then we're going
to have the new 32 gigabyte rumored
Nexus 7 go for two hundred fifty dollars
we've also heard of the cellular capable
nexus 7 being launched though we still
don't know the price but again this is
not the best time to buy a nexus 7 just
wait till Monday number for a nexus 10
it's about time that Google builds their
own 10-inch tablet and we've got enough
leaks and photos to confirm that it's
made by samsung and then it brings a lot
of innovative specs that are not seen in
the market yet now time will tell why
that tablet is so ugly but it could just
be that it's made to be different number
3 android 4.2 that we still don't know
what pastry they're going to call it by
think of anything that starts with a k
but people are speculating that this
version of android will allow developers
to port apps easier from smart phones to
tablets and others are saying that
apparently this new version of android
it enhances it in a way that fits better
into tablets some people are talking
about multiple users and other things
that we saw in jellybean that weren't
really implemented so what do you think
will come with android 4.2 start with
the name leave us a comment number two
is an LG nexus 4 though i'm still not
even sure why this is in the script
anymore i feel the phone as a year old
already we've seen leaks photos there's
been a review there were some really
good specs on the phone and sadly some
underwhelming ones like very little
storage and no expandable options the
world waiting for google to surprises
and tell us no this was just a prototype
the LG Nexus 4 is actually as good as
the optimus G but we'll see and finally
our top number one prediction for
Google's Android event on monday is
something we haven't seen before just
think about it it's either that or rules
terrible at handling leaks it feels like
there's something missing in the puzzle
because we heard the league's about
Google working on
different nexus smartphones with
different OEMs we also saw that fake
picture of the Sony Xperia Nexus extra
whatever they wanted to call it and it
just seems like if either Google's
building something else or there's going
to be a really boring event so that
leads me to the question of the day
forget about our top five predictions
and I want you to focus on whatever you
would like for google to launch on this
event I would love an HTC j butterfly
variant of a Nexus device but leave us a
comment down below our own branded
minuman will be live covering the event
which happens on monday october twenty
nine to ten a.m. eastern so make sure
you follow us on Paco now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm high metairie better
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
