with a glass back believe it or not
dancing might revive the Espen earlier
than expected but not on smartphones and
sluggish times our tablets it seems that
Apple continues to reign supreme I'm
high Meadow iveta and the only thing
stopping me from starting to celebrate
my weekend is the next few hours on
Premiere Pro business parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
and Super Bowl Sunday those of you in
the market for a tablet that can replace
your laptop the surface pro 4 continues
to be one of my favorite toys right now
it is again two hundred dollars off in
the language of description and then you
can also get yourself an NFL type cover
in the bundle yeah that's great other
very interesting official news have to
do with the drop in tablet market share
believe it or not I pads are down nearly
3 million units when compared to last
year but still apple continues to reign
supreme in the market having twenty one
percent of the market share pretty much
it just shows you how much Cupertino has
been able to calling on to that even
with the steep price tags of the ipad
pro line up anyways now how about if we
talk about roaming in the European Union
and I believe that's not going to
include Britain or at least I don't know
but the news are that we've been talking
about how Europe is moving into no
roaming fees across the European Union
apparently certain documents have been
signed today meaning that carriers
should be ready by June fifteenth for
you to be able to roam freely and that's
great news of your in Europe hopefully
that's going to happen in every other
region going forward now the spotlight
over to the samsung galaxy tab s 3 bs2
has probably been one of my favorite
android tablets on the market mainly
because of its good looks them that
would be the huawei mediapad and three
would be the second one because of its
speakers now for those of you that are
wondering what's going to happen with
its feature we were thinking that we
would see something a tifa but instead
it seems that we're going to wait until
later and apparently one of the major
features that it's going to include is a
fully functional s-pen meaning a record
digitizer
everything in addition to an optional
keyboard I think that would make a great
selling point let's see where we go and
finally a very hot nooses they have to
do with the LG G six and some of its
probable new features if you remember
when I saw the HTC you ultra at CES in
vegas on the things that i mentioned was
whoa that secondary screen it's like
looking at a b20 and apparently LG is
going to do a little more of that
backwards now it seems that there will
be a glass back on the LG G six we've
got some leaked images and yeah it looks
pretty much like the HTC you ultra that
is good in my opinion but it leads me to
the question of the day what do you
think about smartphones OEM is all
moving into glass packs in my case I
never did like it in the iphone 4 iphone
4s I feel Samsung has been an amazing
job with it but still it's not my
favorite material male because of the
smudges leave us a comment down below is
