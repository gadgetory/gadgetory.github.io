checked it out yesterday as part of the
galaxy note 3 reveal in the launch event
we've got another one here we're not
going to put it on our wrist but we are
going to tell you how it compares to the
pebble smartwatch let's check it out so
we've posted a piece on pocket now
yesterday about how the pebble and the
Galaxy gear are for two entirely
different people and that's completely
true that starts right with the body
here I mean you're seeing this very very
thin very slender a fairly lightweight
device and while the galaxy gear is
actually lighter and more slim than we
expected it is significantly larger
there's no question about it we'll get
to that other important difference in
the second want to make clear though
this is a security measure this is not
part of the watch the watch is actually
not this dick it ends right here just so
you're aware of that part of the tether
and charging mechanism let's get to that
other major difference and that is the
display here pebbles can never remember
if it's igor epaper but i'm sure some
smart people in the comments will be
able to tell me something about that
anyway this is the pebble that I've been
carrying since this is my Kickstarter
edition version which came in here's the
back there the room just so you can see
what the thing looks like on the back
pebble itself a very simple product
based around this monochrome display
with backlighting yes these are the
various spaces you can get it also
displays notifications and when you have
to see text it's this you know decidedly
low res kind of no frills system that
actually works very very well probably
because of its simplicity and because
it's a pretty good product the Galaxy
gear until we review it in full we won't
know how good a product it actually is
wake up the screen there but as you can
see a very very different display this
is a color display that has fully
backlit it's i believe it's 320 x 320
and you can see already just going
through the home screens first of all
it's a touchscreen you don't there's
only one button on the device and it's
on the side compared to pebbles three
button interface and all button
interface by the
that's no touchscreen and the the galaxy
gear much closer to a SmartWatch to a
full device that you wear on your wrist
it's all gesture driven you can go
through the UI like this the back
gesture is from the top down and also a
darn sight more hardware here in the
form of a camera to shoot 720p video if
you want or if you don't you got stills
this one by the way it should I should
mention both of these devices depend on
other hardware to operate this one can
be paired to a samsung galaxy note 3
which we showed you the other day or in
this case it's paired to a galaxy note
10 one just to show you the
functionality of that camera we talked
about will just happen here and there's
the viewfinder obviously nothing like
that as possible we're going to roll
some video here and here's just just to
show you what's what's capable possible
with this thing obviously no such
capability on the on the pebble galaxy
gear definitely following in samsung's
pattern of incorporating many more
features than then possibly anyone would
ask for but we will have to see and
here's the absent of one commonality
though which will probably use this to
close out third party apps you can write
them for pebble you can write them for
the galaxy gear and as you can see here
there are no shortage of them on this
device but we're going to take a closer
look at the galaxy gear as soon as we
get one end have a look at our existing
pebble video and our other coverage on
that device and we'll do a proper
comparison in the pocket now review
studios when we have the chance but for
now this has been michael fisher with
pocket now that's an Sanda notes behind
the camera this is the samsung booth
we've got a lot more coming up stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
