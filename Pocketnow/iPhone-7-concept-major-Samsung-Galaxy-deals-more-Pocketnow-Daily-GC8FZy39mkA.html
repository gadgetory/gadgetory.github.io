future smartphone windup might look like
Samsung ups the deal ante by giving you
some major deals to buy a smartphone and
Microsoft just got odd with its Cortana
implementation on Android I'm hi meri
behna and why is it that Tuesday's are
less annoying even though they follow
Monday this is parking out daily the
official news to me begin again with
best buy and now Samsung as a here this
if you buy any of the new galaxy black
ships you know galaxy note5 galaxy s6
edge+ or any of these phones on either
verizon AT&amp;amp;T or sprint for two-year
contract obviously you will be getting
none other than a 32 inch LED TV from
Samsung yeah I know what are you doing
watching this video here in the market
for a phone right now this is the time I
mean for free TV that's just crazy now
as will the spotlight over to Microsoft
the company just made a ton of headlines
recently with the launch of Cortana on
Android and even more with the fact that
the hot word you don't hey Cortana would
work from certain screens which was
great up until now where the company has
just pushed the software update that
disables the feature the company doesn't
mention why but apparently it does
interfere with the microphone on certain
devices not necessarily sure which ones
are these but to just buyers beware that
update is for that particularly even
though most of the rumors of that LG
nuke Lenore ngoc loan processor mainly
have to do with how fast this processor
is how powerful it is the rumors that
this processor was going to be ready for
the g5 are actually not necessarily
going to happen we've got some very very
credible sources claiming that it won't
that we were still be getting a
Snapdragon here and that will probably
have to wait for it on the successor of
the lgb 10 say LGV 11 which is their
super premium phone wait for that and
the next year it seems that's incredible
how people responded to the whole apple
is launching the iphone 7 without
headphone jack news last week but as it
turns out it seems to be the way things
are happening credible sources claim in
addition to the fact that apple's
selling point to justify this
is that we will be getting much better
audio quality with this new iPhone
through the Lightning port and this is
actually a protocol that already exists
there are lightning headphones out there
that already exist as well so it seems
that this is what Apple is going to use
to market this new feature or the lack
thereof and finally the very hot news
today really have to do with the concept
and you've never seen me cover concepts
here in the parkin out daily but the
reason why we chose this one is because
of following the whole iphone without
headphones rumors we now see what the
iphone might look like in this designer
obviously considers the iphone without
the ugly stripes and stuff of the
antennas but probably the most
interesting part is showing us the
possibility of bluetooth enabled earpods
or you know an option for a lightning
port enabled ear pod and you know this
is probably one of the biggest questions
that people have is exactly what Apple
wants to do with a veto the headphones
that are included in the box which have
been legendary ever since the first
generation ipod so it does lead me to
the question of the day if you have to
choose up you know what would you want
in the box of your future smartphone
would you want smartphone makers to make
the move to bluetooth headsets or would
you prefer you know lightning port Mabel
headsets which provide better quality
audio in my case I prefer Bluetooth
headsets but that's just me leave us a
comment down below what would you prefer
friends as always you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
