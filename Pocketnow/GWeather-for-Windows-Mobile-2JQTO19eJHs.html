pocketnow.com and this is a quick look
at a new dedicated weather application
called G weather for Anna launch it from
here G weather lets you take a look at
the weather in multiple locations and
get more precise weather forecasts then
you would get in the touchflo 3d weather
panel so you have the animations you'll
see two dots down here so I can swipe to
the right to the other city I have in
here New York and if you want to get a
more detailed forecast you swipe down
and now there are five dots so I can go
right and i can go left friday october
second saturday october third and see
the weather conditions in the morning at
noon and in the in evening gives you the
wind speed the chance of rain and how
much rain there will be in the high and
low temperature which is pretty cool you
can easily add new locations by going
into the pop-up menu here so edit add
location and it will actually use GPS to
determine where you are and say you're
traveling you want to see what the
weather conditions will be like to
automatically find where you are or you
can just type in a new location here
let's put in Paris and hit the search
button and there we go Paris added
checkmark and now we have three dots
along the bottom now it'll also show you
whether in satellite conditions but
unfortunately only for Europe so we can
see the rain radar but only in Germany
which doesn't really doesn't really help
people in the US too much and satellite
image in Central Europe so a program
more so slanted towards people in Europe
though of course you could certainly use
it if you were in the US now the program
is free for 15 days although if you want
to use it full time it'll cost about 10
euro which is equal to about fifteen
dollars if it's important to you to have
an extended view of the weather in
cities that you travel this may be a
good value for you we'll post a link on
pacquiao com on how to get g whether
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
