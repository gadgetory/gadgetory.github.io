about the anti 2018 smartphone a device
that didn't follow all the trends or at
least most that we've seen last year
no not know edge to edge display no thin
and light build and this is what I would
call version 2 I'm he might be better
with pocket now and let's talk about the
sony xperia x z3 I love Sony headphones
and speakers but their popularity has
diminished over the year and what's odd
is that Sony has still managed to launch
more flagships than almost every other
company if I'm counting correctly the
Sony Xperia z3 would be like the third
or fourth flagship of the 2018 so let me
begin this video by telling you what I
like about this phone and it actually
begins with this build and the feel of
the phone we've got a glass on glass
front and back with curved borders and
an aluminum trim and this phone is
unapologetic about its thickness but
that actually comes in an advantage this
phone is very ergonomic in the hand in
front just assume that you're seeing a
pixel to excel but with a great screen
this 6 inch P OLED display Aquatics the
plus resolution is vibrant saturated and
yes very 2017 with its symmetrical
curves on each corner best of all there
are dual firing speakers that are plenty
loud and Sony's got this vibrating
gimmick that will vibrate whenever
you're playing music with the beat I
switch it off if I were you it seriously
just drains battery well the only thing
that's 2018 are the specifications we've
got a qualcomm snapdragon 845 4 gigs of
ram 64 gigs of expandable storage ip68
waterand does resistance fast charging
through USB C Qi wireless charging
capabilities and a 3300 milliamp hour
battery that actually performed really
well in our tests the right about now is
where I tell you already where I'm mixed
about this device and it again
with the photography experience this is
probably the only phone with a dedicated
camera button left which I love but
we've got a single camera in the front
in the back the primary is of 19
megapixels f/2 aperture 1.2 2 microns
and the wider 25 millimeter equivalent
photos are good during the day I wish I
could say remarkable given that most
flak ships they use Sony camera sensors
but it seems that Sony leaves itself
less and just provides a good experience
the aggressive AI and scene detection is
seriously hard to switch off and our
design choices like HDR only being
available in manual controls can make
the experience really cumbersome in
low-light the camera is good but not
great if you can hold the phone steady
at least and then there's this portrait
mode that's pretty much in existence and
sure there's only one camera sensor but
it tells you boquete mode photos are
coming you point you take the shot and
then it tells you that it wasn't able to
achieve it just like flat-out really bad
and then the selfie cameras of 13
megapixels f 1.9 aperture in a wider 23
millimeter equivalent with photos being
good the moment you switch off all the
beauty modes which are crazy aggressive
and set by default and then video
recording is good there's an intelligent
steady shot set by default on the
primary camera which is great but the
funny part is that this same feature is
not set by default for selfie video it
tells you that it's set on standard
stabilization which is not at all good
make sure you go through the settings
and set on intelligent steady shot on
the secondary camera which actually
doesn't affect the crop I do praise this
and then there's the software experience
I mean kudos to Sony for including
Android Pi at a time when it's hard to
find but why reinvent the wheel will the
user experience that's counterintuitive
it took me a day or two to figure out
how to remove the app tray button and
leave the gesture but then you swipe up
and it requires you to swipe left or
right for applications and those of you
looking for full screen gestures or the
pixel pill again this phone feels like
2017 so there's no option or I just
probably haven't found the setting
because those are all so convoluted now
once
figure out all these hurdles I do have
to be fair the user experience is fast
and fluid and it keeps things that I
care about from the Google experience
like the Google feed on the launcher but
of course there's no such thing as a
perfect product let me tell you what I
don't like about the phone and it starts
with the rest of the software gimmicks
like for example because there are
curves in this display there are edge
menus but the sensitivity is so off that
you will be so annoyed by day one you'll
end up doing what I did by just
switching them off and last but not
least let's queue in this button
arrangement I mean Sony did make some
changes and race the height of the
fingerprint scanner and the side buttons
when compared to the Xperia z2 but I
still find my finger and landing on the
camera lens instead of the fingerprint
scanner
I even wonder if my photos could have
been better if I cleaned the camera lens
every single time I try to unlock the
phone so to conclude what can I say
about the sony xperia x III it's a good
phone and if you're a Sony fan I have no
problem telling you to go buy this phone
it's comparable to 2018 flagships and
performance and specifications and it
gives us breathing room in this sea of
notched phones it does so at a cost this
phone is not any less expensive than
those flagships out there and I do
realize that there are certain design
choices that are not necessarily the
most popular so if you're a Sony fan
sure go for it but if you're not I think
there's a good list of 2018 flagships
that I would rather recommend over this
one but let us know in the comments down
below what do you think about the sony
xperia x III do you like it or not and
