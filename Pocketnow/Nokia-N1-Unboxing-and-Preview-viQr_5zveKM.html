questioning why so many people wanted a
Nokia and one tablet but I also said I
wanted badly to experience it for myself
at MWC in Barcelona it was Jaime and
Anton who got that honor so it's about
time I got caught up I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow unboxing the first tablet
from the new Nokia the N 1 as the fancy
retail packaging makes clear this
unboxing and the review to follow it
comes courtesy of 28 mobile bringing you
the most sought after mobile devices in
the world no matter where in the world
you are to get a Nokia and one of your
own pay a visit at 28 mobile comm and
tell them PocketNow sent you the Nokia
n1 is notable in part for its specs
called out on the packaging and
including a sub 7 millimeter thickness a
nearly 8 inch screen and a 64-bit Intel
Atom processor but it's easier to read
the box than it is to get inside it this
is the hardest packaging to open since
the Nexus 7 of 2012 and I had to step
away for a breather once or twice to
avoid totally trashing it if you end up
buying one of these just be patient with
it that's my advice once you do get
inside the n1 itself is the first thing
you come across we've got the natural
aluminium version here but there's a
lava gray Edition available as well
beneath the tablet there's precious
little a pamphlet that wasn't much used
to us here in the States and a charging
cable and AC adapter more on that cable
in a second pulling the n1 from its
protective envelope I'm treated to a
beautiful Nokia startup screen and I get
a second to evaluate the feel in hand I
am immediately impressed the aluminium
has been sandblasted for a satin finish
which combines with the rounded corners
to make for a very comfortable first
haft it's significantly smaller than
both the Nexus 9 and the iPad air I
don't have an iPad Mini handy but it
feels similar in size to that and like
all these tablets it's four by three in
aspect ratio still a relative rarity for
an Android tablet
and yet the n1 is technically an a OSP
tablet at least this one is and it's
running the Nokia Z launcher on top of
everything else as Nokia puts it the Z
launcher is the home screen that knows
what you want before you want it we'll
see it's also the home screen that lets
you doodle a letter to quickly search
your installed apps rather than typing
on a virtual keyboard we tried the Z
launcher briefly on an lg g3 last summer
I'm looking forward to seeing what
improvements nokia has made in the time
since and what it can do on a larger
canvas
this is the real Nokia by the way the
part of the company not sold to
Microsoft in the Windows Phone
acquisition the one thing markedly
absent from this and one of course
Google Play services nokia has said it
will ship the n1 with the Play Store and
markets where that's available and we
saw that at MWC but as for us we'll have
to sideload it I'm looking forward to
getting into the odds and ends of this
little tablet the speakers on the bottom
are half a watt each and they surround a
USB type-c connector this will be my
first experience with a reversible
charging cord on Android the screens
pixel density is 325 PPI and at first
glance it looks quite nice as does the
fit and finish on little details like
the volume and power buttons the Foxconn
who built the tablet to Nokia's design
seems to have done nice work here we
want to know what you want to know about
the Nokia and one drop your questions in
the comments below be sure to visit 28
mobile comm if you want one of these for
your very own and stay tuned for
PocketNow Zen one review coming soon in
the meantime check out pocket now's
recent reviews of the HTC One m9 Blu
vivo air and Xiaomi me note and be sure
to subscribe and give this unboxing a
thumbs up if you did enjoy it until next
time this has been michael fisher with
PocketNow captain to phones on twitter
reminding you to only sandblast your
aluminum under the supervision of an
expert we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
