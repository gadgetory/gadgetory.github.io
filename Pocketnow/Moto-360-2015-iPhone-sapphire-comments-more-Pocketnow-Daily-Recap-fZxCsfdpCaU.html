like if nothing happened toughness trust
me it hurt I just couldn't leave you
guys without a video how many times does
he say interesting to effing many
interesting i meant pay the rent some
time so you won't have to move into a
new studio every few months I'll take
your advice that's right as that time of
the week I am high memory that this is
pocket now and this is the bargain out
daily recap for last week last fun day
was about the 1+2 there was an
announcement yet and I was asking you if
you were waiting for this phone or for
another one as we had some sales states
and other details we had 367 comments
one of them starts with one plus two yet
another overhyped bone I don't agree and
i'm sure a lot of people don't either i
only care about three devices this year
the 1+2 the new Nexus and the new iphone
that's a big disparity but your choice
one plus two is definitely a killer
mid-range phone but I think it's worth
the wait for the nexus 2015 and the moto
x and yeah even though the oneplus 2 is
a cool phone i have to agree with you
there moto x particularly as a cool
phone indeed then everything was
announced on tuesday the 1+2 in addition
to the new Moto X file in the Moto G etc
and I asked you you have to pick one
plus sure Moto X there's a twenty dollar
price difference here which one would
you pick we had a crazy 1075 comments
thanks a lot guys we start with Moto X
for sure SD card moto maker and NFC
winner yes if you pay for the extras to
get all that pseudo USB type-c on the
1+2 that's only USB 2.0 and no NFC no
micro is the notebook charged with a
convoluted invite system to moto x tile
wins no contest yeah I agree moto X all
day and daily WTF would i do with a
1080p 5.5 inch screen with no expandable
storage whereas how you get a bigger and
better screen with the sweetest d card
slot 1 plus is being blown out of the
water it is but again so long as you pay
for the additions which would require
moto maker remember the basic Moto X
doesn't bring these things in the 1+2
well does it either Wednesday was about
the Moto 360 it wasn't announced at the
event but it showed up at the FCC so I
what would you change for this future
moto 360 509 comments we start with one
word battery life and flat tire enough
said yeah true battery life in
particular but there are the things that
can prove these Motorola let us have an
always-on screen if not please Huawei
let us have an always-on screen if both
companies neglect to include this
feature I'll be sticking to LG and I've
been seriously considering the same
thing for exactly the same reason
thinner lighter better display and make
it iOS compatible kill the Apple wash
hashtag and I would make it thinner or
lighter that's one of the things I like
the most about the Moto 360 but iOS
compatibility would be awesome indeed
and then if you remember I had a car
accident on Thursday so we had to skip
that daily in go to friday and i asked
you what do you think about rotating
bezels is that a good idea as samsung is
preparing everyone for that with it's a
gear a and we have a 450 3 comments just
need to get rid of those stupid google
cards for their watch they're ugly and
remember this would run Tizen so the
cards would not be there and yes I would
love it if android wear had a better UI
indeed as well what dating bezel is not
a good idea after a while of using it
it'll feel like if your fingers are
about to fall off and yeah it'll depend
on the bezel true but uh yeah you do
have a point it would be cumbersome
indeed this is Christ Sam so you stop
with your gimmicks please just copy the
effing digital crown from Apple like you
always end up doing and push out a
software update in three months time and
it won't make it to the watch because
another 25 were already being released I
would not like for the digital crown to
make it and I hope that this rotating
bezel doesn't do that because it is a
not really necessary for the Apple watch
it's cool it's just again it is a
gimmick indeed i feel that samson could
come up with something cool but again
it'll depend on the UI and will depend
on this watch working on other devices
that are not just samsung because i feel
that that is the biggest issue with gear
devices that's it for the bargain out
daily recap thank you very much for
