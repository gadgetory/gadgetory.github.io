know that but we have a hot powerhouse
Android the Sony Xperia z1 and we have a
mid-range err windows phone the Lumia
925 of course it's only a mid-range err
if you compare a to a an Android phone
so how do these two compare let's check
it out in this video right now after
comparing the Sony Xperia z1 with two of
the leading Android smartphones the
Samsung Galaxy s4 and the HTC One we
decided not to neglect the windows film
fans out there whether they want to
switch to the Xperia z1 from the Lumia
925 or some of you want to decide
between getting one of these two devices
this is for your and not only viewing
pleasure yes we know the difference is
oftentimes huge between Android and
Windows Phone just like in the case of
Android and iOS or iOS and Windows Phone
but that makes it even more fun
interesting and intriguing we love
diversity on the other hand there are
also similarities so which one comes out
on top in our by now familiar set up
we'll be comparing these two phones in
terms of hardware software and user
experience as well as the camera the
Sony Xperia z1 uses a single piece
aluminum frame construction sandwiched
between two layers of tempered glass as
we concluded in our recent z1 vs. HTC
one video it is a phone which is a
pleasure to hold it also comes very
close if not equals the premium
exceptional in hand feel of the one the
Xperia z1 is a jewel when you add water
and thus proving to all that and we need
to remind you it is rated for depths
beyond one and a half meters of fresh
water you get a phone which is hard to
resist on the other hand it is our
belief that the Nokia Lumia 925 is the
best of all Nokia devices when it comes
to in hand feel sure it's not completely
made out of aluminium and glass as we
all expected before its announcement in
London but it sure feels to us as the
most premium of all Nokia Windows Phones
if the z1 has glass on the back glass on
the front and aluminum in between the
Lumia 925 has a curved towards the edges
glass on the front which blends in
nicely with the sides aluminum edges and
one of the softest polycarbonate Swee
we have ever touched on the back
interestingly Sony did not need a
protrusion for its 20.7 megapixel camera
on the back of the c1 but not you needed
to create a hump for its 8.7 megapixel
PureView shooter however it doesn't
really bother us
despite being significantly larger than
the 925 the z1 is just as thin at 8.5
millimeters it is however 15 millimeters
taller at 144 millimeters and four point
six millimeters wider at 74 millimeters
it is also 31 grams heavier due to its
size and glass construction at 170 grams
again we can't stress this enough we
have all sorts of IP ratings on the z1
but in layman's terms it is dust roof
and water proof beyond one and a half
meters of fresh water that alone can win
the game if you are looking for
something like this on the inside these
two couldn't be any more different
however there is also a fundamental
difference between the two platforms
which justifies hardware specification
differences the Xperia z1 is powered by
a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor the Lumia 925
has a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 at its core Ram goes to
the z1 and is 2 gigabytes versus half of
that on the Lumia 925 however internal
storage wise the Xperia z1 only has 16
gigabytes onboard expandable via microSD
well the 925 comes in at 16 and
sometimes 32 gigabyte options both of
which are sadly not expandable the
display battle also goes to the Xperia
z1 regardless if you look at size or
resolution we have five inches against
4.5 inches Full HD 1920 by 1080 versus
720p 1280 by 768 resolution 441 PPI
versus 334 PPI and then there are the
differences in technologies there is a
TFT display on the Sony phone with the
company's own triluminos technology from
TVs together with x-reality engine and
there's a ClearBlack AMOLED pure motion
HD unit on the nokia phone comparing the
two is difficult due to the different UI
layouts but resolution aside as far as
image quality contrast color vibrancy
saturation and everything else is
concerned we'll have to give it to the
Lumia 925 and it's deep blacks
natural color tones and
users ability to customize the color
profile in terms of temperature and
saturation side angle visibility also
matters to us we understand that it
might not matter to some of you but the
Lumia 925 we emphasize resolution aside
wins the battle on paper the 20.7
megapixel stabilized camera on the z1
destroys the 8.7 megapixel PureView
stabilized camera on the 925 if you look
at sheer numbers sensors aside its G
lens versus carl zeiss lens by ons and
Exmor RS technologies versus peer review
we'll see how they actually compare
later on in this video
Sony fitted a larger battery under z1 to
power everything we're looking at 3000
milliamp hours on the z1 vs. two
thousand milliamp hours under 925 sadly
neither of the two are user removable or
accessible neither supports wireless
charging out of the box on the software
side we've got Android 4.2.2 jelly bean
on the z1 and we've got Windows Phone 8
Nakia lumia amber addition on the 925 it
couldn't be any more different and while
this is not another Android versus
Windows Phone video will tell you that
both deliver a solid user experience
however those who love customization and
a basically endless choice of software
titles will tend to go the Android way
on Windows Phone GUI is minimalistic
fresh different but there are some
applications still missing in the store
well you might find most of the
applications there are a couple of
exceptions which might simply not be
there at the time of recording this
video however chances are that once you
go Windows Phone you'll adopt the
Microsoft ecosystem and offerings like
The Office OneNote SkyDrive and outlook
suit against Gmail and all the other
Google services while the entire user
experience on the z1 is as fluid as it
can get
thanks in part to the fast processor
plenty of RAM and the OS itself when the
is built on the Lumia 925 has never felt
better it is an OS which is by design
snappy responsive and buttery smooth
there are certain things though on the
software end that can tip the balance in
favor of the Nokia phone the entire free
here shoot would online as well as
offline voice guided navigation the
Nokia pro cam app Nokia music and all
the others on
and Google Maps is the go-to source of
many for mapping solutions and you can
also make them available offline
navigation however will most of the
times require a data connection sony
also bundles its own offerings for music
and games the rest is the same meaning
it's as different as it can get on the
two-thirds multiple home screens and
widgets versus scrolling lists of live
tiles panoramic hubs and the UI that was
once called Metro for a reason lots of
notifications in the queue versus those
notifications which at the moment
disappear but some of them could be
retained on live tiles and the general
feeling of tweaked ability versus
options to change wallpaper background
accent and tile sizes if customization
is your cup of tea the z1 wins if on the
other hand you're looking for something
different and fresh the 925 and Windows
Phone bring that to you let us move on
to the camera while we talk about it
we'll play the samples for you in the
background we had a hard time deciding
and coming up with a winner here the z1
has a twenty point seven megapixel
camera but she can't really shoot in
that mode except if you specifically
enable it in the manual settings and
disable all other scene modes in that
mode you can also only tweak white
balance and exposure for everything else
your output will be 8 megapixels like on
the Lumia Windows Phones default camera
doesn't really allow you to do anything
Nakia zone pro camera app available on
the 925 can be set as a default camera
application and allows you to tweak
everything you can think of and even
more the Lumia 925 wins but not by a
large margin though in our opinion this
is the closest camera shootout we've
done in a long time before we tell you
more we have to mention this they're
both good shooters
however the Lumia 925 has a slight edge
when it comes to anything that is not
shot or captured under perfect lighting
conditions where does he want wins and
since those conditions are probably the
rarest of what you'll encounter the rest
makes the difference the z1 tends to
introduce more noise in the images and
all images except those shot in the
aforementioned perfect lighting
conditions the 925 does a better job as
far as noise or concealing noise is
concerned also the 925 delivers more
details throughout the frame
while the z1 shots tend to wash out get
literally towards the edges and this is
not that the field and also this is
something which is present on most of
the shots especially in the far right
edges as far as color reproduction is
concerned you have to take our word for
it the Lumia 925 is the closest to what
we've seen ourselves when shooting these
stills and videos under low-light
circumstances the z1 bumps its
sensitivity and captures enough light to
produce images that represent your
subjects however with a lack of detail
well the 925 captures more detail with
less light an auto mode but once you go
into the manual mode of the pro cam and
set the shutter speed to anywhere
between half a second and a second you
get more light as well as details
anything above will meet the optical
image stabilization if you don't use a
tripod and pretty much destroy your
image video is also tricky but the main
things mentioned above are also valid
however they're less visible and before
you comment this is not the same footage
and due to the different perspectives of
the two cameras while shooting the Lumia
925 failed to focus which was really our
own mistakes things which happen when
you shoot with different cameras
simultaneously check out the samples for
yourselves hey everyone this is Tony
from PocketNow and we are in the same
place but it's a different side of the
park we are checking out the Sony Xperia
z1 and putting it against the Nokia
Lumia 925 we are recording HD video
which is full HD and the Xperia z1 just
lagged a bit for a second there but help
is just on the screen and not in the
final video we're gonna go against the
Sun here
keep on walking by let's see how these
to cope with changing lighting
conditions and let's try to moving for a
close-up on the leaves here on the
ground
it's then they're a bit used to see if
they both managed to cope there and back
again and there's some movement action
and get back to where we started from
thank you very much for watching see you
in the next video hey everyone this is
tony from pocket now and we are in the
same place but it's a different side of
the park we are checking out the sony
xperia z1 and putting it against the
Nokia Lumia 925 we are recording HD
video which is full HD the Xperia z1
just lagged a bit for a second there but
hope is just on the screen and not in
the final video we're gonna go against
the Sun here people walking by let's see
how these to cope with changing lighting
conditions and we'll try to moving for a
close-up on the leaves here on the
ground stand there a bit just to see if
they both manage to cope there and back
again and there's some movement action
and get back to where we started from
thank you very much for watching see you
in the next video okay time for a
conclusion which is now the hardest
thing to do if you're a fan of Android
or Windows Phone there's little chance
anybody can convince you of the contrary
however if you're looking for your first
phone you have to first do some research
on what these two ecosystems have to
offer not as a whole but for you and
your own needs regardless of what we or
anyone else tells you there are
different designs is what can help you
make a decision then there comes the
camera which in our opinion goes to the
925 even if by a very small margin
however if water and the screw thing are
something you'd need just grab the c1
among the two this was definitely one of
the most interesting and exciting
comparisons we've had the pleasure of
ever creating folks that's gonna do it
for today for our Sony Xperia z1 vs.
Nokia Lumia 925 comparison if you like
