getting larger that news plus a boatload
of upcoming announcements in the hour
ahead and one of us is podcasting from a
battery-powered mobile device and can't
stay connected very long so let's get
right down to it this is episode 05
three of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcasts from pocket now
where we discuss smartphones tablets and
the state of mobile technology in 2013
I'm your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and today I'm
joined by multi media manager shirtless
hi may Rivera good morning there and hot
powerless Honduras good morning and
let's just leave it there before I jinx
it again yeah it's a good idea and by
senior editor Taylor new digs Martin
good morning to with your new office got
a new office new apartment new pretty
much everything you everything and
you're down the road from a PF changs
but I don't know at all man I needed a
new girlfriend now I was just gonna I
was just gonna say like I don't want to
talk too much about Taylor's awesome
positioning in the in the in the world
when Jaime is stuck literally podcasting
with no shirt on from an iphone tethered
to a laptop with no power did I get all
that right Jaime yeah you got all that
right all right hey sanding himself for
the folder I want to know about this oh
yeah sure I am though the literal way to
say it is I'm blowing myself with a full
now who that is not the literal way to
say it Fanning Taylor had it right
Fanning part if I pardon my lack of
perfect English girl like you your lack
of perfect English is is rare but
hilarious I want to I want to hear
something I need I need an international
education because I was not aware until
I don't know a couple months ago that
the power outages are can something of a
regular occurrence in Honduras it is it
is it actually got better years ago with
the previous government but the problem
is here most companies like the phone
company and the power company these are
all government country companies and
they are on purpose these are what keep
the government from going broke right
and so it's funny because my light bill
for example is more expensive than my
brother's like bill in Washington DC you
believe that close to three hundred
dollars of a light bill and then I get
power outages almost every week wow wow
well crazy we thought that Jaime was not
going to be able to join us this morning
and but he definitely came it came to
the rescue of the pocket nah we CLE with
it with a laptop with an iphone no I'm
using the built-in ones in the iphones
headset how does that sound yeah yeah
and I mean you sound good it's it's
great I feel like we always have that
surprise like whether Joe is podcasting
with his headphones or steven is
podcasting with whatever he use is like
it's everyone sounds really good so
anyway lorenda random podcast for the
potato yeah well I yet with the
exception of Brenda what does Brenda
news I had an idea he's gonna hate me
he's got a snowball he's got a snowball
just like I do does he really yeah you
must have more right angles in that
office than anywhere anyway I got a lot
in this one man a lot of echo so now
you're you're you're doing fine here
let's let's get into it though cuz we're
but we're all time constrained and we're
starting a little later than usual today
we have a couple announcements to get
out of the way the first one is not an
official one or it will be tomorrow but
PocketNow weekly listeners you get a
little early insight into this hey you
know all those times when we talk about
Instagram on the podcast well regardless
of what your feelings on Instagram are
that you should know that pocket now now
has its own official Instagram account
at Instagram now / pocket now pocketnow
now and Taylor Martin having returned to
Instagram for a little bit is providing
some excitement to my day because he is
just kind of posting all the time and
I'm a post all the time anyway like I'm
used to Jaime being on Instagram now but
I feel like we three are the best ones
to be on the show right now for the
Instagram announcement cuz we're kind of
the only ones who use it regularly right
on the team back yeah branded only
opened the account and all he's got what
all he's got is one photo i think uh
what what I'm ways personal account yeah
oh yeah I don't know if I even follow
Brandon I didn't even bother because I
know he doesn't use it but we the pocket
now account will be officially announced
tomorrow it's not a big deal like it
we're not going to do too much special
with it but we're just gonna be posted
a lot of photos from behind the scenes
photos of review devices photos from
review devices and me making stupid
faces while I'm shooting review devices
so what are you gonna what are you guys
gonna attribute with it yeah what are
you good what are you gonna do I haven't
even talked to you about this you guys
gonna use it for fun times I want
America knows what here you're hi mera
canos um maybe it's like a liver to what
is that a pastry Oh Marikana it's a
person walking piece of pasta oh okay
all right you know I just I just love
her I just love how you people in the
United stay safe americano why don't
just say the American back yeah like I'm
gonna like asking for an American like
kind of an American and a cup it's just
an over here yeah this doesn't make
sense now I heard some backstory on on
the americano I don't know how true it
is but I did hear a story saying that
you know during World War Two we were in
we were in France and we wanted coffee
and they only had espresso and it was
too strong so they put water in it oh
good amerock an americano so I don't
know how so so the translation of that
is that an American coffee is a is a
watered-down version of what could be
awesome right basically yes yeah yeah
you guys would hate tonkin donuts I want
to talk let you guys know I mean what
are you gonna be you're not gonna be
taking running shoe photos on Instagram
you surely you will be doing something
else well at least not for the pocket
now account and I mean if you want to
see a lot of boring running photos of
leaving yeah follow me on instagram I
don't think any other boring i know
there's no spinning what you're spinning
ones are getting a little static but the
the running shoes when they're good so
somebody like what am I missing here he
was like why are you always static when
you're taking photos of yourself
spinning and I'm like well I have to
stop to be able to take the photo that's
just the way it is but yeah why not a
couple of bloopers on on parking out
daily see how that looks oh that would
be really cool yes cuz we can do video
on Instagram no to so anyway it's gonna
be fun that is the unofficial
announcement follow us instagram.com
slash pocket now also we've got us a
forum I don't know if you missed the
video but pocket now has its own little
BBS now returning to our roots after I
don't know what 13 years
it is at forums pocketnow.com and when
we launched it I was petrified because
this was sort of my it wasn't my
original idea I guess but I was really
advocating heavily for it and I may I
think you had tried to pitch it earlier
and it didn't really land right well I
wanted him back all the time I actually
landed in pocket now through the forums
that we used to have before with
vbulletin I had bricked the pocket pc
that I had back then and that's how I
that's how I learned about pocket now
and so I let's just say that I I was in
charge of the forage for a while and
years ago and then I was in charge of
the redesign of the forms back then and
then one day after one day led to the
nut another Brandon comes up to me he's
like I'm killing the forms and I'm like
no you're not he's like yeah I am and it
would we went back and forth for weeks
on discussions of why I didn't want him
to kill the forms and well he ended up
killing them anyways well you know it's
I guess it's good that we had some time
apart from from them because we were
able to start afresh with the new thing
and there's a lot that there's we have a
list like a mile long of changes we want
to implement and the UI needs to be
changed a lot of stuff needs to be fixed
and improved but what's nice is the
community we've attracted has been
really really cool so far and I know
we're still in the honeymoon phase and
the trolls are going to come out of the
woodwork on whatever but where there are
some great great conversations happening
over there and considering I was
petrified that no one was going to show
up like it was going to be one of those
things where you throw a house party and
nobody comes i I'm a blizzard and happen
that happens to me every time oh I'll
come to your house party I'll come to
your office party throw an
office-warming party anyway visit us at
the forums please we're having awesome
discussions over there including a
thread which i think is my personal
favorite entitled jaime rivera is a jerk
face which i posted and it took like
four days for jaime to actually visit
the forums to find it and I was like oh
good you're here finally thank you can't
find that again I know it's in here
somewhere is it off topic I don't know
maybe Stephen shank finally became a
moderator and and deleted it anyway we
are due to get into some news here so
well thank you for letting us get the
announcements out of the way at the top
of the show co-hosts and listeners thank
you for your patience you
guys why don't we talk a little bit
about Windows Phone shall we we had a
pop like right before the Lumia
announcement last week it was the only
time we could do it and then we had a
live hangout during the official
announcement but one thing led to
another etc etc the Lumia 1020 is
official yay and I think we had found
what nine or ten editorials that day
talking about the army attempt yeah I
don't know how I even worked that day
cuz i did a podcast in the morning a
hangout during and then i wrote like
three editorials that night yeah ya know
what happy that it was a good day i'm
really excited about this phone and this
is this is really big coming from me it
is indeed yes now i am curious as to as
to what excites you about it i might
share that with us i know it's the
camera but you know in a broader sense
okay so for me i'll give you an example
ever since the Lumia 1020 was announced
I'm using the Windows Phone 8x again I'm
using le dos again yeah um you know I
have nothing against windows phone I
just I have I had struggled to find
something of Windows Phone that made me
want it more than any other phone and I
think this is it i mean i love i love
candid photography i do i it doesn't
matter what I take photos of whether
it's my shoe after I run or whatever but
I've always wanted you know it's funny
because I even carry the galaxy camera
in my glove compartment because I always
want to have something to take a cool
photo from and and for me this this is
like the solution it's like all right
you're gonna have a lossless zoom really
cool camera with you and it's going to
have a you why that even though it's
still not as mature as I would like for
it to be I mean I started using that
instance application that you recommend
the face that yeah the Instagram stand
in you man that is that is like the best
third-party application can I've ever
seen in my life that's why I wrote that
that editorial with basically that
headline that's like oh you did you did
it the best third-party implementation
you did that's right yeah so I guess a
lot of my windows phone problems are
solved right now first of all i have
spotify now i have i have an alternative
for instagram so I I guess I i started
using the eight
recently and I haven't felt the need to
go back I'm actually enjoying my
experience now and all I need now is the
camera isn't that great yeah I love that
it's so kind of yeah what's the what is
the word I mean satisfying as an
insufficient descriptor but it's so nice
to be on a platform that for so long has
gone without the necessary apps from my
perspective you know like like you just
said Spotify was absent for a long time
an Instagram client was absent for a
long time a youtube app was absent for a
while and it's like it due to have them
appear one by one it's it's funny it's
like a kind of a gradual stream of
presence to a to unwrap and then all of
a sudden you know when the one day you
wake up and you're like wow I don't
really need to put down my Windows Phone
and pick up an Android device to to go
through my day and that's really cool
and I agree it's only going to get more
compelling once this camera drops but
can we talk about the price really
quickly guys well um I was just going to
say that I wrote an editorial this
morning that that's talking about the UI
and everything and why I haven't really
been able to use when to his phone for
so long and now that basically what I'm
a was saying the camera is one thing
that's pulling me over but but also the
application support is growing and what
was the name of your piece this morning
it was does does Windows Phone need to
refresh to I'm sorry and it was supposed
to be in the rundown I'm sorry to skip
over you there oh well well it's already
in there now yeah so that's also
inserted that's an awesome question
because it's an awesome headline and I
know it's gonna get the comments are
gonna be a flame war but like that's a
really good question because we haven't
besides smaller tiles we really haven't
seen a revamp of the UI and yeah since
since seven launched almost you know as
we're seeing yeah and that's that's
coming up on three years right and and
and people at this point I fell for it
or not updating ya know an input with
Windows I think the counter-argument is
because windows phone is an ish platform
or it was and now it's picking up steam
because it's a much smaller platform
it's kind of eternally fresh because
nobody knows about it right I mean
that's the argument that i was using to
to kind of be like well i guess they
have bigger fish to fry than read
the UI because it's still going to be
new to millions of people right yeah
well that's that's that's fair if you
liked it from day one but I've kind of
felt a little bored by it and just now
now I will say that the change getting
rid of the arrow the pointing arrow that
kind of took up a whole row or column I
guess mm-hmm getting rid of that was a
good idea but but i think that there's
more that can be done with even the
tiles that are there that are there
maybe put the arrow back but but don't
have it take up an entire column but
have a grid that's not what is this for
by however many tall have a grid that's
square and you can pan left and right
and up and down in two dimensions and I
mean there are just so many different
things that could happen I think they're
kind of never-ending potential for him
and they could kind of have anything
they want with it and yeah so these I
was pretty um tame in the article and I
didn't really call it out i mean i
started the article with i like windows
phone no really i do right because
everybody every time I write an article
people were like all your hater well
that's stupid yeah that's no no wait
that's that's a great title right don't
you go stealing time is dator crown oh
yeah oh yeah well that that's the
culture and which we've talked about
before of yes and particular ecosystem
people say that about me when I write
about I OS as well yeah and I don't hate
iOS I don't hate windows no but there's
this you're gonna call out areas that
that that you see require improvement
and that actually you make a good point
in that piece as well because the 1020
announcement showed us nokia did not
focus on the platform at all I mean I
don't think Stephen Elop said the words
windows phone 8 once the entire
presentation yeah 0 not once and because
there's not much to announce right
because we're all waiting on the next
update and and the next series of
updates really so yeah no I do want to
keep this narrow there because I don't
want to broaden it up too much because
we want to keep the feed going here but
you I the price I mean 299 on contract
forget the unlock pricing for a second
stephen shank wrote a cool piece this
morning where he titled it lumia 1020
pricing is either genius or self
delusion and he talks about
is it genius because it's doing this is
the thing these argument goes this for
four years the gold standard in high-end
flagship smartphone pricing has been 199
and yeah you can go higher than that if
you give added storage but 199 is pretty
much the sweet spot and now we're seeing
it for 299 the Lumia 1020 299 on
contract with AT&amp;amp;T exclusively I mean
that's concerning to to me because I'm
gonna have to buy this thing and i'm
buying it for full price i think i think
it was spending out there 650 okay i'll
give you a reason okay so yeah me for
somebody who's walking into the store
299 for this one obviously the pitch is
the camera but is it enough go ahead
honey well the thing is it's not just
any camera they're not just selling you
anything i mean they're they're selling
you something that is going to take each
of its competitors years to figure out
and i feel for example i'll give you an
example windows phone has retailed for
the past three years as the underdog
cheap phone and I oh I never did like
that I think it's a customer perspective
I mean well the first generation iphone
was launched it costs five hundred
dollars after a two-year contract and
it's sold like hotcakes if people get
this perception that if something is too
inexpensive it's cheap and I do
understand the mentality of Microsoft
and above all the partners and trying to
keep windows phone affordable to be able
to graft more customers but I wrote in a
tutorial probably like a year or two ago
about the fact that people are
considering Windows Phone cheap and I
feel that there is nothing there is no
compelling reason to price windows phone
any less than any flagship Android phone
and they are yeah it's a perception
issue it's a perception what about let's
talk about that because the only
flagship androids that are sitting at
that price point on a contract I mean
are like the Galaxy Note and that was a
long time ago that's not even it's not
even there there's there's nothing on
AT&amp;amp;T right now that's 299 la except yeah
32 ke VI for Devon 32 gig is 299 right
and then it is a capacity thing I mean
yet okay so they're giving me 32 gigs on
that lumia 1020 why not yeah same thing
I think I don't think you can draw a
direct comparison there because it's
like
the user cannot achieve you don't have
an option right you internet you have to
get the 32 gig of the 1020 you don't
have to get a 32 gig iphone you can go
cheaper if you want to the 10 tony is
that 300 bucks or nothing yes but here's
the problem i mean how can you really
can you really consider lumia 1020 with
16 gigs usable absolutely not no I agree
there's a good reason for that 32 to be
there all I'm saying is if if you're
going to launch at that at that price
point you've got to be willing to to
accept the fact that the sales people
have to carry a higher burden they have
to be able to really overcome objections
when selling this thing and the carrier
has to we're seeing moves that we're
going to talk about in a second of
carriers changing their their phone
pricing policy so maybe that'll factor
into it but it's still a
three-hundred-dollar phone on a contract
and I feel like the last time we were at
this point was years ago where a
smartphone could justifiably be priced
very very high on a contract and you
forget about the iphone for a second i'm
thinking of like old windows mobile days
you remember when those things used to
be priced about 550 on a contract I know
I remember I remember those days but but
listen listen Michael I just for me for
me a hundred dollars in this country is
a lot it's a lot of money I mean it's uh
I mean I would have to go to the most
expensive restaurant in the city and
take to take three people with me to be
able to have a restaurant bill that tops
100 bucks and then you're living in a
country where a hundred dollars is what
you spend in dinner uh you know with the
date every day whenever I go to Burger
King it's always a hundred bucks yeah
I'm sure to PF changs boom done I really
mad I don't know I guess I guess for me
a hundred dollars point yeah for me a
hundred dollars is not a big deal when
I'm getting something that no other
phone can give me absolutely and yeah
there's no question that that's what
you're getting with this yeah yeah I
have three points to make one the Lumia
520 lends credence to exactly what I'm I
was saying about Windows Phone having
this the stigma about being cheap
because that is one of the low end
models and it's if i'm not mistaken one
of the most popular windows phones ever
the Lumia 520 is the that's the one
that's like 150 off contract right yeah
but it it shows that Windows Phone at
least if nothing else if it can't
compete on a large scale with high-end
devices it will appeal to smaller
markets and people looking for a cheap
punk but the price behind the 1020 I
have a problem with it because on
contract is 299 off contract its price
relatively comparable to all the other
flagship SATs 659 off contract which
means that that you're signing a
two-year agreement for just a little
over or just a little under half off so
you're getting like a forty five percent
cut on the price of the phone for a
two-year contract but you're still
paying we'll circle back to this later
i'm looking through the rundown
correctly but you're still paying for
that hardware in the contract and you're
paying just as much as someone who gets
a bigger discount on a phone for the
same term for instance the galaxy s4
it's 200 on contract off contract it's
around the same price i think is 614
about six hundred and forty dollars nine
or something yeah i think it's six
thirty nine ninety nine wrote about it
the other day but you're getting a much
bigger discount sixty percent off or
something in there and there i'm doing
really quick rough math but uh for the
same term and you're not getting as much
off so it's a worse deal if you think
about it mathematically financially it's
a terrible deal but in the same respect
you're getting much more out of it
because one you don't have to go buy
another point and shoot camera just use
your phone because it's that good the
difference the discounted price
difference is eighty dollars so the
galaxy s4 you're getting four hundred
forty dollars off the Lumia 1020 you're
getting three hundred sixty dollars off
so that's the that's the difference
there yeah so that it's a pretty
significant difference when you're
talking same term you're paying the same
amount back on your contract in your
rate plan and you know it's just kind of
crappy I mean that's the best way to put
it you're not like basically what it
amounts to is the carriers are going to
make a lot AT&amp;amp;T is going to make a lot
more money off the Lumia 1020 then they
will on the galaxy s4 and maybe just
maybe that'll give sales representatives
a incentive to actually sell Windows
Phone that that's that that's the real
question that I've that is a very good
point yeah it's a good point on the
books but I remember there being like
the relationship between sales reps at
the retail level and the corporate
office and the actual overall direction
of the company was so disassociated when
I worked for two American carriers and I
I don't know I haven't seen any evidence
that that you know disconnection has
been repaired in any of my excursions to
modern mobile retail stores sound of
that matters if they're working
commission to AT&amp;amp;T sales reps work
commission yeah yeah they do then if
they're gonna make more money if they're
gonna make more money on a Lumia 1020
and it's the right fit for customer
that's the that's the point though like
I have never I've seldom seen a
corporation that actually does this
where it's like oh wow this device needs
to be pushed really hard let's
incentivize the sales reps yes it's
logical yes it makes a lot of sense I
don't see it happen very often okay I
spy mobile did well yeah I don't know if
I could talk about that but they
definitely did right I'm we were
actually living in a Cell area yeah well
we didn't work on the sheet but what we
were told to sell android phones as
upgrades new lines we were told to sell
it sell iphones as much as we could and
and upgrades were non iPhones because
you don't make much on people upgrading
to an iphone but a new line you make
more so it's kind of yeah i think we
were told and we and we did we hit we
had quotas and we would hit him
regardless and in the case of the
iphones or interruption together the
iphone um there is at you know the
reason why the iphone loses its price
like so dramatically like a month before
the new iphone gets launched is because
they you know carrier signed contracts
for specific amounts of iphones to sell
so if they don't get rid of that stock
they're gonna have to pay a penalty to
Apple so that it's like it's convenient
for carriers to sell that phone like
hotcakes and I don't know how Apple was
able to pull that negotiation off but it
worked for them like wonders yeah but
you know our list of the details of how
they actually execute it you would they
have to incentivize the sales people to
move this thing because otherwise it's
just going to be the 900 all over again
the 920 all over again I wrote a piece
about the carrier of exclusivity sucking
because that's what we've talked about
on the podcast over and over again about
this the Easter Sunday ball drop and the
the fact that the phones weren't being
pushed in the retail stores even though
they had premium positioning you know I
don't know but I think the 1020 probably
stands the best chance of actually
developing a following among salespeople
because it really is a spec monster like
you said in your piece Jaime about nokia
having finally nailed it yeah yeah I
mean cuz because you tell anyone 41
megapixels on a camera and their jaw
will drop it unless they are the biggest
Luddite ever and all other arguments
aside like even though you're using that
stick even though you're you're you know
putting aside the facts and the
technical stuff in the pixel doubling
and all that kind of stuff and just tell
somebody who's yeah it's got a 41
megapixel cam would like that is an
instant attention getter and that's what
you're going to help move this thing my
mom she was like no way and I told my
photographer friend the one who took the
pictures of me for the the pocket now
inside her yeah I told her about it I
told her about the 41-megapixel phone
and she's like I hate smartphones I said
why and she said because one it makes my
job more difficult because people want
to just use their own cameras instead of
hiring someone and to I have a
three-thousand-dollar camera and five
thousand dollars worth of lenses and
people are getting very comparable image
quality out of a phone right it's not
the same you don't get all the the
effects that you can get from a lens or
all the settings toggles that you can
tweak on a DSLR but she said it doesn't
matter because people don't see the
difference and and in it and really
exactly does her work yeah yes and so
did I do that d value to her work with
with photoshop touch well but but here's
the thing so that's not to not tell like
dog your friend cuz she takes wonderful
wonderful photos but I'm never I don't
understand that attitude I actually I
kind of do when I was still planning
long-term on on a different career path
I was getting really pissed at reality
TV because it was really really robbing
a lot of opportunities for actors
because there just wasn't fictitious
programming being made anymore was all
reality crap and so I but I was fighting
the the trend and that's a difficult
thing to do and that's exactly what's
happening in photography now I'm
completely agree with her Taylor I think
that you can get amazing amazing results
with expensive equipment and with the
craft of photography I'm not in any way
saying that you can reproduce a
non-smartphone but I think she hit the
nail on the head most people can't tell
ya people don't have an eye for most
people than around for composition or
you know balance or anything like that
and it depends it depends on on each
specific scenario like for example in my
case I have a t3 I I have a I have a the
the Sony but I've been with the young
guys are even the nex-5 and these are
all great cameras but I can't take these
cameras to downtown here I'm not going
to take them with me everywhere I go I i
I'm no and even if I wanted to they fit
in my glove compartment and man i'm just
looking for an opportunity to getting
mugged here yeah tell me about that
you're gonna get you're gonna drop for
your camera I'm serious so for me I
guess that's like part probably one of
the biggest reasons why I love the
iphone because I mean it's not even it's
not even noticeable in my pocket and I
could just take it out whenever I feel
the need and I just use it and I you
know the Lumia 1020 is probably not as
thin or anything but i would i would
rather deal with the compromise i mean
it's it again this is an this is the
person that people have considered to be
an on windows phone guy fine I'll take
your criticism but to be honest with you
I feel that the price point is perfect I
I studied business in college and I do
understand what you're doing and I do
applaud what they're doing because I
have always felt that the
ice points for windows phones have been
all wrong I seriously have two points
I'm a I'm one what have you not studied
in college and two you're gonna have to
get bigger pants to compensate for that
camera hump yeah i use i usually use a
holster oh god do you real good yeah
yeah I didn't know that okay that's not
very inconspicuous you're gonna get the
yellow one the white one which is even
worse I don't know I feel bottom line is
I feel that the especially the unlocked
price it's the same price of a 16 gig
iphone unlocked I mean for me it's like
oh now that is a compelling argument
right there I'm like okay iphone 5s or
Lumia 1020 this is the first time that
I've ever been sitting on a discussion
where I'm like oh wow which one am I
gonna pick right I know it's when i'm
picking can I i have to tell you guys
that I am for the second year in a row
gonna be in line at the AT&amp;amp;T store to
buy a Lumia or maybe the microsoft store
I don't know motorcycles are awesome
aren't they I love them you've got
motorcycles i've got chihuahuas take
your pick i have air conditioning the
for that for the second row i'm gonna be
lunch at the AT&amp;amp;T store to buy a phone
and the the color i'm not going to be a
hundred percent on the color I'm getting
the yellow one because I don't want the
black of the white-winged cuz im bored
with both those colors but man I I am so
annoyed that that cyan is not going to
be out and launched and I'm sure it's
gonna be out two months after and I'm
gonna be having this yellow phone that I
sort of like but don't really like
because it's yellow instead of blue you
know I kept anything like that yellow
color and I think it has to do with the
way they're promoting it i just like the
phone and yellow for some reason
everything looks better in that black
but if the red one comes out I can't
think of anything more boring than a
matte black phone but go ahead I'm sorry
it just looks great well well the
exterior of the phone was not made to
entertain you man come on wait a bit
hold on if I'm dropping 299 on contract
and 649 without I'm gonna be entertained
damn it which is why I'm getting a
yellow fog well now that said if the red
one comes out I really really really
want the red
I can't handle warm colors in my
technology I really really can't stand
it I blue is boring I know yellow as
well as I were told you I don't like
yellow I'm just kidding it's better than
the other two Taylor how old are you man
you're not even going through your
midlife crisis why do you want to read
come on baby red orange car i was gonna
say your red phone is gonna clash with
your orange car you gotta get a yellow
phone for your orange car bro yeah shall
we shall we move on to another lumia
device or do we have any parting
thoughts on the 1020 before next week if
you're gonna make us talk about the
Lumia 625 let's just consider talking
about the time I don't want to talk
about the 625 for too long I just wanted
to mention it God we stepped over an
article what do we really should Norton
we were you know I do you want to make a
point on that because Taylor Martin
wrote a piece called and with it with a
headline that doesn't quite match the
tone of the piece and that sounds like a
dig against you Taylor and it's not
because the tone of the piece is much
more hopeful but the headline is lumia
1020 won't say of nokia or Windows Phone
and the foot master so I don't know what
to think about that I was trying to
sneakily get past it so that we could
could maybe move the conversation
forward but let's take a minute and I
don't think it's gonna be a super
successful device now granted I think
it'll be a great device I think it might
sell pretty well but it's not really
going to do much initially for windows
phone and I only say that because one
the price point there are going to be a
lot of people in the US who are turned
away by that 319 or 299 price point yes
it's it it gives the illusion of a
really high quality phone but no it's
not going to sell like hotcakes where a
galaxy s4 at 200 will or an HTC One at
199 will you've got phones that are
innocents better if you don't consider
the image sensing they have better
specifications and all these things that
self representatives will ultimately
compare and people are like oh this must
be better because it's got four cores
instead of two and yeah
you get this basically this comes down
to cells representatives and yes and how
they're going to push the phone and
nothing is going to change the way they
push the phone except for one if they
are compensated if they have an
incentive to sell it and to getting past
the stigma that better specifications or
more cores higher clock speed more
megapixels all these things make the
phone better it's not just that it's a
whole package and illuminate in 20 at
least we haven't reviewed it yet
obviously but the whole package seems to
be there so this is something that's
been mentioned on twitter a whole lot by
a couple of people i follow and respect
and the point has been made that maybe
the 1020 is really just an 808 camera
bolted onto a 920 because if you look at
the thing from the front it looks like a
920 you ready yeah and because we're
still waiting on advancements from the
platform itself we so we actually don't
have the full story yet we don't know
what the advertising is going to be like
it's what i wrote yesterday right and i
imagine that the pitch is going to be
pretty intense from the carrier and from
microsoft and from nokia we don't know
what the new software is going to look
like when the various updates drop so we
don't we're kind of judging a phone
that's even more even further from being
complete than we I don't know then we
usually do I don't know you know why
this thing on launch day it's going to
be incomplete and it's going to come
into its own as the software gets
updated I'm sorry have I go ahead yet
you know you know what's concerning for
me is yeah I still remember when Steve
Jobs was announcing the first iphone
he's like what happens if we if we get
this new genius idea down the road we
can't just pull these phones back and
add and add a buttom to them they're
already shipped you know so i think that
he makes a very compelling point about
the fact that yes you know Taylor you do
have a very end you know it's it's a
very very similar point to the one I
make in the other editorial that I write
I feel that the problem with the problem
here is not nokia anymore i mean i think
that nokia is like really calling
microsoft's bluff right now it's like
okay you said that this was going to be
the hottest flat
format it's logical I mean think about
it Windows 8 is like the best selling
platform out there love it or hate it
but it is so isn't it the smart thing
that people want the phone that looks
like their computer and still the bet
hasn't really paid off and when how we
have a problem now we have a problem
where I feel that this phone is oriented
more towards men in my particular case
and I'm like yeah I do care about a
phone that says that it has four course
even if I don't need them I don't I
don't really care about your excuses as
to why that is I want you to get me the
damn four chords and I want them now
that's my perspective uh you know i
guess i don't know i feel you do have a
solid point it's not going to save the
platform it's not going to save the
company um but i think as i said as we
you know as we talked in the Hangout
when this phone was launched this is
really good this phone is really gonna
show windows phones true colors it's
like this is really calling Microsoft to
either push or no kids either ship out
it's it's either one of these things now
I do feel that the phone will sell and
this is funny but you remember when the
surface when the surface was launched I
was like it's not going to sell and it
didn't sell um there have been so many
there have been so many cases where i'm
like i don't know if it's the marketing
buzz i don't know if it's the product
itself i don't know if it's the offering
and the timing within the market but
there's this thing i'm like that thing
is not gonna sell and you know eighty
percent of the time that's what happens
it doesn't sell and so in this
particular case the Lumia 1020 may not
be the best seller it may not be the
best seller but I do feel that it's
gonna change a lot of perspective
towards Windows Phone and I feel that
it's real I feel that it's really the
seed that the platform needs and by the
way let's let me take that back not the
platform the company it's planning the
seat from okiya now yet nokia has come a
long way um one they announced a phone
with a price point and a date that is
something no one else can do a very
awesome yeah Apple does it and Samsung
can't do it HTC can't do it nobody seems
to be able to do that except Google
maybe they've done it with a few Nexus
devices but but yes they announced the
phone gave a price and a date and said
here it is and it's ready in the same
respect it feels rushed
and that's kind of the same problem that
I had with the Lumia 900 the 920 and
it's what Michael just said they're not
completely finished when they come out
and that that's probably the biggest
problem on that yet i don't i don't
think that was necessarily the case with
the 920 I think 920 was pretty I mean we
yeah we had to wait forever for
Microsoft to get a version of windows 8
that was ready for when it was fun it
was ready for it but I think 920 was was
pretty finished when it came out from a
hardware perspective I mean aside from
that camera lens problem on the front
but you know well though that the 900
definitely was a 900 was appealing I
really hated my 900 when I had it for a
couple weeks but here's the thing the
1020 I've been trying to think of an
analogy to do this and for all the
disadvantages we're seeing and for all
that is yet to be determined in the way
of advertising and sales performance and
all that stuff the 1020 is the first
phone in a really long time I think that
I can remember that recalls the era of
of phones still being a novelty I
remember the days of dumb phones when
when camera phones themselves were new
like the first camera phones right and
it was like a year or two out and I had
a camera phone and this was you know
they were new but a lot of people had
them but I had the Samsung a600 on
sprint and it had like a reversing
screen and a rotating camera like it was
ridiculous well yeah it was I loved it
and it was priced I think actually it's
funny i think was priced about to 9999
on contract which is hilarious it was
like a 0.3 megapixel camera and whatever
but here's the thing I enjoyed telling
people about it and people enjoyed
hearing about it now this phone was ugly
it was like I had a bolt through its
neck it looked like a Frankenstein phone
and it was not well known because it was
priced so high nobody really knew about
it and I don't think it sold very well
but I loved mine and I loved telling
people about it and I think that's what
the 1020 is going to be I think the 1020
saddest generation is a 600 yeah exactly
people aren't really going to know about
it because whose let's be honest Nokia
doesn't really market that well in in in
the US that's true yeah and it won
because they don't have the relationship
they used to have they don't have the
presence and two because they don't have
the funds to you
and remotely compete with my samsung on
a marketing level so so it's going to be
a word of mouth thing it's going to be a
thing where you're going to see that
phone with the with the ring on it I was
watching a video completely unrelated
video non mobile technology yesterday
and some dude was in a crowd and taking
a photo was a power plant being knocked
down and some dude was in in the crowd
taking photos with his phone and it
looked like the the 1020 ring on the
back and I was like I kept rewinding to
that point the video mic oh is that it
and I think people are going to do that
because it's a very distinctive look no
other phone looks like that when you're
talking on it or taking pictures with it
and that's something i think the word of
mouth is gonna be powerful on this one
yeah I would I was completely wrong
about the galaxy note i remember when
the galaxy note came out the first
generation we were in Brussels we were
out we were in Barcelona with Tony and I
would see all these people from you know
from these Asian companies all of them
having a galaxy note and I'm like how
can they carry that Gigantor phone I'm
like that that goes from big too
ridiculous I will never use that phone
and now i use a galaxy note 2 so you
know i feel i was wrong about the galaxy
note it's sold it sell it so like
hotcakes it's expensive and people want
it um so i think that's a good point i'm
am sorry it's because it you're
absolutely right that gig note is a
perfect example of what i was talking
about yeah it's I mean wife anyway what
benefit do I have from a phone aside
from the fact that it's big so this time
I have the opportunity to not only get a
phone it's not really small it's not big
but it's not small but I also get the
added benefit of saving me cash on a
camera because point you know it's come
to the point where point and shoot
cameras are gonna die next year they're
just gonna die I mean right now if you
know if you don't buy a mirrorless
camera you can't really tell the
difference between the the photos of my
iphone 5 and the one of my sony
cybershot you just can't tell the
difference unless you you can shell the
the 500 bucks you'll need for us
mirrorless camera the point and shoot
cameras are gonna die especially with
this phone that's my perspective I feel
that if people learn to find out if
people were willing to buy the note 2
they were there gonna be willing to buy
this phone well well the point and shoot
here's a problem
I just want to close out the note
discussion the galaxy note was exclusive
to AT&amp;amp;T and it did okay the galaxy note
2 did much better and it wasn't
exclusive to 18 so we might prefer the
very the variance of the 1022 land
before we had a big move here no III
feel it again didn't Stephen Elop say
there was gonna be another Lumia event
like quote unquote soon maybe I don't
know yeah he did he hinted at something
at the very end of the thing you you
were listening and I was yeah yeah yeah
I don't really hear again it this is I
think tell you have a point this is not
going to be the phone but it's gonna be
the seed for this will be the future
this will be the note to the note 2 and
the 1020 successor will be the note 2
yeah and and the reason people pay for
the note 2 they pay the extra money is
because it offers something unique and
that's something that the 1020 does and
the successor will do and that's pure
view that's nice well you know there's
the thing that's speculation I like that
okay here's the thing what does the note
to give you that's actually better than
anything else I mean the pen input on
that phone is terrible what do you learn
about it is what do you think what kind
did you say on the note 2 how often do
you use the S Pen well I use it pretty
often yeah when I use the note 2 I use
the S Pen quite often and all the time I
yeah I don't well maybe one of the lucky
eighty-five percent of people that
actually don't and you're on a dime oh I
have a fine experience with the S Pen on
the note 2 I have a good area the S Pen
on the note 80 fine okay I'll take it
back the the input on that phone is not
that bad it's just not perfect you know
it wasn't writing an editorial right
after this so it's good to have this
conversation yeah but I do feel that the
Nokia that Nokia is nailing a more
ubiquitous feature with a camera yeah
yeah you know we're gonna we're gonna
see how it is i I've been thinking as
we've been talking about this about my
forthcoming trip to the ATT store and
about what I'm gonna have to like sell
to justify this this purchase but you
know it's the first time in a long time
I've actually been been amped enough to
want to do that and I think it's going
to capture the hearts of the
squad I think it's going to do what the
HTC One did for for HTC index past past
quarter where it's like wow every
technique in the world loves this thing
it must be worth looking at say well
tumors well it still didn't save HTC
because they're still losing money well
yeah and speaking of that actually
Nokia's numbers came out this morning do
we have a story up on this yet I don't
know I just asked me that our front page
yeah Nokia's financials came out and yes
commenters as I'm waiting for this page
loaded yes we know it's nakia in some
parts of the world not here in America
no okay Stephen Elop even says nokia now
he's Canadian yeah yeah whatsapp Samsung
teases octa no we don't have this story
up why don't we have the story of now
maybe it's not that great nokia
financials results and reports from
nokia financials nokia uh i'm glad i'm
the only one looking this happen here
i'll join you thanks thanks thanks bro
well I'm it has an excuse hehe is he's
got no power his other hand is Fanning
him or blowing him siam for forbes has
an interesting line of forbes has a good
headline on this story that is nokia q2
2013 figures from nokia and blackberry
reveal the third ecosystem winner and of
course we know who that is its it is
windows phones at the moment but it
looks like you know windows phone
powered lumia handsets where they're at
7.4 million yeah they're selling on
lumia now then BlackBerry's selling all
their blackberry lineup including the 7
device right so yeah if you in if you
omit the blackberry 7 devices i think
blackberry tenant said only did like to
point something million in the last
quarter so this is yeah BlackBerry's
reported q2 number was 6.8 million and
then if you take out the the other ones
it's just 2.7 million for the bb10 stuff
but just talking about Windows Phone I
don't know how the numbers compare
quarter over quarter or year over a year
it looks like mobile phone sales are
down for nokia of 5 million versus 53
million you
yeah Wow well net sales were 233 million
i guess that's pounds up eight percent
sequentially or quarter to kind of sift
through this really quickly adds a lot
of one it's so Italy you know that the
story will be will be up probably by the
time the podcast lands I hope and you'll
be able to check out the numbers there
we are not gonna get too deep into
Nokia's financials I just wanted to
touch on it real quick and see you know
hey the news is that they're still
selling Lumia phones and that's cool and
the Lumia 625 is going to join the ranks
there this is rumored to be what the
biggest nokia windows phone in history
or the biggest windows care skin 7-inch
display I mean that's the fact of Titan
to him and the Titan let's just skip
there's no point there and say it's an
emerging market phone I you know I wish
they would come out what I wish they
wouldn't have kept the Asha and probably
brought like a watered down version of
Windows Phone to run on the Asha and
left that as the low end phones and then
kept the Lumia as the high-end
smartphones because having high-end
Lumias and low in Lumias is just
confusing I hate that with the galaxy
lineup yeah I also agree i think i would
have preferred that the lumia brand be
reserved for higher end devices but of
course that's not the case at all yeah
the 625 looks just interesting from the
perspective of having the biggest screen
of a lumia device at 4.7 inches but oh
really care about isn't it yeah because
I've reviewed the Samsung ETFs with its
four point eight inch display and you
know I don't know exactly you know 4.8
inches it fine I mean whatever windows
phone doesn't need to be big but yeah
emerging markets big deal as high my
says let's let's go ahead and move past
that that's not big news the sorry I was
yawning you saw the final bit of news in
the Windows Phone section is that halo
Spartan assault is gonna arrive for the
Windows Phone halo game now let me tell
you guys I'm not a gamer I I like
playing games on occasion but one of the
only games I've played extensively
basically is halo so this is part of the
reason it's in the lineup but also
seeing microsoft launched a version
of this immensely popular game on
windows phone is like this bomb for
years of frustration I remember the
first time I heard about Windows Phone
in 2010 windows phone 7 I was like yes
well you know we know it's going to be
an awesome gaming platform because look
at what Microsoft's doing with Xbox and
four-year update they have absolutely
failed to leverage that I mean yeah you
can get your little xbox what do you
call that what do you call your
character your gaming care I don't know
your avatar or whatever the hell can I
can I get that on there and all that
kind of crap but you you've not been
able to get awesome titles on Windows
Phone can i watered down you're not yet
i'm still knows i'm still looking i'm
still excited let me be happy about this
for one more second and while i am i
will note that i think Adam Lane last
night went to the launch yeah II for
this and yeah somebody have a video up
we have a video up already yeah good so
know what are you gonna do come come
come and pee in my cereal what's up let
me turn your expresso into an americano
I'm a raccoon in the garbage can Rivera
go ahead why is this a top okay so halo
is a first-person shooter right yes
really it's a 3d graphics game that was
invented in the times of me playing in a
fort 486 computer with Wolfenstein 3d oh
yeah okay it's a flare I'm trying to
understand why is it that I can play
even Wolfenstein on you know in
first-person shooter games why is the
halo version of Windows Phone a top
camera down game that reminds me of the
games that I used to play before
Wolfenstein wait like Grand Theft Auto
to wait like is it is buddy i'm watching
the trailer right now and the trailer
has a lot of interesting scenery and
blah okay so here's gameplay and yeah it
is top-down isn't it well I imagine they
did this to to cater to the the phone
interface because first-person shooters
are tough to do on a phone like I've
definitely do him on the phone I've
played wolf and sign on a phone and it
sucks because you have to overlay the
controls right on the action have you
ever played nova 3
on on on a phone or play which is the
other one modern combat they're awesome
and what is the excuse me I mean why is
it that we have modern combat already
and we can't get halo to look like but
okay fine it's not going to be just as
exact as it is on the computer but then
we've got death space which is not
exactly the same thing that we see on
the game console and it's a first person
shooter you know I gotta say that's
that's true i just watched that whole
trailer and I i don't think i will enjoy
learning how to do that top-down stuff
um you know i'll say that was it like
gun bros or whatever that was fun to
play us top down so gun bros yeah oh you
know what forget it i'm just playing
dough pours from from now on that's all
I'm doing love the game back in the day
I'm sorry I'm just I'm really
disappointed in Halo I was expecting
like this bombshell amazing gaming
experience coming from the Masters of
halo the owners of halo Microsoft them
as it turns out you haven't played it
yet you just can it's not a veteran mad
you like we don't know how good it is
what yeah what I love video games I hate
halo you know that's alright man that's
fine halo all my friends are like you're
an idiot I've played it I've played it I
hate it I know that's a good I I will
tell you is a sins creed I respect but I
don't like playing just cuz I don't like
the I don't like being in the first one
I don't like wandering around you know a
desert village it's not it's not what
I'm into you should play the the latest
i want to put it easy that's a pirate
ship one no well that's coming today I'm
talking about I'm talking about the
Civil War I don't care about that either
I want oh I want ships anyway hey
let's talk about Android are we done
with windows from can we move on yeah
yeah yeah let's go yes we guess what got
announced this morning we know this
because of my sweet lead and HTC I love
this because HTC hinted at this last
night of their Twitter accounts like we
have a little announcement tomorrow and
it's you know little was in quotes and
then donessa who hangs out with us and
our live broadcast a lot was like I
wonder what it is or something like that
in HTC was like care to take a guess and
then she was like I think she guessed
like the phablet or something like she
guessed something that wasn't little at
all
and I was like no donessa come on it's
the it's the desire 200 and then I was
completely wrong it's the one mini so
everybody was wrong last night ah do not
guess the one mini I don't know I just
don't think about the one mini a lot you
know why because next to the one it's me
looks the same size to me I know yeah
but it's on it I'm visible it's not a
one it is not one I I am disappointed I
mean how can it be that this phone looks
exactly like a one it's all the sizes
almost so similar I mean okay so I'm
gonna quote I'm a quote I'm going to
quote the hands-on video that I saw last
night from the verge they did a good job
it's just funny how black comes up to
the guy this is the HTC more sales I
don't know what representative in London
and he's like this is the HTC One
experience in a smaller package with no
compromise and so he's like okay he's
like okay so we don't have it aya and
and the sales guy it's not even Vlad
comes up and he's like okay it doesn't
have an IR blaster the camera doesn't
have optical livid civilization like the
one this is only 16 gigabytes it does
not have an NFC antenna but this is the
HTC what experience with no that's never
again 400 yet you do so just just shades
and so you could just hear blad you can
just hear black big like uh yeah except
for everything you just said right now
don't know right I think I believe my no
compromises like the the you know it's
aluminum it's still aluminum self no
compromise I think I could just imagine
blast face with his eyes popped out and
be like right so they just so you know
listeners the specs on this or 4.3 and
720p display which is pretty cool ppi is
through 41 it's 122 grams which is super
light the it is powered by a Snapdragon
400 dual-core obviously clock at one
point 4 gigahertz with a gig of ram and
like Taylor said 16 gigs the batteries
1800 milliamp hours android 42 silver
and black Wow listen I I still think
that's an ok spec load I think it's
hilarious that they're bent billing this
is no compromise that's very funny but
this is as much a mini HTC One as the
Gaga she is
cs4 yes Jinxy ona pizza okay what first
was what one question pizza man yeah um
so the only reason why you're able to
put up with that the 4 megapixel camera
on the HTC One is because you've got
optical image stabilization and
therefore you have great low-light
photography pretty much so how are you
going to put up with a 4 megapixel
camera without that do you think that
this that it's gonna hurt the brand
actually I do you know I think this
phone will be swept under the rug faster
than they can launch it you know here's
the thing if if this thing were notably
smaller then yeah like the original
right like that would then then it would
all make sense to me but it you if you
look at the videos and no we don't have
one so you know we'll get it we'll get
it soon but when you look at the videos
that other sites have done these phones
look almost identical they look almost
identical I mean you can't tell the
difference I mean they put the HTC one
right beside it and I was like which is
which I I'm serious oh yeah for a second
there I was like in today how in God's I
mean what is the design process that
leads to this it's like okay well we
have whatever whatever we say the screen
size was 4.3 we have a lot of 4.3 inch
panels to you know that we have access
to or we have we have this you know well
yeah but we did not we did not sell the
HTC first so we need to gather to those
panels guys think of something Thank
asunder and what can we do that's pretty
much what happened it's fascinating yeah
but what what HTC needs to do what would
really just change the game for them is
to make a smaller high-end device make
something like the size of the desire to
100 may make something the size of the
the iphone of that yeah make a 720p
phone 4 inches put a Snapdragon 600 in
it 2 gigs of ram 16 gigabytes and up to
64 decent sized battery I'm just saying
make an HTC One the size of the iphone
you can do that it's possible yeah the
only problem is it yes you have less
space inside the phone but the
components aren't that much
different well I you know I was going to
advocate making one with a 4.3 inch
screen and just slimming down the bezels
to a ridiculous degree and i don't mean
the side once I mean the top ones but
then of course you lose boomsound and
they're not going to do that and I don't
think they should know they need to make
their constrained by boom sound which is
great it's a good thing to be
constrained by because it's awesome is
one my favorite feature it is man but
this phone is like oh god you know as
the guy kept talking I'm like okay why
didn't you just snap the one of the old
eight megapixel cameras from like the
HTC One X or something on that phone and
it would probably not be as bad as it's
going to turn out to be I mean what's
the point about having this phone that
looks like another if it's not going to
perform at all like the other yeah you
know it this may be a case as we're
talking about this now and I'm realizing
we're just crapping all over this thing
like this may be the case of getting one
in the hand and realizing how different
it is because the iphone 5 to me when I
saw it pictured was just an iphone 4 and
I was like I'm very disappointed and
then I saw one and it was like oh wow
this is actually way different yeah you
know when I actually held it so I'm
remember wait to hold it for anyone who
says that we're in HTC's pocket for
anyone who says that you know we are
just shills for HTC I would like to
point out as I already have and we have
not had hands-on time with this device
yet so boom yep eat it I want to add one
thing um yeah I reviewed the first the
HTC burst and it had pretty much
identical specs to this except for I had
a 5 megapixel camera instead of four and
actually really liked the phone I mean
it was too small for my taste but it was
actually a decent phone and if you don't
do a lot of gaming that phone is all
you'll ever need really but in the same
respect don't call it a one unless it's
a one basically that's my only beef with
this phone it's not a one following in
the red in the footsteps of the s for a
minute like you say you know yeah we
will have to wait and see we'll have to
see what happens when we get our hands
on it let's talk about the LG optimus
strikethrough g2 LG's finally dropped
the optimist brand name the LG gggggg
too so this is my problem right when
your brand name and when your
when your master brand is his two
letters should you should you make your
model numbers letters and numbers as
well it's just confusing to me I
actually liked the optimist brand name I
thought it stood out do you think that
the what do you think there was the
source of this have they commented on
that um they were actually sued by it
was a Hasbro you know I know their owns
the rights to transformers right but
aspirin and a sous was sued by them to
write the transformer prime or the
transformer yeah yeah they tried to do
something with it so when they bail
Jesusita so as well really ya think so I
feel I feel like I read that somewhere
LG Optimus lawsuit help me Google now
these are all product things anyway we
can probably find that link if anybody
finds it let me know anyway regardless
of the reason for it it's now just the
LG g2 that I will be going to New York
City to check out presumably if that's
indeed what they're announcing on the
seventh which I think it is well maybe
they didn't and I felt like they did but
maybe they decided that then I mean I
don't know yeah either way either way
they need something more than just LG g2
because it sounds ridiculous it does LG
also announced I didn't think about this
this is from Anton's news post LG
announced that its phablets will be
renamed to simply view as the company
appears to drop the outdoor from the
list yeah let's not talk about the view
yeah so let's move on the Nexus 7 i'm
sorry i dropped the wrong link in there
for you guys but the Nexus 7 has been
leaked by someone I think this was
brought to us by Android Central posted
this and we were you posted their video
which is underscored entirely by the
android central theme so you can watch a
mr. blurry blurry cam video of the
supposed new Nexus 7 with some sweet
techno dance beat behind it that's nice
fun yeah I was like I was like when
there's an excuse to use the full pocket
now theme and a commercial like we did
for the forum singers I love our theme
so hard so I get up I'm not gonna say
anything the top comment on that video
is all
dragging of yester you have like a
hundred likes that top comment that that
go read that on that video I want to is
it on our centers on Android Central
don't know I will tell you what potato
did you film this with all right so
anyway the video aside this is uh this
looks to be maybe maybe the new Nexus 7
I you know we have a google event that's
going to tool and that's good scheduled
for next week that I'm sure will be
reporting on what that's going to be on
thee what day july twenty fourth so next
next wednesday maybe these things are
related we will have to see i know i'm
not going to talk about the nexus 7
right now because I don't even know how
to how to do a Segway you know how to do
sex work I mean it could but you and
you're already doing it you're already
doing it you're doing it right now it's
great I just got to say say the next
thing we're talking about it's fun let's
live on the air Taylor mart is a sweater
segue well you know we shut up Taylor
just do the Segway cat b15 let me see
what I'm see what I might convince and
it just says it see ya we happen it just
says honest I don't get her after I'm
trying to compete with you on this and I
can't just I am 15 like I can't do this
yeah the cat b15 so it is a fun story
about I will say this how about this I
grew up around around cat caterpillar
bulldozers and everything so my dad
would actually really like this exactly
why I may need you to do the same way
but you know maybe you know you didn't
know that beer did I grew Brown
bulldozers I have a pair tell you grow
up in super Carolina I knew you'd grew
up around bulldoze I have a pair of
caterpillar shoes that I was gonna say
if I wish I had cat boots cuz i would
have warned him when I was throwing this
thing on the river yesterday I do those
are Brogan's they didn't write the cat
b15 is a super rugged android phone we
checked out in barcelona and there was
divided there were divided directives
from the top i'm going to share some
pocket now insider info with you guys
and with everyone there was a division
of opinion above me as to whether or not
we should secure this device and we did
because i argued for it but i think it's
going to be a
because I don't think a lot of people
care about it but oddly enough
commenters were asking for this when I
was doing the galaxy s4 active stuff
like every I don't know 50th comment or
some of those I was like what about the
cat b15 like you know about the cat b15
who knows about this thing so we secured
it and we've unboxed it and we've put it
up against every single waterproof phone
we have in the office and the Boston
browsers that's a good video that's a
good video thanks bro appreciate it I
didn't get to watch it because the
internet here slow it would have taken
like three hours to buffer it's cool man
I believe you that's fine but it's a fun
video I throw it in the river a couple
times it's great but mainly the reason I
bring it up the reason it's in the
rundown and we'll move on after this is
if you have a question about it a topic
for it we can't do a pocket now you
review episode based on it because it
just won't like nobody will come but
things leave a comment in either the
under the YouTube feed on the comments
at pocketnow.com or in the forums at
forums pocketnow.com because if there's
something else I can do with this phone
before sending it back to our friends at
clove I would really really like to do
that because it's it's a fun beastly
phone to mess with and with that said do
you guys want to touch on tablets real
quick because Taylor and I have a little
have a little we're tablet buddies now
aren't we tapped as I've got way too
many tablets right now yeah you have my
old xperia z or not mine but pocket now
sold Xperia tablet Z I do and you also
though more interestingly have a the
android tablet the nexus 10 yeah but
have an android tablet with a home
button on the wrong side of the display
yes I do Taylor has to go to have 10 the
Galaxy Tab 3 10 point 0 which won't saw
10.1 he is a worse Oh Dane for tablet
ever yeah well before yoga's matched
only by the galaxy tab 3 8 point oh yeah
galaxy tab 3 10.1 galaxy God can you
imagine to every time out how to reward
that every time I tried a core galaxy
tab 3 10.1 I end up saying galaxy tab
10.1 3 or galaxy tab 3 point you should
check out my comparison to see the
outtake when I try to say galaxy tab 3 8
point 0 vs galaxy note
point out like it's lie it's frickin
impossible and why did they just say
Galaxy Note 8 why do we have to be point
0138 point I'm lioness is there good is
there gonna be a 10.1 or a 10.2 or an
8.1 oh I do it they do it so that
commenters can argue about whether dot
or point is more appropriate in the
comments that's why they do it it's a
servicer I'm serious burn I I enjoyed it
doing filming my comparison though of
the tab 3 versus the no date because I
did it in this kind of industrial park
and I got this really cool a bunch of
really cool footage and like nice color
of like oxidized rusts running down a
asphalt driveway and moss coming up and
I guess I'm actually really nice shots
but the whole time I'm filming these
beautiful passes of these devices on
concrete like just outside the frame and
I mean literally just outside the frame
there was a dead rat and it's ruled
atrocious and I didn't discover it until
the end of the day and I was like oh
this is gross no one of the flies have
been eating me alive so you're welcome
everyone for undergoing that but I've
been having a ball with location
shooting recently Cambridge has some
really fun place nice what phones
outside yeah but I need to find some
around my new area but um yeah the list
let's agree to call him um galaxy tab 3
8 decimal zero and then galaxy tab 3
idea 10 decimal one completely we do
this for now and let lately let's agree
to segue to the next topic because these
two tablets are not gonna sell sounds it
well that's the thing i should segue to
the next topic because this is something
that is compelling to me but i do want
to make the parting point that as I say
in that comparison I just don't see a
reason why listen I the last thing I
want to do is come across as somebody
who doesn't think money should be an
object cuz I understand it's a big it's
a big deal for a lot of people for me
included but if the difference in price
between the Galaxy Note 8 0 and the
galaxy tab 3 8 point 0 is eighty dollars
I mean you're already spending at least
three hundred dollars right yeah yep
you've got to assume I've got that a
large portion of buyers who have that
money who have that money are going to
be able to spend the extra
d bucks for a much what appears to me to
be a much better product in the Galaxy
Note II yeah I haven't done the
comparison that I'm going to finish it
today but I've said the exact same thing
at the end of the script we can't figure
out why the tab 3 10.1 exists when you
have the tab to 10.1 and the galaxy nate
galaxy note 10.1 because the galaxy note
is or the samsung or the nexus 10 you
can access a note 10.1 yeah the tint
note 10.1 has much better specifications
and it's about a hundred dollars more at
retail value but the tab 3 10.1 has the
exact same specifications as the tab to
10.1 saved for the intel atom processor
and it's in anything worse is the fact
that none of them are going to sell
anyways because nobody likes Samsung
tablets well the notes samsung temples
are the most popular Android tablets ya
know yeah so so so one of themselves
200,000 units said Sampson sales 300,000
let's move on time is done talking about
android tablet that's okay this is your
baby you know we're gonna have this
we're gonna have the more of us to talk
about next weekend away because we're
gonna have a tab 10 review and we're
gonna have a tab 3 8 review so you know
it's just it's just the funniest thing I
mean nobody I just I can't understand
why Samsung has not figured it out I
just all my friends come up to me and
they're like why would I want to bias
galaxy tab if I can buy an ipad that's
whenever whenever people come up to me
with that argument i'm like damn Sampson
you're really having a hard time here
aren't you you know it's funny I'm it
like if Taylor is the segway crusher
Jaime is the king of saying let's skip
it and then talking about it for another
five minutes yes all right listen here
jerks I want to talk about my new
favorite android phone can we do that
please can we oh no guys here's the
thing Samsung has released folding
android phones before they have released
clamshell android phones for China and
they've been you know beset with model
numbers like SCH v40 200x and it's like
okay we're never gonna see this thing
this is the first folding android phone
I've seen with a with a galaxy brand
name it's the samsung galaxy folder
which was tipped than I can't what what
is that a lame name is a folder galaxy
folder couldn't come up with something a
little better than calling the phone
folder you know it's funny like I agree
with you like I agree it's kind of a
lame Brandon but I'm instantly defensive
on behalf of this phone cuz I like it so
much so I'm like shut up Taylor well sir
listen I like it shut up I really want
one of these I I don't think Samsung the
America will I don't know wait I don't
think we'll ever see this come to the
States but if it does I really really
want it I've Tony can if Anton can get
ahold of this through sent with one of
the samsung's European outlets I would
pay him for the shipping that's how much
I want this guy's listeners it's not
it's not impressive it's just a
clamshell phone it's got a you know
numeric keypad and it's got what does it
look like 23 points something inch
displays we don't know what the size of
the displays are it's really small I
just okay I want a flip phone I've
always wanted you know you remember
those days when motorola you remember
that MPX to tune in 202 20 yeah yeah
yeah but ok but you remember that there
was a 300 that was rumored that was
actually a dual flip phone it had two
hinges it never came to the market never
made with yeah it would flip to the
right and it would be a full keyboard
but then you can flip it up and it would
be like a numeric keypad yep and I want
I was like I would I waited for that
phone so long and Motorola never
announced that it was it was go ahead I
was gonna say it's like the it's like a
smartphone version of the oh god alias
the samsung alias all right with the
keys yeah yes similar to that duel him
setting yeah so so here's I do want a
flip phone I just I would rather have a
kyocera torque with two screens um then
having an echo then then have a new
method yeah sorry gecko then have a
numeric keypad I just I love the concept
I love the idea I would have just loved
two displays on a flip design and a sous
has done it with with a tablet recently
I just I I do want it for me clamshell
phones or the
call quality products out there because
the the microphone is directly below
your mouth and I contrast to your face
and the contours to your face in a
satisfying way by snap shut yeah I love
opening it i love pulling on my pocket
and flipping it open listen for me for
me the the days of the motorola startac
now I we just pull it off we have a hole
that I eat a case and flip it open with
one finger that was a great thread about
clamshell phones and extendable antennas
coming on in the forums right now
actually there's a whole sub forum for
nostalgia and somebody posted a startac
picture yesterday I think and it was
great and then and then Taylor just just
something would you send us a flip
concept since you render yeah I wrote
about that thing when i first started at
phoneDog and I it stuck with me ever
since like this is something I wish
existed we're gonna distract we'll go
ahead and drop this this photo in the in
the post so that you listed can see what
it is I'm gonna find a better picture
because there are better pictures I
guess my biggest concern with this with
this concept Michael is that I guess the
curity keyboard is dead isn't it wait a
minute oh you mean the physical QWERTY
keyboard yeah the physical curity
keyboard is dead yeah pretty much if
that's that then the numeric keypad was
dead even before that so I I don't feel
I do feel that there's a lot of waste of
space I feel that the concept would be
awesome with a dual screen phone and if
they could figure out a way to actually
have those two snap together in a way
that this would turn into like a really
long phone that would be awesome it
would a form factor is something that I
really would like more manufacturers to
play with but I don't want to spoil a
forthcoming editorial from adam dodd so
i won't so you know i'm just going to
keep my fingers crossed that we see the
galaxy folder in some kind of wide
release that we can get our hands on it
and that i can shoot a video of me
spending a day with a flip android phone
again because yeah I guess I guess my
biggest problem is it's gonna be it's
gonna be an entry-level phone and that's
gonna be sad yeah cuz it's wvga and it's
not too impressive it Taylor yeah it's
okay i was going to say that I wish
Samsung had come up with another brand
instead of galaxies for this and maybe
called it like vanilla or something
oh that's a good idea that's a good idea
sure it's nothing I dropped another link
in the chat yeah yes forever at it but
they grabbed your photo you guys if you
guys remember the code name for HTC what
which was it touch flow in the past
before it became sense the code name was
vanilla yeah yeah what manila folder is
not a phone that I'm ever gonna carry
well I would never carry a galaxy folder
so well there you go the day but this is
why you and I just just can never be
friends in real life it's a shame look
at look at our galaxy folder oh wow look
at the shall we talk very briefly
because we don't have much time left
Taylor Martin wrote a great piece about
the changing status of upgrades on
American carriers and it was called our
t-mobile's jump and eighties next worth
the extra cash and of course now we can
add verizon's what is it edge or
something to that yeah peezy edge yeah
so the real question I have Taylor is
already stated by your headline are they
these are the new early upgrade programs
for those carriers by the way if you
don't you're not familiar with them that
allow you to upgrade your phone more
than once every two years in exchange
for some some green every month so
what's the story Taylor well first I
would like to be referred to as Taylor
mathematician Martin firm for the next
10 minutes no icing all you have is two
and a half minutes on this segment so
move on I did I spent so much time tony
was like you're you just moved you've
got to get everything in order so just
don't spend a lot of time on on this
today and I started crunching lost 30
seconds go ahead like it's like
impossible not to spend time on this
yeah I started crunching numbers and it
just it took longer and longer and in it
I looked at the word count and I'm like
1500 words I'm like okay I've got to cut
some words out of this and really just
figure out what I'm talking about and
after i started crunching numbers like I
originally thought both of these are
terrible I would never ever ever even
consider doing one of these or using one
of these programs
and and now that I'd crunched numbers
and looked through them and figured
everything out I actually would AT&amp;amp;T
next absolutely not I would not
recommend it to anyone why is that and
the the reason behind it is you're still
contracted right so t-mobile this this
concept only really works if you're not
on a contract because with AT&amp;amp;T every
phone they sell is subsidized even if
you buy a phone with no contract you're
still paying for the subsidized price of
the phone in your monthly bill so all of
their services calling your minutes text
messages and data are all marked up for
the loss to cover the loss that they
have in subsidized phone so they sell
you a phone or twenty dollars we were
talking about this earlier you get a
phone sign it to your agreement for two
hundred dollars and AT&amp;amp;T eats four
hundred five hundred dollars each time
somebody buys a phone right and they
make that up over the next two years so
you know that you know the funniest
thing is for example if you want if you
want an earlier an early upgrade on an
iphone i think the penalty is 200 bucks
yeah so once you start crunching these
numbers you figure out that the price
you're paying for hardware and your
monthly bill could be anywhere from
maybe ten dollars to thirty dollars
nobody really knows how much it is yeah
per month you're paying for this phone
even if you don't use 18x so say you buy
a galaxy s4 you're paying anywhere from
10 to maybe thirty dollars per month for
the hardware and if you look at and by
the end of your 24 month contract you've
paid them way more than what the phone
is actually worth but if you look at
AT&amp;amp;T next if you look at AT&amp;amp;T next the
galaxy s4 is 32 dollars per month to
finance it so no down payment note no
interest nothing is 32 dollars a month
and that sounds good because after a
year when you can cut your eligible for
another upgrade you've only paid is it
340 some dollars I've got it in here
somewhere and I'll say you're talking
you're talking about t-mobile's jump
them now your time i do i'm talking
about a teensy next yeah yeah i'll get
to
jump in a minute so yeah whatever it is
it doesn't matter what the number is
your your ping 184 okay yeah 384 over
the course of 12 months for the galaxy
s4 but you're also not including how
much you're paying in your bill and
that's only yeah that's only 12 months
and you're eligible for another upgrade
and you can change phones but say you
don't you can keep paying those
installments for eight more months and
you can call the phone yours after you
do that you've actually paid almost nine
hundred dollars for the galaxy s4 what
doesn't so damn sense at all it doesn't
make any sense because you're actually
paying yeah you're paying more in every
way you look at it you're getting double
charged for that phone except you're
doing it over yet that but but the the
thinking goes that people are not going
to plan their budget two years in
advance because really you know nobody
outside of very very smart people do
that yeah so so they were like oh well I
can if I can avoid paying as much at the
store if I can just push that cost
further into the future that's fine if I
can spread it out and then then that's
valuable but of course they're getting
screwed yeah yep and with tmobile next
it's a lot more t-mobile next t-mobile
jump whoo yeah it with tmobile jump it's
a totally different story because you're
not contracted t-mobile doesn't do
contracts anymore and what happens is
the price of the phone is not included
in the price of your service so the most
you're going to pay t-mobile for one
line is seventy dollars a month because
that's unlimited everything so seventy
dollars a month so that includes no
price for hardware so you buy your phone
either outright or you get it on an
installment plan and those covers the
exact mug yeah you put a down payment of
maybe one hundred and fifty dollars down
and you pay twenty dollars a month and
the ends when you pay the phone off you
don't keep paying and keep paying it it
ends when the film is paid off and it's
yours so that that's how t mobile works
the only thing they've done with tmobile
jump is at a ten dollar per month fee so
you pay ten dollars a month and it
covers insurance and allows you to
upgrade every six months and that's so
awesome yes you can upgrade twice per
year
and you pay an upfront costs and twenty
dollars per month for the phone so you
you're paying actually a total of thirty
large per month bore so you'd be paying
around a hundred dollars per month for
your service the device and the ability
to upgrade early which and that amounts
to oh yeah it amounts to a hundred and
twenty dollars per year to upgrade twice
per year which is a great which is ideal
yeah what is it's actually a very good
deal you're not paying and you for
anything plus you're getting an
insurance bundled in with that as well
exactly so they're real pretty much just
financing the phone but it's really at a
very low at a very low rate you know
it's like if they're not really making
money for the phone they're not they're
not there they're making their their
normal profit that they would make if
they sold retail value yeah i know i'd
retail yeah yeah they're making the same
amount of money so say they buy the
phone from sated by an iphone from apple
for well there's no margin on my iphone
SE dig by the galaxy s4 from samsung
each unit is approximately like say five
hundred and fifty dollars and they sell
them for 650 or 630 yeah so they're
making a few you know they're making
about a hundred dollars on a phone so
they're not making a much they're
they're making all their money and
services but that's awesome i mean
that's really the way the business
should be connect so the same concept
from AT&amp;amp;T completely fails because they
double charged you for everything
basically right but but people are not
going to be i mean i'm glad that you
wrote this piece and I'm glad other
people are writing similar pieces
because maybe AT&amp;amp;T won't will tweak that
and maybe VZ edge won't be as horrible a
deal because people need to be informal
but what I doubt it I doubt it too I did
you mention VZ edge will be the exact
same thing is next yeah I agree my
principal take away from all this is
that one Taylor I'm glad you did this
piece because I never would have gotten
through it I cannot handle that much
numerical action and do I'm sad once
again that that t-mobile and I are not a
good fit for each other because that
sounds great i think i would really
enjoy jump and yeah i think i'm gonna
sign up for yeah well it you know i wish
good but uh you know 18 G's device
election and you issued coverage just
serve me better in my market so that's
unfortunate but yeah I guess that's the
unfortunate part of team over there
services like well it depends on where
you live though I mean it like with all
its ok here in Charlotte yeah it depends
on where you where you are that's that's
great I thank you Taylor for informing
me of yet something else I cannot take
advantage of I'm going to be buying a
phone for 650 bucks next week yeah yeah
me too probably maybe yeah but yeah i
will say i want to add one thing to that
and that is that another part of this
that i've included in that editorial is
that you can sell your phones privately
for you can actually turn a profit way
to do it right right on ebay or
something yeah yeah but you can also do
it in a way that you come out even so
you're not paying 120 dollars for jump
so you buy every phone outright and you
sell it and then you turn that money
around and just keep buying phones
perpetually and eventually you're gonna
start losing money but yeah you know
they're there are other ways to do it we
have we generally wrap up the show on
listener mail guys but we are wrapping
up a pretty busy week here so i think
we're just gonna call it early today
