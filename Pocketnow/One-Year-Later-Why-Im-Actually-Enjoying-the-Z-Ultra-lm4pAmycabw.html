Xperia Z ultra and I wasn't all that
impressed so why did I buy one a few
weeks ago I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is why one year later
I'm actually happy with the Z ultra a
few weeks ago I picked up the Google
Play edition Z ultra vise Oni yeah I
know it doesn't seem to make a lot of
sense
I reviewed its next of kin the Xperia Z
ultra about a year ago and let's just
say it wasn't the best phone I'd ever
reviewed it was plagued with issues
namely touch screen sensitivity problems
it wasn't running the latest firmware
either because it wasn't available for
that specific model yet meaning it was
missing the ex reality engine the
software to make the display really pop
and worst of all it was the
International model which did get HSPA+
on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but switched to
edge the majority of the time I used it
in other words I had to carry the
biggest smartphone on the market around
for roughly one week it barely fit in my
pocket or stuck on 2g most the time and
my Scrolls were mistaken for taps or
vice-versa it's difficult to express
exactly how frustrating it is to try to
get an honest opinion on a smart phone
when it only works a fraction of the
time and takes five minutes or so to
refresh Facebook
needless to say my experience with the
Xperia Z ultra was far from favorable
and I never felt like we had a fair
chance together I've never felt like
that about any other phone I've ever
reviewed no other time have I hit
publish on a review and immediately
wanted another week to make sure
everything I said was accurate and for
the record and never second-guessed what
I said about the Xperia Z ultra I just
didn't want it to be true I wanted to
like the phone but in those conditions
it was never going to happen for
starters I've never been a fan of Sony's
custom software it's never brought much
the table and it's not all that pretty
it's just kind of they're not great and
not terrible and it was a missed
opportunity on the Z ultra an
opportunity to put true tablet software
on a smart phone Sony dropped the ball
and reused its small apps feature a
half-measure at best the entire time I
was reviewing the Z ultra I was thinking
this thing would be so much better with
stock Android and I know we say that a
lot outside reviews but it's especially
true with the Z ultra the hardware was
great some of the best at the time and
so few versions of Android went as
smoothly
I the see ultra Snapdragon 800 and 6.4
inch 1080p display were begging to be
set free that's why as soon as the
Google Play edition Z ultra was
announced just a few months later I had
to talk myself out of buying one at six
hundred and fifty dollars plus tax and
shipping the price simply wasn't right I
talked myself out of it again when
Google slashed $200 off the original
price tag I'm not usually the type to
buy an already aged phone but when the
third-party retailer expanses started
selling the Z ultra with a case and
screen protector for just three hundred
and fifty dollars I couldn't say no
anymore
I bought it because every time someone
mentioned the phone it reminded me of
how much I wanted to like it before I
reviewed it and how tainted my review
period was I bought it because I
remembered how it's a better fit for the
dash of my car than the Nexus 7 I bought
it because over the last 12 months its
aged really well the snapdragon 800 2
gigabytes of RAM and 3050 milliamp hour
battery are more than enough so far I've
been very pleased
I don't regret buying it at all and I
was right from the start it's so much
better with stock Android on board the
only things I can't help but feel it's
missing our true simultaneous am signs
multi window feature and a better
speaker after using the m8 for so long
the Z ultra speaker is a joke but hey
water resistance right it's still
ridiculously large and it barely fits in
my pocket it requires two hands to use
at almost all times and I still don't
like the button and port placement but I
can live with all those because right
now the Z ultra fits my needs better
than just about any other phone I can
install this in the dash of my car and
still carry it as my daily driver
something I couldn't do with the Nexus 7
gaming watching movies and reading or
what it's built for and I'm really going
to appreciate that on my flight to
Germany next week and pulling a six
point four inch phone out of your pocket
always gets tons of questions so there's
that
either way I'm satisfied with my
purchase and I finally have that feeling
of resolution after how last year's
review ended folks thanks for watching
