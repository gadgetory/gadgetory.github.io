pocket now face off again for a world
dual core domination this time we've got
a new challenger the Motorola Atrix 4G
up against our reigning champ the
Samsung Galaxy s2
alright let's kick off our face off for
world dual-core domination we're gonna
run through some specs we're going to
boot up both of our contenders and check
for available RAM when we run the
quadrant smart bench and lint pack
protests we're going to do our own
unofficial speed test while they're
gaming comparison as well as wrap this
up with our browser comparison all
rights kicked this off motorola atrix 4g
weighs in at 136 grams it's got a four
inch qHD capacitive touch display
resolution of 540 by 960 offers Gorilla
Glass you've got a front-facing VGA
camera upper left-hand corner and for
touch sensitive keys below the display
May Menu key home key back key as well
as search key all right our reigning
champ galaxy s2 weighs in at 116 grams
definitely the lighter of the two offers
a 4.3 inch Super AMOLED plus capacitive
touch display resolution of 480 by 800
also offers Gorilla Glass upper
left-hand corner 2 megapixel
front-facing camera for video calls and
below the display you have two touch
sensitive keys a menu key back key as
well as one physical home key all right
as far as cameras Atrix 4G offers a 5
megapixel camera with autofocus dual LED
flash geo-tagging as well as image
stabilization video capture is 720p at
30 frames per second galaxy s2 offers an
8 megapixel camera with autofocus LED
flash touch focused geo-tagging face and
smile detection as well as image
stabilization video capture is 1080p and
30 frames per second the battery on the
Atrix 4G the monster 1930 milliamp hour
battery rated at 9 hours of talktime
galaxy s2 1650 milliamp hour battery
rated at 8 hours and 40 minutes of
talktime on 3G memory card on the Atrix
4G is hot swappable on the galaxy s2 it
is not alright
let's get these babies back over and
centered talk about memory atrix 4g
comes with 16 gigabytes of internal
storage one gigabyte of ram on the
galaxy s2 two versions one with 16
gigabytes of internal storage one with
32 gigabytes of internal storage both
come with one gigabyte of ram and on
both phones you can increase internal
storage and additional 32 gigabytes to
the use of a microSD card as far as
processors atrix 4g comes with in videos
one Giga our Tegra 2 dual-core processor
on the galaxy s2 it's Samsung's Exynos
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor
operating system on the Atrix 4G Android
2.2 Froyo galaxy s2 it's Android 2.3
Gingerbread user interface on the Atrix
4G is motoblur and on the galaxy s2 it's
Samsung's TouchWiz 4.0 for us get things
started by booting up our two
contestants and see how much RAM of it
is available after they boot the galaxy
s usually boots up pretty quick HX 4G is
never in too much of a hurry to boot
what's important is how much RAM is
available once we get there so let's
find out
galaxy ass is just about done all right
going to settings
applications running services give that
a minute it's showing 604 megabytes of
free right now 647 there we go
647 640 and still waiting on the Atrix
4G all right let's unlock it go into
settings me want applications there we
go running services all right 566 and 52
so around 610 let's let it settle we're
at 6:38 megabytes of free RAM on the
galaxy s2 what's its matrix settle down
you slip at 49 and 65 it's for 540 so
you worried about 540 on the 545 50 on
the Atrix 4G and 638 on the galaxy s2 so
there's definitely more available ram
after boot on the galaxy s2 alright
let's run the quadrant center benchmark
tests on Atrix 4G in galaxy s2 got a
good clean start alright let's take a
look at our scores on the quadrant
Center benchmark test and on the Atrix
4G a score of 26 30 and on the galaxy s2
a score of 30 177 so our quadrant
standard benchmark test winner is the
galaxy s2 all right let's run our smart
bench test
go clean start on both again alright we
have our results and it looks like we
have a split decision in productivity
index the galaxy s2 4350 versus 28 58 so
big win there for the galaxy s2 games
index Atrix 4G at 24 59 verses 21 89 on
the galaxy s2 so split decision
alright last but not least Lim pack Pro
for Android on the back
mark on both of these and the galaxy s2
came back the winner of 46 megaflops
forty six point nine three nine and one
point seven nine seconds versus thirty
six point eight one seven megaflops in
two point two eight seconds on the Atrix
4G all right let's run our own
unofficial speed test advanced task
killer it's called a background task
Heron will trial try B's accurate as
possible calendar that was definitely
the Atrix 4G Maps I believe that was the
galaxy s2 but that was very close
settings both instantaneous what
settings text messages that seem to be
the galaxy s2 Gmail that seemed to be
the galaxy s2 market galaxy s2 let's try
what do we want to try let's try two
cameras on both definitely the galaxy s2
let's try third-party movies again that
was a galaxy s2 as well so it looks like
our unofficial speed test winner is
going to be the galaxy s2 which is
fitting with the other tests we ran all
right let's try a little gaming I've
turned off the lights hopefully give you
a little better view of the graphics
we're gonna load raging thunder - I'm
gonna do a lap on both I can't guarantee
entertainment value out of that give you
a chance to see how they load and looks
like they load about the same just a
little quicker but my finger might have
been a little quicker we'll start with
the Atrix 4G they got I'm doing this for
camera lens so
all right the bath bed all right let's
try the galaxy s2
we got taken out there huh
all right looking a little gaming on
both of our combatants alright let's
wrap up today's pocket out faceoff with
our four world dual core domination
between the Atrix 4G and Samsung Galaxy
s2 with our browser comparison I've got
that had the display set on automatic
brightness through the entire face off
I've gotten both running off the same
Wi-Fi network I've got flash enabled on
both they both been updated to Adobe
Flash 10.3 and I clear the cache and
history on both so I think that's enough
chatter let's put these guys to their
paces and we'll start with Engadget as
soon as I can find it there it is own
one and there it is on the other and
we're off then they're both good out of
the box looks like the Galaxy S there's
a little bit of a lead while there goes
the Galaxy s2 is done and as you can see
smooth as butter
titania is supposed to be smooth as silk
whatever you want to call it it's very
smooth double tap to zoom in alright HX
4G is done also pretty smooth not as
smooth but up there look at that
definitely a better showing in the
optimus 2x double tap to zoom in pinch
to zoom no problems double tap to rewrap
reformat the text double tap to zoom all
the way out look I got the story didn't
want to do that let's go back double tap
to zoom out very responsive matrix good
showing any rendering issues doesn't
look like it
galaxy s2 again looks gorgeous
very very smooth of the two it's
definitely the smoother of the two if
that's proper English alright let's head
over to pocket now on our two combatants
here and there it is on one and there
where is it on the other I know you're
right here come on there we go and we're
off
Oh gave a little head start to the Atrix
4G see if we can take advantage of it
doesn't look like it's going to happen
again the galaxy s2 is running Android
2.3 Gingerbread and it the browser is
extremely quick although here comes the
Atrix 4G they're up to the point where
it's loading the flash so we're gonna
see which dual-core processor handles it
the best and again it was the Galaxy s2
and as you can see it's again smooth as
silk double tap to zoom in absolutely no
she's very responsive very fluid and
we're still waiting on the Atrix 4G to
finish loading the flash I think it's
just about there there we go
got the whole page and again you can see
it's not as fluid but not too bad double
tap to zoom in double tap to zoom in
there we go you can see it's not as
fluid as it was before at all and again
there's a lot going on on this page for
it to handle and it's definitely having
some issues handling it and when
compared to you can see how smooth and
fluid the galaxy s2 is let's go to the
article itself see how that loads on
both I think it looks like it's gonna be
the galaxy s2 although here comes the
Atrix 4G neck and I think it's gonna be
a galaxy s2 it's got the flash already
loaded yep
galaxy s2 again and again extremely
fluid as you can see still waiting on
the Atrix 4G bottom line I think our
winner again and still champion
dual-core supremacy the galaxy s2
another great faceoff for pocket now
again it's been Craig hope it's been
helpful take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
