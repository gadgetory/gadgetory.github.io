packing.com we're going to take a quick
look at a new app called YouTube by lazy
worm now you might remember we already
have a YouTube plugin there it is and
this will just bring up the web page the
mobile YouTube web page however it does
enable YouTube videos to play with in
other web pages but it's not really that
user friendly as a youtube app so we've
got lazy worms youtube app from here
that seems to load pretty quickly and we
have featured YouTube videos right there
and nice search got most viewed
top-rated if it loads them okay
taking its time back to featured search
let's try see if I can type
search works pretty nicely now when you
get into a video it's kind of settled
but you can see there's a nice
background there and that that's using
the thumbnail of the video as a
background image which is pretty cool
and so we got related videos you got the
rating at the full description and we
can watch it we just saw there was a
internet explorer loading and then it
went straight to the streaming video we
see little dots going here so it's
loading that
it's being a little slow
hey guys its brand a minute intro copy
video to android and to the iphone let's
get started can't drag you can fast
forward and it has to buffer again but
the we got full screen here now so
that's pretty nice okay it's a little
bit more so we don't need to do that see
going back brings us to internet
explorer because the youtube app just
goes out to the rail route youtube site
and then links us to the video so we
have to do two backs in order to get
here down here we don't have much that
sort button search button but a little
bit nicer than the mobile site well a
lot nicer than mobile site and you know
cool interface for interacting with
youtube that's pretty much it though
that's it for now hope you enjoyed this
video and please thumbs up if you liked
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
