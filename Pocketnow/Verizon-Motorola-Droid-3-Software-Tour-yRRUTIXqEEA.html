pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the software on
the droid 3 by Motorola from verizon so
sit back relax and enjoy the show now
the droid 3 is using a full motoblur
configuration it seems to be a slightly
modified runs a whole lot faster than
standard motoblur does yeah if you hit
the home button twice then you can see
the multiple screens and this is the
mini screens you can have there doesn't
seem to be a way you can change those
you can swipe back and forth across
those screens just like you would in any
other launcher you can add widgets to
your screens by tapping and holding on
the screen the interesting thing here is
when you go to move your widgets around
you get this plus effect and then a
little more latitude to move the items
from side to side this is the data usage
app from verizon the other model or
motorola droid 3 that I just had I
configured it to show the data properly
but this is a different unit because the
other unit had demonstrated some of the
keyboard issues and way send me another
unit that has a lot less issues with
that keyboard it's a while it's not as
fast moving as my epic 4g it's still
very smooth didn't get stuck any of the
spots like the other droid 3 we did the
hardware review on the unboxing review
on down at the bottom of the device are
the phone messaging camera and launcher
same default as you would expect any
place else can't add more items to this
but you can change out items by tapping
and holding and then selecting a new
item to add to the dock and if we go
into the app launcher we can see the
default apps that are included on here
pretty standard stuff browser
blockbuster if you'll notice there's not
the let's golf
and Nova apps on here anymore I was
actually that I lied there all right
here I was actually able to uninstall
them on the other device and I wanted to
show you on this that you can actually
get rid of some of that blow where
unfortunately you cannot get rid of the
verizon V CAST apps they're on there
forever but some of these other items
slacker is not available to remove it's
kind of strange which ones they actually
allowed for removal versus others that
are not allowed so these when here Nova
I could uninstall if I wanted some of
these apps i've installed myself like
touchdown but for the most part it
doesn't have a whole lot of bloatware it
doesn't have any bing by default which I
appreciate when you click the search
button you get the standard search
functionality other interesting items to
note the menu background here the
standard task menu background is white
with black text rather than reversed
which is normally for two point three
point four let's see here 2.3 by far
additionally there is a battery and data
manager functionality here where we can
go in here and see this part of the
standard droid configuration you can
also go into data saver and or battery
mode here by default it goes in night
time saver mode which is supposed to
turn off the data after a certain time
at night and then or not turn off the
data but reduce the battery usage get
more battery life you can go into
performance mode and get better maximum
battery saver get even a performance
more better power maximum battery saver
obviously for more battery savings
otherwise things are pretty standard in
here or what we would expect if you go
into the market however once again
you've got kind of a skins look here
compared to the rest of the any other
gingerbread devices now the previous
droid 3 that I had sent out as a review
unit looked like the normal gingerbread
configuration it had the market exactly
how you would expect it to look in fact
let's just slide it right over here it's
the same unit you can see the market
here in this device is different than
the market here on this device why
there's a difference we haven't been
able to determine the software versions
in the about iphone are exactly the same
these were supposed to be created
exactly the same time but something is
different between them and I haven't
been able to find a way it'll change
this one to the default or change this
one to the skin version that said the
skin version is not unappealing in fact
brings up a lot of interesting
information when I saw this at first I
thought wow maybe Google changed their
market app and actually went to look mom
my other phones but alas it was just a
skin that Motorola has seems to have
provided step outside for a moment and
we'll take a look at the car dock and
then we'll come back in for those of you
haven't seen it this is the motorola car
dock application
which props you when you insert into
this doc frame here comes up with a
little acceptance piece which you make
go away but then you have some apps in
here right now it's a night mode but you
can customize this with your own apps
and add new functionality to this but it
gives you options like recent calls and
voicemail dial pad navigation bluetooth
music voice search the cash and slacker
by the defaults and then you've got a
couple of other personalization options
here you can do by tapping and holding
on an option then you can scroll through
the list to select something else to
launch instead couple of other items of
note here rd n la app to allow you to
connect to your own servers for content
city ID which you have to pay for in
order to be able to do city caller ID a
it's unfortunate but that's how verizon
works gotomeeting is installed by
default NFL mobile the slack wrap which
already mentioned Nova ends the let's
golf apps are both demos or not full
versions unsurprisingly Quick Office for
office related opening documents from
your email the be cast apps obviously VZ
navigator which is the same VZ navigator
as any other device I've used it on it
still requires a subscription in order
to be able to take advantage of but
unlike another recently reviewed device
that we had from verizon this actually
includes google maps as well when you
tap the mail button you actually get
this set up accounts it's kind of a
unified account configuration which you
can add items like your google account
or Twitter or Facebook your text
messages can all come into one unified
messaging application now on this
particular device I don't have many of
these set up because I had already set
it up on the previous droid 3 and this
is the replacement device so just to
show you what the clean configuration
looks like otherwise it works just like
any other messaging app
the mobile web browser looks very solid
doesn't have any scaling problems with
the type of screen that's on here though
small text which we're going to see in
just a minute that it can get very very
tiny and difficult to see here and if
you're scrolling up and down quickly it
can be a little distracting how the text
fades from one spot to the next the
droid notification system is rather
unique as it stacks up multiple
notification items here you can actually
tap the minus button to clear individual
notifications rather than tapping on
them and having them launch what you can
do as well you can still hear the Clear
button to clear everything if I really
like the ability to clear out individual
notifications now well the droid 3 does
have a mobile hotspot functionality here
at least a launcher and an icon on the
desktop and it would look like if you
connect it as a device to this that you
could actually get internet access as
soon as you try to connect out it will
try to get you to approve the purchase
of the tethering app now this may be
fixed with other third-party rooted
Wi-Fi tethering packages but the default
tethering package here on the default
android does not give you the
functionality to be able to tether
devices one of the witches included on
the droid configuration is this favorite
widget and as you can see here I've
added a couple of the default pound
contacts here and I have a plus button
to add more if I swipe down on this then
I get a whole box of favorites that I
can choose to dial from immediately and
then I can star them are going to edit
some of those changes
that wraps up our software review of the
motorola droid 3 from verizon if you
have any questions or comments please
leave them below and we'll get back to
them in the full review try to cover
some of those items as necessary or will
respond back in the comments thanks for
