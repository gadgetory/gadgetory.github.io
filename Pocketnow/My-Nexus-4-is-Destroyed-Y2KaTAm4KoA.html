a certain influence over everything in
our lives including our smartphones I'm
Joe Levi for pocket now and this is what
you should do when gravity kills your
smartphone so first up I had an entirely
different video plan for today it had to
do with my Nexus 4 and a custom kernel
but last night gravity exerted its will
on my smartphone this is a nexus 4 for
all those who are wondering right there
the back came out pretty much unscathed
a little bit of a chip down here in the
corner but the front is dead not only is
it broken all over the place but it's
also dead it doesn't recognize finger
inputs nothing at all and well let's
just say it's painful because Nexus
fours aren't easy to come by as many of
you know so in this video we're gonna
talk about what you can do to protect
yourself against an unfortunate fall
caused by our enemy gravity and what you
can do to recover from it first and
foremost if your phone lands flat
there's not a lot you can do unless you
have a really big bulky case I had a
bumper that was conveniently at home I
had taken it off that morning I was
planning on putting it back on that
night this would have given just a
little bit of a ridge when my phone hit
the ground flat that might have given
some level of protection believe it or
not screen protectors can also help in
such a fall yes they're not going to
protect it from breaking from cracking
from all that 100% what they are going
to do is they're going to add an extra
layer of very very durable protection
now that protection is going to keep
small cracks and and imperfections
defects and whatnot on the screen from
exploding into these kinds of really
really big cracks that just take over
your whole screen so keeping your screen
that much better will help
prevent a catastrophic break in the
future when you're actually dropping it
it's also going to absorb some of that
impact some of those forces and may just
keep that screen all in one piece
even if it doesn't I don't know if you
can see but they're shards I mean
they're there's literally pieces of
glass coming out of that screen it's
going to add an extra layer of
protection to keep you away from those
sharp pieces that leads us to our next
thing by the way
yeah I've gotten that like two days
before I drop that just hadn't gotten
around to installing it yet Wow
keep a hand on your device that should
go without saying I prefer not to rely
on my hands ironically enough
that's what failed me this time I like
to keep my device in a shirt pocket like
that or in a holster or in a pocket
without anything else in that pocket
what can you do or what should you do
immediately after you have dropped your
device you might be surprised
immediately after you've dropped your
device don't touch it
you're going to be tempted to reach down
grab it look at it and you'll be
panicked the adrenaline will probably be
flowing don't touch it
wait for just a second gather yourself
together and then pick it up very very
carefully preferably by its sides do not
reach underneath and grab on to it now
the reason for that this is glass it is
sharp it is broken glass will cut you
and when it does you're not gonna like
it
I've seen lots of friends who have done
just that they've picked up their device
and they've immediately sliced open
sometimes fillet to open a thumb or an
index finger it's not good once you've
dropped your phone it's probably already
broken take a second
relax don't worry it's just a thing pick
it up carefully and survey the damage if
there is none congratulations
be more careful next time if it is
damaged like mine at least you didn't
run your finger down over the top of it
and slice your finger open as well
that's going to last a lot longer than
we'll take you to get a new phone unless
you're trying to get a new Nexus 4 I
need a new phone before I did that
though I went and I wiped my phone just
in case because my data is still on
there until I was able to boot up into
recovery mode that's the volume down and
power button and I went through and just
did a factory reset that cleans
everything off that device now doesn't
have my personal information on it so at
least I'm protecting myself that way in
my case the very next thing that I did
was I went on to the Google Play Store
and I ordered up a new Nexus 4
it's the 16 gig version it's gonna cost
me about 390 bucks after shipping in
taxes and it's gonna be here in three to
five weeks I guess I'm gonna have to be
patient some of you might be able to go
back to your carrier and say hey I broke
my phone what can you do for me they
might be able to get you into a new
phone if you extend your contract with
them I'm off contract I don't have that
luxury but I do that for other reasons
that we've talked about in the past
after that you're gonna need a phone so
what I did is luckily this is a GSM
device and I have a GSM carrier I was
able to just pop out my sim little push
pin was able to pop that out and at that
point I needed to find a device that I
had laying around that I could use while
I'm waiting for my new Nexus 4 to arrive
that lucky device it just happened to be
yeah my t-mobile g2 that's seen a lot of
miles if you liked what you saw please

some other tips for us head over to

mistakes and gravitational experience if
you've got a story I want to hear it for

dropping your device breaking your phone
and how to recover quickly just in case
you do I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching
