brought us not only the Galaxy s5 with
some smartwatches as well three to be
more specific out of which we have two
in our labs now and we're gonna pick it
up with the Samsung gear 2 neo unboxing
let's go check it out so here we have
the gear 2 and we have the gear 2 neo
version the difference between the gear
2 and the gear 2 neo is basically the
lack of the camera on the Neos bezel and
as you can see we've got the same old
faux wooden texture on the galaxy box
this is no longer called the samsung
galaxy gear like its previous version
it's called the Samsung gear and it's
the second iteration and looking at the
back we've got the gear 2 neo cool out
and a 41-point four millimeter that's
1.63 and Super AMOLED screen with a
resolution of 320 by 320 this is not
being called out on the box but what is
is Bluetooth 4.0 and we have the gyro
accelerometer heart rate monitor and all
the other cool outs of course this is
ip67 certified for dust and water
resistance another important aspect is
that the gear 2 now runs Tizen Tizen
it's not running Android wear and of
course it's not running Samsung's own OS
available on the Galaxy gear the first
iteration is that a Super AMOLED screen
and of course Bluetooth as being called
out above let's crack open the box and
see what we have inside we will have to
break the seal here and another one
right here so we can open up the box and
there we have it the gear 2 neo sitting
in front we'll put that to the side
while we take a look at what else is in
the box we've got a adaptor which is the
charging adapter for the watch itself
we've got the
we'll wort which has the European plug
and of course a micro USB plug which
will plug in to the adapter itself and
we have a lot of literature we have the
warranty card and we have the
instructions which is of course in
Romanian because this is a Romanian
version and not much else in the box
let's put it to the side and take a look
at the watch itself so this is the gear
2 neo wrapped and plastic now turning to
the specs as we mentioned we got a
one-point 63 inch Super AMOLED display
the resolution is still the same as on
the original Galaxy gear it's a 320 by
320 resolution screen and operating the
gear 2 is a dual-core one gigahertz
processor compared to the 800 megahertz
processor found on the original version
we got 512 megabytes of RAM 4 gigabytes
of internal storage and as you can see
there is no camera on the gear 2 neo as
opposed to the gear 2 what we have here
is a home button and of course on the
back we had the Samsung heart rate
monitor with the charging connectors
right there and so that you can compare
it it is somewhat larger than a usual
sports like watch but we will get used
to we'll get a full review with features
and everything soon after our galaxy s5
review because the gears work well with
Galaxy phones and since we're expecting
the galaxy s5 will just bear them
together before if we do let's just
borrow it on real quick and see the
initial good sequence so there we go
Samsung gear 2
and there's a Samsung flyer screen and
of course it's in Romania so we'll have
to set it up with the English language
so we can all understand what it says
and we'll just turn it off
folks that's gonna do it for today thank
you very much for watching if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and don't forget to follow PocketNow and
all the usual social media channels I
have an engine denied until next time
stay safe
in this video we're gonna unbox the
Samsung gear 2 neo and see what's inside
the box because it's an unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
