along with a couple of iphone 7s is in
the works android and on the Galaxy s7
might not be the version that we're
expecting and somebody finally
acknowledges that the Google pixel needs
help with the speakers I'm hi Mary Vanna
and my son claims that I need hair color
the question is should I go blue green
or color this is Parnell daily the
official news today begin with deals we
have seen constant discounts for the
next bit Robin but I don't think it's
gotten any better than today right now
on amazon the phone is available for a
hundred and forty five bucks if you do
the math over the next bit services that
you're getting and all the cloud-based
features that the phone has 145 bucks
means this phone only costs 45 bucks I
would highly suggest you consider in
link in the description and for those of
you that are interested in getting
yourself an Apple watch I continuously
say I don't recommend serious one I do
recommend series two but hey if you
still want to get either of these
they're currently on discounts on the
apple store between 16 and 14 percent
not great discounts and there is a catch
of the fact that these are refurbs now
bear in mind these have the same
warranty I believe as if you're getting
a brand new product so if you want to
keep it out that's probably the best way
to go even though best buy is famous for
a lot of its discounts on apple watches
but you'll have to wait for those i
mentioned it in my review and now people
are finally acknowledging that there are
speaker issues with the Google pixel
there are clicks and clacks depending on
the intensity of audio which is either a
bad speaker or a lot of things but
according to certain developments
apparently it's a software problem and
it recently was fixed with a third-party
rom meaning Google should be able to fix
this please just chime in if you're
having some issues with your phone in
the comments and speaking of software
updates that are kind of underwhelming
we were expecting Android 7 dot one
nigga to come to the Galaxy s7 whatever
the updates were available but according
to some sources and vodafone carry your
testing for what we should be getting on
our final phones is apparently version 7
dot 0 and yeah if this is what carriers
are testing right now it seems that we
not getting seven dot one and it makes a
lot of sense android well no not android
samsung does this constantly instead of
giving us software updates on time
they're extremely sluggish and finally
the very interesting news that they have
to do with the iphone 8 and other
possible variants bear with me here the
news are quite extensive first of all we
hear that this is being called Project
Ferrari or codename Ferrari and the
first time or the only other time that
an iphone was given a code name with a
name was project purple the first
generation iphone ever since then we
hear that there are a letter and numbers
for the code so in this case apparently
we do hear that this is project d 22 but
then we also hear d 20 and the 21 so the
rumors claim that apparently there is an
iphone 7s and a 7 s plus 2 also match
the iphone 8 could it be that we are
getting the same deal like with the
Apple watch series 1 where they've got
beefier processors but it's still the
same old Apple watch and absolutely
everything else hey it leads me to the
question of today what do you think
apple is doing here do you think that
the iphone 8 is a complete revamp and
that's why it's being called Project
Ferrari and then an absolutely
everything else we're getting a new
iphone 7s which is the same iphone 7
with BP your specs and Apple is just
offering great iPhones and theory for
this new launch hum in my case I'm
confused but I can't wait to read your
