begun and they claim new display
technology the nexus 6 finally sees a
price drop to something more reasonable
and t-mobile seems to think that you
don't have enough video calling options
I'm hanging that'll be better bracing
myself for a crazy weekend of packing
and stuff that I'll explain to you soon
this is pocket out daily the official
news are kind of odd as we have facetime
we have google hangouts for video
calling we've got so many different
services that you can use right now for
free but t-mobile has decided to offer
its customers a new native service that
works with the dialer it reminds us of
the old gsm video calling services from
back in the day where you can make a
video call through the dialer this is
pretty much the same thing it just only
works on certain t mobile units like the
galaxy s6 but more details in the link
in the description this will expansive
out phones coming soon and you won't
have to pay for it and for those of you
interested in the future Nexus you might
as well consider the current Nexus 6 as
we have some major price drops at amazon
for the 32 gigabyte Varian you can buy
for 350 bucks 64 gig variant is for four
hundred dollars a crazy price tag for
such a good phone I mean this is a nexus
after all might as well get it now but
this is pretty much a hint the future
nexuses are coming soon or next week one
of the manufacturers of these Nexus
devices is LG and we've been brushing
off the leaks of an LG be 10
particularly because the design does not
seem compelling but then again now that
we have a leak spec sheet let's talk
about it seems we have a 5.7 inch quad
HD display in addition to a Snapdragon
808 so for those of you that are
wondering if there is a super premium
phone from LG it seems that there will
be a couple also move the spotlight over
to Motorola as we've been covering the
leaks of the motorola bounce
particularly because even though the
Moto X has a better design or at least
in photos this bounce has better
specification starting with the
processor display etc and well for those
of you wondering we already have leaked
photos of the device showing us that
either it will get some motomaker
treatment or you will have different
color options whatever the case may be
we will definitely be followed
and finally for the very hot rumors of
the day even though the iphone success
has not been unveiled yet it seems that
Cupertino is already working on the
iphone 7 as they regularly do apparently
we've got trusted sources that claim
that well the company is planning to
change its display technology for this
phone in order to bring more megapixels
without bottlenecks apparently the
insult such technology does create a
problem for manufacturing and apparently
Apple wants to go back to the glass on
glass design that it had with the
original iphone a lot of people to think
this is a step back but Carly this
technology has evolved for the future
but anyways it leads me to the question
of the day whenever you pick for a
smartphone is the display quality
meaning the display type important to
you meaning deeper for ammo letter IPS
in my case yes it does I actually do
prefer a more LED panels ever since last
year particularly because of that color
saturation which is just gorgeous so
