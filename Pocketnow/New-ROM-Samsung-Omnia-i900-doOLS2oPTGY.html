pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to show you all the changes made
to the Samsung omnia I 900 through the
latest rom update the new rom is DX h g4
for those of you that have an omnia and
the old ROM was DX hg 2 or DX hf8 so let
me walk you through all the change
changes or at least the ones that I
could find so far let me get in a little
bit closer and let's start on the today
screen we have three new widgets to talk
about the first one over here is the
internet widget which is really just a
link to opera mobile so if I click on it
it takes me right to opera going down
the list we have another new one here
which is for favorite people so you can
add four people here and if you have a
picture associated to their to their
contact you'll see their picture here so
that's pretty useful and right below
that there is a wireless manager so that
you don't have to dig through the
settings or the program list to find
where you turn on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or
turn off the phone if you're going onto
an airplane we still don't have stocks
weather or even a calendar application
that shows us our next appointment so I
really wish Samsung would have released
those widgets or at least that they're
working on them because again I really
don't find this widget based today
screen very useful because it doesn't
show me the vital information that I
need to know ok let's move on now
something that was pretty cool about
this phone is that it has an
accelerometer so that when you flip this
screen over it automatically goes to
landscape now what Samsung has changed
is the animation in this new rom which
makes it seem much much faster I'm quite
impressed by the speed I'm not actually
sure if it is faster but the animation
just looks much more fluid and of course
you can go the other way too so that is
an excellent addition and again screen
rotation works in pretty much any screen
in the operating system unlike the touch
diamond which only works in some screens
let me zoom in a little bit something
they didn't add that I hope they would
have is flick scrolling see I'm flicking
my finger and nothing's happening and so
you have to use the sidebar which is
annoying because it's kind of small and
skinny and if you're using your finger
and not the stylus it's
to position your finger right over the
scrollbar so that's unfortunately now
alarms has been replaced with clock and
clock is a really neat application let's
that let you do a few things with a
clock so you get a world clock here or
you can go to alarm and the alarm is
really well done so it's it's very
simple and it's touch friendly and you
can turn it on and off easily you can do
snooze you can select all the days that
you need the alarm to be on it's a
really easy to use alarm function and
finally Samsung has added a piece of
software that will convert what the
camera sees on a business card into text
and I've been playing with it a little
bit and I found the accuracy to be
fantastic here it's called smart reader
and I'm gonna spend time on another
video talking about this because I think
it's really really well done other
devices try to have this but the omnia
does especially well at recognizing the
text on the business card and it even
does it automatically so what you have
to do is line up the the frame around
the business card and you'll get these
green indicators and when all four
indicators are green well it will take
the picture perfect so I'll talk about
that later but that is pretty much it
for the update on the samsung omnia ROM
so much needed improvements though I
really wish that Samsung would do
something about the flick scrolling and
the lack of useful widgets on the today
screen and of course if you like what
you see in these videos subscribe to the
pocket now video youtube channel that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
