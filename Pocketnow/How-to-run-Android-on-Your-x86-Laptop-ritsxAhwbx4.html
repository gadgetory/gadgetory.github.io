we've heard a bit in the news about
Intel trying to make an x86 version of
Android that'll run on well Intel chips
we've also heard that Asus is next a PC
isn't going to be running Windows 7 like
everyone thought it was they plan on
releasing it running Android so that's
really good news for people who want to
have an Android at netbook or an Android
slate or even Android running on Intel
processors in their phones because
choice is always a good thing well just
how far along are they what further than
you'd think
today I don't want to show you two
things one is how to make a bootable
Android USB Drive so you can try and
boot off of your laptop right now
without having to format or risk your
operating system then if that doesn't
work I'll show you another way using a
virtual PC okay I've downloaded two
files already the first one is the you
netboot installer which is the installer
that you use to a download and install
Linux distributions two thumb drives and
to make live CDs and stuff with the
second is the android at 1.6 iso for x86
architecture they don't have anything
above 1.6 just yet but it's still a good
way to check and see what android can do
and once it gets booting I'm told it
boots really fast so how do we make this
well first of all we change the
distribution up here from distribution
mode to disk image because we've got the
ISO on our desktop we will navigate down
to it and there it is right there open
that up and then make sure you check
this and then check it again we want to
put this on a USB Drive and it is Drive
D I already have my thumb drive
installed that's the safer way to do it
we're going to go ahead and say ok it
says oh no I've already done this before
I know that we're gonna yest all and
it's going to extract and copy do a
whole bunch of stuff at this point if
you'd forgotten about those import
and files that you had on your thumb
drive it's too late so hopefully you are
watching this before you try it yourself
because this will erase everything on
that thumb drive
okay installation is complete and it
wants us to reboot now so we're gonna go
ahead and do that now depending on your
computer you may need to hit a special
key to bring up your boot menu in my
case that's f12 okay so I hit f12 to get
to my boot menu and my options are USB
storage removable devices the audio data
I want USB and I do have my thumb drive
plugged in and at this point it's going
to load up this boot menu from unit boot
and what I want to do is run android x86
without installation if you're having
problems you can go down here to visa
mode that helps with a few other monitor
types and graphics drivers but what I
want to do is just show you the normal
run without install and of course you
can install it to your hard drive but I
really wouldn't recommend that at least
not at this point of the game so we'll
go ahead and run it without installation
and down here at the bottom it says it's
detecting android x86 with some dots
marching across the screen this is where
a lot of people in the forum have said
that their install doesn't progress mine
as you can see does and I've got an
android hash prompt and then I get a
cursor up here in the corner you can
just barely see that at this point I
should have the android logo animating
across the screen but I don't have a
supported computer now epcs are good I
think there's a lenovo in there that's
good with visa mode but this dell
inspiron 11 just isn't supported by this
rom so i'm kind of out of luck i can't
show you any further than this but
there's some other videos on the
internet that show you how to do it what
I want to show you however is how to get
Android on your laptop so we're gonna
pull out the thumb drive get rid of that
and we are going to reboot the computer
back up into Windows and I'll show you
how to set up a virtual PC
so you won't really be booting into
Android but you'll still be able to run
it on your computer hopefully with a
little bit more luck than what we just
had their first thing I've done here is
I've gone out to Microsoft's website and
downloaded a virtual pc 2007 I am
running on Windows 7 home premium but
that's not eligible for the Windows XP
Mode and Virtual PC so go ahead and get
2007 you'll get an error saying it
wasn't designed for this OS or if you're
on Vista or another or less it shouldn't
be a problem but in my experience here
it's been working just fine so go ahead
and download and install that and then
we want to click on this new button to
open up a new virtual PC wizard we'll go
through that create a virtual machine
next we're going to call this android
x86 you can call it anything you'd like
next operating system is other you have
Windows and os/2 os is to choose from
this definitely is not one of those so
we'll say next we're gonna use the
recommended amount of RAM which in this
case is 128 Meg you could change that if
you wanted but for illustration purposes
we'll accept the default and then we
want to setup a new virtual hard disk
this is the storage that that virtual PC
is going to use now keep in mind this
hard disk is going to be at least that
much space so in this case 16 gig on
disk and it can grow to be a hundred and
thirty and a half gig that's actual
space being eaten up on your hard drive
so keep that in mind we'll go ahead and
finish that and great there we are we
want to go now into settings and
everything looks good android x86
hundred twenty eight make ram yadda
yadda yadda yadda so we're gonna go
ahead and cancel that okay now i've gone
one step ahead so let me go back we want
to mount up that CD so we can boot from
it so we're going to capture an ISO
image and we're going to navigate back
to where we have that ISO on our desktop
and choose open
and then we're gonna reboot the computer
and I'm just gonna reset that okay now
what that's going to do it's just gonna
run through BIOS this is a virtual PC
and then very quickly you can see we're
all the way up to our Android live
install so I just want to go ahead and
run Android without installation now a
lot of you are thinking well why not
just install it to the hard disk you can
try that but I never had any success
with it so let's go ahead and just run
it from here and see what we get you'll
notice we're getting some errors and
some warnings that's because this is
still in development a really gross
screen and you may think at this point
to abandon all hope but I've done this
before so just hang out don't worry too
much about it we'll get past that in
just a minute okay I ended up having to
reboot the Virtual PC and I decided to
boot this time in visa mode and you can
see I'm getting a lot better graphical
experience sometimes he'll work in that
other mode but visa has worked a little
bit better for me so we're going to
stick with that for now
and you can see the Android animation
cycles through about three or four times
and then here we are we move this up
here a little bit for you Center it in
the screen now first of all you'll
notice here's my Google search and I'm
getting a message saying hey if you want
to use your mouse cursor inside the
virtual machine go ahead and do that but
to get out of it you have to press the
alt over on the right hand side so once
we've done that we can click in here and
search for now press enter and if we had
networking that would be great we don't
so it's not gonna work for us
but you can see you can interact with
the keyboard there and it's giving us
the no network connection so so far so
good to go back press the Escape key if
you want to keep going back to the home
screen here the Menu key should be the
window
his button come over here and drag the
tray out so you can see what comes
already inside this you'll notice there
are no Google apps in here still trying
to figure out how to get those on there
including the market which kind of
limits what you can do with this click
and scroll side-to-side actually I long
clicked on one spot so click and drag to
move to the other screens this one has
three home screens so just like that
little bit laggy a little bit hard to
control using the the trackpad
unfortunately you can do all kinds of
cool stuff with it but it gives you a
good sense of what you can do using
Android on a laptop now I'm really
impressed with what you can do with some
of the Lenovo's getting them to work
just booting up from from your USB Drive
and on the epcs as well
from what I have heard you can get boots
that are under 7 seconds on any PC so if
you want something really fast that just
gets you online and on those builds they
do have networking working or have a
workaround depending on which version of
the epc you using I'll link over to the
the full instructions on how to check
and see if your laptop is on the list of
supported laptops or if your going to
have to do something kind of hacky like
I did just to get in there and play with
it but for something that's nearly fully
functional on an e PC including
networking superfast boot time and to
let you do what you need to surfing the
web is pretty quick and we're talking
Chrome here so it's it's still pretty
full functioned you'll be able to watch
all of your YouTube videos of course no
flash on it until we get Froyo and
install the Flash Player but overall
pretty cool so showing you how to run
Android on your laptop I'm Joe for
pocketnow.com if you thought this was a
cool video thumbs up if you'd like to
subscribe to our channel do it now if
you don't want to stay in touch with
everything that's going on in the world
of mobile computing
mobile devices well there's nothing I
can do to help you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
