split-screen multitasking for the ipad
motor launches the Moto e and
lte-capable Moto G in a new alerts have
and a samsung galaxy s5 active seems to
be ready for action I'm hi Mary meta and
instead of giving those cheaper phones
why don't we just keep last year's black
chips at a better price this is parking
out daily boy do we have some official
news today as our own Michael Fisher and
Adam Lane we're in New York City for the
motorola vent and we have the new Moto e
which is in 129 dollar phone unlocked
and you get pretty much very decent
specs for phone that's priced at this
range and aside from that we also get
the Moto G with its LTE burien which
will cost you like 150 euros obviously
there will be pricey for the United
States but still it is a decent phone at
that price and as I think that Motorola
has also launched a new application that
will help you track people with
geofencing and everything links in
description for full details on
everything that was launched it was so
much that I'd rather you might as well
watch Michael Fisher's coverage of
everything that happened now it's all
about Samsung as we have been waiting
for the galaxy s5 active as last year
this was probably one of the hottest
variants of the galaxy s4 now we already
have a code name for the galaxy s5 links
in the strip triple details on
everything that we should expect on this
phone but the most interesting question
would be if the galaxy s5 is already a
waterproof phone that includes a
fingerprint scanner aside from the fact
that you also get a heart rate monitor
what would the galaxy s5 active bring or
should we call the current galaxy s5 and
enact the phone and speaking of
competition let's go through LG as the
company has begun teasing its g3 and we
have a May 27th event and pretty much
every leak that we've seen of its design
is real we should expect this great bond
great specifications let's see what we
get at the event but even more
interesting is the fact that courtesy
about leaks we now have the first press
renders of the Uni 8 from LG and I know
the name is odd but this is the first
Windows Phone 8.1 device from LG in a
very long time apparently it does keep
the same design of the g3 if that is
be the case but stay tuned both these
phones would be really hot up next let's
talk about Apple as it has been reported
that the company has purchased Beats
Audio for 3.2 billion dollars even
though the company hasn't really
confirmed that but still there is a
bigger strategy behind this as beat some
music then really have many subscribers
apparently the point was the company is
working on bringing us HD audio for the
future of iOS we're talking about new
accessories downloadable itunes music in
HD audio and we're talking about even
new headphones with a lightning cable
port that'll be very interesting as we
don't know exactly how Apple plans to
pull that off but still apparently dr.
dre and the rest of the people from
beats will be at WWDC that's the rumor
so interesting with the whole Spotify
thing and Apple losing some itunes
market share this is a desperate move
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day we've got reports from
very credible sources that apparently
Apple is bringing us split-screen
multitasking to iOS 8 though wait a
second apparently that's not going to
work on the iphone it will only work on
the iPad and we're talking about the 9.7
inch variant not the ipad mini really
interesting as both tablets pretty much
have the same pixel density but still
apparently the company is working on
bringing us a more productive ipad air
and the iPad Mini will not be which is
really interesting it's really hard to
know exactly what Apple plans but
apparently it includes a very cool
option to allow they share data between
applications as well but that leads you
to the question of the day how important
is split-screen multitasking for you in
my particular case it is basic I mean I
find myself not using tablets lately
because I just can't be productive with
them so it's an extra thing to carry
around along from your laptop and
definitely windows 8 doesn't really pull
it off and a lot of things but leave us
a comment down below would this be a
cool feature for you to buy an iPad and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filming she'd follow us on
 out comment subscribe try to
channel as well you'll also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscored iveta please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am high never be better
thank you very much for watching we will
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
