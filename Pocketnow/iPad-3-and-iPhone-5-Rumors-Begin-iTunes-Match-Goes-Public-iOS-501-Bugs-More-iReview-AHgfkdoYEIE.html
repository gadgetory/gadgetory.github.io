5 begin to surface Apple finally
launches itunes match to the public and
iOS 5.1 s bugs are all the bash material
of the week all this and more coming up
right down hello everybody I'm hi Mary
vetta and welcome to the pocket nail I
review the show we go through all this
week school and the not so cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let's
hard this week off with the cool 2011
hasn't ended and the batch of rumors
what we can expect for the Iowas lineup
next year has already begun we already
heard that Steve Jobs spent his final
days working on the iphone 5 as its last
master p's and well rumors have it that
we will be getting at mid-year 2012
it'll support a larger screen a thinner
design and an aluminum back to match the
rest of the iOS and Apple products now
interesting enough we already heard
rumors of the ipad 3 coming in at april
march of next year and apparently it
will bring a Retina display and a fat
thicker design now interesting enough do
you really believe that the retina
display is possible on an iPad now even
if it were technically possible my
personal opinion is that we won't expect
this soon first of all current imagery
and videos for Apple products are all
limited to 720p HD resolution imagine
720p on an image screen that's larger
than the iPad that we currently know the
pixels would actually pixelate on such a
large device I mean screen or you can
actually expect the pixels to box in for
any video that you played that 720p
resolution so either Apple figures out a
new HD resolution for their iPads or
well we could probably expect us not to
happen the retina display makes a lot of
sense in the iPhone because obviously
it's a small device you don't really
need something really big or pixelated
on such a small screen so let's see what
happens now speaking of steve-o John
Stanton chairman of the venture capital
firm trilogy partners recently came on
records and mentioned that Steve Jobs
originally wanted to create a mobile
spectrum and carrier to complete with
current carriers now it makes sense
because if you remember back in the day
the iTunes
phone there was releasing the
partnership with Motorola actually
failed terribly so I guess it made all
the sense in the world that if you don't
find a good partner like they found what
singular back then it made all the sense
in the world for you to build your own
thing now interesting enough it seems
that Steve was planning to use the Wi-Fi
spectrum to build a carrier so can you
imagine trying to make a phone call on
the highway not really likely so it
seems that everything is history in the
past but it's interesting to see what
Apple has been willing to do or the
extent that they've wanted to reach to
be able to change things in the world
interesting after a couple of weeks of
being late Apple finally launches iTunes
Match to the public you pay 25 bucks a
year and every time you launch itunes
what it does is it will skim through
your library for changes match the
pirated I'm sorry I mean rip music in
your library and then well it'll upload
the songs that it can't find the match
the ones at cannes from the itunes store
now you have to activate itunes match
for it to work on your computer your
iphone ipad ipod touch and iphone TV now
it's interesting to see how Apple has
figured out how to have this work now
our advice to you is skim through your
library and look for the songs that
weren't matched before it starts
uploading the songs you can actually
even stop it before it starts doing that
and well if you don't see the little
crowd beside the song you can actually
admit the information on the song and
try to match it as much as you can with
what apple offers in the iTunes Store
for it to match eventually and not
upload a low-quality song where you can
get something even better from the store
now let's talk about our favorite
segments of all the hacking section
first of all somebody has already
figured out how to make facetime work
over 3g without my wire other services
so if you have a jailbroken iphone hit
the link of the description for details
on how to get it done hit the other link
in the description for us to show you a
way for you to unlock your AT&amp;amp;T iphone
4s iphone four or 3gs for any carrier
now this is temporary it doesn't work
all the time and apparently doesn't work
for everybody have to do a couple of
different procedures so look at the
description and if you're lucky enough
it'll probably work other sources have
recently found I checked coat on iOS
devices now I don't really think that I
chats coming to iOS device
as I think that I chat is going to work
with iMessage eventually hopefully
that's what's going to happen and well
it was also a matter of time before
somebody figured out how to crack the
server coast for Siri to make it work
now interesting enough other people are
mentioning that this will work on
Android eventually with this hack but we
don't see it likely i mean syria is in a
server so obviously apple just has to
tweak it and fix it that does it for the
coolest continue on with the not so
coolin well not everything's fun and
games for Apple right now iOS 5.0 point
one was definitely deceiving it did not
fix the battery issues and rumors have
it that Apple is already working on
iowa's 5.2 to get this done now
customers are complaining of lame
battery life of terrible problems with
getting even caller ids working making
phone calls lots of bugs and just about
everything is going wrong it didn't
actually fix things and make things
worse so breathes everybody will keep
you posted whenever the updates out
there because obviously everybody is
waiting for it even us and data-hungry
AT&amp;amp;T customers are currently getting
text messages from AT&amp;amp;T because well
they're not hungry because they're
currently clogging their networks with
so much data that they're using now it's
such an irony because if you compare the
option of owning an AT&amp;amp;T iPhone or a
verizon iphone or sprint iphone the only
reason you'd really speak to AT&amp;amp;T is
because the data is faster on AT&amp;amp;T now
imagine ATT is giving you a hard time
over using data one apparently it's the
only reason why you'd get it after the
drop calls now AT&amp;amp;T get off my back I'm
one of the people that uses your data a
lot and well I can do with the phone
plan whatever I want as long as you
charge me so much money and well I know
everybody else is thinking the same way
it isn't cheap and well we have to use
it don't we that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
high metairie better remember to give us
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
