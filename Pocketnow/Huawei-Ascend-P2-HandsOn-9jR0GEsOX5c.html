pocketnow.com Michael behind the camera
we are here at 2 Ave with the you Wahby
S&amp;amp;P - it's available in black and white
let's take a look at it ok then there's
gonna be the intro so we have a 4.7 inch
screen which is not full HD it's 1280 by
720 it's an IPS display protected by
Gorilla Glass then while we're on the
front we have a 1 megapixel front-facing
camera and your regular buttons for
Android let's unlock the phone which is
the normal back home and the menu let's
hop on to the side we have a power
button the micro nook nano SIM card slot
and a dedicated camera shutter button
which is always good addition on the
left side we have a volume rocker for
volume up and volume down not much else
the bottom has just a microphone hole
and on the top there's your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack plus a micro
USB and an additional microphone for
noise cancellation popping onto the back
there's a 13 megapixel camera with LED
flash now as far as the operating system
is concerned it's running as you can see
Android 4.1.2 and while we're here we
can take a closer look at the model
number CPU RAM which is a quad-core 1.5
years processor it's got 1 gig of ram 16
gigs of storage and the resolution as
mentioned is just 720p so running on top
of android 4.1.2 it's emotion UI 1.6 and
it's pretty fluid at this moment and if
you pinch to zoom you'd have access to a
total number of 9 home screens which you
can of course remove to your heart's
content
and add back popping back right here we
have also customized settings we have a
general tab which is basically a
shortcut for your main settings and the
old tab where you can find all the
settings for your phone with the custom
colored icons so this was a brief brief
look at the S&amp;amp;P 2 this was Anton from
pocket now Michael behind the camera
