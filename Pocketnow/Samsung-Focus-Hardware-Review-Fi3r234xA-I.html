pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to review the hardware of the
samsung focus on AT&amp;amp;T this is one of the
first Windows Phone 7 devices to come
out let's take a look so this device is
slated towards people that want a big
screen maybe not as big as the HTC hd7
on t-mobile but something substantial
this is a 4-inch screen a very good size
the same size screen that is used on the
Galaxy S devices in fact it's the same
screen as the Super AMOLED 800 x 480
display so let's walk around the device
a little bit and see what we have we've
got this flush panel here with these
buttons down here on the bottom the
required Windows Phone 7 buttons so
that's the start button the search
button and the back button every Windows
Phone 7 device will have these three
buttons up here we've got of course the
speaker grow and if you look closely a
proximity sensor and a light sensor no
front-facing camera Windows Phone 7 in
its current form does not support
front-facing cameras now if you look at
the screen in the right light it
actually looks a little bit blue and
this is the same effect that we got on
the samsung captivate and we're going to
talk about that in a minute it's using
again the same screen the Super AMOLED
screen four inches diagonal 800 x 480
resolution it looks really really good
and it's super responsive turning over
to the side the sides are adorned in
nice chrome typical of an AT&amp;amp;T device we
have this chrome strip that gets
skinnier and skinnier as it goes down
and stops towards the bottom volume
rocker nicely placed along the side here
on the bottom is the microphone and
here's a little bit of a and allege that
you can put your finger nail into to
take off the back battery cover we'll
talk about that in a second here's the
dough action camera button that is
required on all windows phone 7 devices
and what's cool about Windows Phone 7 is
that you can launch the camera
application without unlocking the device
so if I want to take a quick picture I
tap and hold the phone vibrates and it
launches into the camera application we
can take some picture of the desk not so
fun but very very handy feature in fact
I've used it many times walking down the
street I see a nice tree fall foliage
want to take a picture don't want to
unlock the device open the camera app
asian one touch here get you there here
is the standby button over on the top we
have 3.5 millimeter headphone jack for
audio and of course we have the micro
USB port here for syncing and charging
behind a little battery door some people
like doors some people don't I think
it's a nice touch to keep it clean now
one bit of concern here with this flat
panel on the front this flush panel of
course it picks up fingerprints as
you're seeing now but I'm starting to
get a little bit of dust accumulation
around the edges of the screen and some
devices with flush screens can pull this
off without accumulating Dustin some
can't it looks like unfortunately the
samsung focus is one of those devices
you're gonna have to keep clean a lot
and keep away from pocket length if you
don't want the the edges to accumulate
with dust so just a little note there
let's go over to the back here we have
the 5 megapixel camera with the single
LED flash there's the speaker grill for
the speakerphone have a really nice
contour on the back this is really cool
it's kind of a sliver design where it
tapers down towards the sides and you
get this nice little almost a racing
stripe very cool we have the Windows
Phone branding and let's pop off the
back battery cover now the samsung focus
is among the very few devices out there
for that is running windows phone 7 that
will have removable storage but it's not
removable storage in the traditional
sense you can't one day decide that you
want to add more memory if you want to
add more memory it's going to hard reset
your phone you're going to have to start
over from the beginning the reason being
that Windows Phone 7 merges external
storage with internal storage and the
samsung focus has 8 gigabytes of
internal so if you had a 16 gigabyte
card it adds the 16 and the eight and
puts that all together which is very
nice because you can expand your storage
but it's also a little bit a little bit
misleading because you can't just hot
swap your cards if you want to add a
larger movie and you're taking a trip
across the country on a plane for
example but again it's nice to have that
feature so here we've got a little
notification that says stop and read the
Quick Start Guide because they don't
want you to hard reset your phone
accidentally and here of course is a sim
card holder here's the battery it looks
to be the exact same battery as the
samsung captivate the galaxy s devices
around 1500 milliamp hours now in terms
of specs the samsung focus is running
the Qualcomm Snapdragon one gigahertz
processor the same CPU that we're seeing
in all of the windows phones out of the
launch devices again it comes in at one
gigahertz it's very fast the phone only
has 256 megabytes of RAM compared to the
galaxy s devices which are around 512
now the samsung focus when we went to
New York City's felt like one of the
fastest Windows Phone 7 devices despite
having less Ram so don't let that 256
number to tell you because it really
doesn't matter that much it's a very
very fast device and the screen is super
responsive coupled with the software to
make it feel very very fast so let's
take a look at the samsung focus next to
the samsung captivate they both have the
same exact screen in fact if we turn it
on you're going to see that same level
of really really high contrast and I
know it's hard to compare apples to
oranges here because you're looking at
different things but just kind of get a
sense for the clarity of both of these
screens is just tremendous the Super
AMOLED screen has really really good
outdoor visibility really good contrast
the colors are explosive compared to
standard LCD technology and it looks
just really really good now the samsung
captivate on the left here is actually a
little bit thinner than the Samsung
Focus in fact the captivate is probably
one of the thinnest devices on the
planet and its really nice because what
they do is they have a little ledge here
it goes down and you feel this part
which is super thin about nine
millimeters well the focus is about 9.5
millimeters but you do tell a difference
between the two it's very clear that the
captivate is thinner and everything else
is in the same exact spot coincidentally
so on the left side volume rockers over
there the button for standby is the same
the captivate doesn't have a of course
camera button here and on the top
everything is the same year it's
basically the same device but running
Windows Phone 7 a different processor
and a little bit less ram but that's not
a bad thing to samsung captivate is an
awesome awesome phone in terms of the
hardware in terms of good quality
Samsung did a really good job the only
sticking point again
is that some dust may be accumulating on
the sides of the screen long term but in
hand the device feels solid it feels
high-end even though it doesn't make use
of any real metal everything you see
here is plastic unfortunately even this
ring around the camera this screen is
glass obviously it feels very very firm
a lot firmer than you'll get on other
phones that run Android or even some of
the other windows phone 7 devices that
was one of the things we liked best
about the focus was the feel of the
screen it's just tremendously sensitive
sensitive and it requires an extremely
light touch to operate so a very very
high quality screen a very high quality
feel in hand and overall a really good
device in terms of hardware they did a
great job at making this into a slick
sleek-looking Windows Phone 7 device so
that's it for now if you liked the video
