we're taking a closer look at the
BlackBerry key one there's not quite
anything else like it so instead of
jumping straight into some comparisons
we'll be highlighting a couple features
looking at what makes this option unique
and what better place to start than with
this phone signature feature literally a
part of the phone's name this keyboard
is a throwback piece of hardware to the
more exciting and diverse days of
smartphone design BlackBerry's
transition to a modern operating system
might not have been the smoothest but
arriving on Android this is the third
device with manufacturing partner TCL
you just don't see hardware keyboards
much these days as Android evolved we
all just sort of agreed on glass front
faces and maybe some hardware navigation
buttons usually a keyboard feels
half-baked stapled on an afterthought we
would expect of course that Blackberry
would succeed here where others have
stumbled after a couple weeks of use I
can't claim I'm any faster or more
accurate at typing on these tic tacs it
took some work getting my thumb's to
remember what this feels like but every
day I use it I feel more comfortable
taking these presses for granted as they
slide into the mental background of my
messaging I've always liked that
hardware keyboards allow the whole
display to be utilized but the addition
of this hardware moves far beyond text
entry there's a phenomenal amount of
consideration for how it integrates into
the rest of the Android experience of
course we've discussed the fingerprint
sensor built into the spacebar it's
inspired design anchoring the phone for
how you'll hold it most often and that
runs double for the capacitive sensors
which can augment navigation sliding
over keys to move between home pages or
scroll vertically you rarely have to
reposition the phone when using it and
maybe the only awkward slide is reaching
up for the power button which we can all
agree is on the wrong side of the phone
see whenever a manufacturer strays from
its normal hardware form-factor we
rarely see that change while represented
on a first generation device a perfect
example would be the first iPhone
six-plus at launch the big iPhone
arrived with an OS that had always
focused on
thumb ergonomics there was little
software to really utilize the
additional real estate and the few new
additions to iOS were largely added to
apologize for the bigger dimensions
blackberry gracefully avoids these
pitfalls it would be an annoying reach
around the keyboard to use the camera
for example but the spacebar doubles as
the shutter button and the capacitive
sensors are wonderful for dialing in
quick exposure adjustments shoot a
handful of photos and it's easy to get a
feel for how this has been incorporated
into the overall phone philosophy
blackberry doesn't apologize for this
mass below the display instead embracing
it giving people reasons to use it
throughout the UI though that strength
might also be the BlackBerry's greatest
weakness for two reasons one users might
embrace it or might suffer from a
plethora of choice you get 29 buttons to
customize 29 you can assign multiple
shortcuts and contacts all over this
phone I know several people personally
who will probably pee themselves for
options like these but I also know a few
folks who will likely consider this a
chore and point to this phone gives off
a somewhat poor first impression it's
extremely unfamiliar for a lot of the
smartphone buying community now I was a
hardware keyboard junkie back in the day
and it took me a couple days before I
stopped thinking about every keystroke
I'd imagine that early use might have an
even steeper learning curve for someone
who has only used software keyboards
that's the thing about hardware you have
to get a feel for it
but then you get the benefit of
operating through feel without ever
looking at the screen sliding from the
spacebar after unlocking too long
pressing a key launching an app or
messaging all more reliable than Voice
Actions an alternate method of control
which might evolved primate paws kind of
dig this is a wonderfully successful
pairing it's always exciting talking
about gadgets that target a specific
feature or issue then nail the execution
this phone really does what blackberry
claims it can do beyond just punching in
letters
software keyboards aren't really a
problem for anyone these days this is a
well considered polished control surface
which guarantees the key one becomes a
bespoke gadget tailor fit to the
individual who owns it there's nothing
else quite like it as always thanks so
