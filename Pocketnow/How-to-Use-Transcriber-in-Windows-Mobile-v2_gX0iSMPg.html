pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to show you how to use transcriber
which is built into every windows mobile
touchscreen phone I think a lot of
people forgot about transcriber if you
watch the apple newton video you may
have seen how with the newton you can
write anywhere on the screen so you
could you could write the word here here
and here or up there up there up there
to the side and it would still
understand what you're trying to say you
can write anywhere on the screen well
windows mobile lets you do the same
thing with transcriber so let me
demonstrate that now i'm just going to
start off by going into pocket word okay
here we are and the way that you select
transcriber is by clicking the up arrow
and the keyboard selection option here
and this is the standard HTC keyboard
chooser and I've chosen transcriber of
course in other devices like the samsung
omnia it may look a little bit different
so i press the up arrow here and i get
whoops went away i can just go right to
transcriber it's the same thing and over
here it actually asks me to kind of
learn how to use the different gestures
because it's the first time that I've
used transcriber on this device okay so
now i'm going to write hello world
perfect and you can use this in other
programs too so if i go into pocket
internet explorer i can write anywhere
on the screen to enter a web address so
i can write CNN there it is or i can use
this into context program so if you want
to make a new contact your let's do it
in calendar actually and I do menu new
appointment and for the subject i'm just
going to write Bob there we go now there
are some settings that you can mess
around with to get the accuracy of
transcriber to be better in the bottom
left corner here and the transcriber
options we have this button that will
allow us to kind of choose which letters
we write in certain ways it's a little
bit tedious you have to go through the
whole alphabet to do this but if you get
to a letter and you say you know what I
never write my em like that you tap on
it and then you select never and then it
gets crossed out and this way
transcriber knows to never look to those
letters for converting there also there
are also some options you can choose so
if we go into this button down there we
can choose whether there's sound with
this whether there's an intro screen if
you go to the inking tab you can select
the color of the line and there's a lot
of colors to choose from you can choose
how thick the line is and right now I
have it set on bold which is kind of
three-quarters of the way up in terms of
size and you can also set how long it
takes for it to recognize what you write
and I haven't set kind of in the middle
here because i like it to try to
interpret the whole word and pause for a
minute to recognize it rather than
letter by letter because it's not as
accurate that way so that's pretty much
it for transcriber it's a really useful
feature that lets you write anywhere on
the screen and get the text recognition
which is actually pretty good if you
want to find more options and more ways
to use it there are certain gestures you
can use to copy and paste and there are
ways to backspace without having to use
the backspace down here you can go into
the helps help option which is the
question mark and you get lots of lots
of information on how to use the
gestures to get the most out of
transcriber so that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
