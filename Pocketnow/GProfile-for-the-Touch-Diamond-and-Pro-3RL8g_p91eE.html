pocketnow.com and this is a video
showing a new program from a software
come
SRC it's a new software company that
develops windows mobile software the
program is called G profile and what it
lets you do is actually use the
accelerometer feature of your touch
diamond touch pro and also the 18t fuse
the HTC touch pro the Sprint diamonds
there's so many of these now to actually
silence the ringer if you turn over your
phone now of course out of the box if
you get a call coming in and you rotate
the phone it will silence the ringer but
what if you want to silence the ringer
totally so maybe you're out at a
restaurant or a business meeting or at a
bar and you just want to flip over the
phone to the front and be done with it
the ringer will be silenced so let me
show you what the application actually
looks like so it's actually a settings
once you go into the system settings and
here it is it's called mobile source G
profile and there are some settings here
what you can do is set the polling
frequency and of course if you increase
decrease the polling frequency you get a
little reduction in battery life because
what it's doing is checking for the
orientation of the device at the
frequency that you prescribe and we have
other options for calibration we can we
can specify action when the screen is
often when the screen is on out of the
box that works pretty well though 22 to
work well with your device so let me
show you how this works ok so let's say
you have your phone out face up I'm
going to call the phone and you're going
to see that it's going to ring because
its face up ok phones ringing and now
I'm going to flip the phone to the other
side and I'm going to call the phone
again and you're going to see that the
phone is not going to ring and I didn't
change anything I didn't turn on the
screen to change the profile or anything
like that I just simply turned over the
phone and there it is it's vibrating
it's actually moving down the table so
it absolutely works very well so G
profile costs three dollars and
ninety-nine cents which is a pretty
decent price if you think about how many
times this can save you from having to
turn on your device to silence silence
your ringer or save you from an
embarrassing moment while you're out at
a restaurant you can go to mobile SRC
calm to get that they have a free trial
for that will last for just five minutes
so won't last you a very long coming up
next we're going to test their other
piece of software called G scroll which
allows you to use the the capacitive
touch area down here to scroll
vertically and horizontally and also it
enhances the functionality of these
software or these hardware buttons so
you can open more programs than then
what you can out of the box so watch for
that coming up soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
