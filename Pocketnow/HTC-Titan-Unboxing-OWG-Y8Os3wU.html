pocket now calm Windows Phone 7 has come
a long way since its release a year ago
the release of Windows Phone 7.5 mango
is upon us which brings fast app
switching front-facing camera support a
better browser and a whole lot more plus
we're experiencing a new wave of Windows
Phone 7 device releases of which include
the HTC Titan perhaps the best Windows
Phone yet it's got a 1.5 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor the
fastest yet it's got plenty of RAM a
huge 4.7 inch screen and until we see
what comes out of the Nokia Camp this
might be the Windows Phone 7 device to
get if you're looking for the best of
the best in this video we're gonna unbox
the HTC Titan let's get to it so this
phone is being released across Europe
right now us availability has not been
announced however this particular model
sold in the UK you can get it at clove
code UK will work on a TN t--'s 3g
network which is great if you want this
particular Windows Phone
it'll cost you of course because you'll
be buying it unlocked and importing it
right now it's available for about 415
pounds which is about 650 dollars again
from clove code UK so you're gonna pay
for the privilege of having this phone
now let's take a look at the box of
course typical HTC box we get to see the
device on the front this is the actual
size so a pretty big device with that
4.7 inch screen it seems that phones are
getting bigger and bigger in terms of
screen size and around the back we can
see a few specs here and we'll get into
that 1.5 gigahertz single core Qualcomm
Snapdragon CPU you might be wondering
where's the dual core for Windows Phone
well the truth is that Microsoft is
going to do multi-core support but not
into a later generation of Windows Phone
devices apparently they want to do it a
little bit differently than sort of
Android which is yet to fully support
multi-core phones even though there are
plenty of them out there in addition to
that we've got 16 gigs of on-board
storage there's a lot of storage we've
got 512 megabytes of RAM would like to
have seen a little bit more but that
should be plenty
again 4.7 inch WVGA touchscreen that's
800 down by 480 across
we've got of course the usual GPS and
Wi-Fi radios and there's that 850 UMTS
ban which will allow us to get 3G on
AT&amp;amp;T in most places not a lot of places
because you would need the 1900 band as
well and that's pretty much an 8
megapixel camera this apparently has a
really really good camera that lets in a
lot of light into the into the lens and
we've got a front camera 1.3 megapixels
but let's get to the unboxing let's see
the Beast that is the HTC Titan spelled
with an eye not a Y alright let's take a
look
wow this screen is so big and the great
thing about these phones that have big
screens is that they're relatively thin
to be exact the thickness here is nine
point nine millimeters it's really
amazing how thin phones have become even
when they have very large screens I can
tell you this feels a lot like the HTC
hd7 which had a 4.3 inch screen so we're
bumping that up significantly here so
I'll set that to the side see if we have
any interesting accessories windows
phones stuff well you know the drill by
now we've got headphones and a charger
alright let's push those to the side and
see the Beast that is the HTC Titan so
slide it out while the screen is
ginormous and it goes nice into the edge
of the phone so we don't really have a
thick bezel we've got the typical
Windows Phone buttons on the bottom
start back and search got that
front-facing camera which is new for
Windows Phone there's an app that you
can use called tango that will allow you
to do video chat on Windows Phone take a
look around the device we've got sort of
a meadow actually back here which is
really nice you can tell it's metal it's
really cool to the touch dual LED flash
the 8 megapixel camera with the speaker
3.5 millimeter headphone jack the device
is absolutely large in fact I'm having a
little bit trouble getting my hand
around it I don't have the biggest hands
definitely something to get used to the
size itself is no bigger than your
typical 4.3 inch screened phone maybe a
little bit bigger in terms of the
tallness but it's not like this is going
to be
huge in your pocket so let's take off
the this part here so we can see the
battery okay this entire thing kind of
comes apart wow that's kind of cool
so let's take a look at the battery size
well boot this up that's where the SIM
card goes obviously there is no microSD
storage on the HTC Titan quite a big
phone hopefully we've got a nice battery
here it is of size sixteen hundred
million powers Windows Phone 7 typically
has really good battery life so in terms
of powering through the day that
shouldn't be a problem so let's pop this
back on
HTC really has been going with this sort
of double style case design where the
back sort of wraps around the front kind
of cool snap that on power it up you
have to have it in all the way ok
power it up and we'll do a first boot
impression we'll see how long it takes
to turn on wow that screen is really
really big and let's see how long it
takes to get to this setup screen even
though Windows Phone 7 is extremely fast
at starting up of course the first boot
up that you do on any phone is going to
take a little bit longer so here it is
Windows Phone with the new logo the
square windows insignia and we're going
into the Windows Phone interface again
it's very thin we'll do size comparisons
to other devices this is pretty cool HTC
is kind of itched into the metal that is
a really cool touch there you go welcome
to your Titan X 310 II get started so
choose the language and you know the
drill from here first time set up accept
the Terms of Use you should read that by
the way and go from there we'll have a
lot more coverage on the HTC Titan the
best Windows Phone 7 device yet it's a
running mango it's got a faster
processor than we've ever seen on a
Windows Phone and it's got a mega huge
screen a lot more coverage coming up if
you liked this video please give us a
thumbs up and if you want to see even
more pictures of the Titan after we turn
this on and get it powered and ready

it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
