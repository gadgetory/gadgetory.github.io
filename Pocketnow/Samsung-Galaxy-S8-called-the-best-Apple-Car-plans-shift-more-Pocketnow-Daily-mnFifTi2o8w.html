consumer ratings thanks to the Galaxy
smartphones google has just snatched the
lead genius behind Apple's eight chips
and Tim could kind of sort of vaguely
talked about cars like sort of I'm high
metal Iveta and I know the Polar's are
not back I just need to get on a plane
in about an hour
this is parking out daily oh man this
shirt needs ironing the official news
today have to do with deals those of you
in the market for smart phone right now
the HTC 10 may be a year old but for
$240 that is a deal I would kind of not
pass out on mainly because it is
probably one of the most durable smart
phones out there it's got great audio
experiences and it is really cool
looking regardless you can learn more in
the description it's on Sprint now let's
talk about Verizon and the HTC u11
mainly because for those of you that
didn't know that you 11 is actually the
first smartphone according to certain
recent information that has literally
ditched Verizon CDMA network we know
that the company is phasing it out we
just didn't know exactly when it would
happen so yeah for those of you that
don't see it fall back into 2g there's
actually a reason for that and hooray
for progress because Verizon's 2g
network is terrible we've had a lot of
admiration for Apple's eight chips
because of their power regardless of the
fact that a lot of people consider them
underpowered it's actually the other way
around they pretty much beat the ton of
benchmarks and still we just learned
some very interesting twists as the
companies lead designer for these eight
chips has just moved to Google Madan
Gulati has just announced on LinkedIn
that he is the lead associate architect
for Google so what does this mean for
the future of the cool pixel for example
stay tuned for that
and speaking of Apple 10 Cook was in a
recent interview and even though he
didn't really say that the company is
building cars because those rumors have
kind of died out he kind of sort of to a
certain degree claimed that they're
working on a core technology that pushes
automated cars how is that going to work
is going to be very interesting as again
Apple sees itself as a software company
could it be that the company wants to
take our ploy to the next level we will
see and finally the very interesting and
most
commercial news today have to do with
consumer reports and the Galaxy s8
mainly because the publication that was
started in 1936 is just claimed number
one - the best smartphone right now -
the Galaxy S paid plus the second would
be the Galaxy s8 and the third would be
the Galaxy a7 from last year this is
rather interesting as there are a ton of
smartphones this year starting with
devices like the LG G 6 for example that
to an amazing job and still Consumer
Reports has considered that the best
smartphones out there are all galaxies
I'm not in disagreement mainly because I
do love the galaxy s 8 for a ton of
reasons but I wouldn't consider it the
best so it leads me to the question
today for you in your opinion what is
the best smartphone in the market today
and why Oh in my case that's interesting
I love a lot of them but for me probably
the favorite would be the g6 not
necessarily because it is the best
smartphone it's just because it gives
you the most bang for your buck as a
flagship because of those dual cameras
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends you
