and in this video we're going to give
you a look at the hardware of the HTC
Wildfire we're going to check out some
of the hardware specs in terms of the
CPU the memory as well as the screen the
battery so on and so forth so without
further ado let's go ahead and jump
right in alright and we are back and
it's time to jump into our Hardware
overview of the HTC Wildfire as you can
see here is a 3.2 qvga screen which has
a resolution of 240 x 320 now despite
the influx of the larger screen devices
we've seen as of late this device has
still slept with the smaller screen to
become more consumer friendly the
advantage there is this has a thirteen
hundred million power battery which once
again is powering this smaller screen
therefore it will give you around eight
hours of talk time on the GSM signal and
around seven and a half when you're
using 3g or wcdma which is very very
good for this type of device this phone
has 512 megabytes available for a ROM
which is going to be your application
install space or your storage it has 384
megabytes of RAM which is a very strange
number which is basically going to allow
you to run different applications at
once and then as far as a micro SD card
it's going to come with a 2 gigabyte in
the device itself it's upgradable up to
32 so they have kept you up to date with
being able to add the larger size and
micro SD cards the device weighs about 4
point 2 ounces and that's partially
because of the fact that it has an
aluminum shell much like the nexus one
along the edges here as you can see this
is your aluminum footprint that goes all
the way up to the top you actually have
an extra aluminum for the earpiece here
now the back is plastic however it's the
Teflon coated plastic here and then this
back cover is actually plastic itself
now the way the battery comfort cover
comes off is a little different because
it actually goes over that chin as you
can see here the chin itself is actually
where the phone sits
now in order to put the sim card into
the device you have to actually take the
battery out however you can actually
take the micro SD card out and put in a
new one with the battery still in by
using the spring-loaded slot as you see
here moving back to the front of the
device you're going to have the four
capacitive buttons much like the nexus
ones designed however these buttons are
very accurate to the touch and there's
no issues there it's also going to give
you the optical track now it is a 5
megapixel camera with a flash as you can
see here also is the ability to
autofocus and geotag where you take
those pictures getting a little up close
and personal the device we have the
volume rocker button on the left side
here you can push up or down to tear
your turn your volume up and down
accordingly we have a micro USB port to
charge your device we have the
microphone it's a very very little small
hole there as you can see moving on to
the right side we have just a flat
smooth surface the top will give us our
power button as well as where you would
take the battery cover from just pry
your nail in there in our 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and once again this panel
itself is plastic Leverett is the
painted encoded Teflon you also have the
ability to use the FM radio using the
headphones the actual antenna itself is
included in the headphones as you can
see here if we scroll down to the FM
radio we're not going to pick it up
because we are indoors but it does work
as long as you have the headphones on if
HTC Wildfire interests you you can check
it out over at clove co uk for about
three hundred dollars and that's really
where this device is going to shine by
HEC only pricing this device at around
three hundred US dollars unlocked you
really can't complain there we're
looking at some of the other options
that you may have and finally jumping
into some of the network band specs of
this device here for 3g which is going
to be hsdpa as well as the wcdma it's
going to use 920 100 megahertz what that
means is you won't be able to pick up 3g
if you're in the United States now as
far as gsm goes it's going to use 850
900
eighteen hundred and nineteen hundred
megahertz for the spectrum so there'll
be plenty of signal on the edge when
you're in the u.s. however you once
again will not be able to get 3g unless
you are in Europe or Asia this has been
our hardware overview of the HTC
Wildfire as always thank you very much

a thumbs up if you liked this video and
