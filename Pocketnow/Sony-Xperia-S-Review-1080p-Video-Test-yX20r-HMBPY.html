parking out common we're testing the
1080p video capabilities of the Sony
Xperia S as part of our full review so
let's talk about it and I'm using it to
film right now so tell me what you think
about it okay so we're here at the park
doing a test of the video capabilities
of the Xperia S I'm sadly not impressed
not with the video quality the video
quality is great you'll notice that I'm
walking in the Xperia there's a really
good job at stabilizing the video but
the problem is I can't do anything with
the camera once I'm filming I touched
the screen like I'm doing right now and
it does nothing
I cannot switch absolutely anything not
even turn on the flash once I'm filming
as opposed to other smartphone platforms
the only thing I can do is zoom in and
zoom out with the volume buttons but
once you zoom in like you notice right
here it does do a heart it has a hard
time in focusing it can focus on faces
but I can't touch anything in focus
sadly other than that well the sensor
does a really good job if I try to do a
close-up right now you'll notice that
again I can't it tries to focus and
there it finally focused right there but
it's it's trying to look for spaces to
focus and let me see if I can do a
little close-up here
not perfect can't touch it there it
finally focused it takes it a little
time but once it does you'll notice that
the sensor does a really good job in
handling detail and obviously video
looks beautiful on the 720p display so
sadly as I'm telling you it's not
perfect but it gets the job done let me
try to zoom in here let's see if it
focuses at some point come on focus
now don't count on it but again these
are the tests for 1080p 1080p is great
sadly I'd love to show you though and
see now I'm out of focus for everything
else let me just hold it there and see
if it focuses at some point no it's not
gonna focus oh there we go it finally
focused so I'm trying I wish I could
give you a test of the 1.3 megapixel
camera at the front and I'll do that but
I have to do it separately because sadly
it doesn't allow me to switch the camera
so
that's another bad thing so other than
that it's it doesn't really good job
filming though okay and now I'm testing
the 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera on
the Xperia S you'll notice that well it
looks really good does a really good job
with color with detail even if it's 1.3
megapixels again probably the only issue
that I have is not being able to switch
between cameras kind of a no-brainer
hopefully that will come with the Ice
Cream Sandwich update that's it for a
1080p video test of the Sony Xperia S
you'll notice that well things aren't
perfect but the sensor does a really
good job I just wish that the software
UI did a much better job than it does so
don't forget to give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
