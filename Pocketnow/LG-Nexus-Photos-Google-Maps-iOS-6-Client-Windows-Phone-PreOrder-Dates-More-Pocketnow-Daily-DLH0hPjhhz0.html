iPad Mini is seeing some production
delays and the Windows Phone pre-ordered
dates get leaked I'm Hyneman Rivera
wandering of an unreleased products
should ever be considered as delayed and
this is parking out daily
yes believe it or not some leaked photos
of an LG e960 point to a feature google
nexus device it has the same specs as
the LG optimus G but this time it has a
similar design to the current generation
Galaxy Nexus recent other rumors have an
HTC DLX packing the same specs as this
LG optimus G so hey could be that we are
getting more than one nexus product
samsung and google are both working on a
new 10 inch tablet that's also a nexus
tablet so the rumors might be true and
speaking of google android 4.1 point2 is
just reached a sop and the nexus 7 is
the first device they get it the upgrade
is minor but it doesn't glue landscape
support for the home screen on the Nexus
7 which is a cool addition some people
are already reporting that they have
gotten the upgrade but none of our
tablets here and the pocket now labs
have received it so if you're lucky
enough to get it leave us a comment down
below now even though all of us know
that Windows Phone 8 will be launched
the public on october 29th none of us
know when the phones will be available
to get it recent rumors have that the
pre-orders will begin on october 21st so
if you're out there to get a windows
phone you better keep that wallets safe
because nobody knows how much the phones
are going to cost sadly now maps on iOS
6 is still a topic of disappointment and
lucky for us a third-party developer has
already built an app called classic map
which brings Google Maps the iOS on a
client that works far better than having
it on a browser now there's a still
version one point no so you don't get
navigation you don't get Street View you
don't get directions but it's really
cool to have in case you're looking for
a specific place on maps and you want to
make sure that that place is exactly
there now warning this app looks exactly
like naps on iOS 6 so before Apple yanks
that thing make sure you download it
because it's free and finally for the
apple rumors of the day it seems like if
the iPad Mini is reaching some
production delays because apples
changing the design apparently they want
to make it a little more tapered around
the edges and none of us are going to
complain about that now if the rumors
are true for the launch States we're
supposed to get invitations for the
event tomorrow so stay tuned for that
because this could probably change
everything and that leads me to the
question of they are you interested in
an ipad mini this holiday season I'd be
willing to sell my current generation
ipad but leaves
comment down below now if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on pocket
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
