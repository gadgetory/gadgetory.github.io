good morning good afternoon good evening
everybody and welcome to it now
live episode number 16 and while we were
waiting for the show to go on air we
were wondering what the hashtag
boomsound is and hopefully we'll get
some clarification I am Anton denied
managing editor of pocketnow.com I'm
receiving some notifications on my
phones and I am joined today by Jaime
Rivera multimedia manager all the way
from Honduras hi Jaime Oh everyone how's
everything everything is awesome how are
you today I have coffee everything
should be great after this but you know
what you don't have you don't have your
name tag on so pleased by the time I get
back please do that and I'm also joined
by mr. Adam doubt our contributing
editor from nowhere else but Chicago
Illinois hashtag boomsound hashtag goes
down and from what I've heard you've had
an awful day we're not going to go into
details just on a scale from 0 to 10 how
awful was it well I'm guessing that
since we lost him it's getting work in
the morning for nokia to announce the
Asha horrible but it's uh it's nothing
good nothing good sleep and gentlemen we
will try to keep this as usual at one
hour 30 mark I'm not sure we'll manage
to but we'll try an hour today's topic
is the google i/o event and the nokia
lumia 925 launch event from London where
I happened to be so without any further
ado let me give the float the show floor
tu hi mera Bella please hemet choose
somebody that is my name tag on it is
and it's looking good ok so I'm going to
look for somebody that I do not know ok
R&amp;amp;R quijano get that hey mr. aim yeah I
can hear you just fine man how's
everything a pretty good thank you how
are you cool man cool man let's we're
talking about google i/o we're talking
about nokia
we're family currently I have a tax
history ok so you what are your you have
a gs3 what are your impressions on
google i/o then what do you think that
we got do you like what we got or you
like what we don't get him I don't know
I have mixed feelings about the aisle I
like all the engagement and all the
improvement in the little Google
ecosystem but as as you say I know point
the editorial ram it's like well here
Mexico will have all the services I we
don't we will we won't have all the
services like yeah I'm gonna hmmm wave
history futuristic and I like all those
stars because it sounds like great
through the future but I don't know
where I'm going to get it and also what
I was expecting 104.3 but yeah well I
think is that cool yeah I Oh google
conference and is not all about hinder
if they have chrome OS and stuff like
that and I think they did we'll look
you're using that to ping it you know
they're being like no this is a
developer's conference so we're focusing
on developers and I'm like okay wait a
second our developers supposed to build
applications for specific operating
system so if there is no yearly cycle
for the operating system do we really
consider that we perceived all the tools
cuz if you no worries me that everything
that we saw you know it's like for
example whenever they come out with a
new version of iOS they're like okay iOS
7 is out and so they go over all the
features and then they're like okay and
the new SDK will be available to
developers tomorrow so they can start
working on their applications but then
here we got a lot of improvements we got
a new pretty much a new type of SDK for
Android but we didn't get a new
operating system so I'm like okay so
what are you what are they gonna do
they're gonna publicize the next version
of android in July and then bring the
SDK and then bring the software updates
a move six months later I don't know I'm
kind of confused with this whole
mentality I don't know what you think
yeah well I think like they're the focus
that Google wants to be his like we need
more development developers in our
Senate like Apple has a very wide range
of development developers and I think
they are focusing get attract more
developers for they to improve as an
ecosystem for apps and stuff like that
well but I'm i don't know i think like
people like us like users we were
expecting you know android stuff more
andre stuff like new hardware or maybe
in any update something like that but
what is that's real I'm realizing the in
the company like Apple I think I like
better the Apple events because they
just give away what people want but you
know I don't know what to say I'm I'm
like yeah it's cool but well I don't
know we'll see okay second question if
you have the choice between the galaxy
s4 since you're you're eventually up for
an upgrade galaxy s4 with stock Android
or with TouchWiz what would you prefer
well yeah it's a pretty different path
my mother just got the s4 and I have
weekend to play with it and I think like
it's pretty cool phone but you know
touch with is pretty heavy like yeah I
noticed all the lack of loading things
and when you changed for Ephram
application to widgets you had you do it
like you stop for a minute then load
everything I don't know I'll feel like a
the phone with so much power and he's
like laggy because of the UI and i would
like to prefer that to talk to you stop
android because i had i had a esta tu
and i put say hello cyanogen moderate
and it was better touch with i like it
very much interesting that's nice this
might as well any questions to the team
anything you'd like to know yes about
you know the galaxy s3 s4 with a stock
andrew what we haven't seen this before
left
well not stuck Andre specifically but
you know maybe I don't know I found
company and I want to put like a new
phone and smartphone with android and I
said oh let's put cyanogen mod and like
I don't have need to build the new UI
why we haven't seen like a company like
put cyanogen brother I were stuck under
his like it's not like bad idea he will
attract I don't know I think it will
tell us more you go so you think that
cyanogenmod should sell their their port
or not actually sell it but like the
possibility to be in a certain type of
home like yet that you beautiful being
sold with cyanogenmod I would be ya know
because well I'm really interested in
both means in the samsung galaxy s4
right with stock hundred I think it's a
pretty expensive because well you
practically did that this way too much
but well you can put another phone like
it's good enough like grow and sell it
like with sandwich mother or a panel
Android ever yeah yeah well anyways
that's all the time we've got for for
this segment okay you'd like to share
your twitter handle or anything oh my
google plus account is like my name is
playing the screener the Google+ URL
this kind of long well Jesus Ted time

screens well it is a pleasure meeting
you thank you for joining us and we will
thank you much said that was good to get
into hang out Thank you Thank You matter
before I hand it over to Adam doubt i
have a announcement which is probably a
usual announcement for those who are
watching us on a weekly basis guys on
youtube who are watching this live or
guys on pocketnow.com who are watching
the embed happening live on the post if
you have any questions and trying to
monitor
comments on YouTube as well as on the
pocketnow.com post please write it in
all caps question column and your
question I'm trying to go through them
and I will try to answer them or if i
cannot i will try to ask my colleagues
and with that i'm gonna hand it over to
Chicago Illinois Adam doubt thank you
very much sir let's talk to I'm gonna
screw this up is it a lot s alaap that's
you yeah there you go so what would you
want to talk about you you want to talk
about nokia google i/o none of the above
whoa google i/o okay so what do you
think about google i/o were you were you
happy were you sad I was like at the
time I was really happy and I saw that
Google to a lovely service and I saw
there was no any envelope paper I wish
happy too because ah I got a strong data
ah there is a next version of an amusing
in five point point it should be simple
if Google did it is any simpler version
and we've inside okay yeah I think a lot
of people were I think a lot of people
were anticipating some type of hardware
release some type of new version of
Android key lime pie or at least a new
version of jelly bean and got a lot a
whole lot of developer stuff which I
mean it's cool i'm nodding enough um yes
hi i was waiting for that to sew well
yeah um you know I but i think you know
when you really take a step back and you
look at everything that google did
provide to developers they're building
the app ecosystem you know they're
building it up for everybody it's not
just developers is not just users and
you know to use a baseball analogy i
know that a sacrifice bunt moves a guy
in the store a scoring position but
nobody cares about the guy who did the
sacrifice bunt they want the guy to
drive in the run so and in this case
google pretty much to the sacrifice bunt
and they're leaving up to developers to
drive in the run
so sorry I'm a baseball guy this is very
very steep stone and which was the other
guy uh well we had Harry Caray Steve
stone most recently we had Len Kasper
and Bob Brenly although if you want to
go famous throughout history you're
probably looking at Jack Brickhouse so
he was back here hey yeah really feel
for the Chicago Cubs game nice the wiser
that's right super station right there
baby I'll hijack the topic did yeah yeah
we're hijacking so um of the enhancement
did you want did you have a chance to
watch google i/o yeah I was but it was
late I gotta block i watch the work of
love and the midnight then I left you
think asleep you know you did better
than I did because I was actually at my
day job while that was going on and it
was like it was completely dead at my
day job right up until the google i/o
started and then it was just call after
call after call and I'm like what maps
good what up all right guys keep it keep
up so I've you know I've pretty much
been reading about what was the what was
the favorite thing that you saw at
Google i/o what are you most excited
about if anything Oh yo that Google
Cloud majestically love it because I
have food Isis one is for samsung galaxy
y + 1 is my exes service which I bought
me yesterday so I missed notification in
my samsung galaxy by always because his
disabled sister and she plays along with
it and she something this place is
purification which I good like it okay
alright so was there anything else that
you want to talk to us about anything on
your mind you know Google whether
baseball whatever nothing really jumping
okay are you on are you on the twitters
of the googles or any any type of social
media that you wanted to share with the
rest of the class oh I love like we did
I DS
anyway it be understood yes perfect
perfect okay everybody follow go do it
now now all right so all right well
thanks for joining us that's all the
time we have so i am going to toss it
back on over to the boss man Tony thank
you ping pong ball away so question to
Jaime from a youtube commenter honey
what do you love a lot about barcelo
barcelona how do you say but Philip it's
the best team in history man what is
there not to love about Barcelona aside
from FCB it listen it's the best team in
history but aside from the best team in
history I love the way they play it said
so it's a I consider it a work of art
they are
Purdue galaxy s4 so i think and i'm
ninety-nine point nine percent sure that
is the quad-core Snapdragon s4 version
yeah that's the s4 and a question for me
Tony do you still use the phone bed i'm
sorry i cannot hear you see again do i
still use the phone bed yes I do thank
you and there's your answer okay let me
talk to somebody who is new to me
nicholas Nicholas Oliver I haven't
spoken to you I think ever goodness
where are you from I'm from Poland where
again Oh full report I'm sick up for a
Singapore awesome could you please talk
a little bit louder uh yeah yes we can
what do you want to talk about nokia
lumia 925 google i/o or anything else
google i/o Pixley I want it yes sir yeah
I really love to go yeah i'm using
anxious nice you were saying huh we're
yes we can yeah I really often go so
yeah and it talked about google i/o i
really like nokia so yeah so what what
in specific do you want to talk about
regarding google i/o yeah I'm real
disappointed that we will even involve
the Android key lime pie 4.3 know me
nexus 4 wheel for this mr. one second
hold on why do you think key lime pie
will be for the three and maybe not
five-point oh no no i don'ti I didn't
posted like that ok Maya team will be 54
in Korea and I'm also disappointed that
Google didn't announce the android 4.3
because there were
not that were saying that google is
going to announce 4.3 at Google i/o it
was called fear on their website Tony
Tony if you think about it I mean
android 2.1 was Eclair 2.2 is froyo 2.3
was gingerbread so there is nothing
wrong and having android 4.3 be key lime
pie they're never going to change the UI
signify I agree and it would make a lot
of sense but this morning when I was
covering news shifts and doing some
other stuff for bucket now I read
through the headlines and I've heard
some rumors that next month or maybe
probably at the beginning of July we
will see the nexus 4 in white tie us up
together with Android for that free
which is rumored to bring those
Bluetooth enhancements and since it's
just a Bluetooth enhancement then I'm
guessing it might not be key lime pie
yeah my I definitely not yeah so
Nicholas back to you bleed yeah oh I
wanna have a question oh yes we can just
speak a little bit louder oh yeah relax
was for right I don't time it doesn't
even though he would probably kill for
it and as far as I know Adam doesn't
have one too but we know the topic so
please do ask your question is it worth
upgrading from the yahoo answers to the
nexus 4 series in where I live the next
four is not available yeah it's the
failure of but it cause I have easy
hundred and fifty dollars before
upgrading I'm gonna answer your question
very easily going I have this and I
don't have the nexus for uh you know the
upgrade is not dramatically significant
android 4.2 is so awesome that this
phone rocks regardless you know you need
a better but then the camera on the
nexus 4 is not groundbreaking so if i
were you i'd stick with this galaxy
nexus until the next Nexus arrives in
October that is exactly my
when I was about to say at this point in
time and we are in May 17 it's not worth
the upgrade from the old Nexus to the
nexus 4 because in approximately four or
five months we will have a one year
cycle for nexus 4 so if I be you I just
be waiting for the next Nexus better if
it's the nexus 5 Nexus 4 point something
the next Nexus in general Adam do you
have any thoughts on this oh sorry I
needed uh so yeah I wholeheartedly agree
alerted oh yes i did i went i want the
college so i know i agree when the nexus
4 first came out I was pretty thoroughly
unimpressed with the specification so i
would definitely wait for something
bigger and better and brighter and you
know shinier ok so there's also made by
LG that is that was a mean comment I'm
cocky you are the only LG devotee that I
know that is correct aside from match
Tony phone TT as well Nicholas II had
three answers if you have any other
question oh yeah Oh UFO HTC one like you
have an H if you want do you mean this
one yeah yeah oh how does that phone
feel because where I live it is not
available yet I haven't got my hands on
it for me for ifc or a free versus that
it's good quality is amazing how does it
feel well have you ever held an iphone 5
in your hand yes for you I so if you
have held an iphone 5 an iPad and iPad
Mini or a macbook air or bro it is the
exact feeling in addition the HTC one is
more tapered towards the edges so it
fits very well in your head as far as
healing
the hand is concerned i'd say the HTC
one feels even better in the hand than
the iphone 5 but that's just if we only
consider the feel in the hand the
material how well it fits in your palm
how good the grip is and stuff like that
I think bigger than the actual move this
time say say again please is it me
turned on the losses hostess I don't
know but I have the galaxy s4 here with
me and the difference between between
these two is very very little in terms
of size by itself but the HTC One is
approximately fifteen to twenty percent
heavier than the galaxy s4 without
making the galaxy s4 feel and consistent
so they both feel good in the hand if
you like the touch of aluminum then the
HTC one is for you if you uh yeah that's
Molly yeah thanks that's all then maybe
he's model everybody where they can find
you on twitter google+ or any other
facebook social network of your choice
of your preference no google path and my
youtube account state your name or your
url all my Google+ Google class will
cross over so it is like your name that
is n ik ola s 80 l.i.v.e are Nicholas
Oliver you're awesome Nicholas thank you
very much for joining us and hope you
find the time to join us next week see
ya take care bye thanks that goes back
to you Jaime ok you know I'm trying to
find people here but I really make up
meanwhile meanwhile I have some new
questions from YouTube question the
question for all the bucket Nell team
if you will choose the s4 as your daily
driver which version will be better for
you the google one the google one or the
TouchWiz one you know mmm there's the
boot loader on the on the and at the
google one is going to be unlocked i
would rather get that one and load
TouchWiz whenever I want then go for a
locked bootloader galaxy s4 that I
cannot load stock Android on that would
be me Adam I would have to agree with hi
May um but I would probably get the
unlock bootloader just better to have it
and not need it and then put on TouchWiz
and call today I mean most of what the
s4 is is software enhancements
especially centered around the camera
and that's what I would be most
interested in so I don't know that stock
Google would necessarily have those
Cameron has enhancements without
uploading to Google Plus which we can
talk about of course but like the best
face and you know the eraser and stuff
like that I don't know that stock
Android would have all that so that was
that's what that's what I would be
interesting no I believe not you know I
I do feel that a lot of the features are
gimmicky on the s4 except for the camera
feature so yeah I would definitely get
touch with as well just for that as far
as I am concerned you know guys once the
Google version of the samsung galaxy s4
is out and with AOSP or aokp or whatever
version of google rule google release
the community will be very hard at work
at porting that run to the qualcomm
snapdragon 600 versions across the globe
so if you get the samsung touchwiz
version you will probably be able to
Nexus if I it and also return to the
touch with version but once you get the
google version I'm not sure you'll be
able to flash the TouchWiz version I
mean so the most likely that rom is
dumped already and all you need is a
phone with a lot with an unlocked
bootloader no trouble yes I that's what
I'm thinking that it's a smarter choice
but the problem is obviously most people
live on the contract section so it's
like
now you're not going to get that Nexus
version of the galaxy s4 um without
without a contract so you're kind of
lost there anyways quite as well you
know it depends on everybody I would go
exes Brad for the nexus one it just
little touch with one other question
before we move on Tony do you think
nakia will use the same 41 megapixel
camera in the EOS as the 808 or do you
think they will use some sort of tech in
a more standard sense sensor for example
13 megapixels well I have said this a
lot of times I think that for nokia to
be able to use such a large sensor which
would accommodate 41 megapixels first of
all the platform by itself Microsoft
Windows Phone has to support such a
large camera sensor I think if at the
back end the platform will be ready
windows phone 8.1 8.5 whatever the
version number of blue will be if they
will support large camera sensors nokia
already has an awesome sensor in the 808
and since last year i think they managed
to develop it even further and my dream
phone will be the 808 with the 920
having a baby with 41 megapixel camera
and optical image stabilization for
low-light performance and android and
webos LS all right whose turn is it it's
mine it's mine since I get what's up
let's talk you guys call me yeah man
what's up love how's everyone doing
today trying to conquer the world here
how about you um pretty much the same
all right way Vernon conquered it what
topic you want to pick them well the oh
man there's so many of them goodness um
we will go with you know what will go
with hangouts because it seems to be a
bit of a conundrum right now and I'm
feeling you I've actually needed to
contact two of my teammates today
because I had no idea how to start a
public
what has been your experience for
example tell us well I love how it
integrates with my tablet or phone
everything seamlessly it when you're not
doing video stuff I'm running into a lot
of civilian try believe the cameras
locked on you Tony Tony I was a debating
I was debating whether i should call out
mr. Tibor who is from the same country
as I am teamwork we have tried to join
and talk with you last week we didn't
manage to you this week it doesn't work
so i would like to kindly please ask you
to stop trying to join because you're
blocking the entire hang out and it's
all already on anarchy as it is and I'm
sorry well I was debating that please
repeat the question I'm it or send me
that no no I was telling you that I
think the camera is locked on you the
camera is locked on me no it shouldn't
be ah well weird say I'm sorry you were
telling us about that how's that sorry
well the the text function seems to work
really well but the video function seems
to really be laggy and not really
working so well particularly I think
this the whole issue were having with
the the table were going oh yeah he's
Tibor he's probably using the our
hangouts yeah I'd say hey listen I like
the fact that they won't cross platform
for me it was like for example in pocket
now we use a google apps so our means of
communication are through google
services and you know i hated the fact
that Google Talk did not work on the
iphone that i would pretty much have to
load a third party application to get it
working and so I like the fact that it's
cross-platform i honestly hate the fact
that like for example right now we tried
to start this hangout and you know i
wish that that application would give me
the option that if i'm on a phone I
don't want video video connections to go
through my phone I would like those
pakora ties to the computer instead and
sadly i can't select that like for
example right now i have
to mute all the communications because
every time every time Tino the Tibor
mangoes comes in and out I get a look an
alert on the phone and so I feel that
it's it's a work in progress it's it's a
great progress so far um but I think
that it wasn't broken before ah it
wasn't really broken before there are
certain things that I don't know I i
think that they went too far in mixing
these two things together and now for
example AT&amp;amp;T customers are having the
problem that the video the video
services don't work and sometimes people
don't the whole hangout service doesn't
work for them because it's blocked by
AT&amp;amp;T because of the video thing because
of the video integration are you sure
that's why I tend to be blocked it I
mean they they block everything I'm
pretty sure it's because they sell
messaging separately I mean that's my
opinion yeah mmm yeah I don't know you
you a worrisome I'm in Alabama okay well
what Kerry do use on tmobile they on it
it was horrible t-mobile is horrible
here it's horrible Mitchell well because
I have 2g service I've had 2g for two
years okay goodness and I mean the the
get new galaxy s4 is coming out on
tmobile or AT&amp;amp;T neither one of those are
gonna work well for me here have a
question for you sim how on earth can
you live with 2g um I just send a lot of
emails so you're keeping it thanks Dylan
pretty much know you know that little it
not at all and that's why i love um this
messaging server so much because the
messages are so quick but the whole
video portion is so bad discuss
important to do you know again my
opinion is if they would separate them
or allow you to select where you want
things to be prioritized to I would
prefer it that way because so far I
can't select where notifications follow
what to do it's a mess so far so far so
what's your next topic my way oh my next
topic mmm
alright google plus the whole picture
enhancement service I've been trying to
use it but I haven't seen my Google+
update correctly for all the new
enhanced features is that actually live
right now you're talking to a Google+
hater I don't know I it is working like
for example it is working on the website
for me it's not working on phones for me
yet I don't know uh is it working for
you Adam you are in Chicago do you make
that to Google+ haters hi my three make
that three okay you're doing the German
number three that means you really hate
it no I I'm doing the European number
three which is this and it's not this
which is the american number three
actually that's that's that's three
right there so okay that's as American
as it can get this is Europe yeah that's
amazing to me because you guys say you
use google apps for pretty much
everything and now that Google is
putting my say everything else right I
was I was probably the last bastion of
the entire pocketnow team yeah who was
driving everybody nuts because I didn't
want to give up my microsoft exchange
server for Google Apps and everything
google so i am still at this moment
using microsoft exchange as the only
person on the bucket now team who does
not use google apps and i think hi matt
is probably in between using either gf's
orbit exchange depending on his phone is
exchanged every now and then that was I
got gonna keep doing that because Google
is pretty much using Google+ for
everything it's like the base of all
this or I'll tell you this much they're
doing something smart they're making
Google+ something useful see for me the
problem with g+ is that it was just
another service you know it was just
another social network and now they're
focusing on actually adding value
they're making it edit your photos i
mean i think that that was like insanely
smart I mean he the guy was right
Victor's the kazoo through he was right
I mean you come back from your vacation
you've got a thousand photos
and you want to prioritize but then you
don't have any time to actually organize
your photos in any way so I think that
it's extremely smart I'm not sure that
the photo enhancements that we saw work
good at all but I don't know I'd like to
give them a try so for me I feel that
it's a smart choice to use it as a photo
repository and you know it's cool that I
get to select what you know what I ok so
i'll tell you what i hate about Google+
making a shrunk list Emmett oh yes hate
about Google+ for example and probably
this is going to change right now but I
hate I hated the hangouts mentality I
hated that you know if I have a thousand
followers when I least expected I gotta
hang out requests with ad island asking
me for a hand and I'm like damn I'm
recording wife i'm recording pocket now
daily I'm like you know I rarely ever
talk to most of my Facebook friends so
you know I like what I mean it's are
about more mobile technologies talk
about running or let's talk about coffee
or beer or something so for me Google+
is like it's a good middle ground
between Twitter and Facebook but until
now that they're adding value to it is
what I'm gonna start using it in the
past I didn't use it at all that's
that's me well go go pretty much I mean
what they're doing is everyone who has
andrew a phone now pretty much has to
use Google Plus which no one was using
it before so an unexpected it is smart
enough I will say though that I am
worried that when I want to message Jess
my friends like on facebook facebook is
pretty much for just personal family
stuff yeah so I want to just messaged my
family I do have to worry about
messaging or people that I don't really
know sending messages they need to
separate that out somehow exactly that
for me that's my problem with google
plus it's like I wish I had a choice I
believe that there will be a choice now
you know but you know so far the problem
is it's not there yet so or at least I
don't know I haven't turned it on yet so
I don't know I'll keep you posted but
anyways move any next topic any final
topic
um Wow follow topic Oh somebody talked
to me about the nokia phone i know i'm
waiting for Medland I'm waiting for my
turn about the Nazi bell but nobody
cares about in lumia 925 it's an awesome
phone I've been there I thought it I'll
tell you I know what's talking about it
because it's no different than the 920
it's different because it has a sixth
lens haha that's all that's all I could
get out of the entire nakia team in
London 60 Tony you are telling me that
that's come on you know i i'm not
selling you Nakia Nakia us telling you
I'm just the messenger Yeah Yeah come on
say I'm amazing nope you could come out
with two phones say that they're
different and they're exactly the same
as the 920 Sam we have a question for
you okay akhiya the the so-called or the
rumored Nokia EOS with a 41 megapixel
camera combined with the OIS
stabilization would that be enough for
you to switch to Windows Phone no
because I know system what is it in the
ecosystem that you miss because nakia
made it a huge deal at the London event
that Windows Phone has now 145k
applications aside from Instagram do you
miss anything I like the Google
integration all the new things that
Google is bringing to the table that no
fears trying to work with windows or
windows isn't putting the same emphasis
on that google is so I like the Google
services and also are invested in the
Google ecosystem and you're getting
offerings on Android which you are sure
you would not get on Windows Phone
pretty much at least right now and the
thing is most of the world I'm sure will
probably feel the same which is why
windows isn't doing so well and Google
is doing so much to stretch that out now
with all this new stuff they're adding
this is you but you've got the you
probably made the most solid point of
why Windows Phone doesn't take off I
mean honestly it's like the solid the
smartest thing i've heard i mean think
about it it google microsoft came up you
know google comes up with their sir
service it was awesome now Microsoft was
like okay I'm gonna compete you know
instead of saying okay let's make Google
a great Microsoft Partner know they were
like okay now let's get which was it
msms amazon services yep dip work then
we get Windows Live then work then we
get thing then work let's get everything
that we can out there let's get a Google
is doing naps let's bring out our own
nap mat service the problem is you know
I like the fact for example one of the
things that I like about Apple is that
there they don't try to do everything
they focus on doing certain things right
and then they partner with other
companies that do the other things right
so you got google maps on the iphone
yeah they screwed up with their new map
service and they're coming back but big
time being is you know week i could
notice it and Larry page's face when he
was at the keynote that their
relationship with Microsoft is extremely
stressed it is extremely stressed and
therefore you know but there's no way
that Windows Phone is going to take off
if they don't figure out a way to
embrace Google well yeah I will
contradict chief just for one second it
depends on really which side of the coin
are you looking at because if you ask
google that's of course Google
standpoint but if you ask microsoft
microsoft will tell you that google cut
them out because they give they gave no
api is for accessing google mail then
now there's the cease-and-desist thing
for youtube so everything's Tony
everybody's got their own story
interestingly Apple managed to get a
decent YouTube application and there are
no problems so what's the problem with
Microsoft oh no I think it's gonna be
the end of Nokia because of it they made
a bad choice when they had the choice
between windows or android so do you
think do you think Google is a little
bit bitter because nokia chose windows
phone / Microsoft instead of android /
google back in 2011 no because they have
samsung so that is another i agree that
the solid point but i think if nakia
would have went android in 2011 right
now and this is my personal opinion they
would be breathing down
Samsung's neck heavily mm-hmm probably
so and I mean I think that competition
would have been good for us I'm an
Android in general I think I think we've
been better and maybe maybe Google was a
little upset then maybe because nokia
had a nice product but I mean it's just
I don't think it matters to them so much
cause Google new Pinocchio is the one
that's going to lose out on that okay
thank you pining back to you if you want
to rip it up Sam it's it's a pleasure as
always talking to you buddy any final
thoughts any questions or anything for
rapaho I love you guys do a great job
congratulations to all of you and keep
we love you too thank you very much and
the camera is locked eyes who watch us
know where to follow you but those who
don't there's your / handle so everybody
go follow us employed jr. oh yeah let's
go together before I hand it over to
Adam here's a question for not
necessarily Jaime but I know it sits in
his court mm-hmm what features would it
take for all of you to switch the
Windows Phone and in this case for you
to switch the windows phone ah is it
about features really or is it about the
ecosystem or is it about the experience
oh ok so it is a very difficult response
it's it windows phone for me just
doesn't feel natural in a lot of things
um I just don't relate to the operating
system it's pretty um but I'm i don't
know i don't like the mentality ok so i
used to work in a corporate company for
15 years and the mentality and
corporations is let's make something
that's efficient let's make something
that's fast let's make something that is
as effective and windows phone is
everything that a corporation would be
happy with meaning it is extremely fast
that is extremely fluid but it is so
efficient that it's not really visually
appealing it is extremely sluggish when
it comes to a lot of the thirty third
party applications you know you do get
whatsapp fun you do get it but it's
extremely slow have you ever tried
loading it yeah you do get youtube have
you ever tried load
youtube video on that service so I'm
like yeah it is great I've never seen
battery management as good as in Windows
Phone so rated r 8 operating system made
for a business guy that will never buy
it on the other hand I mean have you
ever seen somebody you know if you give
somebody a BMW and you give them uh give
me a Toyota Corolla very efficient car
whatever you want you give them the two
options and then you tell them that
you're going to charge them the same ten
thousand dollars for the car what do you
think the owners gonna choose the BMW or
the corolla so the problem is user
mindsets are like okay Samson gives me
all this and then I have windows phone
which doesn't give me all that for the
same money where do you think my money's
gonna go even though you will probably
never use 75% of those right but people
don't think that way come flirt like I
would rather get more from my money
that's the mentality wrong Adam you're
the resident Windows Phone guy you're
already on Windows Phone but do you have
anything to to comment on this um I
think I think the biggest problem you
know I actually you know I wrote a piece
a week ago or week or so ago about you
know things that Windows Phone needs and
I talked about you know additional
customization give us a couple different
keyboards give us additional web
browsers and you know once now that I'm
back on Windows Phone full-time again
the one of the things I'm realizing that
Windows Phone just kind of sucks at is
anything background and what I'm talking
about is messaging I'm talking about
skype i'm talking about google talk i'm
talking about anything that it which it
should be sitting there waiting for
something to happen and once it does
happen it just doesn't seem to it
doesn't seem to let you know I mean I
google talk is a horrible experience on
the Windows Phone skype isn't much
better you know the only thing that
really kind of works is facebook chat
and that's because it's integrated
os-level um so that's billith flow I
don't know that it's necessarily slow
I'm
carrying two phones and all the time i
get my notifications first on the iphone
and then five minutes later they arrive
on Windows you know but I'll flip it
back on you yesterday I'm sitting at my
desk at work and I'm getting Twitter
notifications on my windows phone before
Twitter's telling me the website is
telling me that i have a new interaction
or something so I did you know I think
it's just based on your experience but
you know your mileage will vary as they
say so I mean I don't find it to be
particularly slow I they tend to come in
right around the same time at least for
me maybe it's my Wi-Fi maybe it's
whatever but yeah so I mean I get
notifications seem to come through
pretty quick but just background tests
it doesn't seem to handle very well and
I should take this opportunity since the
ball is in your court Adam please we've
got tooth buddy to talk to okay I just
want to throw out one other thing you
know before we before I pick my person
you know our topic of the of the day is
Nokia's conference and Google i/os
conference the topic of the podcast
yesterday was Nokia's conference in
Google i/o um did I did everybody forget
that blackberry had a thing this week to
some apparently yes I just sit here and
I'm like I've heard just like laughing
yeah heard that lame wait oh god oh ok
let's brawl names back in the day when I
met you and I were young and Tom my
commenters who phones like these that's
correct I use one of that too to all my
commenters on my blood is blackberry
still alive article this is my point I'm
just saying anyway so having said that
oh I'm gonna go i'm gonna go ahead and
talk to mark is it mark saw one yeah how
you doing how's it going mark how you
doing today good good good so what do
you want to talk about with blackberry
I'm just kidding so what do you want to
talk about today using this out you and
Michael Fisher get along don't you guys
use the city yeah absolutely
um actually look we can continue that
the Nokia Microsoft talking and I'll end
with google i/o because it really is an
interesting situation for them because
it's obvious that Nokia is a hundred and
ten percent held back by Microsoft by
the software you know it's kind of like
I like you know these events that they
throw it's like you know here's what we
got you know they just throw out these
phones and it's kind of like let's stay
here and wait until Microsoft has
something for us yeah you know yeah yeah
and I think and you know what I was
gonna say just one other thing when
people decide whether they're going to
buy a samsung gs4 or a Nokia Lumia 920
they're not deciding between samsung and
nokia they're deciding between Android
and Windows fall so I just want to throw
that out there as you were absolutely
absolutely and I mean I I have a 8x you
know sitting in my drawer here and I i
like i love that I love I love the UI I
think it's got a lot of things going for
it but Microsoft just needs to make a
more compelling argument for for windows
phone itself I mean for example I feel
like if they don't leverage a lot of
next week's Xbox event to Windows Phone
then I think I mean I think that's one
of their last shots essentially is the
whole mobile gaming market because
that's still relatively untouched and
you have some really high quality games
for iOS and Android and you know you
have the RIA that's releasing a month
but still i mean the the mobile gaming
market is still completely untapped if
an end and anyone can do it microsoft
kin okay so i think i think i'll be
interesting to see how they you know
integrate that whole ecosystem um but
yeah I mean I mean people yeah I'm sorry
I just have a question and back in I
think 2011 or 2012 at mwc i interviewed
the marketing manager from microsoft and
back at that point i asked him what are
a sony playstation style windows phone
with the gaming controller would be a
solid solution or would be a decent plan
for Microsoft to do with the oldie Xbox
gaming and integrate
everything and back at that point they
said that they had no plans to do that
like this the Zeus hold on let me Lock
by Cameron you mean yes that exactly so
imagine that with with Windows Phone and
the gaming controls and taking the
advantage of the entire Xbox games and
the entire suit and they said they
wouldn't do it so mark my question for
you is do you think that's something
like that would have probably saved or
or boosted Windows Phone I think so and
I mean what if what if they took a step
further and instead of you know doing
something almost gimmicky like that what
if they enabled something like the
nvidia project shield where you can
stream your xbox like the full quality
xbox games to the phone so essentially
it's not a question about hardware as it
is more software that's a cool idea
right i mean i mean online tried to do
it and I mean they had they had a rocky
start which kind of threw them off but I
mean if you have the right
infrastructure it can be done so yeah
true and you know going back to a point
that you made at the beginning that's
another solid point about Windows Phone
when we were in the HTC 8x event um
there was the phone um it was cute and
all but Windows Phone 7 Windows Phone 8
was not ready so we could only see the
phone and we could only see the
employees moving everything around but
we couldn't even manipulate the damn
thing because windows phone 8 wasn't
ready the same thing happened with the
Nokia Lumia 920 why was the damn phone
late because Windows Phone a wasn't
ready so again this is like the tech
irony the biggest tech irony of history
you have a software expert and you have
a hardware expert and the hardware
expert which is it is much tougher
tougher for you to have a supply chain
going to build at a unibody
polycarbonate phone then for you to get
all your engineers to build an app
rating system that's already existed in
all you needed to do is enhance it so I
can understand why why is it the
hardware was ready and the software what
that was stupid
yeah I I think I think at this point I
think Microsoft is almost in the exact
same position that Android was at its
two years day right I mean up until I
mean I mean this is Inc is a great you
know piece of proof but up until now
android has been essentially playing
catch-up with iOS catch up to the market
share right so features that essentially
it released were all things to either
compete or give it like you know small
wake up from iOS not you know Android
has such a big market share goo can do
playful things like you know the new
Google+ camera for photo features and
things like that they can you know start
to gear things more towards consumers in
general right yeah right yes i saw this
google i/o is more of like fine-tuning
the whole experience like we've got all
this you know they spent you know
several years building up building the
bill getting their market share getting
everything together and now this year
they felt like they could kind of fine
to the experience you know it's not so
much get stuff out the door now now it's
more about making sure that the stuff
goes out the door is high quality yeah
exactly and i'm now I actually this i/o
made me more optimistic about the next
version of android and the next you know
line of Nexus devices I think what's
going to end up happening it we're going
to see here is start to see a change
where the Nexus devices are going to
remain inexpensive devices but they're
going to be geared toward developers
only and who knows what other
partnerships they can get with other
OEMs like that it would Samsung for more
I guess consumer stock Android
experiences Nexus products or what i
would call disruptive products here you
are net android tablets did not take off
they came up with everything they could
and then comes the nexus 7 4 205 yes all
that needed to happen for one android
tablet to take off a nexus product to
make it take off the same happen with
the nexus one that people don't remember
people don't remember what what android
phones were before the nexus one and
then came that beautiful good phone with
the first one gigahertz processor
it was fast it was fluted it was
beautiful that's you know if you don't
remember android phones before that they
were horrible they were hard you know i
think the thing what they do is disrupt
they challenge the system and i love
what they're doing I you know the Nexus
program needs to continue challenging
the system that's what needs to continue
happening yeah absolutely and I mean I
you know I haven't really spent much
time thinking about it but you know all
the all the new API is and developer
tools they gave these developers it
really makes me curious as to what
they're what they're doing in terms of
the next Android release right I mean
they're happy there has to be a means to
an end to be means right so it's just
you know a lot of the location stuff
they're doing a lot of the low battery
low power stuff they've been releasing
it it's just interesting to see what's
what's going to come of it ok I would
like to kindly pass everything back to
Adam because we shamelessly hijacked his
topic no no that's fine actually knows
actually yeah any any final thoughts
mark we're kind of hitting our ceiling
here a little bit so ya know that's what
I out let's move it to the next person
ok all right well thanks for coming on
it looks like you're got your google
plus up there is that you're just first
name last name on google+ that's the one
okay so all right well very good thanks
for joining us and love your thoughts
and we will toss it on back to Tony
thank you very much and thank you Mark
for joining us as usual every week and I
have a question from YouTube do you
think android will lead the smartphone
market for the next couple of years I'll
gonna answer first I cannot see another
company by passing them i mean the
closest competitor is Apple's iOS they
have at any point three devices may be
four out there the iphone 5 the 4s the
for the ipad mini the ipad for maybe
another ipad so six devices running iOS
versus 75,000 328 devices running
Android so I cannot see when you got it
up hi Maddy do you think the same or do
you have any other options
it's seventy six thousand three hundred
men oh yeah I'm sorry I didn't call
glass galaxies at well my Lydia is going
for second place was in my mode so don't
worry about i'm looking at the test all
right um listen um I don't know there is
no way that androids going to lose
there's just no way it's an open source
system people are capable of selling
their phones as their own brand they can
do whatever they want i mean android
they already made a refrigerator out of
it that they already made your
android-powered toaster Tony yeah no no
that's the webos toaster i'm waiting for
the anchoring vacuum cleaner and
dishwasher android is such a resilient
work of art you got google glass and by
the way this is somebody that prefers
iOS seriously but i believe that there
is much more potential in android in the
future there's it's already what it is
now and it's gonna be twice as big later
unless somebody figure something smarter
out but i really doubt it i mean i don't
hear so here's what I disagree if if if
if ever android will lose the top number
spot and something should happen it will
not be because of a competitor i think
if that thing happens android will
implode so it's androids it's androids
game to lose as what yours absolutely
it's only android that can screw up a
turret okay that's fair me i would have
to agree i would say even more than two
years i would say probably at least
three to four years projecting out i
mean who else is gonna catch up to him I
mean it's just not it's just not going
to happen especially with you know I
mean Samsung and HTC are leading the
charge right now but who knows what om
might be around the corner just waiting
just waiting for to bring in their own
offering so yeah it's definitely going
to be you know Sam it's definitely gonna
be Android until windows phone you know
takes them over and dominates the world
thank you I'm sorry I almost got that
out of the straight face I was this
close okay oh alright thank you I'm
seeing a lady which is venting not only
herself but she is venting her laptop
with her own two hands I can't remember
the last
that but if you can describe shortly the
procedure and after that I know you're
the biggest nakia fan Madeleine and
we'll talk about nakia Lumia 925 yeah
well yeah I was actually pretty
disappointed not to hearing anything
about the US extreme how how hot is it
in Denmark now meaning that have it's
only 22 degrees Celsius 22 I had five
degrees Celsius in London two days ago
and I was dressed like this with a
t-shirt and and short short bangs and
when I landed it was barely almost
snowing so it was not what do you think
about the Lumia 925 I know you're a huge
nakia fan well i think i would get it um
but I don't like the design of the back
it's what is it sorry hmm is it the
choice of materials or is it the design
itself the sign itself around him mmm oh
so you say that the camera is looking
pretty much like the camera on the HTC
one with the lens yeah okay but that's a
minor thing i think i will choose the 25
/ them 900 the 925 oh yeah that's that's
that woman I 20 but yeah I like that 928
honestly Michael made a solid point I
mean Lumia 920 between the 925 I'd
rather go for the 920 why well I don't
know that the design is a more unique I
i consider Madeline's point to be solid
i mean i like that i'm 20 more even if
it's heavier you guys have jack hold the
925 it is it is it will give you mixed
feelings the first time you get it in
your hand it will give you the same
feeling when you get yes for this is too
cheap it's inconsistent I don't want to
use it but when you get a feel for it
shipping address at the bottom Tony
shipping address at the bar I'll take
note when you get a feel for the
aluminum which by the way is only on the
of the phone then you'll have that
strange combination that we are your
left foot is in a hot tub and your right
foot is it a freezing water it's cold on
the sides in the aluminum and it's warm
on the back with the woody polycarbonate
yeah but Tony you know I came home the
other night and I when I went up to my
bedroom and I tossed my toss my 920 down
on the charging light your was such
a beautiful feeling man I haven't had
that Philip I haven't had that feeling
for like a year and a half now since i
since i lost the pre three so not lost
i'm actually gives this idea right there
the 925 has an additional lens in
addition to the five lens on the 920
which gives it more clarity under normal
and low light situations boom sound you
still have to plug it in boom sound
unless you get a wireless charging cover
unless you get a stupid hat for it thank
you okay we're playing devil's advocate
meddling back to you it's your time now
actually I have a question to add on
there you said it there's my facebook
night youtube app for windows though
right um there's its hotly contested at
this point I mean I can still get
youtube videos on my 920 i'm not sure
what the exact state of affairs is as
far as that's concerned but they are
definitely having a little bit of a
hissy fit with each other so okay
because YouTube is mainly the most
important that for me sure sure I use
YouTube on a daily basis so I don't know
about necessarily on my phone but in
principle I use YouTube all the time as
does i would guess a lot of people so um
but i haven't had a problem with it up
no just i'll pull up a YouTube right now
but if the app were to disappear can you
use browse or something like that well
actually I'm gonna step in right here
just for a second Eva since they won on
Windows Phone youtube for windows phone
was just a shortcut an icon which
lead you to the mobile application over
there watch the videos online on the
site this application is different you
can Madeline you can and actually html5
on when on the widow's home browser is
very good it is i would consider the
html5 experience superior on windows
phone but the problem is that the
browser is not based on the WebKit
protocol so for example if you're
watching a video right now and you buy
any reason press any of the capacitive
buttons and leave the browser whenever
you return to the video it'll start from
the beginning whereas if you do it on
the application you don't have that
problem and if you do it on ios and
android you don't have that problem only
in windows front is they don't use web
but as far as far as actually playing
here you go there's Anton hi Anton how
you doing hey I'm I said I'm also
hearing Ravi on back in London yeah so
yeah so yeah I was able to pull it out I
mean at least in the mobile web browser
it's a workaround but let's face it it's
windows phone what is listen to work
around on Windows Phone so long live
chevron yeah Madeline yeah else any
questions to the team any final thoughts
its use your time however you wish well
yeah i still wait for the US it even
though i'm really disappointed that they
haven't given any information about that
it there's an interesting story when i
was back in london i met this awesome
awesome lady who was in charge with a
couple of phones and she was kind enough
to help me get some hands-on and she at
one point noticed that i grabbed the 808
PureView from from my bag and I compared
it against the Lumia 925 and of course
she was kind enough to wait until I
finish the video and she said to me i'll
try to quote you know what could be the
biggest thing that can happen and I was
like know what the 808 PureView in that
Jesse's running Windows Phone 8 and I
was like you got me even though not with
those phony
android God is yeah android I'm not sure
and if somebody is knowledgeable enough
watching this could you guys leave a
comment or send me an email Anton at
pocketnow.com does android support high
resolution sensors like the 41-megapixel
sensor let's say nokia would have a
choice let's go with android would
android support 41 megapixel camera
sensors hi I believe that the
manufacturer would be responsible for
building the driver the driver is one
thing but the platform by itself the
actual snapping the picture through the
driver writing it too after processing
it writing it to the file system is that
something which supports because I don't
symbian nokia had to do that
specifically for symbian for the 808 we
have a galaxy camera man i don't know
well that's that's how many megapixels
is that that's 16 but still you know
it's an optical sensor it's a different
ball game and I guess they figured it
out so I think that Android can do it
but he knows a developer maybe please
drop us a line nine o'clock it's just
data just put the date on the phone just
do it so yeah it's great Medlen I have a
question for you yes if supposedly the
Nokia EOS with 41 megapixel sensor and
the optical image stabilization would
come up with an awesome aluminum chassis
sand and all the good stuff but running
Android would you go for it well I don't
really hate and right but I don't I just
think it's kind of boring it's it's for
Mia I'm done with it would you buy it or
do you not Alice me nah maybe right now
I'm actually actually kind of like the
Sony Xperia said are because it's a
water-resistant yes that's it's a cool
feature I know you had that right
I have the Zia oh this yell actually
talking about water resistance and my
stepfather he dropped his 920 in a
bucket of water oh and I said to him
that he should take his phone cook it in
a bowl of white rice and leave it for
tonight and it worked the day after oh
nice that will just about knocked aerial
quality yeah but just remember that the
internals will rust at some point it's
not it's not coated so the smartest
thing is to figure out a way to just get
it replaced for warranty I'm at least
had the toilet phone oh the toilet phone
is here yes toilet phone here it is HTC
sensation and that nice works I know it
doesn't work anymore sadly it does a
woody it worked for a full year before
calling it quits after falling in the
toilet yeah see if I drop my phone in
the bucket in a bucket of water I'd
probably put in a bowl of rice for like
three days I would like to want to get
every little sip of moisture out of that
thing that I could I wouldn't I wouldn't
just do it overnight I do it for days
also sells my salt works pretty well
yeah salt works well okay you know and
Tony going going back to your question
for Madeleine I don't understand why
Nokia can't go both ways I mean they've
got the Rajah lineup why don't they come
up with their Android lineup and keep
their lluvias fine I can only apply on
this and since they made such a huge
deal about knowing windows phone because
they didn't want to get lost in the sea
of android oems now it becomes a thing
of pride maybe now after New Year's that
they stuck the Windows Phone going
Android would be like recognizing that
okay we were wrong we lost in this game
and we are trying desperately to catch
up to something in order to survive not
to mention what does that say about your
Lumia line I mean you know where we've
we've been all Lumia for two years and
now oh wait here's an android phone oh
but still pleased by Lumias yeah okdokey
a right on top of that no problem yeah
nokia is an expert in hardware they've
brought so much innovation into the
world
mean I don't want no get a die that's my
problem that I my first four phones were
made by nokia i call it Nokia's problem
but okay I also think it's not a good
idea that they make so many different
phones and subscribe to the YouTube
channel and get videos from every film
they made I think it's confusing how
much the how many phones that make yeah
yeah they should keep to the one phone
and keeping them open for every carrier
that would be smart yeah let me add has
a carrier problem too because they've
got the 920 the 928 the 925 the 920
six-and-a-half edges I really need to go
cross they really need to go across all
carriers with the same device the same
branding just bits and it's a Lumia 920
or whatever I just won't even heard of
Adam I would go further I don't think
that nokia has a carrier problem i think
that nokia has a u.s. perception problem
because if you're looking at the latest
numbers which nakia published the
financial numbers the entire Earth
globally nokia saw a rise and in its as
in market share it's us the only market
where they saw a slight slight slight
sly close to zero increase or was it a
decrease so I think Nokia made the big
mistake that back in the day when they
were the number one OEMs they neglected
the US market and now the US market is
reacting I mean if you negate or such a
long time you know what know yourself
and that's all well I mean that could be
too but they're also selling five
different flagship phones in the United
States which one do you get the 920 the
925 and then 28 oh yeah it's it's just
if they would go across you know cross
carriers in the United States or
wherever and just keep the same darn
name I mean that way people will know
it's a nokia lumia 920 they don't have
to guess what why is my why is my 928
better than the 920 well it's not i have
the
answer for that and my interview from
London okay I'm not gonna I see horrors
mispers I see what you did there okay oh
but I think and then it doesn't matter
because all and the phones that comes to
Denmark they are open to every carrier
we have yeah and I don't think we're the
the 925 of the 928 is coming to Denmark
so I think you will only get them in 25
and you will have the option of either
925 or 920 which are both global
versions and there's the situation is
the same here and in Romania or in the
entire Europe and it's the same i think
in Honduras with time it's just the US
where every carrier has to be pleased
yeah yeah I think you know the 925 is
coming I still waiting for the EOS yeah
yeah then the problem is the United
States is a credit country a hundred
percent credit so it's if nobody buys
anything cash out even you know it's
funny if I it's harder for me to make
five hundred dollars in my country then
to make five hundred dollars in the
United States and still the United
States is more of a credit country even
even if the value of money over there is
much higher it's just that it's just the
cultural thing that it is I know closing
thoughts or maybe a question for any one
of us I think the final thing I wanted
to say and I have wanted to say a long
time that is the only thing i like about
iOS it's the year equus is that the
products they work together yeah I think
that will be the thing that would be
most compelling to Microsoft if they
could do something like that from the
film's to the tablet to the computer now
that they have the windows a decline so
you're saying that if Windows RT and
windows 8 and windows phone 8 and
windows 8 on the tablet would play
together as well as maybe the max the
iphones the iPads the Apple TVs and so
on they could sell more if they did that
because I have known people that
said that a has tried the windows phone
and then shifted back because they
didn't like how that didn't work with
the computer or tablet so okay i have
got it I know a lot my camera on you and
that's gonna be because you have your
twitter handle there right yes if it's
not awkward everybody go follow Madeline
at ma d z IE CA T headland thank you
very much and you know I'm right there
with you I'm waiting for the EOS I'm a
huge 808 fanboy probably the only one on
this planet but that's that's the camera
for me yes there you've got Maxie's he's
there he's oh yeah they call it the Tony
phone yeah Madeline thank you very much
for joining and hope to see you next
week that's why I joining hi here bye
bye and before this is going to be the
final round so it's gonna be one more
chemical and one more Adam Cole and no
more calls for me but before that
there's the question to Jaime do you
think ios7 might be the biggest thing
this year from apple ah that's a big
question I don't know I've never seen
anything any software ever made by
Jonathan Ive i have seen OS 10 being
dramatically improved by craig federighi
so functionality wise it could be the
design wise i think that apple's gonna
play it safe and leave it conservative
and therefore i don't really think that
it's going to be groundbreaking
initially it'll probably be on version 2
or something but who knows i mean
probably we don't know the fact that
probably iOS 7 could have been a work in
progress for the past two years I mean
Steve Jobs said that iOS originally was
five years ahead of its time and that
would that ended in 2012 so probably
they started building you know it to
whatever we're going to get in june or
probably not that's it's it's a very
tough question to answer right now much
for your answer I've been trying
desperately to try to stop the ongoing
flood from alec Alexandra
Prado who is I guess a national of mine
but there's no way I can do that so
we'll just have to put up with the lag
and everything that happens I have lost
control of everything so with that I'm
gonna hand it over to Jaime okay so
since this is the final hang out and
there is a bad mother deed fan here that
I don't want to talk to Lulu I would
have to talk to the guy because he has a
blackberry question so this is gonna
make Adam happy not really all right ho
step on wed what's up hey how are you
can you hear me oh can he just find
trying to conquer the world here okay I
have a question for all you guys far
away okay blackberry is just releasing
his BBM in summer and I think and don't
you think this is just a slaver
blackberry just for introduce he's it's
a smart phone to android because our
blackberry sofurry stacking technology
company bleeding so what do you think
about it okay I'll give you an example
IBM IBM used to be a hardware company
they build computers originally and then
they ended up being a software company
he asked for the last five or six years
I think that Nokia is making a budge
into their here services in order for
them to land and mail as a software
company if their hardware intent doesn't
work and i do believe that what
BlackBerry's doing is the same thing
they're like okay if we can't succeed in
building phones then let's make the best
messenger out there the problem is there
five years late if they would have done
this five years ago then BBM would have
made sense because in latin america you
and I are in Latin America this is
blackberry land or at least this was
blackberry land up to a year ago um but
the problem is that they didn't react
and that whatsapp ate the market share
and so the problem is why would you want
to move away from whatsapp on what's
happened already just as good as BBM I
mean bbm is going to be here and on to
be honest with you something that I've
been noticing for the last four months
is that everybody that I know has an
iphone and I didn't see that before
everybody that I knew had a blackberry
before
so sadly this is gonna be the year for
the iphone in latin america next year
it's gonna be for the galaxy because
they don't even know what android is
they know what the galaxy is and that's
gonna be the deal sadly so i believe
that there it's a smart move the
blackberries doing but i feel it's too
late that's my perspective and that's my
perspective any other question I was I
was desperately waiting for Adam to jump
in before I was chewing my answer but no
I think had him agrees completely with
you yeah that's Jamie I'm a pretty much
summed it up so so fire away tony well i
was saying the following thing I don't
think that having a blackberry messenger
application for Android and iOS would do
any good in the short mid or long term
for for blackberry as a platform and as
a company because I was a blackberry
user just like Jaime my entire company
was on blackberry all the communications
were happening on blackberry today I
cannot tell you one or two of my friends
/ acquaintances who still use blackberry
so let's say Alan stole BBM on Android
or iOS Who am I gonna talk to you know
the only reason the only reason why I
start using bbm is not necessarily
because I have any friends left using it
but because i know that it's like one of
the most secure services out there um so
yeah i mean if you have a need to have
like a very secure conversation with
somebody that you don't want to get
leaked bbm is gonna be like your safest
pick but then yeah I bet you how the
situation is in your region guys but
here and in Europe and especially in
eastern europe facebook Messenger has
become the standard for all
communications and it even it even beats
SMS now one thing you I don't know if
you've ever talked Tony with with
Michael I have not asked him this
question I really would like to know
where probably you know about this Adam
if the blackberry z10 requires a
connection to the inner to an internet
server to the blackberry internet server
or does it connect like every other
phone to the typical internet 8
provided by the carrier do does any of
you know how I think if the if my
previous usage of blackberry phones is
any example I have not used the BB 10 or
the c10 or the q10 but it needs an
internet connection to connect to BB
sbes and bis which are blackberry
enterprise service blackberry internet
service and library whatever service no
ok so that's both good and bad because
that that's both good and bad that
because that server falls all the time
lately I don't know what's wrong with
blackberry yeah I mean I was gonna say
remember the huge blackberry messenger
outage at half and what about two years
ago I mean it was a global thing and it
was just because you know someone
tripped over the cord and server room or
something it's so but I mean that
happened and like blackberry around the
world went dead so I would imagine
there's has to be some type of
connection to something located in
Canada but I'm as far as like the actual
architecture behind it got me so yeah
any other questions that was open with
no it's okay imma Thank You probative
it's a pleasure it's a pleasure talking
to you I don't know if you can lock the
camera Tony for hold on just one second
there it is it should be locked and
listen I don't care if we have muddied
winds today that's the copilot's the
second place that doesn't really matter
right i mean Barcelona is already the
champion that is what matters word was
annoyed a pleasure talking to you
bye-bye because nobody I have one
personal obligation and this is a
question on my personal facebook account
link right there from Peter Nicholas
bravado and he's a long time pocket now
reader and he has a question for all of
us and the question goes like this do
you think sometime in the future OEMs
will launch their phones with just talk
android rather than the OEM skin or make
it an option to turn it out of the theme
just like the HTC first reason why I'm
bringing this up now is the gs4 now
launching vanilla makes me think that
this will be a slowly developing
between oems I don't say it you know
oems put so much into their skins and so
much into and actually when I first
broke my first facebook home piece I was
under the impression that home was you
know just wiping over everything because
nobody had seen it yet I mean you know
there were a couple of leaks but I mean
for the most part I was just going by
what they saw in the video and my whole
point at the time was you know OEMs put
a lot of money into research and
development for these skins they put a
lot of work into these things to make
them the more the most usable flavor of
Android out there therefore people will
come by it i mean it is it possible sure
in the next couple of years i would say
probably not that's going to have to be
a that's going to be had that's gonna
have to be a trend that starts with the
grassroots movement the geeks and then
that'll move to the general population
at that point OEMs will look at it and
say oh what are we blowing all this
money on research and development for
let's just put stock on in a call today
so but yeah that's that's several years
out if if at all I'll give you my
perspective um it would be going back in
time I mean if we go back to Android
version 1.6 that's the way things worked
you got a phone with android and cirno
liam's like HTC came out with the
version of sense you know their first
version of sense on the HTC which was at
the hero I believe the hero was phone
with HTC sense so in the past it used to
be that way in the past windows mobile
used to be that way as well um the
problem is that that system did not work
and it's funny it's a complete irony I
mean think about it these hardware
companies are doing an awesome job with
hardware wouldn't it be smart to just
let Google focus on the software and
have everybody be you know have
everything work together it should be
that way but the problem is that it has
proven it has proven not to work you
know if the if the hardware companies
are not in control of their own software
they can not enhance the experience in a
way for them to differentiate their
hardware for people to want the phone
and sadly for everybody you know you
don't
with this proportion of the phone you
don't interact with the aluminum when
you interact with is what's on the
screen that's really what matters it's
what's on the display its what's on the
software so i think the Tony put it best
in in our hangout yesterday when he said
samsung sells you a Samson's bum they
don't sell you an android device they
sell you a samsung phone and therefore a
companies are going to continue trying
to differentiate that's the reason why
windows phone does not take off because
OEMs do not feel and control the process
and microsoft is not doing a better job
than they are that's the problem ok ok
thank you very much and before I hand it
over to the last call of the day it
looks like we have a comment here it
says bb10 uses normal internet i use it
daily thank you very much Ravi or ray V
and there's there's a lot of comments on
YouTube concerning a alleged PocketNow
phone and people would actually pay four
hundred dollars for that and I can
already see ourselves in in a garage
with brandon michael taylor and
everybody on the team soldiering
motherboards and then doing stuff what
do you guys think you bring the
soldering iron I'll bring the beer I was
gonna bring the beer you're not you're
gonna do the BBQ man I'll handle the
grill Oh Adam please they can scold ah
let's go with alexandra is that is that
you Alexandra ch eat try a try
ch Alexandra how you doing I think you
might be muted in there no we might have
to move on audio issues no no problem
Adam bleach I don't know all right yes
sir oh you know you are okay sorry it's
my i use a google plus because I I
watched your
your last life pocketnow and honor the
first time i use it i didn't know how to
desert activate it activate my my don't
work we hate it too don't worry consider
yourself because I activated so what do
you want to chitchat about you want to
talk about google i/o nokia that other
company what do you got I don't know
maybe Google i/o is is a is a good point
because I think that Google i/o bra
brought a lot of things new besides what
people think because we are a very we
are used to lots of new things but
Google is doing always something new and
it's improving I think that most of the
things that they do is integrating all
the new things that other companies do
like Google+ is something like Facebook
that thing that the last time in pocket
now live someone talk about the picture
with the faces that are attached that is
a future feature that has if i'm not
mistaken the experience he and they
brought that feature they know no has
some phone I could chew on maybe or some
other phone has technology as for the
galaxy on work ok ok technology the
technology is actually Nokia's oh ok
that's instant interesting story so so I
think that Google a lot a lot on the
table but I also think that you are
right Jamie Rivera about Google waiting
for the able to release their the new
new I iOS iOS yeah then they they will
make the step to release the new android
and I think that is the there they are
changing because first time I April will
release their their features after
Google so they had a point ahead now is
google that is doing the reverse think
about this don't so I think that Google
is maturing in some way you know the
things that they do yeah that could be I
mean I I kind of disagree about the
whole timing aspect you know I don't
know that Google necessarily waiting on
Apple to decide what they're gonna put
out as opposed to you know to counter
what Apple does cuz I got to think that
all this stuff has been decided a long
time ago I mean this isn't this isn't
the type of stuff you sit down in a
garage over a weekend and bang out you
know a best face feature on the camera
this is something that's in development
for you know months and months and
months so I have to think that there's
executives in Google that are holding
spec sheets for Android seven you know
that are kind of going over them I'm
approving what's going to be there and
you know and I i I'm pretty sure there's
a samsung executive that has a galaxy
note5 on his desk already to approve so
um I mean here's the problem Adam do you
remember what Android looked like before
it was launched I what was Android I
know I love I loved the landscape layout
with a 40 keyboard and okay so let's
let's remember this when blackberry was
was went sorry when Android was
initially considered when Sergey Brin
and look for this video on YouTube when
he introduces Android for the first time
it was a product to compete with
blackberry um Windows Windows Mobile lot
when it was launched it was a product to
compete with Nokia and then out of the
blue comes apple with something
completely different and everybody was
flummoxed everybody was like capacitive
despues aluminum chassis um the for
every nobody remembers this before
gigabytes of storage back then was
literally almost impossible to find
and so so the point being is I think
that Google is doing the smart thing and
not under estimating what Apple is going
to do in june because a lot of things
are changing we don't have the
stubbornness of scott forstall anymore
so it could be that what we get as
groundbreaking it could be not but you
know I think that you know Google
already learned their lesson they they
you know they learn what happened with
the iphone they completely swapped
everything and they came up with the HTC
dream that's the reason why the code
name is dream which we eventually new at
the tmobile one the the whatever the g1
and you know I think that it's happening
again you know they underestimated apple
with the ipad they didn't know anything
about it when you least expect that boom
here's the IMF and back then remember
that the Eric Schmidt was part of the of
was part of apples um board of directors
now they got they've got nobody on the
inside so I think that Google is doing
the smart thing that's me i think that
there is a conspiracy theory ok ok you
need to rev it up I'm running out of
coffee yeah he'll Alexandria got
anything else you want to talk about um
now I have a nexus 4 i boasted the two
months ago i think i am very eager for
the nexus 5 because all the phones that
are released in the last month our full
akadi full HD they have nice camera 13
megapixel for megapixel tropics and i'm
really waiting for the nexus 5 because I
i switch Allah switched a lot of phones
I had a ATT 11 x I had the not too many
other phones they're not too I like it a
lot but i didn't i didn't like the
display because it is big enough to see
pixels even in the 7p photography
yeah yes so I i I'm going to debate or
for the nexus 5 or for the not free with
full-hd in a good display and I loved
about the the bed the battery the
battery is this wonderful and not to
because I can use my phone for two days
without worrying to charge the phone
which I cannot say about the nexus 4
because I'm searching all the tweaks to
make more durable the battery but I I I
can I cannot so I'm gonna kind of funny
that oh I'm sorry I find kind of funny
that you say you know you're looking
forward to you know a full HD display
and get in the same breath you mentioned
how much you love battery life so so I
also kind of get a kick out of the fact
that you're you say you just watched
your nexus for two months ago and the
early one x is 5 you are such a smart
phone player you go boy you've gotta buy
smartphones yes i like very much to this
he's like yes I got money yes I got
money no because I here I'm from me
today but I'm Romanian okay and here I
about the phone because we don't we have
contracts but I don't do contracts i
bought the phone then when i bought the
next one i sell the phone put up 50
euros a hundred and i have a new phone
and then I i don't know i don't need to
stick to the contract because it is one
year or two years in one year your phone
is old is already all you have the
android 2.3 or four point and it's not
new so i think it is yea or nay on
that's gonna do it for today and we have
to get up we have to get it come inside
baby I'm my food is actually still here
and it's cold so we have to go yeah and
yes thank you very much for having me is
the first time that
I tried I tried to click that book

don't know we saw you clicking the
button believe me it yeah thank you a
lot and you're the best you're today I
always watch your your videos thank you
