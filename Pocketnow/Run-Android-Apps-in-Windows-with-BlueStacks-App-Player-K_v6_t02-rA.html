would you like to run Android apps on
your desktop or laptop computer without
having to run them through the Android
emulator I would - and that's what
BlueStacks does let's go take a look so
after you download the BlueStacks app
player for Windows and this is in beta
so you're going to have to sign up to be
a beta tester first it's quick it's easy
they send you an email you respond to it
and immediately you've got access once
you can download it which took me a
little while because their site is
getting slammed right now with everyone
trying to get in well then you get to
this part where you set up your account
it asks if you have an Android phone in
this case I do and it asks for my email
address we'll go ahead and type that in
and then my country code end phone
number now why is it asking this you
might want to know well essentially what
it does is it teams your Android powered
smartphone up to this and kind of
synchronizes your your apps between the
two so I'm going to go ahead and put my
phone number in and we'll move on to the
next step so what that's done is it has
send a text message to my phone and it's
given me a hyperlink to go to and
install that app that I already showed
you if I didn't have it already it also
gave me a pin that pin was mirrored up
here on the screen and I just typed that
into my phone and now the two are
synchronized or synchronizing you can
put a checkmark in there and tell it to
sync with the cloud it goes through and
it use my apps for syncing and there we
go there's all of my apps now that means
that I should be able to access them
over here and it is going to download
and install but what that's going to do
is it's going to let me use my apps and
ideally my paid apps as well since this
is still me this is still one of my
authorized machines and all it's going
to do is let me run them over here on my
desktop computer now while those are
synchronizing you can see over here the
icons are kind of bouncing up and down
and I've got this a little rotating
arrow well that means that it's
synchronizing with the BlueStacks App
Player for Windows when it does that
comes down and in your notification tray
down at the bottom of your screen it
shows you what has recently been
installed that we're synchronized so in
this case here's my barcode scanner it's
not going to be much good for me because
I don't have a camera but this is the
same barcode scanner app that I have on
my android powered phone so I've gone
ahead and launched Angry Birds Space
which by the way if you haven't played
this yet it is awesome it's preparing an
app for eat first use and it's asking me
to wait it says that I can press ctrl +
or ctrl - to zoom in and out that's kind
of like your pinch to zoom and whatnot
down here it says it's loading and
that's going to take just a minute and
then I should be able to play Angry
Birds Space the Android version right
here on my Windows powered computer
now you're saying of course you know
there's there's an angry Pig space for
Windows but it costs quite a bit of
money I've already paid for it this is
the HD version of where it should it be
the HD version of Angry Birds space so I
should get really high-def graphics and
let's see if I can do this very good for
you here the pressure is on so very
fluid very smooth very nice I can play
it really really easily see what else I
can do first we got to make sure I get
three stars of course because that's
what this is all about
so yay now it does not synchronize
across my games that's something that's
more specific to Angry Birds than it is
to anything else but it doesn't sync
that down here in the corner you've got
your traditional back button and a menu
button in this case menus not doing
anything for me I've got this home
button in the middle it looks like a
bunch of stacks so we can go ahead and
hit that there's my Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook
app my carrier coverage app clouds and
cheap copilot live USA you know just a
whole bunch of apps that I already have
installed and if I want to find more I
can
more its downloading more that are
coming over here so really kind of cool
and I can run them right here on my
desktop let's see if we've got Gmail
shall we so you can see kind of the
utility here there's my gmail I can
actually use Gmail for Android on my
desktop computer with all of its bells
and whistles and everything that I like
about that and carry that across to all
the different kinds of apps that you'd
expect or want to use on a bigger screen
with a keyboard and mouse you know fast
data entry and whatnot that you can't do
with a tablet or with a phone at least
not very easily so overall very very
cool I'm really impressed with it I'm
going to spend the next few hours here
playing Angry Bird space so why don't
you go ahead and watch a couple more
PocketNow videos for pocket now showing
off BlueStacks App Player I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
