disclaimer at the top that we are still
using a pre-release sample of the V 20
which does not have finished hardware or
software enough people have been asking
about this phone though that we felt a
little showdown was in order even if we
can't discuss some of the more detailed
charts and tests we usually show in a
comparison like this for v10 owners we
can at least try to answer whether the V
20 is enough of an improvement to
warrant a one-year upgrade first for the
spec junkies you can pause the video
here to get a quick rundown on the
differences and improvements moving from
the v10 to the V 20 with that out of the
way starting off with design the V 20 is
a very different animal than the v10 it
replaces gone are the stainless steel
rails and the grippy back LG has moved
to a true all-metal rear heading off any
of the concerns we faced on the g5
thankfully even though this is metal we
still haven't lost the ability to swap
the battery speaking of the g5 there's a
lot more of that phone here than the
previous V the way the forehead and chin
taper or moving the volume rocker to the
side of the phone the v10 was the
ultimate evolution of the g2 and flex
designs the V 20 fixes what we didn't
like about the g5 metal feels nice in
the hand but these phones are all about
getting work done and the v10 is simply
easier to hold on to we don't doubt the
durability of either phone though LG
rates each is milspec 810g drop in shock
resistant and both of these devices have
taken some gnarly accidental drops on
the concrete from about chest height the
V 20s drop scraped a tiny edge near the
front camera while the v10 silicone
edges have aged rather poorly over the
last year and the fun stuff remains -
like the IR blaster to use this phone as
a universal remote and the second ticker
display for notifications and shortcuts
one area where the V 20 walks away with
a handy victory is performance LG did
some amazing work pushing the Qualcomm
808 to its limits on the v10 but the V
20 uses an all-around more powerful and
more efficient chipset even on what we
would consider beta software the V 20
stutters far less frequently when
driving the phone hard with multitasking
situations besting even the curent
powered hallways in
on Disko mark we were initially a little
dismayed by the gaming performance until
we caught this little power saving
feature which was activated
out-of-the-box disabling at the v20
behaves about the same as most welcome
820 power devices this year but we're
finding several of the games we test are
poorly optimized for nougat
we'll have to revisit this for the full
review a couple quick changes to mention
on camera performance most obvious the
v20 packs dual sensors giving you a
standard view and an ultra wide view LG
has moved to a native 4 by 3 aspect
ratio though which will frustrate some
in our audience it's still a 16
megapixel sensor but the native image
will be a bit more square there are some
fantastic improvements to the camera app
focus peaking is incredibly helpful in
keeping your subject tack sharp and the
improved audio controls are also
welcomed providing you a low-cut to
reduce Rumble and background noise in
addition to a limiter to rein in louder
noises from peaking and distorting a few
changes have proven frustrating though
LG's terrific simple mode is no longer
docked in the ticker display arguably
the people who would post benefit from
this mode are the same people who won't
want to have to dig for it in the
settings also we miss having faster
access to resolution and quality
controls where the v10 kept these better
and reach as for the quality of the
output we're tabling that discussion
until we have finished hardware and can
produce a real camera review ditto the
audio we're not in a position to share
graphs but on the whole we can say if
you liked the video like the v20 both of
these phones pack some of the most
sophisticated hardware we've seen for
powering a headphone jack tailoring the
output to the specific headphones you
connect hook up some higher impedance
cans and the amp onboard launches end up
beast mode radically outpacing most
competing high-end smartphones and the
v20 speaker delivers louder and fuller
output it won't compete for quality
against front-facing stereo solutions
but it is a solid improvement over the
dull v10 speaker especially for alerts
and speakerphone situations adding a
section to this comparison LG has done a
terrific job of improving the microphone
quality on the V 20 not only do these
mics handle louder sources before
clipping LG has backed off a little on
the extreme noise reduction processing
which would degrade audio on the v10
most noticeable during video shoots the
voiceover for this entire comparison was
actually recorded using the
on the v20 surprise moving to battery
life again we have to reiterate that
we're working with pre-release hardware
and software but we do see improvements
even if this phone isn't completely
properly optimized for a consumer
release running a media test streaming
30 minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 190
Lux the v10 drains 10% of its battery
the V 20 whittled that back to seven
still not a battery champ but this is a
significant improvement recharge times
are also a little better hitting the
supplied charger for 30 minutes the v10
topped off 35 percent while the V 20 hit
40 but also stayed cooler to the touch a
nice perk is you can recharge a little
faster or just swap a battery when you
need to so let's wrap this up where does
that leave us between the LG v10 and the
LG v 20 the one-year upgrade is always a
tricky recommendation has enough really
changed to consider parting with your
hard-earned cash looking back at the
most common criticisms of the v10 the
underpowered processor in the poor
battery life we're inclined to lean
towards YES on this upgrade while
obviously we're not talking about
radical improvements many manufacturers
were burned last year by poor
performance on Qualcomm chipsets that
alone helps this purchasing decision add
in better microphones a second camera
sensor and a better fingerprint sensor
and you get a little more icing on this
upgrade cupcake though we will miss the
metal and silicone build of the v10 and
how easy it was to hold on to as always

catch you all on the next video
especially for alerts and speakerphone
situations adding a section to this
comparison LG has done a terrific job of
improving the microphone quality on the
v20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
