companies take risks and build their
brands last year Alcatel delivered one
of our favorite budget options for 2016
the idol pushes into mid tier pricing
with the 4s it's a crowded market so
does this phone have the goods to
compete between Moto's and one pluses
now positioning a phone at 350 dollars
is a delicate balancing act
Alcatel has done a commendable job of
maximizing these specs for the price we
get a really pretty 5.5 inch AMOLED
screen with a quad HD resolution its
respectively bright with good outdoor
brightness and under manual control it
hangs right with the galaxy s7 the phone
is powered by a Qualcomm 6 5 2 chipset
with 3 gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
storage and a 3000 milliamp hour battery
with fast charging technology flanking
the front face are a pair of speakers
those grilles are mirrored on the back
of the phone ordering a 16 megapixel
camera and in always-on fingerprint
sensor that sensor is slower than some
of the other options we've played with
around this price but it's functional
and positioned well to prevent dancing
the phone around in your hand even tiny
hobbit hands like mine appreciated
because glass gets slippery
Alcatel maintains the overall look of
last year's Idol which is a good thing
for the most part as we liked that
phone's design graceful tapers rounded
corners and these cool edges around the
speakers though we are happy to see the
camera is more centered on this phone
than the easily blocked corner shooter
on the idol 3 we still have that wonky
button arrangement with the volume
rocker on the right and the power button
on the left
certainly a recipe for finger confusion
while you're getting used to it and I
accidentally took a lot of extra photos
that I didn't need to in the camera app
the headphone jack is on the top of the
phone with a micro USB port on the
bottom both of those ports well offset
from the center of the device new for
this year the back of the phone is made
out of glass raising the bar for a
premium look it feels a little like the
lovechild of an idol 3 in a oneplus X
there's also this new boom key which can
be user assigned to launch specific apps
which for this reviewer is of course
tied to the camera software is also a
balancing act for mid-range unlocked
Alcatel x' interface here is another
what we would call stock plus mostly
what we would find from a clean build of
Android with a few tweaks we appreciate
like a 5th row of icons on your home
screen a quick toggle for auto
brightness in the notification shade or
shortcuts on the lockscreen the 4s
includes support for gestures like
drawing a C on the screen to launch a
phone call these gestures don't clear
the lock screen though so we question
how much more convenient this might be
then using a fingerprint and keeping
shortcuts handy lastly this phone ships
in a VR headset so we get a handful of
apps to show that off alongside a proper
store just for more VR applications this
is not a bloat free phone but there
aren't really any egregious abuses here
for pre-installed software looking at
performance the Qualcomm 652 chipset is
a solid performer a spiritual successor
to last year's Qualcomm 808 found in the
Nexus 5x or LG v10 it's capable but it
tends to run a bit on the warm side the
phone benchmarks well and we encountered
few issues sliding through the user
interface even with only three gigabytes
of RAM multitasking performance is
decent when sliding back and forth
between a handful of services moving
beyond communication in social media the
idol 4s is a respectable gaming machine
implosion ran well on high quality
settings a marvel future fight has
historically been poorly optimized for
Qualcomm chipsets but here we're seeing
performance which bests most of the
Qualcomm 820 powered phones we've
reviewed a happy little perk to see a
mid-range err play this well networking
performance was also impressive testing
around town on ATT the idol 4s regularly
bested the galaxy s7 by 2 to 3 decibels
and this was mirrored in Wi-Fi
connections where the idols seemed to be
able to hold on to our router signal
just a bit better now we did run into
some throttling issues though and they
manifested most readily when using the
camera so talking about the camera we've
got a solid 16 megapixel sensor with an
F 2.0 aperture and we see some nice
evolution here for the camera app
sliding across the screen moves us
between modes with controls on the left
hand side might I add controls which
toggle in place instead of popping out
additional menus making you move the
target to change options
annual mode allows folks to dial in
specific photo settings but these
sliders can be tricky to use in bright
sunlight now photos come out nicely
exposed bright and crisp in daylight
like most phones maybe they're a touch
overexposed but over saturation is more
of a concern warmer colors yellows and
reds can clip detail even in shade now
blues greens and browns look terrific
though low-light photos require patience
and a steady hand there is no optical
image stabilization so landing a crisp
shot at night can be difficult the HDR
mode in daylight is slow and it's even
slower at night
now night mode takes a shorter scan of
the scene but it still requires you to
hold still we also get a handful of fun
modes to play with slow motion video is
over sharpened but delivers a better
than mid-pack output for a 720p image
there's also this FIU's fusee
fuse mode which creates a parallax
effect when scanning around your subject
which works surprisingly well and does
this cool sci-fi scanning thing when
creating the final image unfortunately
panorama stitching is rather poor this
is a challenging scene but the output
still has a significant number of
stitching issues but over saturation and
panorama stitching aren't the real
problems remember how we said the
qualcomm 6:52 ran a bit warm well this
phone has an issue with throttling in
100-degree heat out here in LA powering
a bright quad HD screen shooting UHD
video we were only able to shoot a
couple short video clips before the
phone would start throttling down and
wrecking the videos normally I charge
each phone while driving in between
setups but that kept the battery too hot
so instead I kept it on one of my AC
vents but that didn't give us much extra
time shooting it's a shame as the clips
which weren't throttled were shaky but
otherwise a high quality Ultra HD video
this is only my second experience using
a Qualcomm 650 series chipset and like
the sony xperia x which throttled when
shooting HD video now our second example
throttles even faster on UHD video we're
hoping this can be addressed in a future
update but as such we're holding off on
doing a real camera review Audio gets us
back on track though these speakers are
kill
and deliver a robust sound for games and
videos
headphone audio also delivers the amp
output is about what we would find on a
Galaxy s7 but the quality of the DAC is
just nipping at the heels of phones like
the oneplus 3 looking at the audio
branding waves is a well-known software
developer in the recording world and
you'll find their plugins on many
recording engineers computers here WAV
software forms the backbone of the idols
Mac's
audio setting giving users granular
controls over bass treble reverb stereo
image and including a-10 band EQ these
settings are also tied to usage so you
can have different presets for music
movies and general system sounds or you
can throw it all over to the Auto Select
which will make all of those audio
choices for you taking a quick look at
some audio tests using the auto select
the software is working to augment
certain frequencies of sound similar to
how boom sound might juice up your music
it's not a setting for purists but it
does deliver more colourful playback
last year's Idol carried JBL audio
branding but we're definitely more
impressed with this waves plugin
battery life is also solid this 3000
milliamp hour battery gets us through
the day well enough with some room to
spare by dinnertime now we're changing
up our media test slightly normalizing
for 50% screen brightness on the galaxy
s7 we're now setting all phone's
brightness to match the same Lux output
after 30 minutes of streaming video over
Wi-Fi the idol forest drained about 6%
of its battery solid performance and the
recharge speeds are handy for those who
might need a top-off during the day 30
minutes on the supply charger landed a
53% recharge a bit shy of all katella's
claims but still great recharging speed
lastly it's just fun that Alcatel is
shipping this phone with a VR headset
and that quad HD screen comes in handy
for virtual reality applications this
headset is a high quality solution for
the idle foam runs all the way around
even over the bridge of the nose cutouts
provide access to the headphone and USB
ports and we get buttons unlike some
other headsets we've recently reviewed
adjustable lenses would be nice but
otherwise we think idle owners will
enjoy this hardware so let's wrap this
up where's that leave us with the
Alcatel Idol 4s we love seeing evolution
moving to a higher price point is an
exciting move we really liked the Idol 3
and everything we liked about that phone
is still here plus some great new
features like higher screen resolution
and more premium build materials when
looking at recent releases this phone
lands well against competing options
smack dab in between a moto G 4 plus and
a 1 plus 3 we do have some performance
concerns with how quickly the phone
camera can run hot but otherwise we were
impressed with the offering Alcatel
delivered an ambitious follow-up to last
year's phone which gets almost
everything right and it slots into this
market right where we think it should
fit now consumers just need to check
their budget as solid competition exists
on both sides of this price as always
