for a Galaxy s3 running Windows Phone no
well here's one anyway I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is the
Samsung ativ s neo video review if the
ative s neo seems familiar it's not your
deja vu sitting in it's a variation on
the theme we've seen before
specifically last years at Eve s the
first Windows Phone 8 device to see an
official announcement but one which
never made it to US carrier shelves the
achieve as neo looks to remedy that as
one of two devices bringing third
largest US carrier Sprint back into the
Windows Phone game but is it really
worth your time well let's find out to
justify the jab that kicked off this
video will make clear right now that the
ative s Neos specs are not our sore
point with this phone the Windows Phone
has never been about the spec race and
with few exceptions it's never needed to
be and like most Samsung devices the Neo
goes above and beyond what many windows
phones offer making its 2,000 milliamp
hour battery removable and it's 16 gigs
of onboard memory expandable via microSD
customizations which are sadly
endangered-species these days instead of
the specs what burns us about the
achieve s neo is a combination of its
build and feature set which are nothing
more than mild iterations on what we've
already seen from Samsung back in
January WP central printed a quote from
Sprint saying the company wasn't trying
to launch on six month old hardware with
its return to Windows Phone but with the
exception of the Snapdragon 400 inside
and the substitution of LCD for AMOLED
on the display and a few other details
old hardware is exactly what we're
getting with the achieve as neo some
aspects like the reduced battery size
are actually a step down
if you don't care about the context the
neo is fine the 4.8 inch display is 720p
and looks good though we miss the deeper
blacks of the AMOLED screen on its
international sibling it's a bit heavier
and thicker than other recent Samsung
smartphones which gives it a more
substantial feel in the hand and the
faux chrome and the sides plays nicely
with the very subtle pattern under the
hyper glaze on the battery door
aesthetically this phone would play fine
in a boardroom at a glance it looks like
pretty much any other Samsung smartphone
and there aren't any color options
beyond the royal blue and chrome finish
if you're looking for a windows phone
that will let you blend seamlessly into
your surroundings this is the one for
you things start looking a little better
on the software side where Samsung is
actually just surprisingly gone out of
its way to bolster its custom software
offerings after months lying fallow the
Samsung zone in the Windows Store now
boasts almost twenty custom titles that
doesn't sound like many but for the
company we've often considered the most
a pathetic Windows Phone maker ever it's
a big deal the additions are almost all
camera centric possibly in response to
Nokia's suite of special camera apps in
its own section of the Windows Store
everything from effects lenses to
dedicated video and photo editors and
even a manga camera app are here the
Samsung has also brought tap and share
to the Windows Phone world with a tee
beam a pokey but fun feature which
worked fine for sharing pictures to a
Galaxy Note 2 and a moto X but not to
non Samsung windows phones and the
useful weather and news app Samsung now
is still here which we like but the
company really needs to do something
about that hideously low res live tile a
particularly cool addition here is the
app folder a Samsung app which allows
you to supplement your Start screen live
tiles with folders containing apps
something we've wanted to see for quite
a while it's not for everyone
apps contained inside the folders can't
display live tile information and stock
apps can't be included in folders but
it's still an add-on we found quite
handy
just like on the HTC 8x t our ateva CEO
came out of the box with a bunch of
Sprint bloatware and just like on the 8x
t deleting all of it didn't help much
with software responsiveness something
in Sprint's customizations or some
interaction between Windows Phone and
the new Snapdragon 400 SOC isn't doing
the software any favors the atiba CEO is
less responsive than its predecessor the
atif s and it's less responsive than
most other windows phones on the market
especially when playing music in the
background whether you're streaming it
or it's locally stored it won't be a
showstopper for everyone but it's
definitely annoying especially given
Windows Phones typically buttery
performance elsewhere testing the
achieve sto over more than a week in the
Greater Boston area reminds us that some
things are slow to change Samsung's
voice quality is still just okay with
callers telling us we sounded fine as
long as we were in a quiet room once
background noise came into the picture
though we needed to get far away from it
to continue our conversation the rear
mounted speakerphone is tiny and tinny
compared to what's coming from other
manufacturers these days so speaker
phone calls and media watching are gonna
be once again
ok and listening to music over earphones
is similarly middle-of-the-road an
equalizer called Sound alive is here
which we appreciate but it really
doesn't seem to do much no matter how
much you fiddle with it Sprint's LTE
network in Boston is still less robust
than that of its competitors but it does
deserve an honorable mention for
performing pretty well at a recent Red
Sox game with 30,000 people in the
stands and the phone's battery lasts
quite a bit longer than we were
expecting
given its reduced capacity heavy users
will still want to consider carrying
around an extra pack but moderate use
shouldn't give you any trouble over a
full day camera performance on the Neos
8 megapixel shooter isn't much to get
excited about well-lit photos outdoors
produce nice results but indoor pictures
tend toward the gray zone of washed out
blah thankfully samsung's HDR setting is
there
to help with this and help it does so
long as you remember to take your photos
in the shooting modes app instead of the
standard camera viewfinder
there are also enhanced settings for
contrast saturation and the like as well
as that ridiculous manga camera than
other fun filters so taking the photos
is usually a more enjoyable experience
here than on a stock Windows Phone it
just don't rely on it for night shots
without the flash video mode features
some more compression artifacts than
we're used to seeing and the focus is a
little slow to catch up in some
situations but saturation is good and
audio capture is - it's not a bad
camcorder but it's far from being a
great one
really that's the story on the ative sto
on the whole in broad terms it's almost
comically average in design and
execution that's not a crime but there's
a small legion of Sprint customers
who've been waiting for their carrier to
release a fresh new take on Windows
Phone since 2011 and a warmed-over
helping of last year's design with an
added side of compromise just isn't it
it certainly beats out the 2 year old
HTC arrive and the newer 8 xt but in
both cases that's really not saying much
if you need to be on the now network and
you're interested in a Windows Phone
Sprint's various discounts take this
thing down to 50 bucks on contract
that's a nice price for a fairly capable
device but if you're looking for a truly
outstanding Windows Phone experience
you'll still need to look 2 carriers
other than sprint and manufacturers
other than Samsung we give the Samsung
ativ s neo a 7 out of 10 now folks we do
have some more information on the
achieve s neo if you want to see how it
compares against the HTC 8x T in a bit
more detail we have a comparison video
on that we also have our unboxing from
several days back you can look at that
see what comes in the box and you can
