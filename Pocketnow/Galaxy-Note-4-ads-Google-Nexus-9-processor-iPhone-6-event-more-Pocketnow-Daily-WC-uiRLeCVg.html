iWatch and the iPhone 6 models on
September nine new leads talk about the
processor of the google nexus 9 and
Sampson keeps stepping things up with
ads for the galaxy note 4 i'm high
memory that I in no i will not do the
ice bucket challenge again in the studio
green screens will mess it up this is
pocket now daily as if you didn't know
that the samsung galaxy note 4 will be
announced that Aoife 2014 the company
has decided to step its game up when it
comes to ads for today's official news
we've got as many as four different ads
to remind you why the note lineup is so
important so listen description for all
the ads and tell us what you think are
you getting the galaxy note 4 let's
continue talking about Aoife as it's
happening next week anyways if you were
wondering what will be the name for the
assu SmartWatch that was a tease
yesterday it turns out that it's going
to be called the asuste zen watch as you
know the zen books and everything and i
don't really understand why don't have
any zent bones but yeah the company is
going to be calling this the zen watch
and we are looking forward to this oval
design and hopefully a little bit of a
curve in the display let's see how a
sous plans to compete with so much
Android wear in so little market and yes
more SmartWatch talk as those of you
that are wondering exactly how that LG G
watch 2 is going to be named and why
it's going to be round well we've got
another teaser for LG again for another
Aoife event where this will be unveiled
this is going to be called the LG G
watch our or so we assume and yeah the
company continues to tease the design
and it does look a lot like the Moto 360
but then again how it else can you do a
round SmartWatch it has to be round so
they'll most likely look alike the
design looks interesting we did like the
watch phases on the G watch at least
that so that could be good for the LG G
watch Charlotte see what we get if
you've been wondering how true are the
leaks of the Sony Xperia z3 when it
comes to design don't let us talk
anymore link to the description look at
the full photo gallery of the Xperia z3
and its full glory and some
certification documents they even tear
the phone apart and sadly with that
tearing apart the only thing we were
able to confirm is the three
100 million power battery but then again
the design is what we thought it's got
the stereo speakers the curves on the
sides it looks a lot more refined that
the Xperia z2 even though they're just a
couple of months apart so yeah that is
another Eva 2014 event separately so
stay tuned for that and finally for the
hot news of the day if we could calm
news these are really rumours number one
we've got reports that the iphone 6 will
be launching meaning on your doorstep
between September 16th and the 19th
which is what we expected since the
phone will be announced apparently on
September 9 and historically they
launched 10 days later but even more
interesting we've got some more credible
sources stating that Apple will announce
everything on this event meaning the
iWatch the 5.5 inch iphone 6 will all be
announced at this event and even though
we probably will only get the 4.7 inch
iPhone between September 16 and the 19th
probably it could be that we will be
getting the rest of the products by
December so that leads me to the
question of the day are you getting
either of these three products 4.7 inch
iphone 6 5.5 inch iphone 6 or the iWatch
which are you getting in my case 4.7
inch iphone 6 will most probably be for
me and the iWatch depending on how it is
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think friends you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
before this video was filming you follow
what I'm talking now calm straight tube
channel as well it also follow me on
Twitter hi my underscore a meta please

what you saw I am hi nobody better thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
