with for 2017 the moto z2 force seems to
be one of the more controversial
internally here at pocket now I've spent
my first twenty-four hours with this
slim sexy smartphone and I've got some
early thoughts to share cracking this
thing out of the box it definitely gives
off a startling first impression this
definitely recalls that first hands-on I
had with the original moto Z motor roll
is only releasing one phone this year
there are separate Z and Z force devices
with different focuses for different
audiences as far as Motorola is
concerned the killer feature of the
original Z force wasn't the larger
battery was the shatter resistant
display ultimately I think Motorola is
correct in taking the most impressive
features of those two phones and
cramming them into one device but it
wouldn't be a pocket now video if we
didn't point out that that combination
will come with a few compromises we shot
some unboxing footage just so you can
see what actually comes in the packaging
and I am a little disappointed to see
that there are few moments just like
last year's Moto Z the two force does
not have a headphone jack so we're going
to have to depend on this little dongle
here it seems to be the same audio
hardware as what we had with last year's
phones we're going to be running a real
audio review just to test this out - but
unlike HTC you're not going to get a
pair of earbuds in the box
and compared to last year's phone the
other omission it's kind of bumming me
out more than I think it really should
last year's moto Z came with this faux
wood panel back you could slap on didn't
provide any functionality but it at
least obscured these pogo pins you
didn't have to worry about the sort of
techie er guts of your moto Z being
shown off no I shouldn't be too cranky
there are a lot of deals out there to
get yourself a moto mud in addition to
the phone a lot of these pre-sales and
pre-orders but there was just something
really nice about a simple backplate
covering which you know we've got this
360 camera that we're going to be
cracking into and playing with also and
I just don't see where I've got to take
this piece off right there like get rid
of that but I just don't see where I'm
going to be keeping my phone like this
all the time that's not to say that the
z2 doesn't deliver a cleaner look than
the original Z this brushed metal finish
on the
backplate this definitely looks nicer
from an engineering standpoint it is
impressive when you can hold this one up
against an iPhone and it's significantly
thinner and it feels thinner and it's
not some trick of just bending glass but
I'm not going to play that game is it
too thin it feels good in the hand it
feels sturdy and it's definitely going
to impress when you hand it to someone
else
the Moto setup process is blissfully
easy not a lot of extra stuff to turn
through just one extra permission that
you need to grant Motorola's custom
software on board you're off and running
and it's a very pixel like experience
it's crazy snappy just sliding through
the UI moving through home screens
pulling up the Google now side bar I
mean it populates really quickly and
just buttery smooth and getting you from
page to page obviously before I've
waited it down with all of my various
social media networks and multiple email
accounts let's wrap up a few more of my
concerns though this version of the
plastic screen seems to have a little
bit more of an oil slick like coating on
top all of Motorola's shatter shield
products have had a similar effect but
this is a bit more pronounced than what
I remember from the g-force last year
and I hadn't been using the phone more
than a couple hours before I already
have a little nick in the upper left
hand corner of this top bezel here
that's disappointing I hope it's not
indicative of this screen experience
this is fresh out of the box it's one
day old and I already have that one
little thing that I can't unsee on the
front face in this first day I also
haven't figured this out yet the
separation between the home button and
the on-screen controls I was really
hoping there would be an easy system to
employ like on the Moto G 5 where you
can use the home button as a
multi-purpose button swipe it long press
it double tap it and that would double
as your back
your home and your multitasking keys but
I haven't found a way to activate a
setting like that on this phone and I'm
sure someone's going to school me in the
comments and it's really easy to find
and I just don't know where to look
really early impressions but I'm already
impressed by the dual camera system on
the back of this phone this is already a
noticeable improvement over my
experiences with the first moto Z I'll
be curious to see how it compares
against the original Z force improving
the clarity and contrast of every single
photo you take as opposed to trying to
implement
kind of zoom or wide-angle feature and I
got to say Motorola's camera app has
been nicely simplified and refined very
easy to get to your basic settings the
viewfinder is free from a lot of
distracting clutter and it's super easy
to navigate very well done there I'm
actually really looking forward to
taking this camera out for a spin for
our real camera review over 24 hours
though I am already concerned about the
smaller battery capacity while I was
wrapping up another video this phone sat
unused for almost six hours I was
connected to Wi-Fi just updating a
single email address I hadn't installed
any other apps or logged into any other
services and the phone drained about 10%
of its battery now this is very early
usage as his first day usage but that's
not very confidence inspiring right off
the bat there's a lot to like about this
phone but I'm having a hard time shaking
one of those core questions that I've
had with every idea of the modular phone
and there is something really cool about
that idea for those times that I want to
change the functionality of my phone I
pop off the battery mod I slap on this
camera mod and now I have a different
device I have different capabilities
when there are times I think I might
want a 360 degree camera this takes up
more space when I'm thinking about what
I need to carry in my pockets or what I
can throw on my wife's purse I
absolutely trust that Motorola software
game is on point that they're going to
have some great features to use with
this camera but when I want to carry an
additional accessory with me just have a
hard time not thinking that I could just
pop in something in the USB port that
could achieve very similar functionality
and hopefully also take up just a little
less surface area I have a lot of
questions that I need to answer over the
next week as we produce our full review
on this phone and if there's anything
that you want to know about this device
