pocketnow.com today I would like to show
you how to install the HTC desire rom on
your unlocked nexus one now the HTC
desire is a different phone than the
nexus one they're both made by HTC and
the hardware is almost identical main
differences between the two are the UI
that the phone uses on the nexus one
it's the stock Android UI and on the
desire it's the HTC Sense UI and then
some apps and widgets and whatnot but to
show you how that's done let me go ahead
and start off here first thing we need
to do is reboot the phone into recovery
mode so to do that we're going to hold
down power button I'm running
cyanogenmod on this phone right now so i
have this neat little reboot phone
option going to tap that and it asked me
if I'm sure i want to do that before i
do it's important to note that once i do
this i have to be ready to push the
volume down button on the side of the
phone to get me into that special
recovery boot mode so we're gonna hit ok
wait for it
and right here we're holding in that
volume down button now what we've got
here up at the top of that pink line if
you can see that says that this phone is
unlocked you have to have an unlocked
phone to be able to do this I've got an
article that tells you how to do that
just in case yours is not from here this
is the fastboot we need to use the
volume down button to go down to
recovery press the power button to
select that and now it's going to reboot
there's your little unlocked icon so you
can see that this is an unlocked phone
once you've unlocked your phone that
will always be there so you'll always
know warranty is void it's unlocked but
what that's going to do it's going to
reboot and it's going to come up into
the android system recovery and from
here that's where we can do a whole
bunch of cool stuff first and foremost i
would highly recommend that you back up
using nandroid all of your current
settings that's going to back up to your
SD card and if you don't like the ROM if
something goes wrong anything like that
you can really easily go back to where
you were the last time you did a backup
so I'd recommend doing that I'll shoot a
video on that so you can see how to do
it in the future but today I really want
to show you how to go in and flash
another rom from the SD card so this
menu option says flash zip from sdcard
we're going to select that and I've got
this rom called the next desire v 1.2
remix zip on the root of my ass d card
so i'm just going to scroll down to that
and select it by pressing that button
down here at the bottom it says that
it's going to install 0 go back in here
as i pushed any other button it asked me
if i want to install it and if i do
press the scroll button and if i don't
any other key so if you want to abort
now's your chance to do it I want to
continue so I'm going to push the scroll
button again you get your traditional
unboxing icon and a status to tell you
what's going on down here installing it
from the SD card finding the update
package opening the package
finding the package a whole bunch of
stuff this process is going to take you
probably three to four minutes so I'm
going to cut right here and we'll be
back as soon as that's complete okay a
couple minutes of past and the last item
on this screen it says install from
sdcard complete and it's brought me back
up to my android system recovery menu so
at this point you think we're good we're
done but we're not we've got a couple
other things that we need to do first
and foremost we had another version of
an operating system running on this
before or another rom in this case that
rom had a bunch of custom settings that
aren't going to work with this rom so
the first thing we need to do is go down
here to wipe and we need to wipe data /
factory reset so i'm going to go ahead
and do that right now again press the
trackball to confirm any other key to a
board that's going to format the data
and format the cash i'm going to take a
step further and wipe the dalvik cache
and once that's done we should be good
to go use the volume down button to take
you back to the main menu and then i'm
going to power off and here's a little
trick that I learned phones off at this
point we could reboot and it should boot
just fine into that desire rom but
because I've used apps to SD on that
cyanogenmod and some other stuff I've
got some a swap partition and whatnot
I'm gonna go ahead and take out the SD
card now if you've got an extra SD card
by all means put that in there it'll
make your life a lot easier if you want
to swap between a whole bunch of
different roms great just use a
different SD card not necessary but
it'll probably save you a bunch of
headaches so we're going to go ahead and
continue I'm going to turn this on and
when i do that comes back up to our
stock bootloader icon there now booting
up a custom rom for the very first time
usually is a relatively lengthy process
when you do a cyanogenmod on
a t-mobile g1 for example that initial
boot can take sometimes 8 to 15 minutes
this boot hopefully isn't going to take
that long but I don't want to have you
sit here and stare at this nice little
nexus one logo so we'll be right back as
soon as it's booted up okay you'll know
you've done everything right when you
get this HTC logo on the middle of the
screen and I don't know if you can see
it on the video but there's this nice
little animated reflection going across
the letters here to let you know that
it's still booting it hasn't locked up
if it doesn't have that animation for
five or six minutes you probably want to
reboot something's gone wrong I might
just need to restart and go on with it
but in this case it's still going good
we should probably have another 34
minutes left before it boots up into the
OS I'll show you that as soon as we get
there okay and here you'll notice we
have booted up into the HTC Sense UI go
ahead and grab the walk bar and drag it
down and the first thing that we have is
this really intuitive very very
comprehensive setup wizard it's asking
what country and language I prefer I'm
English us so i'll hit next you'll
notice on the bottom we have a little
status bar indicator that's really nice
you know how far into the process you
are because it does get pretty detailed
even going as far as having you run
through a tutorial on how to use the new
HTC keyboard which we're all used to if
if you've been running cyanogenmod roms
and whatnot in the past well skip that
for now asks me how I want to connect
mobile network or Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi only I
want to be able to do both so I'm going
to hit next it asks me if I want to
connect to the Wi-Fi network right now
I'm going to uncheck that just for the
sake of time and hit next how much
location information do I want to send
to google and there's my check mark that
lets me share some of that information
with them next at this point I can set
up my google account
microsoft exchange or another mail
account you can always go in and do this
later again in the interest of time
we're just going to skip that this is
really where it gets fun with the HTC
Sense UI that comes included with the
HTC Desire and included in this rom by
extension we've got the ability to link
our Facebook Flickr and Twitter accounts
to various parts of the OS specifically
in the sense UI in the widgets and in
some of the apps that that come included
with the ROM really need I'm not going
to bore you with setting those up but
it's simple as supplying your
credentials for each one and logging in
skip that for now something I haven't
seen on any other roms is the ability to
backup your data and settings to your SD
card that's fabulous you can see up here
I don't have an SD card in the phone so
I'm going to uncheck that just because
this is a demo if this were your
production phone I'd leave that checked
and take advantage of that because
backing up is a very good thing to do
we'll say okay and then we're left at
this tutorial screen where you can learn
more about various different components
on the phone we'll go ahead and finish
up and presented with the loading
indicator which takes all those
configurations that we just built in
that setup wizard and it configures our
home screen for the first run really
kind of nice something else that's neat
is this little indicator this little
help pop-up if you will that tells you a
neat feature about this particular
version of the sense UI now most android
phones you know you can scroll side to
side and you have anywhere from three to
five home screens this one has seven you
can see this little bar indicator shows
you which of those screens you're on
which is really nice you can tell at a
glance which screen you're on and know
which way you need to go to get to a
screen but like that little pop-up
window told you there's something
interesting with this with this rom with
this sense UI you can pinch to zoom and
it shows you
in a very animated very easy very clean
way all the screens that you have open
along with miniaturized versions of
what's on each one of those screens you
can easily jump to one of them just like
that jump back and forth really fast if
you don't like the pinch to zoom if your
phone doesn't let you do that for
whatever reason you can also hit the
home button down here on the bottom and
it will take you to that same view back
and forth so really neat a couple other
things to note about this version of the
ROM the app drawer down here isn't the
traditional just drawer icon when you
tap it and it opens your app drawer up
you've got this little drawer icon off
to the side first thing you'll notice is
this is just a stock drawer it doesn't
do anything fancy which is just fine on
the nexus one we've become accustomed to
what some people called the Star Wars
drawer which has a few rows of icons in
the top and as you scroll some of them
fade off the top and come in from the
bottom really cool really animated just
one of those bells and whistles that
really polishes the OS but it takes a
little bit more processing power this
doesn't have that but it does have
something else interesting if you tap
the menu icon from here you can display
all of those programs in a list if you
like lists better than grids you can go
back in here and change it back to grid
because that's how I prefer it and there
you go the center button has been
changed from the app drawer button that
I just showed you over to phone very
simply phone is a phone this device is
first and foremost a phone so it kind of
makes sense that you'd have that as your
main button kind of hard to get used to
for me but if you're coming into the
sense UI rather than coming in from a
stock Android perspective like I am not
hard to get used to it all in fact it
feels right still a little awkward i
find myself tapping the phone button to
open my app drawer but i'll get used to
that over time last on this customized
bottom part of the screen is this little
plus item this
lets you add stuff to your home screen
widgets program shortcuts folders we've
talked about those in some videos and
some articles in the past one thing to
note is these widgets you'll notice that
under each one of the widget names is a
sub name this one says android android
HTC HTC android HTC the HTC widgets are
widgets that are specific to HTC Sense
UI so you get a whole bunch more widgets
on believe they're about 40 in all
somebody correct me on that but there
are a whole bunch of widgets that come
pre-installed pre-configured ready to go
just for you to drop on all you've got
to do is come in and tap which one you
want to add to the screen and you're
good to go on lots of different faces to
the widgets really really nice what you
can do with them if she likes the stock
Android interface you're probably not
going to like sense UI it's taken quite
a bit of time for me to get used to it
but it's something that I wouldn't mind
having on a phone for me i'll stick with
cyanogenmod rom just because it's so
clean it so fast and i am so used to it
and i just love the clean pure Android
UI but if you like sense especially if
you're a Windows Mobile defector and
you've had some of the HTC screens and
apps on your phone there are similar
versions of sense UI on Windows Mobile
you might come over to this and really
enjoy what HTC is done with their sense
UI for the Android so looking at how to
install the HTC Sense UI via the HTC
desire rom on to your google nexus one
