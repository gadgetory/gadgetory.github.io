Paco calm and today wish you a pretty
neat little application called look out
for your windows mobile device and what
this allows you to do is to have both
antivirus and firewall protection as
well as you can backup your data and you
can also find your missing phone so

thing you'll need to do is actually

mylookout.com website or you can
actually do it from your windows mobile
device so if i go and here on antivirus
and firewall i can run a virus scan if i
want or i can get more so we can go
there and no security events so we'll go
done i can go to data backup so if i
want to deck back up my data again i can
do that of course it was just done seven
hours ago and it you can go to my
lookout calm and to your user
information and password and get all of
your data back onto your device and if
any time you are missing your device or
it was unfortunately stolen you can
either make it really really loud and
set off alarm or you can delete all the
data from your device so we'll go into
the menu here and into some of the
settings we can go into antivirus
settings if you want so it can enable or
disable set when we want the scan to
occur we'll hit cancel and go menu down
here to firewall settings we can enable
or disable cellular or Wi-Fi cancel
again go down to menu backup settings we
can enable or disable we can also go to
choose which settings we want to back up
here we have everything set up right now
so we'll click cancel go menu and
connection settings so you can either
use Wi-Fi or cellular or just Wi-Fi if
