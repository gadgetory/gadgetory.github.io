every other gadget we might want to
carry destroying not only the
point-and-shoot camera market but also
the dedicated music player market but
just because phones have speakers and
the ability to use headphones doesn't
mean all smartphones are created equal
we're 2016 was an amazing year for
camera hardware audio wasn't as well
supported for manufacturers we'd
normally turn to for high-quality
solutions no cop-outs here these are the
top 5 audio performers of 2016 ranked by
our personal listening experiences and
the benchmarks we rent each phone
through while producing our reviews so
let's get to it
number 5 the 1 + 3 T the bottom firing
speaker on the 1 + 3 T is about as good
as any company can make but where this
phone shines is when you plug in some
headphones one of the better performers
of the year for amp output quality and
it has a fantastically low noise floor
the 3 T impresses even more when you see
that sub $500 price the only drawback
and one we didn't face on the regular 1
+ 3 released earlier this year is the
inability to disable EQ tweaks and
tricks hopefully that will be addressed
in a software update as otherwise this
is a terrific audio option number for
the iPhone 7 and 7 plus we're be
grudgingly putting the iPhone on this
list at number four the industry is
walking away from the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and we're sad to see a
proper standard die in favor of
proprietary solutions which will migrate
additional costs to consumers who value
high-quality audio still for having to
plug in this flimsy adapter the iPhone 7
delivers better playback than most of
the phones released this year add stereo
speakers to the mix and Apple delivers a
formidable player we can't help but
express some frustration though that
this adapter situation produces ever so
slightly lower quality output than the
iPhone se or the iPhone 6s if you don't
need the stereo speakers you might be
better served with Apple's older gear
otherwise maybe look to invest in a
couple extra spare headphone adapters
because these things they probably won't
last
very long number three the HTC ten HTC
used to rule the roost for all things
audio boomsound is still a remarkable
competitor and the HTC ten sets a high
bar for both speaker output and
headphone quality this year brought a
controversial move though straying from
traditional stereo speakers the 10
delivers mono output where higher
frequencies are produced by the earpiece
and lower frequencies from the bottom
speaker it's a better solution than most
other phones if it might not quite
satisfy fans of more traditional left
and right channels this headphone jack
is also top-tier with fantastic
signal-to-noise ratios it loses out to
the next two options on our list for amp
power but you really can't go wrong with
this phone until you start using higher
impedance headphones we're hoping this
isn't the end of HTC's audio prowess the
bolt left us underwhelmed and honestly
frustrated with its USB type-c headphone
solution this year the audiophile HTC
fan is much better served by the ten
number two the LG v 20 the V 20 is a
multimedia and content creation monster
it gets an honorable mention in the
audio discussion for including the best
microphones and audio capture tools
available on any phone released this
year it loses the top spot for its mono
bottom firing speaker magnificently
improved over the LG v10 we'd still
appreciate LG moving it to point at our
face if not providing some kind of
stereo solution in the future this phone
however is the undisputed headphone
champ no other device can top it for
high quality output properly supporting
ridiculously high bitrate audio files
crazy low noise floor and excellent
signal-to-noise ratio this is also the
most sophisticated phone for controlling
amp output the V 20 will tailor playback
based on the device it's connected to
plug in some higher impedance scans and
this phone launches into beast mode
using more consumer grade options the
phone dials back that power to prevent
damaging your headphones or from messing
up your hearing if you want the absolute
best for headphone audio look no further
the V 20 is the champ and that brings us
to number one the Z
te exon seven so what if you could get
really close to the headphone output of
the v20 for less than half the price
well the axe on seven might be the right
fit for you the major drawbacks ZTE
lacks support for true 24-bit output and
it suffers a narrower dynamic range
otherwise the axe on seven trades blows
well against the v20 nearly matching
noise floor and producing less stereo
crosstalk best of all we've got maybe
the loudest amp on board of any of the
phones reviewed this year and the axon
should do a terrific job driving most
headphones even more expensive fare it's
not as sophisticated as the LG but it
gets the job done better than any other
manufacturer add some solid stereo
speakers to the mix and what we have
here is the spiritual successor to
phones like the HTC One m8 and m9 an
absolutely fantastic all-rounder for
just about any audio situation you might
throw at it that would be exciting
enough from any regular flagship phone
but when you consider the recent price
cut putting the ax on seven well under
$400 it's an absolutely shocking bang
for buck put in dollars to doughnuts the
axe on seven easily earns our top spot
for 2016 audio this year faced more
compromises than other flashy er
features a companies like Sony and
Samsung delivering options to North
America which performed worse than the
phones they released in 2015 the pixel
proving to be something of a
disappointment though manufactured by
HTC lacking any of HTC's audio expertise
and for the mid-range er manufacturers
if there were any areas to save on
production costs it was off in the audio
if we lose 3.5 millimeter headphone
jacks we hope to see better support for
a standard in USB type-c accessories a
current solutions haven't been very
encouraging until then for the audio
files in our audience these phones are
the best of the best for 2016 and of
course we want to hear from you did your
phone make the list are you rockin
cabled headphones or moving to a
wireless solution for convenience drop
