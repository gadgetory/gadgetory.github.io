public the ios jailbreak seems just
around the corner and legacy Samsung
devices are listed for jellybean I'm hi
melody vana and we're giving tommy
hilfiger a break this week and we're
going to be using nautica this is
parking out daily if you were wondering
if m7 is the code name of HTC's next
flagship or it's really the name well
Peter Chou just came on a YouTube video
screaming m7 like 10 times in the HTC
New Year's party so it could be that the
name is m7 but aside from that he also
came on a public TV channel in Taiwan
demoing the m7 to the public so it's
clear this is the device that's coming
and he left everybody drooling because
the device was in white so I want it now
let us see what happens on the event on
februari 19 and speaking of HTC new
leaks have the company working on an m4
and ag2 codename devices the m4 seems to
be a good device with a 720p display and
the usual suspects when it comes to
specifications now in the case of the g2
sadly it's a very bad tier not met
tiered bad to your device with an h vga
resolution display but we'll see what
happens probably februari 19th again and
now the spotlight moves over to samsung
if they just confirm their plans for
android 4.1 jelly bean on their legacy
devices the Galaxy Note the Galaxy Tab
8.9 and 7 are included and the list is
actually quite big so make sure you hit
the links in the description for the
full list no specific dates are provided
for every device but we do know that the
Galaxy Note is receiving the update on
march first so stay tuned and speaking
of Samson we have a new tablet being
leaked this time codenamed GTP 3200 but
it's hard to tell if this is the Galaxy
Note 8 or the galaxy tab 3 that's been
being talked about it probably will be
released than mwc that we don't have an
unpacked event being planned for mwc so
it's kind of hard to tell we'll keep you
posted obviously mwc is gonna be the
show floor and finally for the okay news
of the day well the jailbreak community
has just confirmed that their new
jailbreak called evasion is seventy
percent ready for iOS 6 what's
interesting here is that it's not the by
specific apparently any device running
iOS 6 will be allowed to use this
jailbreak in order to get the goods but
well the problem is they
confirmed any specific dates just
seventy percent some people were
assuming that it would happen on
februari third but I don't think that's
going to happen that way but that leads
you to the question of the day do you
still jailbreak your devices or are you
still actually waiting for that to
happen in my particular case I actually
got bored of jail breaks and after iOS 5
i'm pretty much just forgot about it but
leave us a comment down below is
jailbreaking still something you're
looking for and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
this one phone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on pocket now that
can also subscribe to our youtube
channel as well please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi Mary better thanks for watching see
you next Monday
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
