pocketnow.com
and in this video we're going to take a
look at all of the settings that you can
adjust on the HTC hd2 let's start off
with the settings that HTC lets you
change then we'll drill into the
standard windows mobile settings so
sliding all the way to the right we have
the settings tab so let's go through
this we're going to start with
personalize and personalize we can
adjust the Home tab wallpaper to either
a weather wallpaper or an animated
wallpaper and of course
tapping on either will give you your
gallery you can go into the album's and
pick a picture from there we can also
change the lockscreen wallpaper this
will also affect the wallpaper that
occurs or shows when you go to the Start
menu so for example this is the same
wallpaper as the lockscreen wallpaper so
you can change that you can also change
the homescreen tabs and uncheck certain
ones that you don't want and of course
rearrange them by tapping and dragging
like so although you've been able to do
this in previous versions of touchflo 3d
now they call it HTC Sense but a click
cancel we can change the font size to a
larger or smaller size depending on how
good your eyes are I like to have it as
small as possible so that I fit as much
screen as much data on the screen as
possible at one time let's go back and
then we can change the vibration
feedback so this will turn on vibration
the haptic feedback when you're typing
on the keyboard or when you're tapping
these buttons along the bottom that use
up a little bit of battery life when
you're using that vibration feature so I
leave it off just to save a little bit
on battery life let's go back and go to
the next thing in wireless controls we
just have the standard communications
manager although this is new down here
Wi-Fi router we've covered this in a
previous video if you have this running
over a 3G connection you can actually
turn it into a wireless hotspot so
imagine you have your device and you're
in a car and you're getting 3G coverage
well you can beam out a Wi-Fi signal as
if you had a Wi-Fi router from your 3G
connection it's a really awesome program
that has a lot of use it has the same
functionality as the MiFi that you may
find on Verizon or Sprint so let's go
back sound and display
so here we can change the profile of the
phone to normal vibrate silent or
automatic we can change the ringer
volume the system volume change the
ringer to perhaps another sound and
you'll get a little preview of course
that's the default go back down we can
change the ringer type so that we can
have it vibrate then ring vibrate and
ring and so on and so forth we can
change the notification sounds for oops
let me go back for a new message or a
new voicemail or a missed call and
tapping on that will bring up whether
you want it to vibrate you can also
change the actual sound for that
particular alert we're staying in this
nice HTC interface for all of these
settings which is a really great
experience let's go back down further we
can have quite ring on pickup which is
pretty cool when the phone rings and you
pick up the device it will sense the
movement and quiet the ringer which
makes a lot of sense right after the
phone rings you know that someone's
calling you you don't need the ringer to
be so loud to annoy people and down
here's pocket mode which is pretty cool
the device will sense if it's in your
pocket or in a bag and it will turn up
the volume on the ringer that can be
very useful here we can change the
backlight brightness although it's good
to have it on automatic adjustments so
that it optimizes it based on ambient
light conditions and if you uncheck that
these will illuminate but I leave it on
there and we have other settings on how
the backlight should behave under
various power conditions so let's go
back and we've one more here calibrate
the G sensor this doesn't need
calibration too often so I'm not going
to go into that and let's go to data
services and this is where you do all
the syncing things so how often the
stock sync and you can tap on that and
change how often it syncs we can change
how often weather syncs and also how
often active sync will reach out and
grab your contacts and your email and
your calendar and so on and so forth
you can also specify here your username
and password for Facebook Twitter and
YouTube and also your gmail account if
you have that setup on your device so
that is data services location checking
this box will tell your device that it's
ok to reach out and find your location
and it's good to keep
that on going down a little bit more
we've security and here an encryption
you can choose to encrypt files when
placed on a storage card although we're
dumped back into the ugly windows mobile
interface here as you can see we can
manage certificates we can require a
password to wake the phone which again
will dump you back into the ugly windows
mobile interface and we can factory
reset if you want to bring this all back
to factory condition and erase all of
your data let's continue down the chain
here we go to applications and we can
remove programs although again this is
Windows Mobile interface it's not the
HTC in our base and we can go to manage
programs with which is used in kind of
corporate environments down a little bit
more we've SD card and phone storage so
this will show you really how much
storage you have left if you're using a
micro SD card or how much storage is
left on your device date and time we can
adjust to have 24 hour time format where
we can adjust the particular local time
settings down one more is locale and
text and this is where we can change the
regional settings weather here what
language you speak how you want the date
format to be and this is spruced up from
the standard Windows Mobile interface
which is nice we can also change the
text input settings so if you want the
xt9
to suggest a word or do a spell check
you can check those off here and down
here you can relaunch that tutorial that
you saw in the beginning and I don't
know if there's an easy way to get out
of this looks like there is perfect
let's go back and updates book went to
the wrong well here we are in other and
these are some settings for specific
programs so we can go into task manager
and this will show you all the programs
running unfortunately the hd2 doesn't
come with HTC's task manager that allows
you to specify that the X button closes
the program rather than keeps it in
hibernation so I've got a ton of
programs running right now but because
this device is so much RAM it really
doesn't matter I could run three times
four times as many programs and still be
running smoothly and we can change the
settings for Microsoft my phone for USB
to PC what happens when you plug it into
your computer and so on and so forth and
let's
go back to update and feedback I like to
keep error report turned off just to
save a little bit of resources and we
also have customer feedback send
feedback to Microsoft and finally on the
bottom about the phone you can see kind
of what's inside of your phone
what sort of resolution that has how
much memory it has and see the speed of
the processor is an insane 1024
megahertz that is why the device seems
so fast
even though I'm running lots of programs
right now so let's go into the full
settings of Windows Mobile the stuff
that you've seen for generations now of
devices so we're gonna go into menu and
off settings and so here we have the
standard windows mobile 6.5 screen we
can go into the today's screen and sort
of change the appearance we can change
what is on the Today screen I want to
get out of that we can also go into
personal and click on buttons but you
can't do anything in here you can't
change the button assignments down here
so it's kind of worthless to go into
that screen also in personal is the
default Windows Mobile stuff phone
settings and input settings so let's go
back and we'll go into system and we see
some usual stuff here we can clear
storage encryption sort of stuff that
we've already seen in the HTC settings
but there are some things in here that
you don't get such as the standard old
Windows Mobile memory screen so even
with all of those programs running we
store 176 megabytes of free RAM left a
lot of the devices start off at about
120 and go down into about 60 or 70
megabytes from there when you run this
many programs but the hd2 just has so
much RAM that it's really terrific I'm
going down a little bit more we have the
usual stuff we have screen and this is
funny you can actually align the screen
even though it has a capacitive display
and it works just like it works in
Windows Mobile with a resistive display
you just move the cursor around on the
screen although I'm not sure why a
capacitive screen would go out of
alignment I guess I guess it can we can
enable ClearType strangely by default
this device doesn't have ClearType
enabled but what it does is it smooths
out screen fonts a little bit which I
think makes it look a little nicer and
then we
have some redundancy here this is the
text size setting that we saw previously
so nothing else of nothing else terribly
interesting in here we've Clark it mode
which you can check off to have the Navi
panel launched when you connect the
optional accessory and we'll cover that
in future videos and I've got this
connected to my bluetooth in my car so
it has that listed there and let's go
back and finally end up in connections
again very usual stuff here that we've
seen in Windows Mobile devices before
connections set up so that you can have
it set up your settings for whatever
carrier you have communication manager
Wi-Fi settings account so that was a
quick look at the settings on the HTC
hd2 it's great that HTC is so fully
deeply integrated the whole HTC Sense
interface even into most of the settings
there are still some areas where you're
dumped back into the sort of ugly
windows mobile interface but for the
most part you can get most things done
through the screen and it's a really
good experience to sort of mess around
with the settings and tweak and change
things that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
