leaked in photos Twitter's no music
service goes live for iOS devices and
Nokia sells more phones except not in
the United States I'm heyman Rivera and
what's cool about my country is that
Thursday's are considered little fridays
this is pocketnow daily let's start
today talking about verizon the company
is just an hour presentation for an
event to happen at ctia on May 22nd but
sadly that's all we got just the present
bite no details on what to expect now
given the fact that we've got some
leaked photos of the Nokia Lumia 928 you
know where things are going and speaking
of Nokia the company has just posted
their results for the quarter and even
though they sold more phones worldwide
they sadly so less phones in the United
States compared to last year their phone
numbers were decent but this time they
sold thirty-three percent phones less
than last year and that was at the time
when the Nokia Lumia 920 wasn't even
launched so just think about this Nokia
there is Android you know there's this
operating system that's really hot you
should probably benefit from it and for
those of you that we're keeping up with
a pantech vega ayran rumors the company
has just announced a smartphone
officially and while the leaks are
partially true on one hand we do get a
device with a sort of a no vessel
meaning you do get a bezel but it's kind
of small which is kind of interesting
but then again it's not a revolutionary
phone this is 720p display device so
there's nothing hot about this phone
it's being released in Asia right now
and then you can get it probably in the
United States later they didn't specify
dates or anything twitter is also made
the mobile news today as they've
launched their own music application
though this is more of a music discovery
thing and it's only for iOS users right
now the way this works again music
discovery you'll be listening to the
songs that your friends are listening to
or your celebrities that you follow but
you're not really getting any music
you'll be directed to Spotify Rdio or in
this case iTunes if you don't own either
of these accounts now interesting enough
it's not available for Android and it
just makes you wonder if Twitter really
knows where their base users are and
still if you want a full walkthrough of
the application make sure you hit the
links in the description and finally for
the interesting news of the day we've
got some leaked photographs of the cheap
plastic iPhone
to probably be released later this year
and yes it is plastic at first we
thought it was the iphone 3gs but then
if you noticed this device is actually
less chubbier than the old iphone 3gs
was so it's really interesting to see
that Apple is actually considering
building a cheaper iPhone but we do know
that the company place with prototypes
all the time so that leads me to the
question of the day do you believe that
these photos are real or fake do you
think that Apple is really working on a
cheaper iPhone in my case I've been
proven wrong before with Apple leaks I
thought that the iphone 5 was a fake
photo but anyways I do believe that this
is probably real even though I don't
know which market they're gonna cater to
so leave us a comment down below what do
you think of course for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's a little mushy follow us
