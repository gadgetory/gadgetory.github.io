pocketnow.com and this was the hardware
and software tour of the ACE RB touch e
two hundred this is a windows mobile 6.5
slider device it's relatively
inexpensive - it cost about three
hundred and fifty dollars over at clove
which is pretty cheap for a device that
is unlocked in that does 3G although not
in the US here in Europe you'll get 3G
HSDPA HSUPA but in the US you will only
get edge so let's take a look at the B
touch e two hundred the screen is three
inches diagonal and the resolution is
four hundred down and 240 across so that
would be WQ VGA a lot of newer devices
have much higher resolution screens than
this but of course this is a budget
device so that's what you get up here we
have the speaker down here's the Acer
logo with a traditional d-pad and in the
center if you press the button inward it
will select you have call and and call
start what's the missing down here and
what is really unfortunate is that it
doesn't have a button for ok or closed
which is very important in Windows
Mobile or a start menu button so a lot
of the time you have to reach up with
your thumb to close a program or to hit
the Start menu whereas a lot of other
windows mobile devices say like the
touch pro you know have the Start menu
button and the OK button built right
into the bottom of the phone so that's a
little bit of an annoyance if we slide
down the phone
we're actually slide it up we get the t9
style numeric pad so if you are good at
t9 then this will be familiar terra-tory
to you but if you like a hardware
keyboard that you're gonna have to get
used to this or you can use the
on-screen keyboard which is better than
the default windows mobile keyboard but
not too great it's got a nice brushed
metal coating and as you saw before it
actually is it's actually backlit so the
numbers light up when the conditions get
dark it's not doing it right now
and this is actually a functional slider
which is pretty cool so if somebody
calls and you want to answer the call
slide it open to answer slide it down to
hang up so it's always nice to see a
functional slider there let's go around
the side of the device here we have a
standby button and also you can take the
phone out of standby by opening the
slider as you just saw we also have a
volume up and down rocker
then we have mini USB for syncing
charging and for audio this does not
have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
unfortunately it's not really made to be
a multimedia device with you know a
small screen like this on the bottom we
have the microphone over here we have
the dual action camera button so it has
autofocus but no flash although it does
have 3.2 megapixels here's the stylist
this is a resistive touchscreen so you
have this kind of cheap collapsible
stylus that you can take out from the
side the sides are adorned in this
silver and the front is kind of black
with the brushed metal the back has that
nice rubbery coating that makes it feel
secure in hand
that said in hand feel while it's secure
is kind of low quality acer's build
quality is notoriously low and we can
pop off the back battery cover by going
over here back here we have the we have
the battery with the SIM card and the
micro SD card slot which is right here
unfortunately you have to take out the
battery to access that then down here
you can see the speaker and up here is
of course the camera so let's put this
back on and we're going to talk about
the software on this device okay so here
we are with the Acer B touch e two
hundred turned on and what you'll notice
right off the bat is the home screen
comes right from the Acer neo touch
which is actually the Snapdragon running
Windows mobile device that we actually
reviewed very highly because it was one
of the fastest devices we've ever tested
unfortunately the bead touch 200 is not
nearly as fast so this is really just a
simple program launcher so we can hit
the little gear down here and we can add
new programs and we can flick through
I'm just using a stylus because it's
easier to use while filming although it
does have good finger friendly operation
the screen is relatively sensitive not
nearly as sensitive as we found on say
the HTC Touch pro2 for example so we can
add say file explorer and check off
there so very simple no frills home
screen which is good and bad there's no
eye candy but then again there's really
no there's no really extended
functionality here you can hit you can
open the Start menu by tapping down here
and it's nice that they added that
because otherwise you'd have to reach up
to the top all the time and when you're
in a program
you do have to reach up to the top all
the time to open the Start menu so
you're using it here with your thumb
d-pad d-pad you have to reach up and you
get the idea from there so tapping this
stepping this button on the Left will
unlock or will lock the device and it
takes a moment to go into the lock
screen and here we are standard windows
mobile 6.5 lock screen then slide to the
right the upper right corner we have a
quick link to the built-in task manager
so it's not an Acer Skin task manager
but it's nice that they put it over
there
this device says 256 megabytes of RAM
which is pretty good for a budget device
let's go to the Start menu and flick
around and see what we have here so we
have all the standard stuff internet
explorer mobile you're probably going to
want to install opera mobile 9.5 or
Skyfire to get a better browsing
experience so let's take a look at
social networking and we saw this on the
other a sir device you can see it tends
to be a little bit slow and as a 520
megahertz processor so from here we can
launch the built-in Facebook application
which is standard to Windows Mobile now
and a lot of these other things will
take you right to the website so if we
go to YouTube
it's going to open up a little YouTube
application actually that Acer built and
we're going to click on the region here
and we're not going to cover the YouTube
application but it basically is a mobile
skinned version of the website so it's a
little bit more easily digestible in
such a small screen so I'm gonna exit
from here and we're gonna exit from here
and we'll go back from the start menu
see what else is in here
so we have standard stuff like agenda
which is the obviously the built-in
calendar which has been skinned a little
bit and again we saw this in the other
Acer device the Neo touch it's a little
nicer way to view your your your
different appointments so we can tap on
a certain day and then we can click on
today to get right to today and we can
go to the next month or the previous
month and so you get the point here's
sort of the agenda view so nicer way to
view your calendar than what is built
into Windows Mobile standard so here we
have marketplace and entry for
multimedia streaming media player
obviously so you can watch mobile
YouTube and over here album which is
just a slightly more glorified photo
album than once you get on the default
Windows Mobile you can slope swipe to
the right swipe to the left obviously no
multi-touch so you can't pinch to zoom
or anything like that and here's where
the lack of ok button kind of becomes a
problem because you can't press an OK
button to quickly get out you have to
tap on the screen you have to find the
back button and then you proceed from
there
okay let's scroll down further see what
else we have here Communications Manager
really standard stuff this one's also a
little bit different preferences so here
we can go into connections and see the
sort of Acer skinned connection manager
which is a little bit nicer we can go
into phone to determine certain things
about the phone these are just taken
from the standard Windows Mobile
settings just made to look a little bit
nicer for the Acer be touch e200 let's
go down a little bit and let's go into
the on-screen keyboard so you can get a
sense for how that looks and how it
feels on a device like this okay so
let's test the on-screen keyboard I'm
just gonna tap here to bring it up and
it's kind of small because obviously
this is a three inch screen the
unscreened keyboard itself on these Acer
devices is quite good but that really
doesn't solve the problem of how
such a small screen and if we go into
landscape nothing is going to happen so
let's try this is a test so that didn't
work out too well let me try again
this time I'll type something else and
try to be a little bit more precise I'll
say today is Monday so slightly better
results there not too much better let's
actually use the t9 pad sort of as it
was intended I don't use t9 too much but
I did back in the day and so let's see
how it works so I'm gonna say today is
Monday today is I'm not looking at the
screen Monday see how it did today's
today okay that didn't make sense let me
do one more thing I'm going to do this
is a test let's see if it works
the t9 pad has generally good feel it
doesn't feel mushy or anything it has a
nice bit of feedback so if you are good
at t9 you probably won't have a problem
entering text into the ACR B touch e two
hundred but if you're not a fan of you
know this sort of keyboard then you may
want to stay away from this device so
that was just a look at the keyboard and
finally a few notes on performance
battery life and call quality so in
terms of performance as you saw jumping
from screen to screen the be touchy 200
is kind of laggy there is a delay when
you go to open certain things like here
we're trying to open up Internet
Explorer and the screen loads 3 for
about 3 or 4 seconds whereas a lot of
newer windows mobile hardware is just
instant especially with that Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor in terms of battery
life you'll get through about a day and
a half using the B touch you 200 with
moderate use with heavy use you'll get
through the whole day and with light use
you'll probably get two or three days of
use out of this device in terms of call
quality I found call quality to be quite
good the speakerphone did this stored at
high volumes but that's really a problem
that we see with a lot of phones these
days it seems so overall the Easter beat
touch e two hundred is undoubtedly a
budget device if you're looking for
something that's very basic that will
make calls that can do email and that
does it with a nice slider design then
you'll be happy with the the beat
200 that said if you want something
that's fast if you want something that's
flashy with really good build quality
perhaps you want to look elsewhere but
if you do want one they're shipping over
at Clover co uk like i said for about
three hundred and fifty dollars
unlocked that is it for now for the acer
be touch e two hundred</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
