pocketnow.com
and this is the video portion of the
review for the logitech quickcam pro for
notebooks you may be wondering why it's
so dark in this room and the answer is
because there's no lights on in this
room the only light is coming from the
screen of the notebook that this quick
cam is attached to I'm actually filming
this with the quick cam itself what's
amazing about this is the right light
technology that Logitech has
incorporated into this you can tell that
maybe the frames per second artists
great because there's a little bit of
blurring motion here but that's just
because it's adjusting for the very low
light level that's in this room I'll
show you what it how well it performs
when we turn on the light now I'm in
Arizona so I'm just going to open up
this bright window that we have over in
there it gets more light going on in
this room now we have an imbalance of
light we have contrast on this between
the two sides and it still manages to
get a good picture one of the key things
that doing a vidcast is that you have
equal lighting so you don't have too
many shadows on your face so this is
pretty equal it's really just one light
bulb over here and a window over here
except it looks like I'm actually in a
studio let me step it up a notch and
show you what it looks like when we have
light behind us if you're on the move
you have very many options about where
you're gonna do your little webcam
session so you've seen how many
different ways we can actually look with
the different lights that we have going
on here now one of the bonuses of the
software features that come with the
logitech quickcam pro 4 notebooks is the
ability to have face accessories you
might be wondering well what is that
well this is one of my favorite ones
it's I'm a pirate now so just turn that
on it tracks your face so it's able to
put an SS free on there and there's all
kind
things that you can do can be a cowboy
it can be tired you could be John Lennon
you can go take a siesta somewhere go
rob a bank if you want except be kind of
hard through the internet if you want to
be a Chinese dragon there's a whole
number of things that you can do with
this it's really interesting it can be
completely goof you fill in to another
one this one's a little bit CPU
intensive Logitech suggests for XP users
that you have 2.4 gigahertz with 512
megabytes of RAM I suggest that this
laptop right now is 2.4 gigahertz XP
with 512 megabytes of RAM so we have the
option of these avatars which are just
completely as you can see they just
completely take up the video frame so if
you want you could stay anonymous and
what it does is it'll actually track
your eyebrows and your mouth and which
way your heads going so you maybe you
can turn around and look around if you
want you can go back to Jurassic Park
this one is one of the more CPU
intensive ones so as you can tell the
men off doesn't really move and cordons
for Vista users Logitech suggests 2.8
gigahertz with a 1 gigabyte of RAM and I
completely agree with them these avatars
rely on your CPU to do their performance
so the better the CPU the better the
avatar it's got a little wiggle in my
eye there so what you can do is you can
actually calibrate it so it will
actually get your face right and we'll
do a little calibration here
okay there we go that looks a little bit
better so another thing that's available
is the fun filters what you could do is
you can actually if you want to do the
whole mystery thing Who am I you can't
really recognize me but you can see that
I'm a guy you can do the mosaics with
the tiles which you know it's another
low nonnamous thing of 50s music movie
real you can do the whole ghosting
effect so if you want to move around
real quick and what can never really get
a clearer picture of you that's fine do
the negative it can do the hall of
mirrors you could do the eighties music
videos what they call it the whole
sketched look so you can pretend that
you're Bon Jovi get a large mystic or
hey I'm at your front door you want to
open it up okay or the neon look there's
other filters available as well as
avatars and the face assessments in fact
there's at least had 10 to 20 pages of
accessories online that you can look at
and just totally customize it downside
is you can only use one accessory at a
time so if I wanted to combine this this
look with the pirate look I can't it's
too unfortunate even though most of us
would like to be a little beaver pirate
be great so anyways that's almost
everything another part about this is I
mentioned it's a two megapixel webcam it
has the ability to upscale to 8
megapixels comes with an embedded
microphone which I'm using right now
with writes on technology cancels
background noise and echo it also has
the ability to face track so it can
follow you or two or more people that
can also do the face accessories base
filters and
the avatars and one of the best parts is
because it's a 2-megapixel it's able to
actually record an HD video now I've
tried recording an HD video on this
machine and the performance is really
lacking so it wasn't able to record and
do face accessories or an avatar at the
same time it's able to but the
performance was lacking so if you want
to use all of those mixed together then
you might want to invest in a higher-end
machine otherwise this webcam is
perfectly it's good to go on the very
top of the webcam there is a button that
you can push it'll take a picture called
quick capture and it'll you can set the
folder that it'll go to in Vista there's
a gadget available for your your gadget
sidebar for the webcam so you can just
go over there click a button and it'll
pop up the interface and you'll be able
to do whatever you want there including
send it off to somebody upload it to
YouTube most of all the features are
available from the quick cam interface
when you pop it up plug it in that pops
up it's available on the system task bar
if you haven't actually 100 bucks laying
around go ahead and get it directly from
Logitech or one of the big store chains
and this if you don't have a webcam I'd
highly suggest you look into this one or
any of the newer quick cam pro editions
and again I'm like Benton aka the
pocketnow.com pirate and I hope you
enjoyed this vid cast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
