phone I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket
now and this is the HTC first unboxing
the facebook phone or something to that
effect the HTC first was announced last
week at Facebook's event by a surprise
appearance by Peter Chou HTC CEO and
this is I guess sort of the first
Facebook phone but you know the argument
there is that every phone is a facebook
phone this one just comes with facebook
home pre-installed so it's the first
facebook home phone I don't know anyway
this is the HTC first it is out today
and this one just arrived so let's get
inside the box and see what it's all
about first if you look around the box
that's very plain minimal but kind of
the same design we've seen by HTC on the
boxes for a while now and this thing is
extremely difficult to get off without
ripping oh my gosh all right Wow and now
that's really easy to open go figure
alright so the device itself is sitting
right there of course move that to the
side and see what's inside the box oh
gosh papers do not discard this is
a replacement label if you take the
sticker off the phone we've seen that
before some HTC stickers nice sim
removal tool this is your Quick Start
Guide and other reading material what is
this safety and regulatory guide okay a
charging block through this little
plastic here AC adapter and this is I
imagine micro USB cable wow it's early
the FedEx guy actually woke me up this
morning so yeah anyway this is the
device so we're actually going to have
to rip the plastic off first it's
actually really really small I'll have
any device is right near be for a size
comparison but this is a 4-inch 4.3 inch
device so it's very small let's get this
class
oh and texting and driving they can wait
of course TNT's favorite little slogan
so let's take a look at the device
itself I looked over and realized I
wasn't recording audio so excuse the
terrible terrible audio on this i'm
using my camera's built-in audio and
that's never a good thing anyway this is
a 4.3 inch display at 720p that's 342
pixels per inch so it's a relatively
high ppi it comes with a custom button
layout which is back home and menu but
they HTC and Facebook wanted these to be
extremely extremely minimal so you have
simply an arrow a circle and a line the
front-facing camera here is a 1 point 6
megapixel camera but it's also very wide
angle as we've seen on other HTC models
and the rest of the hardware is
extremely extremely minimal along the
right edge you have a micro USB port in
a SIM slot I guess that's micro sim then
you have a power button on the top noise
cancelling mic and a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the top on the left
side you have nothing but a very matte
finished volume rocker and the bottom is
the speaker with the same little grill
grill pattern we've seen on the droid
DNA and the HTC One on the back there is
just a few little branding or emblems
down here HTC Facebook an AT&amp;amp;T and then
you have your 5 megapixel camera around
back and that's it is a very very plain
device and it's soft touch so it's very
it feels really nice in the hand but it
is small did grab the HTC One X for a
quick comparison so the size of this is
quite small and feels really weird I've
been carrying you know several large
devices lately so this feels extremely
small and it probably looks really
really small in my gigantic hands which
everybody comments about so not a lot
going on here with the hardware it's a
very very minimal device with very
little going on with the hardware
doesn't have monster specifications it
doesn't have a gigantic display and this
is mainly about what happens when you
hit that power button what comes on and
we're going to get to that in the next
video so stay tuned for more HTC first
coverage there will be plenty more next
week
so stay tuned and I'll see you next time
that about does it for this video if you
liked the video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
and stay tuned for more HTC first
coverage there will be plenty more next
week so stay tuned I'm Taylor Martin and
I will see you next time
