calm here at Aoife in Berlin checking
out the vaio tap 20 this is from Sony
this is a Windows 8 running large piece
of equipment for the desktop it looks
like an oversized tablet at first glance
but if you come around to the back
you'll see that it sits on an
articulated kickstand that with just a
little bit of pressure flattens out and
it becomes this tabletop computer that
you and a friend can play soccer on and
things of that sort there we go that's
what I was trying to get at you can have
games and so forth and collaborate much
like as Tony just pointed out the
original microsoft surface idea before
it was rebranded as a tablet anyway this
is shipping with an Intel processor with
backed up by a configurable RAM up to up
up to a gig I believe there we go that's
much better
that's better and configurable storage
options SSD or hard drive depending on
region and of course as you've seen we
can hop into the windows 8 standard
desktop just like in the other windows 8
machine responsiveness seems intense not
very portable at all as you can see
maybe a little bit more on this as we
continue through checking out the
various Sony products here at the show
stay tuned to pocket now for more from
IFA here in Berlin I'm Michael that's
Tony behind a camera this is pocket now
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
