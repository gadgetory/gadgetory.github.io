the budget Buster thanks in no small
part to phones like this axon 7 on paper
the specs sound almost too good to be
true but are we facing any compromises
to reach that $400 price point we're
going to dig deep into this camera to
see if it can compete with more
expensive smartphone offerings buckle up
folks we have a lot of ground to cover
and I'm gonna move pretty quick first a
little housekeeping we don't know what
sensor is really in this thing axon
details a 20 megapixel Samsung sensor
with optical image stabilization phase
detect autofocus and an F 1.8 aperture
but we can't find exactly what part
number axon is using so we don't know
exactly what the sensor or pixel size is
our best guess is somewhere around a one
over two point six inch sensor with a
similar field of view two phones like
the LG g5 which would result in a
slightly smaller pixel size given the
increase in resolution now starting off
with exposure in color most phones try
to impress us with bright vibrant images
and the axon 7 is no exception though
the phone uses spot metering adjusting
brightness where you focus the output is
still often a touch on the bright side
maybe a third to a half a stop over
blues and greens are well represented
though I'd like to see slightly richer
saturation in shots like these earthy
colors are also a touch on the
conservative side thankfully avoiding
exaggerated oranges but photos can
sometimes feel a little plain coming out
of this camera yellows are very well
captured not significantly oversaturated
and that extra brightness delivering
just little patches of clipping on this
abyss 'kiss and reds are always the most
difficult for digital sensors to expose
for this Rose is sizzling and petal
details are lost because of it but as
the axon is keeping saturation in check
for the most part when we can give the
camera different warm colors to play
with it does a better job than most of
delineating between the more reddish and
pinkish flowers here with spot metering
the axon does a respectable job of
capturing white objects in direct Sun
still dealing with some hot spots but
the subject isn't completely blown out
and where you focus is really important
for landing the exposure you want the
axon has respectable dynamic range we
can still clearly make out details in
the shade while the wall on the side of
this building retains its texture
unfortunately there are no raw files to
edit from so if you cook a shot you
won't be able to walk it back to recover
over and under expose details looking at
file sizes JPEGs are between five and
twelve megabytes per exposure and this
phone records UHD video somewhere in the
ballpark of a forty megabit per second
bitrate a minute of video should land
just under 400 megabytes the axon 7s
camera app is a nice mashup of familiar
Android and iOS tropes in Auto you can
control flash HDR and timer options from
the left-hand side though it is annoying
that HDR will toggle in place while the
flash controls slide out a different
menu for you to hit options on the right
we have shutter and filter options to
distort your image and fun ways using
real-time effects and manual mode is
very well featured giving you granular
controls over shutter speed ISO exposure
compensation white balance and manual
focus
I like this white balance slider as it's
one smooth action with common presets
labeled but the Kelvin number is listed
as you slide through the range digging
deeper into options unfortunately
removes you from your viewfinder this is
a pet peeve of mine but we have expanded
photo and video controls here resolution
metering modes voice capture grid geo
tagging etc a video mode is super basic
only giving us the ability to toggle the
flash as a spotlight and slide modest
exposure adjustments after focusing and
that focusing action can be a bit
frustrating as this is another phone
which forces you to lock focus and
exposure even while shooting video or
after a couple seconds it will reset and
move to full auto exposure this requires
a tap to focus then a completely
separate long press to lock the exposure
you can't lock it with one long gesture
from here the focus indicator can still
be moved though and I found it
impossible to focus and keep the lock on
exactly the object I focused on removing
my finger always resulted in a slight
shift away from where I initially tapped
on the screen and talking about focus
that focusing speed isn't anything to
write home about either for everything
but extreme macro performance the axon
was consistent and reliable but the
actual time the lock is maybe lower mid
pack thankfully the focusing action is
smooth and it
pretty nice when you're focusing during
video circling back to macro shots this
was where the axon bought me the most
closest focusing distance is actually
quite good getting you around three
inches away from the lens but at this
distance the autofocus is easily
confused in busy situations for photos
you can switch to manual focus but video
would just refuse to find this little
flower and even when you do get it to
focus if you have to lock the exposure
remember the phone will shift away
slightly from where you initially
focused which can sometimes be
disastrous when we're working with tiny
objects close up moving to white balance
I'm happy to see axon playing a bit more
with the quality of light than trying to
find the pure white of your subject our
sample photos look a bit warm but I
honestly feel like the camera is doing a
respectable job of capturing what these
scenes really felt like with warm
California afternoon light and a little
smoke in the atmosphere from a
relatively close wildfire mixing sunset
light and white flowers delivers a
really yellowed shot but again this
feels pretty close to the scene as you
would see it though in shade
we'd occasionally find situations where
the camera would overcorrect delivering
a much bluer tint to output than the
scene really called for now taking a
look at HDR performance most phones tend
to just boost shadow detail and the axon
is one of those devices it'll brighten
up the darker parts of your shot but it
does little to rein in brighter areas of
your frame and occasionally the phone
would just completely blow out the whole
scene and we were never able to
determine what would cause this
overexposure so there are some
consistency issues which should be
addressed in future software updates
this is a shame because the axon is also
one of the slowest we've tested at
processing an HDR photo and this is
absolutely not a setting we'd use if
there's any kind of movement in your
scene like say a flower gently listing
in a light breeze or this gentleman who
was really slowly walking through my
background in light this bright there's
no reason an HDR photo couldn't use a
fast enough shutter to avoid this
ghosting and this slow performance is
exacerbated at night where it was
exceedingly difficult to deliver a crisp
handheld HDR photo in low-light
conditions
panorama stitching on the other hand was
actually pretty great feed the bone a
smooth pan across the scene and it
delivered well expose shots with very
few stitching errors even in a busy shot
like this the power lines are a bit
bumpy but none of them are broken this
is very well done okay because you guys
are going to ask about it I hate selfies
the 8 megapixel front camera here
delivers respectable results but even in
good light and not using any beauty
filters expect some smoothing and noise
reduction filtering to blur detail these
effects are increased when your subject
is underexposed but thankfully we do get
some exposure compensation options to
dial in brightness video is 1080p but
with new stabilization it's pretty
twitchy we'd really like to see phone
manufacturers start using some kind of
software stabilization for our
front-facing shooters moving to
low-light shots we can easily see
another compromise on the axon and
that's lens quality prone to flaring
fringing and delivering similar
distortion to what we saw on LG's last
phone the rays of light from this lamp
above the creepy tunnel are a bit warped
for example this phone does find a happy
balance between capturing fine detail
and obliterating that detail with noise
reduction filtering but it does make up
some of that filtering with a little
extra sharpening the final image viewed
as a whole is usually pleasant but pixel
peepers might be disappointed which is
another opportunity for me to reiterate
that pixel peeping is bad and you should
do it when shooting an auto the camera
will open the shutter for up to one
tenth of a second but the optical image
stabilization here isn't quite robust
enough to rein in handshake with just a
little extra light Street scenes are
easier to capture our creepy gate shows
off again that the axon is taking its
white balance cues more from lighting
information than from the true white of
your subject as the scene is lit by a
really ugly security lamp and lastly a
flower in almost no light the axon was
barely able to lock focus after several
attempts but after five shots this was
the closest we could get to a clearer
capture looking at some longer exposures
manual mode is always fun to play with
some streaking tail lights or light
painting photos and with up to a 23
second shutter speed you'll have plenty
of time to play with some fun effects
now it really seems the axon
shutter speed two lengths that the image
stabilization can't quite keep up with
and this is readily apparent in the
super night mode this mode absolutely
requires a tripod and some exposures
were multiple seconds long but the final
results were almost always just blown
out and super bright I couldn't get a
handle on what conditions this mode was
actually for and you're probably better
served by setting up your own long
exposure using manual options moving to
video the axon is capable of shooting
h.265 compression video the bitrate
stays the same but that means we should
see a higher quality output over h.264
compression to my eye there's very
little difference when comparing similar
shots both create blocky artifacts and
consistent blue up in the sky but maybe
the h.265 artifacts are a little bit
smaller maybe regardless whatever
differences we can point to are a bit
too fine to really show off here in a
youtube review this is a super ambitious
setting to include on a $400 phone and
all of our samples were shot using the
highest possible quality modes but we'd
probably recommend people stick with
h.264 for now until we see better
compatibility with video editing
programs and the ability to upload h.265
to youtube on the whole however we get a
great high quality image out of this
camera and with similar performance to
what we saw for still photos good
contrast good color though like many
welcome 820 powered phones this year
maybe just a few more dropped frames
than what we would prefer low-light
videos unfortunately come out kind of
muted or dim scenes like these the
camera would normally use a longer
shutter for the still photo than a one
thirtieth of a second shot but the
darkest areas of the frame don't find
true black it's a washed-out gray which
kind of wrecks how contrasty an image
like this should look now looking at the
OIS as mentioned before this isn't the
most robust image stabilization system
we've reviewed in a walking test we see
a little jello from footfall
compensation but even when trying to
hold still quite a few shots suffered
from some twitchy shakes activating the
software stabilization when shooting
1080p video actually seems to make
performance worse though and looking at
the zoom happily there's a limit
as to how far you can crop to preserve
image integrity it's locked down to a
round of 4x equivalent but this keeps
photos and videos from getting blown up
in destroying the shot it's a perfectly
respectable balance to play with the
fairly resolution dense sensor on this
phone and audio performance is better
than mid-pack here noise reduction does
cut into the sound captured by these
mics and sometimes that can deliver some
shrill artifacts for busy scenes but
it's not completely degraded like some
other options around this and some
higher price point phones
now for transition tests moving from
dark to bright and back exposure changes
happen in fairly deliberate steps which
aren't particularly pleasant especially
moving from Bright to dark but happily
the camera seems to hold on to focus and
white balance relatively well while
adjusting to lighting changes this
panning though did seem to tax the phone
as again we're seeing a few more drop
frames than we would like
lastly looking at slow-motion it's a
really well-executed fun feature we say
at 720p but have options to scale up or
down the frame rate videos are finished
off with the speed adjustment baked in
though with no audio there's also quite
a bit of sharpening happening as there's
a moiré effect on these car grilles but
overall this is a solid option for
slowing things down so let's wrap this
up where does that leave us with the
camera on the ZTE axon 7 it really is
exciting what level of camera
performance we've come to expect out of
mid-range priced phones the axon 7 joins
the oneplus 3 in delivering an
incredible bang for buck
there certainly are issues here and some
frustrations and how much the software
might fight you in some shooting
conditions but overall I enjoyed my time
shooting on this phone and I think we
got some nice images out of it there are
still reasons why someone would want to
pay more for a phone when looking at
camera performance maybe faster
autofocus raw photo capture or more
polished user interface but for folks
shopping in this price tear we don't
think you're likely to find any serious
deal-breakers this phone is a treat as
