you from barcelona i'm anton hanna
behind the camera and we are here with
lenovo the company that purchased marula
we're going to check out their products
their presence here at MWC as well as
their brand recognition let's go take a
look inside so the first thing that
comes to mind when talking about Lenovo
probably is their laptop planet so we
have the think pads on that side and we
have the new yogas on this side this is
not within our scope of coverage but we
wanted to show you what they are showing
off at MWC these are both new and older
products but they are mainly focusing on
laptop and notebook computing and that's
what you should know them for getting
more into things which interests us
directly are the tablets here you can
find lenovo's yoga 8 tablets and on the
other side we'll just go there in a
couple of seconds the brand new yoga 10
HD plus tablets which we have shot for a
brief hands-on video so all of these are
lenovo's 10 inch brand new yoga 10 HD
plus tablets if you want to know more
about these we have just published a
short pants on video still part of
lenovo's the tablet lineup and now we're
going to move to the smartphone section
where we have not one not two but three
categories moving on to smartphones
we're starting with they're higher and
lineup which is called the vibe X we're
not gonna do a hands-on or not going to
focus completely on this phone we're
just gonna tell you that this is a 5
inch shirt with a full HD resolution
with a 13 megapixel camera on the back
and also a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor it looks very good it feels
then in the hand it's got a brushed
metal back and this chrome edges it is
really also one of the lightest
smartphones on the market today but
let's move on to the other phones
the other high-end phone which was
announced at CES but it's going to be
available soon is the vibe Z which is
somewhat larger than the vibe X we've
seen previously and it's also at the
same time a faster phone we're talking
about the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor of course quad-core clocked at
2.2 gigahertz and this display here is a
5.5 inch full HD 1080 by 1920 resolution
it is still thin as you can see it
follows completely the design guidelines
of Lenovo's phones with this brushed
metal which really feels plasticky
sometimes especially on this phone on
the back with the chrome aluminum rings
and of course we have Android with their
own single layer UI on top of it so you
can just scroll until tomorrow or until
your fingers drop let's move over to the
mid-range earphones and cover those as
well so aside from the vibe lineup which
is the highest end among them there are
two more line ups which they call the s
and the a the S is a mid-range err and
the a is the lower and we will not focus
on those because we have something even
harder we want to show you an
application which allows you to share
everything from a phone to another phone
or even to a computer so let's go check
that one out and wrap it up
so there are more applications which
come pre-installed on the Lenovo phones
and tablets talking about security
talking about applications that block
your phone calls or SMS of course if
it's incoming spam but this one
specifically called sherrod is great
because you can share content from one
device to the other whether if it's a
smart phone a smart phone smart phone a
tablet or smart phone to compare it and
the way this operates is that it will
enable you through the application which
can be downloaded today to share
something to another device not my
abilities but while a technology which
is based on Wi-Fi direct so you will not
be tethered to another phone via
bluetooth in a 3 3 4 meter range it will
go as high as 50 meters and also the
strength of the signal is strong and the
fast download speeds allow for quick
file transfers also we need to mention
this which is probably the coolest thing
about it it is cross-platform so if you
have an Android device or a
windows-based tablet or computer you can
share applications documents everything
really with a nice visual representation
of the transfers themselves
so that was a short look at the Lenovo
tour at their products at your
presentation as you've probably seen
Motorola is in good hands but we hope
that their marketing and strategies will
allow Motorola to do its thing in the US
and across the world hi Matt behind the
camera this wasn't on Pocket now thank
you very much for watching stick with us
