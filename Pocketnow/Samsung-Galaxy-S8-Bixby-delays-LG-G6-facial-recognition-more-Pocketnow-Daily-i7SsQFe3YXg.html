assistant won't be ready for when the
Galaxy s8 ships reports claimed that LG
is already working on some facial
recognition love for the g6 and HTC
seems invested in yet another attempt at
a smartphone I'm Jaime Rivera and since
I do read your comments and I have heard
that my jokes are getting boring how
about some ideas in the comments down
below this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with some very
odd statements from huawei CEO according
to him he is confused over the need of a
SmartWatch with the existence of
smartphones up to the point where he
really tries hard to remain excited
whenever the wearable team comes in with
something new and this is rather
interesting because my favorite
SmartWatch last year was the Huawei
watch first generation I have been using
the Huawei watch 2 for the better part
of the last couple of weeks in addition
to the LG watch sport and I like what
Huawei does with wearables this is weird
but then again it makes you wonder
exactly what will be the future for
wearables when it comes to Huawei mainly
because the two is not necessarily the
fanciest watch ever I'm waiting for that
watch too classic but yeah it seems that
we do agree a lot of companies are
struggling with the concept of what to
do with wearables in the future and I
think that Fitness is the way to go it's
just taking a while a little spotlight
over to the other company we were
mentioning LG as for those of you
wondering exactly how is LG planning to
compete with all the new biometrics
being offered by the Galaxy s8 it seems
the company is already working hard on
bringing its own attempt at facial
recognition and I say attempt because
Samsung's deployment of facial
recognition on the s8 was terrible at
least for what we tested with the
pre-production units at the event it
could be that this will not be the part
of final software but we will definitely
be the judge of that in our reviews but
yeah apparently in late spring or early
summer we should expect something from
LG with this ideal we'll see and now
let's talk about the HTC x10 and the
only reason we're going to mention
this show is because we don't want you
to believe that this is the successor to
the HTC 10 actually no we're talking
about a mediatek processor three gigs of
ram definitely not a successor but HTC
is planning to blend better battery life
with its premium mid-range
lineup so yeah that's coming at some
point now let's talk about t-mobile and
the Samsung Galaxy s8 because apparently
as Samsung teased that it would treat
its early pre-order customers well by
probably giving them an s8 early
apparently those of you that voted on
t-mobile will be the luckiest as
apparently the company will be shipping
them out early we're just talking about
a couple of days early not exactly sure
how many of these will be but yeah stay
tuned I wish I would have ordered on
t-mobile actually and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy s8 again but this
time in a very disappointing manner
mainly because we now hear from the
company officially that Bixby voice will
not be ready for the Samsung Galaxy s8
on launch you will be getting Bixby but
not the voice support you will be
getting the Google assistant by pressing
and holding the home button that is
still there of you need voice but it is
rather interesting that Samsung spent so
much time talking to us about a product
that is not going to be ready at launch
and apparently will not be ready until
late spring so it leads me to the
question of the day do you think that
this is a bad move then that this will
pretty much render Bixby dead on arrival
because in my case I do believe it could
one of the major selling points for this
phone is apparently this new assistant
is what every one of us wants to try in
our review period and it won't be
available so you're just going to get
used to living with your phone without
it and most likely will continue to do
so after you own the phone
so anyways leave us a comment down below
we would love to know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
videos filmed follow us I'm out
