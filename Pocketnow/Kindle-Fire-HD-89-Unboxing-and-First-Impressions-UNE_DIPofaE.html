pocket now calm if you're looking for
the best value in the 10 inch or nine
inch tablet it's hard to beat the kindle
fire HD 8.9 which is only 299 bucks
cheaper than the base Nexus 10 this
video we're going to unbox the 8.9 now
that they're finally shipping and give
you some first impressions let's get to
it and so like the Nexus 10 you're
working with a really high resolution
screen here on the kindle fire HD 8.9
we're going to talk about the
differences in a minute of course the
reason that the price is so low on the
kindle fire HD 8.9 is because it's
subsidized by all the content you're
going to buy as an amazon customer so
let's take this out quite light nothing
really in the box let's boot it on for
the first time really curious to see how
the scales in the hand this is so much
lighter than you're used to for a
ten-year tablet like an iPad or
something else that's in the 10 inch
range got a very similar design to the
Kindle Fire HD 7 we're going to compare
we've got the dual speakers which are
impressively loud at least on the 7-inch
and it looks it looks pretty much like a
blown-up Kindle Fire HD 7 as it should
okay so let's find the power button here
hopefully it's not yeah that's terrible
it's hidden along the bezel just like on
the 7-inch that's very frustrating
sometimes boot it up now what we have
here is a 1920 x 1200 screen that's
really high resolution but the Nexus 10
takes it we be on that at 2560 by 1600
at the end of the day on both of these
devices you're not going to be able to
see pixels very well because they're so
small but here on the kindle fire HD you
got to remember that the price is lower
so to compromise that you're making here
is of course the screen isn't as high
resolution and you don't get full
android you get amazon's kindle
experience which really isn't a bad
thing if you have a lot of kindle
content so we're going to unlock it here
it's going to close look at the text
really crisp and clear here much better
than the 7-inch kindle fire HD which has
a resolution of 1280 down
800 across just like the Nexus 7 so
we're going to set this up and come back
with some first impressions we're also
going to remove that glare so you can
see the screen better we'll be back and
we're back any screens are so incredibly
shining which is why they're reflecting
everything but this is the 7-inch kindle
fire HD this is the 8.9 inch and not
surprisingly they are pretty much the
same just one is a lot bigger than the
other the thing that's striking about
the 8.9 inches that it's so lightweight
with such a high resolution screen we're
used to seeing devices like the iPad 3
and 4 with their high res displays being
really thick and heavy that is not the
case with the kindle fire HD 8.9 and
it's also not the case with the Nexus 10
and of course with the Nexus 10 as we
just mentioned you get full android
whereas the kindle fire HD you are
buying into amazon's ecosystem which is
fine because there's a lot of great
content so real quick we're going to
turn on both of these and because of the
poor placement of the power button
you've got it sometimes kind of finagle
and this is the one with special offers
so every time you turn on your your
device you're going to get an
advertisement which is not that big of a
deal actually it's a fair trade-off you
just ignore it or sometimes they're
useful offers so looking for the power
button here we've got Mickey Mouse epic
mini the display on this thing is
amazing 8.9 we're going to get real
close in a minute but you know it's the
same kind of experience we get a menu
over here like we have over here this is
the Kindle Fire operating system it's
not full android although you probably
soon we'll be able to root and load a
custom rom on to the kindle fire HD 8.9
which will be quite awesome actually
kind of like a two hundred ninety nine
dollar Nexus device if you will as long
as that comes to fruition we've got a
lower resolution screen here on the
7-inch so if we look close up on the
text you can see pixels but over here on
the 8.9 this is just a fantastic display
so let's bounce around a little bit i
will look at various things we've got a
book here let's see how text looks on
the screen you can look at really small
text on this 1920 x 1600 display it just
looks really really good and of course
it's the weird kindle operating system
so you have to get used to that
and of course we've got web over here
and the web browser isn't that capable
to be honest they've got the the silk
browser engine which a server-side
rendering but it's not much faster I
think your average browser or it's even
slower in some case I fight if I flip
down the page it becomes white for
several seconds it's just it's not made
for web browsing but that said kind of
would be nice if it was made for web
browsing because the test looks so sharp
and clear I mean this just has a
wonderful display great contrast great
color saturation then the browser just
would be nice to have better performance
in it so we go back one of the awesome
things about the kindle fire HD s the
new one are the speakers and we can't
show you that on camera because it
really wouldn't come through but the
audio that this thing pumps out is loud
like really loud and it has an
interesting surround effect that does in
fact feel like you're listening to
surround sound it's very difficult to
explain go to a best buy and check it
out for yourself if you're an Amazon
Prime customer there's a bevy of content
that you can watch for free in the
kindle kindle library which is quite
nice so right out of the box you get a
30-day trial of prime where you can buy
it for a low yearly fee and you get
access to a ton of free content and of
course Amazon's ecosystem doesn't stop
there you've also got their music
catalog which is very extensive and very
competitive with what you get in Google
Play and with iTunes and of course you
got to go through an authorized the
device and up here we've got newspapers
and magazines and its really the full
enchilada so we've got maximum here and
on such a high resolution display kids
look away just kidding this is safe for
work on such a high resolution display
the page just looks awesome and for
example I you can't really tell on
camera but I don't need to zoom in on
any of these names I can see it from the
entire zoomed out view whereas if I
brought up the same page on the 7-inch
kindle fire HD you would have to zoom in
because the resolution is lower so a
really cool magazine viewing experience
unfortunately magazines are not made in
16 by 9 aspect ratio they're made in 4
by 3 so you get all this wasted space
along the bottom and with a software
update you can actually
you actually get this page turned
animation which is fun again this is
safer work so don't break so so much
better now with the higher resolution
display for looking at various magazines
and Amazon is a huge selection of
magazines now really any content that
you want amazon has it and for 299 bucks
this is just an awesome awesome device
to buy especially if the option exists
to root it and put full android on it
and we're going to check back and see if
that's even possible now because it
would make for one heck of an Android
tablet so no wait have you ordered the
kindle fire HD 8.9 is it on your holiday
shopping list what do you think about it
or are you thinking about getting a
nexus 10 let us know in the comments
maybe you're happy with your nexus 7 you
love the 7-inch form factor and it just
works for you or you're not that fat let
us know what you think and if you're
considering the 8.9 unifier HD you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and thanks for watching that's it for
now
