quick fast and easy and if they look
good doing it all that much better I'm
Joe Levi for Pocket now this is a first
look at LMT launcher for Android they're
an awful lot of things that this
launcher does this of course being LMT
launcher on my Nexus 4 one of the
drawbacks first and foremost is you have
to be running a rooted device the reason
for that well there's lots of them but
to get in and do all the stuff that this
can do you've got to have route let's
just put it that way
ok so let's take a look first of all
what we can do this first thing is
called PI and I think you can see why
it's shaped very much like a PI come
over to this side so you can see it a
little bit better I've got two rows that
I've set up I can toggle Wi-Fi go back
go to the menu go home pull up my search
quick launch into Gmail ingress Star
Trek Google Talk
and Google+ you'll notice over here I
also have the date and time and I have
some notifications scrolling in and off
on the side and they're animating they
look offensive great one thing that I
haven't done is I have not set up long
presses and that's primarily so I could
show you this video in point a long
press I can set up every one of these
icons so that it has two functions one
just what you see and then another what
happens when you long press on it like
I'm doing right now
again I'm not I didn't enable long press
so I could show you this but let you
know you can do that and it's really
kind of cool
so this is not stock this is not the way
that this app came pre-configured in
fact configuration is a little bit
tricky let's go in and look at how to
configure the PI and then we'll get into
some of the other cool stuff this is LMT
and over here you've got all these
settings well scoot over here to PI if
you want to change something in the PI
you've got the level one that's the
inside and you've got level two that's
the outside very quick very easy if we
want to change let's go back to level 2
let's say I don't want to use Gmail
let's say I want to use something else I
can choose
app or any of these other things in here
let's choose an arbitrary app and let's
say I want that to be bad piggies tap
that go back home and from now on I've
got bad piggies right there I can
quickly and easily launch that works
great works fast I love it you can get
to it from either the side the other
side or the bottom which I have not
enabled because I want to use my Google
now for that when you set LMT up
originally you're just going to have one
layer you'll need to go in and set up
the other layer but when you do that it
wipes out all the other settings it
looks kind of funny the reason for that
is all of your icons don't have icons so
when you come in none of these guys are
they're just as app which is really kind
of lame you don't know what it is what
it does until you launch it so to get
around that come over here to settings
scroll all the way down to show app
images it defaults to zero which is
disabled go in here use your keyboard
change that to 1 hit OK and you're good
to go
from then on it will show you the app
icons it will also default to only
launched from this side at least did on
my install but I want to also launch it
from that side so to do that I just tap
on this activation area position change
it to left and right
I didn't choose left right and bottom
again I want to be able to use Google
now off the bottom and those two would
kind of conflict with one another so I'm
just choosing left and right that seems
to work best for me there are really two
other major components to the app one is
called gestures and one is called the
invisible swipe areas if you want to use
either one of those you're going to need
to come in here and set the gesture
input if you take a look here's a whole
bunch of devices you'll want to find
yours in this list mine's a nexus 4
select that otherwise things aren't
going to work just right and it did take
me a little while to figure this out it
defaulted down here to the Evo 3d and my
swipes my gestures didn't work once I
did that they work pretty well now over
here on gestures you've got all these
different gestures that you can do and
the gestures let you do stuff they let
you launch app so they let you change
things toggles
have all kinds of cool stiff so what
I've done is I've just very simply set
up a swipe right double what that means
is I can take two fingers swipe from the
far left to the far right or this app or
this gesture rather is the opposite and
then there's up and there's down and
there's all kinds of cool stuff that you
can do but for this example we're just
going to use this swipe right double if
I want to change that again same thing
that I've used before let's go ahead and
open this up take a look at it let's say
I really like games and let's do Angry
Birds space we'll go back home this is
where I said it gets kind of tricky and
it's kind of hard to show on video you
take two fingers swipe all the way
across and if I did that right there you
go just took a second it will launch my
app really quite cool what it can do
it's not quite as fast to recognize that
as some might like but that's a lot
faster than opening up your app drawer
and hunting around for the app that
you're trying to launch and launching it
that way overall very cool the one last
thing that I haven't shown you that I'm
going to leave you to play around with
just on your own is this invisible swipe
areas it's kind of the same thing you
can set up an app a recent app trigger
all kinds of cool stuff just by using
this invisible swipe area where you can
swipe in that particular part of the
screen go in there download the app play
around with this tell me if you liked it
in the comments over a pocket now if you
like what you saw here with really cool
launchers in this case LMT
make sure you give the video a thumbs up
while you're at it why not tell your
friends on Google+ and Twitter about it
for pocket now showing off awesome
launchers on Android powered devices I'm
