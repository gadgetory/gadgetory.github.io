ago and the amount of things announced
was enough to warrant a separate video
for the pocket out daily some of the
things that were announced for great
others not so much so I'm gonna leave it
up with pocket now and let's go through
them
sundar Pichai kicked off the event
talking a lot about artificial
intelligence and how the company has
evolved over the last couple of years
for example two years ago Google's
artificial intelligence was only capable
of detecting that was a train in the
photo now I can tell what color the
train is in the amount of trains as well
obviously the major role here is for
Google Assistant this is the company's
new AI and we heard two very important
things number one that the company is
using this as an open platform meaning
that currently you can use Google
assistant for Google services but
eventually the plan is for it to evolve
and to other things like for example
allowing you to order an uber and not
really require the application to be
loaded on your smartphone this is all
going to be called actions on Google
there will be an SDK available as of
next year but third-party developers and
companies will be able to start using it
as by the end of this year now another
major role was played by artificial
intelligence obviously that Google
assistant has to be able to talk to
other devices not just your phone so we
got three different products announced
today that are focused in improving that
number one is Google home we started
Google i/o now it's available for
pre-order and the whole idea here is you
get a speaker that allows you to talk to
Google asking questions in addition to
controlling other things at your home in
addition the second product that we got
was Google Wi-Fi the companies on hub is
now evolving into more Wi-Fi routers in
a smarter way for you to be able to
connect different devices and control
who is connected finally Google
chromecast ultra and got ultra in many
ways starting with 4k resolution HDR
video capabilities the only problem is
that the price tag now goes to $69 but
then I'm going to view compared to other
competing devices it still continues to
be a very compelling product but the
problem with Wi-Fi in the chromecast is
you have to register for the waiting
list they are not available yet and yes
of course this whole event had to do
with smartphones and we finally got the
announcement of the Google pixel phones
I have to remember pixel has always been
high-end products for Google so yes
these phones are in the expensive side
but what you're getting here are very
compelling specifications first of all
this is clearly HTC design all over and
the cool thing is that both phones
pretty much shared specifications only
one is larger than the other about the
only differences are that one is a 5
inch display AMOLED 1080p the other is a
5.5 inch display AMOLED quad HD
obviously battery differences are shared
because one phone is larger than the
other but then everything else we
finally get phones with the Snapdragon
801 processor four gigs of RAM options
432 and 128 gigabytes of storage
no water-resistant mentioned here and
everything else about the phone is
interesting number one the design is
great at the back three color options
that are quite compelling problem is the
front is kind of uninspired and we're
not really sure if these speakers are
stereo or not and then Google spends a
lot of time talking to us about how
great these cameras are I'm sure we have
one point five five microns on the
camera but the problem is its f 2.0
aperture so obviously we cannot wait to
test these phones out pre-orders have
just begun our smart phone should be
available soon for review and we will
let you know if it's really worth it to
pay six hundred and fifty dollars as a
starting point for one of these pixels
compared to what you would pay for Nexus
devices in the past and then the
experience of VR was also demoed with a
dream view that's the company's new VR
headset that has a ton of differences
and clearly proves why you need a new
hardware to be able to use it first of
all because it's only compatible with
pixel phones because they connect
wirelessly to the headset there are no
wires and we still don't know exactly
what kind of technology is being used
here now these headsets are made of
fabric because google claims that it
should be comfortable to use them that's
great the controller has a ton of
sensors to be able for you to use it for
drawing for gesturing for point whatever
games you want there will be a ton of
tiles we hear up to 50 companies already
partnered with Google for content to be
launched by the end of this year and the
price tag is quite compelling at $69 the
only problem is again comfort is one
thing look
are another and it's not really that
good-looking or any better-looking than
any other VR headset out there but
anyways to wrap this video up let's go
through our impressions so far let's
just say we are happy with the hardware
that we see but the problem is that we
noticed Google moving away from the
typical direction that the company had
first of all with pixel smartphones
being more expensive with no Nexus
smartphones in the future we wonder
exactly what happened to the company
that tried to innovate with extremely
affordable smartphones and a great blend
with specifications sadly that was the
Nexus lineup which is no more the second
is that if you think about it the only
way for you to be able to enjoy
everything that Google announced today
or at least most of it you actually need
new hardware
first of all Android 7.1 new good with
assistant integration is only available
on pixel phones there was no mention of
support for Nexus devices Google even
said on their Nexus account on Twitter
that it will continue supporting Nexus
devices but it didn't say how so it
makes you wonder exactly what the whole
point of everything announced that I
would be if you have to buy new hardware
to enjoy it obviously it'll take some
time and we're sure that Google will
eventually provide support for
everything but it leads me to the
question of this video are you happy
with everything you saw today or is
there anything that disappoints you
because in my case honestly my
disappointment will be again I have to
buy new things to enjoy this and
everything announced what the Google
assistant is cool but again it's pretty
much not available to the masses it was
