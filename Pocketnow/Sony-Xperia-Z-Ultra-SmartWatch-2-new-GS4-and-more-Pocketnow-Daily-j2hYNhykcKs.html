phablet to the masses the company also
announced they're waterproof SmartWatch
2 and a samsung galaxy s4 with a
snapdragon 800 processor gets leaked i'm
high memory betta and yeah there's only
four days left for the weekend this is
 out daily let's start a off with
some news that'll make some of you happy
in some of you very mad and the reason
why is because we knew that there was
gonna be an LTE advanced variant of the
galaxy s4 in the works but there are
some league photographs of the phone
already and guess what it's also rocking
the snapdragon 800 processor at times
when we know that the processor is
superior to the snapdragon 600 or the
octa-core Exynos processor you guys are
rocking right now so doesn't it burn to
be an early adopter now let's move on
over to some other probably upsetting
news as Reuters is now reporting that
Microsoft is in very advanced stages of
bringing xbox games to iOS and Android
apparently the first game to reach both
platforms as ages of Empires and
apparently you will be getting it for
free as part of a bundle aside from
other goodies that Microsoft is probably
intending for both platforms so for
those of you that are rocking a windows
phone right now yeah you can use the
comments you can tell Microsoft will you
think now we're just a couple of days
away from Nokia's July eleventh event
and according to a very reliable tipster
we will be getting a smartphone of this
event and apparently it will be the new
PureView euros apparently that's gonna
be the name of the new smartphone that
will bring the 41-megapixel camera to a
Windows Phone device do you really
believe that this 41 megapixel camera is
really gonna make Windows Phone take off
leave us a comment down below and let's
see what we get at this July eleventh
event we will be covering it live now
Sony's event just happened in Asia and
we've got a lot of products but one of
the most compelling ones is that we did
get the SmartWatch too yes we did get a
SmartWatch and it's the SmartWatch 2
which blends the design of the Xperia Z
it's got the power button it's got the
waterproof and dustproof specifications
it works with NFC it has bluetooth 3.0
to connect with your xperia smartphone
or I hopefully believe that any other
smartphone as well
well it does bring a lot of compelling
features to provide android support tool
watch the question is if you're really
interested in this product so again
leave us a comment if you're interested
I love the design i love the fact that
it's finally waterproof i would buy it
but then again we will be having to wait
until probably September when it gets
launched and finally for the hot news of
the day sony has also unveiled their
first phablet it's called the sony
xperia z ultra as if they just ran out
of names this thing is humongous it's a
six point three inch display and it's
got all the bells and whistles sony
finally brings a cutting-edge processor
to their next phone it's the Snapdragon
800 and therefore the phone won't be
available until q3 2013 it's got 1080p
display its kind of triluminos display
that brings more enhanced colors to
display which I hope so because the
display on the Xperia Z and ZL was
really bad but anyways links in the
description for full specs and details
on the phone and that leads me to the
question of the day you know out of the
videos and everything that you'll see in
the description what do you think about
this phone would you like an xperia z
ultra in my particular case i am a fan
of phablets i do like them and i do like
the fact that it's waterproof as well I
just don't know what I do with the phone
that big so leave us a comment down
below would you be interested of course
as always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone in salvo makes you fall was

YouTube channel as well you can also
follow me on Twitter and hang onto
