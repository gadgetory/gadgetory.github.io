Macs are having serious connectivity
issues on their new devices Samsung is
soon launching a smartphone with an on
display fingerprint scanner and no it's
not the Galaxy S 10 and some new renders
of the huawei mate 20 Pro just emerged
and do not leave anything for the
imagination I'm Jaime Rivera and like
this video to play for a chance to win
another leak of the Google pixel 3 excel
because they're all over the place this
is pocket out daily the official news
today are inexistent let's talk about
leaks and rumors particularly now with
the oneplus 60 as well there's this
image that just emerged on Weibo that
shows us the display of the oneplus 60
and a date that for those of you that
have noticed over the years many
companies like to tease the launch date
are not necessarily tease the launch
date but in their presentation that will
use the day of the presentation for the
date that's being displayed so October
17th is being shown on this 1 + 6 photo
t1 blue 60 yeah let's see what happens
now let's talk about the huawei mate 20
pro as a more renders of just emerged
yesterday we saw it with a case today we
don't see it with the case we see color
options like Twilight blue as well the
phone looks really really cool I'm sorry
I know they're not just horrible I know
some of us don't like it I've out put up
with it because that back looks really
futuristic let's see what we get in the
end hopefully these are not fake now
let's talk about Samsung as the company
is reportedly working on a device with
an on display fingerprint scanner to the
launch this year but it's not the Galaxy
S 10 that we're waiting for next year
that's the ultrasonic technology from
Qualcomm this one knows apparently an
optical sensor that works through an LCD
and this phone which is being dubbed the
p30 is apparently slated for China so
yeah Samsung seems to be working hard on
the mid-range and it seems like a good
strategy now let's talk about display
mate and the company's rankings as we
know that the Galaxy Note 9 1 and 8 plus
rating on display mate and it always
does I mean the Galaxy Note Everest
so I can remember and pretty much the
galaxy SS well have won so many prizes
over the quality of their ole ads and
yeah I'm OLED technology is just the
best but guess who just won that ranking
the iPhone 10's max is now a higher
ranking over the galaxy note 9 when it
comes to display mates ranking and it's
just funny because obviously this
display is being made by Samsung or at
least we presume because the rumors were
that LG was also going to make all ads
for this phone so let's see which one
won cuz LG has never won anything for
theirs
and finally the hottest news - they have
to do with the iPhone tennis the tennis
max as a we've got some complaints and
I'm actually gonna add myself on that
list users are complaining about Wi-Fi
capabilities on this phone and yes if I
am in a particular room that's far away
from the living room every device with a
qualcomm snapdragon 845 will remain
connected whereas the iPhone 10 wouldn't
and now the 10 s is doing exactly the
same my variant had an Intel chip I'm
not exactly sure what modem mine has but
to my understanding all devices this
year from OP from Apple are now Intel
modems so apparently the funny part is
those that are complaining most of those
on Verizon and this would probably be
the first time that we'd get an Intel
modem for Qualcomm sorry for a Verizon
device so that's sad I don't know what
to make of that and then we've got some
other reports that in battery tests the
10s and even the 10s max that not beat
last year's iPhone 10 which didn't have
great battery life in my opinion and to
be fully honest with you I mean the
battery life on the 10s is it's math
it's not great it's not terrible I'm
also feeling the same way about the
Apple watch series 4 but anyways in
today's comments let us know are you
having issues with your 10s or tennis
max when it comes to connectivity let us
know in the comments we would really
love to know more friends again if you
