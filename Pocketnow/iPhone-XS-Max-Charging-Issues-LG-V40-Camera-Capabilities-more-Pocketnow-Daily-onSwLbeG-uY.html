that won't charge like it should you're
not alone some teasers of the LGV 40
camera capabilities have emerged then we
are excited it looks like that we might
be getting a new Huawei watch after all
hopefully I'm hi melody betta and
welcome to October the month of
smartphones that we were totally not
expecting this is marking out daily
sponsored by swap off the official loose
today begin with product launches as
we've seen Samsung take over brands like
Harman Kardon and AKG but we were still
waiting on hardware and as it turns out
we have a new pair of over the ear
headphones being announced today the
name is kind of long and I'm gonna
definitely forget it before I record it
so yeah new AKG headphones over the year
$350 in the price tag and a ton of noise
cancellation features and everything I
can't wait to share more once our review
unit comes I'll let you know now let's
talk about Oppo as well the company has
definitely surprised this with a find X
expect our review very soon but there
are press invitations for an event to
happen on October 10th and they're
teasing what seems to be a new lineup
there are certifications for up to three
devices not exactly sure if this is
going to be the continuation of the r17
pro or what is going to be the case but
I am really looking forward to see what
we get and speaking of certifications we
have a new Wow way watch being certified
by the FCC I was not expecting this by
the way I've been a big fan of Huawei
watches ever since the first generation
second one was it was okay but the first
one was really great and now with the
Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 3100 that could
be even better though I'm not exactly
sure we're getting this device as part
of that hardware package the a
certification is then possible cellular
variant in addition to a foreign ten
milliamp hour battery gps all the bells
and whistles of let's see in the end
what we get
and speaking of smartwatches let's begin
with the LG v 40s famous tipster Evan
Blass has chimed in on some features
that we're getting in the cameras
apparently we are getting five cameras
on this phone three cameras at the back
that would be wide telephoto
the regular and then the front
apparently there's a regular folk camera
for of selfies and then another it seems
for wide-angle selfies and apparently
there's also a watch in the mix which
would be awesome if we also get from LG
hopefully better-looking than last
year's models we'll see about that as
well and finally the hottest news today
I have to do with a phone that's so hot
that it doesn't charge the iPhone 10s
and 10's max apparently are having
issues in charging with the Lightning
port Lou from unbox therapy made a full
video about his issues I haven't had any
issues with my unit and the units that
we're using currently for review we
haven't had any issues there it's not
when you wirelessly charge that works
just fine but then when you connect the
phone towards lightning cable to charge
from there apparently there are certain
users that are having issues and the
Apple hasn't really chimed then but let
us know in the comments I mean have you
bought an iPhone 10s or tennis max I'd
probably mistakenly said plus earlier I
know it's just a terrible name but then
have you had any issues with your phone
and if not any friends let us know in
the comments so far we're not having an
issues here but anyways let us know and
at the same time we'd like to ask you to
stay till the end of this video for a
message of our sponsor that allows this
content to be possible and folks before
we conclude the video we'd like to thank
our sponsor swap ax for making this
video possible now that we have new

of our favorite models like the iPhone
