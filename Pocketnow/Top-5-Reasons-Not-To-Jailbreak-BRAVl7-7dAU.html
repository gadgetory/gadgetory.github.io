things to come to iOS but sadly not
everything is fun in game so for those
of you that are still on the ropes
trying to decide if jailbreaking is
right for you we already gave you a top
5 reasons of why you should jailbreak
but now I'm high metal you betta this is
 now and I'll give you the top 5
reasons why you shouldn't jailbreak
number 5 sadly jailbreaking is not for
everyone even though it's very easy to
jailbreak any device it still requires a
little bit of technology and aside from
that well not everybody's out there to
try to do their best with the iPhone
they just want to run the specific apps
that they like and they're really not
after tweaking things you're not annoyed
by the fact that the settings are all
stuck in one menu they're not easily
accessible aside from other things it
sadly isn't something that everybody's
out there for and if you consider the
average iPhone consumer I'll tell you it
does make sense for not everybody to
want to jailbreak number for your iPhone
is exposed to malware and well site
loading applications doesn't only allow
you to side load city apps but it also
allows you to side load malware and just
think about this in particular if you're
worried about your phone being tracked
or tapped well in the case of the iPhone
the only way you can actually do that as
if you jailbreak the device first and
then load the applications that will
allow whichever private investigator or
service to be after you so sadly
jailbreaking does have this level of
threat that you should consider number
three it complicates your user
experience for example if you want to
update to a newer version of iOS well
you can't do it over the air anymore you
have to pretty much get rid of the
jailbreak then upgrade to the newer
version of iOS and then restore the
device and it just makes everything
complicated aside from that there are
some applications that don't quite work
with jailbreaking your device like for
example Skype you do get a message that
your device is jailbroken that you can't
use Skype you actually can use it but we
wonder if it's actually safe to use
Skype of your devices yell broker you
still get that alert number two well
jailbreaking apps are actually quite
expensive if you look at them the
average application for iOS could cost
you to one or two dollars there are some
games out there that will cost you $6 $7
at most but then you have it until a
screen next that'll give you a three-day
trial which is cool
the problem is it cost you ten bucks and
if you consider the advantages of in
telescreen X sure you can just consider
not loading it to your phone but then
again ten dollars for a simple tweak is
kind of expensive and aside from that
one you'll get others that are quite
expensive and even though some people
tell me that there are trials well there
aren't drawers for everything so not
everything is out there for you to try
and the top number one reason why you
shouldn't jailbreak your iPhone is
actually two things number one you lose
reliability the time ever since I've
jailbroken my iPhone it's pretty much
crashed around 10 times and you better
get used to that and the second is the
fact that restoring an iPhone to factory
settings can be a pain that obviously
depends on your mileage in my case I
have a 64 gigabyte iPhone in my
connection in my country is pretty much
5 megabits to 8 megabits down so just
think about this 64 gigs that's pretty
much max to 60 and then I have to pretty
much restore the factory settings pretty
much delete everything and then either
use iCloud or use my computer to restore
64 gigs of content how long do you think
that takes it's actually a pain so just
consider that before jailbreaking
definitely your experience is not really
going to be the best if you're out for
reliability and the best iOS experience
even though some people will debate that
and the reason why a jail broke is
because I actually do debate that that's
it for this week's top 5 video on
reasons why not to jailbreak make sure
