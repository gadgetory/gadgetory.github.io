now calm and this is the hardware review
of the Sprint Evo 4G let's take a look
okay we're back and before we talk about
the hardware on the device I want to
talk about the screen quality the
contrast on the color when I first
turned on the Evo 4G I thought to myself
this screen kind of looks washed out
then I quickly realized that I had been
using or I remembered that I was using
the Nexus One is my daily driver which
has an AMOLED screen I'm a hood screens
had fantastic contrast and almost never
look washed out and that's why I thought
that as you're gonna see in a second the
Evo 4G has a fantastic screen that's
even better than the HD 2 so we've got
all these devices set on automatic
brightness and we're going to turn them
on and bring you to the same spot we've
got pocketnow.com loaded so you can see
what they look like I'll jump into the
browser over here are you loaded and
already loaded and you can see straight
off the bat that the whites are whiter
here on the Evo 4G then on HD too but
compared to the Nexus One and this may
be a matter of personal preference I
find the colors to be a little bit
sharper the Blues are a little bit
richer the greens are more green on the
Nexus 1 but again that's what you get
with an AMOLED screen to make a 4.3 inch
AMOLED screen right now would be very
expensive
that's probably why HTC hasn't done it
yet I'm sure we'll see larger AMOLED
screens in the near future so that was a
quick note on screen quality I find that
the Evo 4G does in fact have very good
color reproduction and contrast so let's
take a look around the rest of the
device okay so starting at the top we
have the the speaker girl here but we
also have a notification light up here
which is really handy to have so you can
glance at your phone across the room and
say okay I have a new email I have a new
SMS you can set this in the settings
very nice feature then we have this
front-facing video camera that can be
used with the quick calling application
it's a 1.3 megapixel camera you can also
use it to take self-portraits which is
comes in handy if you are taking
pictures of you and another person and
you want to get that sort of angle in
front it's got the Sprint logo up here
again the screen is 4.3 inches just like
the HD 2
the resolution is 800 down by 480 across
so very high resolution display got four
buttons down here all of which are
completely flat and capacitive and they
vibrate a little bit when you press them
so you've got home menu back and search
it feels kind of weird compared to the
HD 2 because the HD 2 has these buttons
on the front which you can actually feel
for something to get used to though
those of you that are using a Nexus One
are probably used to not having physical
buttons here on the body going over to
the left side we have nothing they
actually put the volume rocker on the
right side which I haven't found a
problem with it took them a few calls to
get adjusted to it but so far so good up
here on the top we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and the power standby
button on the bottom we have 2 ports
which is pretty rare nowadays one is
actually the HDMI port and this uses the
micro D HDMI connector I actually just
ordered one from Amazon so that I can
demonstrate to you how this works when
connecting to a projector or a flat
panel a very very useful function to
have on a smartphone you can project
YouTube videos you can project photos or
anything that you're doing I expect that
a lot of high-end smartphones are gonna
have the HDMI connector in the near
future and here we have a micro USB so
it's compatible with all your existing
micro USB chargers and then we have a
microphone down here here on the back
we've got this nice and rubbery coating
making it feel solid in hand we've got a
dual LED flash with an 8 megapixel
camera you can actually take video in
720p we'll talk more about the video
quality later we've got a speakerphone
which I found to be really really good
on calls it doesn't distort as easily as
pretty much every phone out there that
has a speakerphone the larger HTC logo
is here
remember how HTC used to have the small
logo now they're pretty big and bold
about it and then we have this kickstand
which does a really awesome job at just
propping the phone up on the table has
good weight distribution and just does a
really good job what it advertises it
also has a little brushed metal coating
if I can shine the light it's very nice
very high-end looking and it says sprint
4G on the back let's rip off this back
battery cover you do something by
jamming your nail into here we get this
awesome looking red and the benefit of
the red is that it shows through certain
parts of the cover so around the camera
lens you see red peek through under the
kickstand you see red so a nice little
touch and the battery is also red we can
take it out and the battery is 1500
milliamp hours we'll talk about battery
later but I can give you a little
preview it's not so great an average I
have to juice it up in the middle of the
day and it's probably because I'm using
it a lot but we'll talk more about that
later and also in here we have the very
difficult to get to a gigabyte microSD
card so what you do is you pull up on
this tab and then if you've got small
fingers then this won't be a problem but
for the rest of us
you have to pinch pinch it and slide it
out if you have tweezers that's what you
should use but there I got it out so it
comes with this micro SD card eight
gigabytes very nice to have indeed so
let me pop this back in it's a tight fit
back here I'll tell you that so we just
press it down and it locks so let me pop
this back in and we'll turn back over to
the front now if you're interested in
buying the Evo 4G know that it is not a
small lightweight phone it is big it
feels big in hand it feels big in the
pocket and it's heavy it's 170 grams
compared to the HD 2 which is 157 grams
in the Nexus 1 which is 130 grams I've
been using the Nexus One and the Evo 4G
and when I take out the Evo 4G it just
feels dramatically heavier and you would
think with a form factor like the HD 2
it would feel like the HD - let me tell
you it does not do like the HD - the HD
- feels like a big phone like a big PDA
it's it's thin it feels good in the
pocket it slips right in the Evo 4G is
significantly thicker especially when
you look back here it goes up a good bit
compared to the HD - in fact I
compare the Evo 4G to a slate tablet
phone that's how it feels to me it
doesn't feel like a phone it feels like
a slate maybe that's okay for you maybe
you don't mind the larger size in your
pocket or the weight but just to let you
know it is not a small device and when
you go to the store and you feel this in
your hand you're probably going to agree
that it's also quite heavy for a
smartphone so that was the hardware
review of the Sprint Evo 4G we'll be
back with a lot more coverage be sure to
give the video a thumbs up if you liked
it and please subscribe to our channel
