smartphone ever goes toe-to-toe with
HTC's current flagship I'm Taylor Martin
this is it now and this is the
samsung galaxy mega 6.3 versus the HTC
one the samsung galaxy mega 6.3 and HTC
one or symbolic of the respective
situations HTC and Samsung are currently
in be one for HTC is a new take on the
smartphone industry a fresh start which
will hopefully pull the company out of a
deep rut and so far the reception of the
one has been mostly positive it's a fair
competitor not a serious threat to the
galaxy s4 the galaxy mega 6.3 is a
perfect indication of how well samsung
is performing how it's currently poised
to experiment and test waters without
the fear of going bankrupt the HTC One
is a make-or-break device for HTC that's
fortunately doing well for the company
the galaxy mega 6.3 on the other hand is
a completely unnecessary smartphone that
only caters to a niche market and this
is how those two smartphones compare in
terms of hardware there are very few
similarities between these two phones
there is no denying that mega 6.3 as
part of samsung's umbrella galaxy brand
it shares a virtually identical design
with the galaxy s4 only on a much larger
scale the sides and back for the mega
6.3 are slick hyper glaze plastics with
fake textures the chrome trim around the
edges is a faux brushed metal and the
front and back bear a dot pattern that
breaks up the monotony of an otherwise
plain jane design the face holds
Samsung's typical navigation button
pattern a physical home button in the
center and capacitive buttons to each
side menu to the left and back to the
right the HTC one's design and build
quality are distinctly superior instead
of lightweight flimsy plastic the HTC
One is constructed of a sturdy aluminum
the face of the device bears two large
speaker grilles one at the top and one
at the bottom for the boomsound speakers
with Beats Audio and unlike most Android
phones that are only two navigation
buttons back on the left and home on the
right it has a curved back which makes
it slip into the center of your palm
comfortably but the power button
placement on the top left corner makes
it difficult to power the device off and
on without adjusting your grip speaking
of grip the HTC One is just the right
size for many to use comfortably with a
single hand but the display that
measures 4.7 inches diagonally
it's the upper limit and screen size for
most people the galaxy mega 6.3 is plain
and simple a two-handed smartphone while
the button placement makes it easy to
adjust volume and taco stand by easily
with one hand reaching opposing corners
of the display is difficult if not
impossible without the use of a second
hand the contrast between these two
carry down into the specifications the
HTC One comes with a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 600 chipset 2
gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes were 64
gigabytes of fixed storage with the no
microSD card slot a non-removable 2300
milliamp hour battery a 4 ultrapixel
camera and a 4.7 inch 1080p slc d3
display with a pixel density of 469 PPI
on the inside the galaxy mega 6.3 has a
1.7 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon 400
chip 1.5 gigabytes of ram 8 or 16
gigabytes of storage with a microSD card
slot for up to 60 for additional
gigabytes and a removable 3200 million
power battery around back it has an 8
megapixel camera and the fronton equips
a giant 6.3 inch 720p TFT display for a
total of 233 pixels per inch the HTC One
has dual speakers on the front dubbed
boomsound which are notably louder than
the still very loud rear speaker on the
mega both also come in LTE variants
though our HTC One and mega or hspa+
only models and they both feature Wi-Fi
b/g/n AC and NFC there's a never-ending
debate over whether replaceable and
expandable features are necessary or a
must but one thing there's no debate
over is which of these two devices wins
in terms of display flat-out the HTC
one's 1080p super lcd3 takes the cake in
virtually every category save for sheer
size the LCD panel on the one is
slightly brighter more vibrant literally
twice as dense and thus noticeably more
crisp both displays offer very wide
viewing angles and similar contrast the
obvious benefit to the mega 6.3 aside
from the inferior display quality is its
size and the DPI setting unlike other
extra-large smartphones the mega
features a lower dpi making on screen
elements smaller instead of simply
stretching them over more pixels meaning
most applications display much more
content per page
if you find yourself needing more room
to type or simply want a gigantic
display in your hands in pocket the
galaxy mega is the best choice if
instead you want a one-handed phone with
a superior display build specs and
design the one is the clear winner these
two smartphones are no more alike in
terms of software than they are in
hardware the HTC One comes running the
most recent version of sense UI atop
Android for dot 1 the galaxy mega 6.3
comes with a dumbed down version of the
latest TouchWiz over android for dot 2
meaning it has all the latest Android
features such as lock screen widgets
daydream and more the reason we called
omegas touch with version dump down is
because it's lacking many of the new
features announced alongside the galaxy
s4 earlier this year although it offers
air view and smart state it's missing
smart pause smart rotation smart scroll
air gesture drama shot dual camera and
many many more features with the latest
version of sense HTC tone down its
customization some but in other ways it
added to the Saints experience two major
changes are blinkfeed a persistent
social and news aggregator that resides
on your home screen and the app drawer
which is a paginated vertical grid only
three icons wide there are no quick
toggles located in the notification
shade no lock screen widgets no daydream
mode and recent apps which are accessed
by double tapping the home key is a
heavily customised card view where you
flick application previews upwards to
dismiss or close hmm where have we seen
that before we're not convinced the
changes maiden sensor actually useful
instead they feel more like changes made
for the sake of changing Samsung's
TouchWiz software is certainly more
overbearing than since and changes to
the stock software reach much deeper
into the system such as the tab settings
app and yes many of Samsung's features
are mostly novelties or useless features
added for sales floor marketing but on
the other hand many of those added
features have a purpose the vast
settings toggles in the notification
shade for instance or the quick access
to all downloaded applications in the
app drawer so you can quickly filter out
all built-in applications despite the
odd button layouts there are quick ways
to open Google now on both as well with
the HTC One simply long press the home
button if you're on the home screen you
can simply long press the menu button on
the galaxy mega but if you're already in
an application the quickest way to
access Google now is by long pressing
the home button
and selecting the Google search icon in
the middle at the bottom of the display
at every turn there are conceptual
differences between each devices
software and while it's definitely more
heavily laden than since we have to give
the edge to touch with on the galaxy
mega 6.3 and if you can't come to grips
with the scent software and odor android
firmware on the HTC one it's worth
mentioning that the google edition one
will be available in the near future
running pure stock android for two with
beats audio support when it comes down
to performance the HTC One has a pretty
significant leg up both load
applications switch apps and return home
very quickly thanks to the newest
Snapdragon chipsets and gaming is smooth
on both devices as well but the mega 6.3
is equipped with a Snapdragon 400 a
dual-core chip and the one has the
Snapdragon 600 with four cores though
both are clocked at 1.7 gigahertz
synthetic benchmarks show that the HTC
One is simply more capable in terms of
processing power it can simply handle
more and in 2 to the one managed to
consistently score around 24,000 while
the mega max out at about 13,000 and
averaged around 11,000 and in quadrant
standard the mega maintained a 6000
average to the ones 10,000 average it's
the same story in geek Finch 2 and in
other tests it's to be expected both
devices come in LTE variants but our
units are hspa+ running on AT&amp;amp;T hspa+ in
the Charlotte metro area through several
speed tests both devices averaged around
six megabits per second down and one
megabit per second up though the peak
speed for the one exceeded 7 megabits
per second battery life even with the
power saver mode enabled isn't one of
the HTC one strong suits on better days
we can last most of the day on a single
charge through normal usage but under
heavy usage the battery drops off rather
quickly especially if you crank the
brightness up the galaxy mega is sort of
the same scenario so far but it has a
much larger battery keeping the show
running 900 million powers more to be
exact and that makes a significant
difference for more on the mega 6.3
battery life keep an eye out for the for
review next week finally cameras when it
comes to software the HTC One in galaxy
mega 6.3 share a lot of the same
features the interfaces are quite
different but the end result is the same
a fairly lightweight nimble interface
with a ton of features hidden beneath
the surf
is the one has a nice trick up its
sleeve though Zoe it's a feature that's
enabled within the camera app each time
you press the shutter button it takes a
short video and all the stills and
photos from that brief period are
automatically turned into a relatively
high production video with a generic
sound clip it's truly an awesome feature
in terms of quality despite the low
megapixel count the one wins by a fairly
wide margin the Megas camera isn't
necessarily bad but it seems poorly
optimized it doesn't handle various
situations quite as well as the one for
example autofocus had trouble locking on
a certain things quickly whites were
easily blown out and despite putting out
high-res images the added quality just
isn't there the ones camera is more
balanced and offers more detail
surprisingly and performs better in low
light in other words each of the ones
four million pixels are put to great use
whereas the Megas eight megapixels are
pixel for pixel less efficient these two
devices are clearly stark contrast from
one another in almost every way the mega
is an excessive versatile device aimed
at a small target demographic and it's
also more or less a test device for
samsung in public beta the one is a
make-or-break device from HTC and the
attention to detail shows it's aimed at
a much more broad audience the general
consumer the HTC One overall wins this
battle by a fairly wide margin it's not
that it's necessarily a much better
device but it's certainly more polished
more well-rounded and will appeal to
many more people than a phone that
promises to stretch your pockets however
if the one is simply too small for your
tastes or your hands give the mega 6.3
ago if you may like it but if you're
after something a little more logical
stick with the one if you enjoyed this

before we go we'd like to thank our
friends at negri electronics for lending
us a galaxy mega 6.3 for this comparison
and for the review as always I'm Taylor
Martin and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
