paki now calm and today I'm actually a
new way to change your spb mobile shell
3.0 on your windows mobile device so the
whole thing that this program is
actually add skins and different icons
as well as gives you another button on
the bottom for a weather so we'll just
go into this right now and the first
thing you'll notice is the professional
layout and I thought as few things have
changed so you can choose many different
options on this program so I've changed
the skin on the background and it also
changed different icons on the front if
I go to the right or left it will bring
me to another screen that looks kind of
similar to touch for 3d it gives us a
tee a large clock on the top as well as
our calendar and our notifications as
well as our favorites so if we go we can
continue going from the right to the
left and it will continue to bring us to
the professional ordered a a touch flo
3d mimicked screen so if but if we go
back it'll bring us to the lifestyle
Leah which is Kennedy and if you notice
this clock this is a glass clock and the
program allows you to have different
widgets so that's also nice we'll just
scroll over so you can see that it still
has these same lifestyle properties as
before so you can also have the kinetic
scrolling as well so does nice and the
next one so the cool thing about this is
before spb mobile shell 3.0 didn't have
a little weather icon in the middle so
we can actually pick here to this
umbrella and it will take us to the
weather and it gives us a five-day
forecast just like before except the
icons have changed and I'll show you how
to change those and when we get into the
actual settings of the program so click
down here to bring us to our carousel
view is the same carousel view we can
also switch between tiles so as you can
see we have the same tile so go into SPD
menu it gives us different icons and
these are some of the customized icons
that are in the in the program that I'll
show you so we'll go into tools and as
you can see you can change your theme of
course but it also has this spb skins
4.0 and we're going to
and change some of them right now so
there so there are two different styles
that this program comes with and you can
download more from the website so we're
just going to go into the car oh and
we're just going to pick one of these
let's see something simple how about
this one greenleaf okay there we go and
now it's going to load the customized
screen so if we want to change any other
options we can do that so just go into
okay so from this screen we can pick our
launcher button style so I'm going to
just pick spectrum there's so many
different customizable combinations that
you can choose from so we say okay load
that if I want to pick the launcher
button style to let's say I want the
omnia and click on that okay I'll just
continue to go through the settings so
just pick some more tricolor multicolor
like that one that's kind of neat looks
like the iphone this allows you when
we're on the widgets area allows you to
give a analog clock so if I want to pick
one and I had the glass clock so let's
pick a different one today and let's try
this a go black okay digital clock style
so that's the one that's kind of on the
touchflo 3d mimicked screen so I'm just
going to pick LED and ok and weather
icons this is pretty cool like I showed
you in the weather icons you can pick
different weather Ike so after all the
settings are implemented it'll actually
bring us back to our today's screen and
we'll let go to SB be home ok and here
we are and as you can see on the bottom
some of the icons have changed so that's
neat we will go up or down to bring us
to our professional layout and our icons
are the same I I like those multi
colored icons account with the iphone it
also gives us the same background that
we paid let's lose the leaf and we can
scroll over to the touchflo 3d style
screen we have her favorites button down
here so that's also a neat feature if
you have favorite programs that you want
to go into you can do that or just go
back and if you look up here a tech and
if you look up here it actually gives us
a connection wizard so we can change the
bluetooth on bluetooth off Wi-Fi on
Wi-Fi off all that great stuff so I'll
just go back so that is the spb skins
4.0 the program is free but it's quite
large so you need a memory card and i
will put
Linkin Park another comments on how to
