questions about our favorite devices our
favorite apps and games and even about
our personal lives the pocket now
insider series is a way for us to answer
those questions I'm Taylor Martin this
is pocket now and these are my top apps
for Android and iOS each time I set up a
new phone I go through the same ritual
of downloading dozens of applications I
rely on but of all the applications that
download each time there are only a
handful I wouldn't want to go without
these are my must have applications on
both Android and iOS
on Android my needs are pretty simple
action launcher is my saving grace when
using since or touch with devices and
it's even my go to launch our when using
the stock or near stock Android phones
unlike most launchers the application
drawer is an alphabetical list of all
apps accessed by swiping right word from
the left side of the display one of my
favorite features is covers or an icon
which acts like an icon when tapped but
reveals the contents of the folder
underneath when swiped upwards in
version 2 point 0 which went live
earlier today there is also a quick page
which allows widgets and apps shortcuts
to be open from within any app by a
swipe from the right side of the display
the application drawer can also be open
to top any application the developer
chris lacy continues to make this the
most intriguing an impressive
replacement launcher out there after
using samsung devices for a while
there's always one feature i miss from
samsung's custom keyboard the clipboard
it's a feature all Android devices
should have as i find myself copying and
pasting quite a bit clipper plus is the
best solution I've come across yet
anything you copy immediately gets saved
to your clipboard within clipper it
remains persistent in your notification
shade if you need to access something
you've recently copied pull down the
shade tap the clipper plus notification
and it brings you to your most recent
clippings tapping one will instantly
copy the text and return you to the
previous application from there simply
paste it's super easy with several
settings to tweak to your liking it
comes in a free version but if you want
the cloud sync across multiple devices
and access to more clippings you'll need
to upgrade to clipper plus for 199 for
someone who uses multiple devices cloud
sync is a must-have feature even for the
simple things like an alarm clock that's
why timely is such an incredible yet
simple app it's a beautiful application
with a timer stopwatch and alarm clock
within the application I can enable or
disable all alarms on all of my sink two
devices there are tons of customization
options as well as a broad selection of
alarm sounds hands down it's one of the
best alarm clock apps around
I couldn't possibly make a video about
my top apps without mentioning dashclock
most of you know by now that it's a free
widget with an ever-growing list of
extensions I've made a couple videos on
dashclock already so check those out for
a more in-depth look at the widget
my top apps on iOS are a bit more
specific and unique I've already said I
do a lot of copying and pasting one of
my least favorite things however is
having to paste ugly long URLs from
mobile the bitly app for iOS helps solve
that problem it gives me access to all
of my previously shortened links as well
as the ability to shorten new links on
the fly what the app can do is pretty
limited but I can track link analytics
and manage all of my shortened links
fairly easily twitter is a big part of
my daily routine and on iOS there is
only one client I bother with tweetbot 3
it was recently updated with iOS 7
support and a new UI as expected is
packed with all the same features as
before link shortening through user
definable services several read later
services and various options for picture
and video uploading it's smooth and
polished and has one of the cleanest you
is now with a light or dark theme
frankly this is the Twitter client to
beat and it's well worth the 299 price
tag
I'm also an avid user of if this than
that and I was dying for a mobile
application to be released until earlier
this year now I can edit and create
recipes straight from my iphone I have
things like weather updates that push to
my pebble through push over on Android
or SMS notifications for Instagram
uploads on accounts I need to follow if
this then that is an awesome automation
utility and the ability to use it from
my phone is irreplaceable Calendar apps
are a dime a dozen but fantastical to is
something special from the UI navigation
to the creation of calendar entries
fantastical makes going back to the
run-of-the-mill calendar app quite
difficult why natural language event
creation type things like go to the
grocery store tomorrow at three for an
hour and it will create an event titled
go to the grocery store dated for the
following day from 3 to 4 p.m. it's
honestly incredible
the following applications are on both
Android and iOS and most of them are
fairly well known by now pocket for
example is simply my choice in read
later applications the UI is gorgeous
and it's widely supported across all the
platforms I use iOS and Android tablets
phones chrome Mac etc save things to
pocket and read them offline later it's
straightforward simple and necessary the
same goes for hangouts it's simply my
preferred method of contact these days
it's available on Chrome Android and iOS
and I use it religiously every single
day from multiple devices I use feedly
to browse RSS feeds what i've read is
synced across all of my devices and my
computer from within feedly I share to
my buffer account which allows me to
share links and various content on a
predefined schedule there is also a
buffer app for Android and iOS which
allows you to manage what's in your
buffer your schedule etc buffer is an
absolute must when you're managing
multiple social accounts it's something
I simply can't live without
