pocket now calm today is a day that I've
been waiting for for about 11 months now
well actually about 23 months because
the iphone 4s really didn't do much for
me it wasn't that exciting i was bored
by it very quickly it was just an
iteration from my iphone4 today Apple
announced a relatively big leap from the
iphone 4s the iphone 5 and in this video
i want to tell you what I hate about it
and what I love about it let's get to it
so I'm going to group this into two
parts what I love and what I hate what I
love about the new iphone and by the way
isn't it hilarious or amazing or I don't
even know what the word is that we saw
this phone many many months ago we
started to see the front panels of the
phone the back panels of the phone the
interior of the phone some people went
so far as to make a real-life mock up on
the verge there was a video of the
iphone 5 and it was the exact same
iphone 5 that we saw today Apple
obviously is a major problem with
keeping their secrets secret and their
suppliers are letting things leak way
too early and it's really disappointing
because we already saw the iphone 5 we
were hoping on pocket now that hopefully
there would be a different design and
what we were seeing was kind of a hoax
and a trick by Apple but that wasn't the
case the leaks turned out to be true so
here's what i love about the iphone 5 to
get back to what i was saying i love
that the iphone 5 is an iteration in
every way of the iphone 4s literally
every single specification and parameter
has been bumped up a notch for example
the design is improved no longer is
there glass on the back just glass on
the front and that was really annoying
to have glass on the back because you
drop your phone you have two times the
chance of cracking something now with
metal on the back you might scar the
metal or you might scratch them and what
you're not going to crack the meadow so
your phone is a little bit more safe and
secure especially if you don't use a
case another thing i love about the
upgraded iphone 4s technically is that
it's got a bigger screen the iphone 5
now has a 4-inch screen and when Apple
keenly did is that they didn't make the
with a big bigger of the phone
made it taller so what you get is the
same size keyboard and now when the
keyboards open you get to see more
screen elements at one time which is
fantastic they've bumped the screen
resolution to 1136 down x 640 across
crazy screen resolution but they kept
the retina 326 ppi pixel density to be
able to have that really clear screen
and interestingly what they're doing
with old legacy apps that aren't
upgraded to fit the bigger screen is
that they're putting it the app in the
center of the screen and putting black
bars on the top and the bottom a
reasonable compromise it's going to be
annoying for a while until we get the
upgraded apps but as we learned with the
ipad retina display update and the
iphone 3gs to the four it'll take about
four or five weeks and everything major
will be upgraded the new iphone 5 is LTE
anyone could have predicted that it
should have LTE all the newer Android
phones and LTE the windows phones have
LTE it's not that big of a deal it has a
new a6 processor which apple claims to
have two times the performance of the
forest and the 4s is a pretty fast phone
it does slow down at times the galaxy s3
beats the 4s the 1x beats the 4s so we
really needed to see a processor spec
bump in order to compete with the
high-end Android smartphones that are
out there we don't know if the a6 is
quad core or dual core we'll find out
soon but what matters is that it's
faster which is great another thing
that's been bumped up above the 4 s's
battery life it's got better battery
life than the 4s that's predictable once
again just the way things should be with
each passing generation of technological
device things should get better battery
life chief among them another thing that
they did is they made the camera better
but not by that much they add a lot of
little technologies they didn't increase
the number of megapixels it's still at
eight megapixels but I guess that's to
be expected it's not about the number of
megapixels it's about the quality of the
photo so there's better low-light
performance there's panorama mode and
some other cool stuff which will
hopefully make what I think the was the
best camera phone ever the iphone 4s
overshadowed by the iphone 5 hopefully
the pictures are just as good here's a
little innovation that i love that
I really didn't predict it has three
microphones got one on the earpiece one
on the bottom for calls and one on the
back so it really helps to take good
audio with video and finally some really
cool enhancements to call features it's
got a why it has wideband audio which
has to be supported by the carrier to be
able to allow you to hear lower
frequencies and higher frequencies
because right now everything is kind of
in the middle when you make a phone call
it sounds like AM radio with wideband
audio it's getting a little bit closer I
guess to FM radio where you can hear a
little bit more of a dynamic range also
another change that they made the iphone
4 has a great noise cancellation when
you would talk into it and now the
iPhone 5 is noise cancellation through
the earpiece so we will listen to the
ambient noise if you're in a loud bar
and it will change the audio output
based on your environment which is
fantastic so that's what I love about
the iphone 5 i love that literally they
went through every box of the iphone for
us and made everything better albeit a
lot of things were predictable here and
that's what i really don't like about
the iphone 5 what I hate about the
iphone for us is that everything that i
just talked about with the exception of
a couple things were predictable if you
and your friends got in a room and SAT
there for five hours four hours whatever
and tried to think about how to make the
iphone five what you would put in it you
could figure out exactly what Apple did
they upgraded the camera they made a
foot LTE in there better battery life
bigger screen Apple has stopped
surprising us which is something that's
very upsetting to to a technology
enthusiast such as myself it seems that
Apple is more so interested in selling
Hardware now than they are in making
innovation happen and pushing the
industry forward so there's no doubt
about it that the iPhone 5 is going to
be an awesome phone it's the sum of a
lot of great parts and it's going to be
one of the best smartphones for the next
12 months problem is there's already a
lot of competition out there the galaxy
s3 as a higher resolution screen the One
X has a higher resolution screen the
Lumia 920 is a higher resolution screen
and you could go on and on the droid
razr HD Max's much much better battery
life more than ever there are phones out
there that already compete with the
iphone 5 it's not the kind of thing
where the iPhone 5 is years ahead of the
competitors that's just not the case
that said I'm looking forward to using
the iphone 5 I think is going to be a
great package has a lot of great
features just an all around good phone
for people that just want an awesome
experience anyway enough rambling what
do you think about the iphone 5 what do
you love and what do you hate please
leave a comment and let us know and we
have a lot more iphone 5 coverage coming
up soon and of course a full review tons
of comparisons and all that good stuff
coming up as soon as that guy starts
shipping that's it for now thanks for
