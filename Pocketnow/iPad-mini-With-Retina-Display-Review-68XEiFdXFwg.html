smaller tablet the iPad Mini it
admittedly wasn't its best work but this
year it's upgrading the iPad Mini with a
Retina display and better internals is
it worth the upgrade or the extra cash
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is our full review of the Apple
iPad Mini with Retina display externally
the iPad Mini looks virtually identical
to its predecessor it bears the same
exact design and it's even the same
width and height however it is
marginally thicker and heftier 0.3
millimeter sticker in about 23 grams
more we assume to accommodate for the
new display and larger battery the
speakers Lightning port camera placement
and every last external detail has been
left untouched with the exception of one
thing an additional microphone on the
back side near the top edge as far as
hardware concerns go there's practically
nothing to complain about the new iPad
Mini is unbelievably thin lightweight
and fills as premium as any other
high-end tablet out there but what about
its internals those aren't half bad
either if you recall the specifications
from our iPad air review the new iPad
Mini spec sheet is practically a
duplicate of its larger siblings it
features the same a 7 chipset which is
composed of a 1.3 gigahertz dual-core
CPU with a quad core GPU one gigabyte of
RAM a 5 megapixel rear camera 1.2
megapixel front shooter and 4 storage
options 16 32 64 and 128 gigabytes the
battery keeping the show running is
rated at 23.8 watt hours and finally the
resolution of its 7.9 inch display has
been improved from 1024 by 768 pixels to
2048 by 1536 pixels quadruple the
resolution or double the density at 324
pixels per inch the Retina display is
leaps and bounds better than last year's
iPad Mini display which was noticeably
washed out pixelated and subpar in many
ways this time around the display is
incredibly sharp colors could pop a
little more but the contrast is passable
and black levels are fairly inky beside
the larger iPad air however it's easy to
see the display is not quite as
saturated that's not to say the iPad
minis Retina display is bad by no means
is it but can
parrot of Lee speaking it's clear to see
the color simply aren't as vibrant as
you may be used to seeing if you're
coming from a full-sized iPad the iPad
Mini is the most well built high-end
tablet under 8 inches period of course
it comes running the very latest
software from Apple iOS 7 we've covered
iOS 7 extensively in previous reviews
and walkthroughs so we won't waste too
much time here we will say however that
the software is very fitting on this
tablet more so than the full-sized iPad
air there are a lot of ways iOS could be
further improved such as a split screen
view for simultaneous use of 2 apps or
more but the new interface is refreshing
the multi-touch gestures make
task-switching incredibly fast and
intuitive and the amount of content
available is practically endless there
are literally hundreds of thousands of
applications made for iPads as well as
countless books movies television shows
games magazines and other content which
more to make up for the shortcomings of
iOS all the improvements of iOS 7 are
welcomed
but with competition like the Galaxy
Note series which allows for true
multitasking it's clear Apple cannot
rest on its laurels unlike the previous
model which was clearly underpowered the
performance on the iPad Mini with Retina
display is buttery smooth like we found
with the iPad air in iPhone 5s reviews
the a7 chip on the iPad Mini is powerful
the dual-core CPU and the quad-core GPU
make the new mini markedly better than
its predecessor for gaming and other
graphic intensive stuff such as
multimedia playback and constant task
switching it's quick at just about
everything you throw at it and its
performance in various benchmarks was
exactly what we expected comparable to
the iPad air speaker quality is passable
but we have some issues with primarily
the location of the speaker this as with
the air is questionable unlike many
other tablets which offer two stereo
output which is great for multimedia
playback without headphones yeah I've
had many speakers are divided around the
Lightning port in landscapes this makes
it incredibly easy to muffle set
speakers to the palm of Japan and even
when you're not muffling the speaker's
the sound is unbalanced and comes from
only one side of the tablet this is
still one of those sore points in the
minis design battery life on the other
hand is
eight the increased display resolution
and power called for a larger battery
which Apple increased from sixteen point
three to twenty three point eight watt
hours as per usual
Apple claims the iPad Mini will survive
ten hours of usage and in our testing we
can confirm the battery life on the iPad
Mini with Retina display is as great as
ever we only had to charge the new iPad
Mini every other day even through days
of unusually heavy usage gaming
benchmarking multitasking web browsing
and much more it is possible to fully
drain the battery in a single day but it
takes intent most will survive a day and
a half with no problem the camera on the
new iPad Mini isn't terrible the rear
image sensor offers a max resolution of
5 megapixels in great lighting
conditions it provides passable images
which unfortunately offer more noise and
artifacts than most recent high-end
smartphones will still have low contrast
they're often dull and then often err on
the warm side and the camera is quick to
overexpose and the dynamic range could
certainly be better video quality on the
other hand is great colors are more true
to life and the audio is decent though
pans are a bit on the jittery side in
all the iPad Mini with Retina display is
everything we wanted in a remake of the
original the only factors we can even
begin to complain about other slightly
washed out display the speaker location
and price truthfully to complain about
the display is pedantic it's super sharp
and we only notice the difference in
saturation when it was beside other
tablets the speaker placement is also a
minor issue and starting at $400 in
climbing $100 per capacity model and
another $130 for LTE connectivity the
price isn't terrible after all this
miniature tablet features the same exact
specifications as the iPad air and it's
base price is $100 cheaper frankly we
think the iPad Mini with Retina display
is great and for that we give it a 9
point 2 out of 10
