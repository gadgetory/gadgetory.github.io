one-year upgrade is increasingly
becoming a tricky recommendation for any
manufacturer Apple has introduced some
novel features not found before on
previous iPhones but is that enough to
motivate you to part with your cash here
are four reasons for upgrading from an
iPhone 6s to the iPhone 7 and 3
arguments against first up a little
housekeeping you can pause the video
here to see which specs have been
improved moving from the 6s to the 7 now
what's hot water resistance having a
proper rating of ip67 definitely
delivers some peace of mind for folks
who might be inclined to drop their
phones into some sort of body of water
stereo speakers as an evolved primate
living on this planet it's statistically
likely that you listen to the world
around you through some balance of
having two ears providing two speakers
on the iPhone 7 should better satisfy
that stereo listening experience the
improved camera okay so in daylight the
differences aren't earth-shattering but
the wider aperture and hardware image
stabilization on the iPhone 7 certainly
helps deliver better photos and videos
over last year's iPhone 6s especially in
lower light situations you want the one
with more jeebies we're all very happy
to see the 16 gigabyte iPhone is finally
dead
but even folks who opted to buy an
iPhone with more storage those
additional storage tears deliver a lot
more bang for your buck so what's not
hot headphone audio sure the speaker's
got better but Apple's courageous move
to eliminate the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack results in a cumbersome
set of solutions out of the box the ear
pods and headphone adapter deliver ever
so slightly lower audio quality and it's
up to the consumer to keep track of this
fiddly little thing plus the ear pods in
the box no longer work with anything
else other than iPhones and iPads
sorry macbook users to improve the
convenience or the audio quality
requires the user to buy additional
expensive accessories on top of the
purchase price of one of the most
expensive phones of the year
that battery life sure the battery got
bigger but so did the phone's horsepower
and almost all of our testing the iPhone
7 fell slightly behind the iPhone 6s and
our 6s has a one year old battery we're
not expecting this year's smaller iPhone
to be remembered as a battery champ a
disease will call the sameness and why
increase the CPU core count when so much
of this phone is the same as last year's
same overall dimensions and design as
the iPhone 6 same screen resolution same
RAM even updating to iOS 10 last year's
iPhone 6s doesn't feel that far behind
for performance while Apple is the most
successful company on the planet in
converting geeky tech stuff into
lifestyle accessories even with new
black color options this year the iPhone
7 just doesn't feel like the fashion
Vanguard this brand once represented
let's wrap this up there you have it
folks
four reasons for and three reasons
against the one year upgrade do you
think the iPhone 7 brings it up to the
table for Apple fans to consider
