pocketnow.com and today we're going to
route the HTC EVO 4G using this tool
right here which is called Unruh vocht
and you can use that tool by going to n
revoke com
so today's gonna be an experiment on
rooting the HTC EVO and seeing if this
tool actually works the way it promises
let's go ahead and get started alright
and we are back and as you can see we
are here on an revoked comm and they
have these five main phones on their
home screen all of which use HTC Sense
so because we're going to be using the
HTC EVO 4G we're going to head and click
on this icon here and now it gives us
the option to download the actual route
Andrew flesh as you can see here it's
painless so if you want to route your
device but you're not too comfortable
with doing all the modifying this seems
to be a good tool for you so we're gonna
click here now are using a Mac to do
this however you can use as you see the
Mac as well as lytx and window so it
supports the three major platforms we're
gonna go ahead and download the Mac
version alright and we now have the
Unruh Vokes
tool open on our screen and as you can
see here it's telling us that it's a
painless route and reflash and it's
telling us to basically when the
bootloader restarts you press the volume
down button to the Aged boot USB option
and then press power and it's going to
use the recovery image of clockworkmod
so as you can see we've now plugged in
our HTC EVO here and hopefully you can
see this and we're going to select the
option for HTC Sync which is basically
going to mount this as a USB device can
you see we are now connecting
what this is now going to do is actually
automatically connect to revoked alright
now what's happened and the image
flashed very quickly it was tough to see
it but it actually gave us an image here
saying that it was pushing the reef
flasher so we've automatically open up
to the boot screen now we want to go
down to the H boot USB option so to do
that we're going to use the volume down
button as you can see right there and
now we're going to press the power
button to actually select it now we've
actually gone ahead and selected that
option it will take a little bit for it
to actually click in and now you can see
waiting for H boot to be ready running
pre boot sequence all on a none revoke
so again this is very similar to
jailbreaking your iPhone with a spirit
tool or a quick polling tool as you can
see here it's rebooting the HTC EVO
while it's also telling us waiting for a
reboot alright and now we're getting the
message that it's rebooting into
recovery on the Unruh VOC tool as you
can see we're just getting the blank
screen here so that is normal waiting
for device so now it's going to
initialize the device again on the
recovery image this time and I'm trying
to show you both at once just so you can
kind of see how they're working in
unison here and no it's a little tough
to see but now let's say what waiting
for the device and there's the recovery
itself actually showing up and now it's
saying done so now we are good to go
we are fully rooted I have these super
user privileges here as you can see in
terms of applying these updates wiping
installing zips from the SD card
nandroid partitioning etc etc alright
just to confirm that we do in fact have
Super User permissions here as you can
see going into the menu we have Super
User permissions which will allow you to
enable access to certain programs that
require route from the market and other
applications itself so once again this
has been the Unruh vocht
way to route your HTC EVO give us a
thumbs up for risking our phone here hey
les will give us a thumbs up if you just
liked this video please leave a comment
and of course stay tuned for more thanks
