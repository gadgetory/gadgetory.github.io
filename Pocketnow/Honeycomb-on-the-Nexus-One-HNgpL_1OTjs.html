and a little while ago I showed you
honey comb or what looked like honeycomb
running on my android powered g2 now it
really wasn't honeycomb it was just a
theme and a bunch of customizations but
it looked somewhat convincing this time
it's the real deal it's honeycomb
running on a nexus one let's go take a
look ok so this is a t-mobile nexus one
what I've done is I went through and I
backed up everything so that when i'm
done with this process i can restore it
after that then i did a complete wipe
and factory reset and then i flashed the
sdk rom from XDA developers for
honeycomb now you can find a link to
that over in the article at
pocketnow.com but what i'm going to do
now is reboot the system so i can show
you the first boot goes through it says
rebooting we get the standard nexus one
boot screen shows that i have it
unlocked this part usually takes about
15 seconds then after that we're going
to be into a first boot now remember
first boots take longer than normal
boots and this is just a basically a
port from the SDK the software
developers kit over to the nexus one
it's so alpha they did not even publish
a list of things that they know isn't
working that's how not working it is
they're calling it an alpha but it
really is just a proof of concept so we
have the old-fashioned the Android boot
animation way back from the what was
that the one point six days where we
just have an Android word with the nice
glossy animation scrolling across it now
it's going to do that for a few minutes
and then we're going to come up into the
honeycomb desktop ok and a lot faster
than I thought it would be here we are
at the desktop is still painting the
widgets on to it but you can see we've
got a very small google search apps you
plus sign and all of your tablet stuff
let me see if I can zoom in a little bit
so you can see this a little bit closer
up in the corner over there get a nice
reflection of the camera there but you
can tell that this actually is honeycomb
although not all that usable on a nexus
one so let's go ahead and look at apps
and here are our apps somewhat obvious
you can't see them all see if I can get
this to rotate into landscape and looks
like it's not going to do that for us
but there's our apps we can't see them
all we can kind of see if we can scroll
a little bit here and it's not letting
this scroll go back home here's our
google search will tap on that i had a
nice little highlight there and now i
have the google search box with a really
funky looking keyboard now of course
this keyboard is optimized for tablets
which generally speaking are bigger than
smartphones so the keyboard is kind of
all squished together but we can see
this kind of hard to type with my left
hand and with the very skinny keys here
but anyway I can see how that works
let's see what else we have so there's
our task manager with our search box
down to the bottom see if we can open a
couple more apps and see what we have
calculators always a good one a little
bit slow on responsiveness but that's
kind of to be expected a little bit off
on the text layout there again just due
to the space constraints of the screen
but now when we go back home and back to
our task list now we've got search and
we've got calculator as well so really
nice i like this glow I like the
the way that it's presenting the the
recently used applications just looks
very elegant with the glow behind it
let's see what else we can do here got a
clock down their way down in the bottom
I don't know if you can even see that so
let me see what else I can find I'll be
right back I fired up the music player
and unfortunately this is the it looks
like the traditional music player not
the new honeycomb version that we've
seen recently but I do want to show you
the volume slider so up on top you can
see that nice dialog box with a glow
around it just a very subtle glow and
your volume up and down now of course
you're not hearing anything it's because
audio isn't working on this like a lot
of stuff an awful lot of stuff isn't
working on this but it's really kind of
cool to see what is here and what's
available and what it could look like to
actually run a tablet OS on your
smartphone and you can see it is very
very doable here one thing that they've
added that didn't come included in the
SDK is the file manager that comes with
cyanogenmod roms so you can go down here
and look at the contents of your of your
device in your SD card you'll notice
just like with Gingerbread we've got the
little hater at the top pulse and glow
with the orange color there that's
probably a carryover from gingerbread
rather than honeycomb if we can go back
home I'll see what else I can dig up
alright last thing I'd like to show you
is that dropping widgets on the screen
you see I have already done one of those
with my music player widgets so we come
over here and hit the plus sign in the
top right corner and you can see we've
got all these different things we can do
we've got widgets we can add apps
shortcuts wallpapers and more it's kind
of a little choppy here but that's kind
of to be expected so let's go ahead and
select the analog clock
and now it's should be over on that
screen and we can tap on it tap and hold
just like we are accustomed to i believe
and just drag it down to wherever we
want it to go now you'll notice I've got
a little grid of plus signs and that
grid helps me know where i can drop
widgets what's available what space is
available to to be able to drop
something so there's an improvement
there wallpapers function very much the
same so we don't have too many of those
let's see if we can go into a live
wallpaper and it says no live wallpapers
were found so we'll cancel that we go
into gallery looks like it doesn't come
with the the stock ones but anyway kind
of nice to see what honeycomb could look
like running on a smartphone in this
case it's actually honeycomb running on
smartphone not ready for you to use yet
but if you want to impress your friends
and show off what you can do and what
Google said they wouldn't do and other
said couldn't be done because it's just
a different thing completely different
beast tablets versus you know
smartphones I mean very very different
beast need to see what you can do so if
you want to go ahead and give this a try
head over to pocketnow.com look up the
article that's going to be entitled
honeycomb running on nexus one something
to that effect make sure if you like
this kind of video that you give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to our video
channel so that you don't miss out on
the cool next stuff these guys are going
to be doing a lot more development and
they might even get something that's
functional unusable as a daily driver on
the Nexus One and we've seen it on some
other devices as well so who knows we
might actually get a honeycomb build for
various devices before well before most
devices get gingerbread on them anyway
fun things to think about showing off
honeycomb for real this time on the
google nexus one for pocket now i'm joe
levi hey guys just when you thought it
was over there's one more thing and i
didn't see this when I was shooting so i
want to show you now this is the phone
turned off or in a
sleep mode let's go ahead and turn it on
and you can see now here the honeycomb
lock screen with the neat time and date
up on the top little lock and if we grab
on to this and pull it and see we get
this little ripple effect we can pull
that lock right outside and there we go
we're at the desktop again now a little
bit more that's on that screen if we
turn it back on down here at the bottom
says there's no internet connection
that's no Wi-Fi that's no hspa+ HSPA
edge you've got nothing it's this phone
is no longer a phone it doesn't do
anything for you but then again it's not
supposed to this is just a demo to show
that the SDK can be ported to run over
on smartphones the OS does run and now
it's a matter of getting drivers and
configurations to work anyway I want it
to come back in and show you that cool
lock screen before I sent you away
thought you might like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
