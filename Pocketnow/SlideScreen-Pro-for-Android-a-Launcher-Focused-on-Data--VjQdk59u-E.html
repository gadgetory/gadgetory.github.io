one of the things I really like showing
you about Android is how you can
customize it and one of the main ways to
do that is with alternate launchers or
home screens well today I've got a home
screen that reminds me of something I
saw way back in my Newton days called a
life string
it's called slide screen let's go take a
look okay to start with what is a life
stream well a live stream is a concept
wherein the information that is most
relevant to you is displayed first and
foremost in your graphical user
environment now the way that I saw this
was very very sketchy it was just a
concept really didn't even function it
was more just a demo than anything but
what was trying to convey in the way
that it worked was really revolutionary
and I haven't seen it ever since
so what am I talking about well imagine
if you will you have a cascading card
deck and on those cards one of us is the
is in the front you've got a whole bunch
behind them and some others that aren't
quite in the front yet and if you put
that on a timeline the one that's in the
front is what you're working on right
now or what is most relevant to you
right now as you go back through the
deck you get stuff that you've worked on
in the past and as you scroll forward
through the deck you get stuff that you
haven't started working on yet that's
scheduled to be worked on so okay that's
all very abstract let's do real-world
stuff so let's say I'm at work and I'm
writing a Word document
well in that front card is or that front
window to borrow a term from Microsoft
and Apple is my work doc and I can fill
that up to the full screen just like you
can today but when I restore it back
down or minimize it back down it goes
into the front card and if I want to see
the excel sheet that I was working on
just a few minutes ago I can scroll back
to the previous card oh and before that
there was an email and before that there
was a
PowerPoint presentation and before that
there was a website and I can scroll
back and forth and back and forth as I
get new emails they come up into the
deck
now why is that important why is that
revolutionary well right now we've
actually gone through a few iterations
of how we get to data how we work with
stuff not just on phones but on
computers so for example if I want to
work on a Word document
back in the early Windows days I had to
find Word open it find my document and
then open it
well that's made progress with file
associations and whatnot where now
instead of first opening word and then
opening the document now I can actually
look for the document open it and it
knows that it's a Word document so it
uses word or maybe it's a PDF or maybe
it's an Excel spreadsheet it will open
the app than it needs to to be able to
interact with that information so
instead of being programmed centric now
it's information centric and that's
really the concept behind these live
streams now instead of being content
centric now it's timeline centric and
the stuff that is most relevant to you
is closest to the middle of that deck
and the stuff that's not is further away
from the deck all right you with me so
far now like I said I have not seen that
concept applied in practice since way
back when I had my Newton message
pattern actually it was in the early
days of that it was a 130 not even my my
twenty one or twenty two hundred but
back to this this app is the closest
thing that I have seen to actually
realizing that concept where you have
kind of a deck of information now what
do I mean by that well if we look in
here right in the middle we have our day
date and time we have our wireless
status in this case you can see I'm
connected to Wi-Fi I have a relatively
poor signal strength and I even have my
time of day over on the other side of
that I've got my current weather
conditions and yes it looks like I'm
shooting this in the middle of the night
because the Sun hasn't come up yet but
it also shows me my temp
and the the weather conditions so all of
my pertinent information right there
right in the middle and then as I fan
out from that I have personal
information at the top and I have more
peripherally important information at
the bottom so I'm not really a true
cascade like I was telling you about
before with the live stream but still
very interesting and very unique and
very useful so let's go up to the top
here first of all well before we do that
you'll notice we don't have any widgets
or rather we don't have the ability to
plug in any third-party widgets rather
all we have is what comes with the app
which is kind of limiting but it's still
kind of nice because it's relatively
thoroughly thought out and has a lot of
the stuff that you'd want to add onto
the screen with widget city and weather
forecasts big clocks Facebook stocks
Twitter you know all kinds of stuff ok
so let's go back up to the top up at the
top we have phone calls missed phone
calls voice messages and whatnot right
there and it'll show up with a little
indicator like on my calendar we've got
email next one down and I just read on
my email before shooting this video
calendar items says I've got three
upcoming events and it shows me them and
over on the other side you'll notice
that they're all color-coded so I can
see at a glance what kind of information
that is if I want to go into this
information simply tap on it and then
I'm presented with the default Android
of view so that's all very nice and very
very familiar so moving down to the
bottom we have information and this is
information not necessarily about me or
direct interactions with me but about
stuff that I'm interested in in this
case I've got some articles I've got
some Facebook I've got some stock quotes
let's see stock quotes and again they're
color-coded CF industries right now is
down 301 take a look at that and it says
hey this is a whole bunch of CF symbols
so which one do you mean well I mean see
if industries Holdings Inc and if you
take a look this is where I bought into
it I sold when I got about there and
it's since then tanked and been climbing
a little bit some wild activity but this
is just you know your normal Google
Finance app
it does really nice it does what it's
supposed to do so not bad there but that
information is right there pulls it out
of my portfolio and it presents it to me
on the screen complete with you know not
just the price and you know whether it's
up or down it also has an iconic already
stocked quote it has that color coding
on the other side and then of course
it's got more information in this case
it's got a volume indicator to show you
what the trading volume has been and I
really really really like that it's
subtle it's simple but it shows you more
information but this isn't about stocks
let's go on and take a look over here we
have a Facebook post we'll tap on that
this is still an interface that's inside
the app rather than taking into the
Facebook interface which is nice it
keeps you there it keeps that
information local so then if you want to
act on that you can go further but if
you're just looking informational II you
can look at it right there so very
nicely done but I can't see everything
for example maybe some of that stuff
isn't important so I can grab that
middle bar and move it up and now I just
have my calendar stuff or rather I have
what I currently have alerts on up at
the top and if I need more room I can
scoot that down just like that and vice
versa if I want just my information now
I can come down in here and it provides
an information screen that's just
infinitely scrolling so very very cool
and you know like I showed you before
you can then dive right into those and
do all kinds of fun stuff now is there
much more that you can do well not
really
let's take a look we have three buttons
down at the bottom that we can get into
by hitting the Menu key we've got help
we've got phone settings and home
settings phone settings is what you'd
expect it's the standard Android phone
settings home settings on the other hand
is just preferences orientations whether
you or not you want the status bar
because you don't really need it because
you've got it all in that center bar and
then of course how you can set up your
whether your Facebook stocks calendar
Google Reader Gmail Twitter all that
stuff so kind of neat there now you
might be thinking that's great Joe but
how do I launch any apps from this thing
well that's a very good question
and I will show you that coming right up
all right so I've been using this as my
launcher for the last couple weeks
and this morning I actually switched it
back to launcher Pro and I forgot to set
it back to slide screen so I went ahead
and did that and now you'll notice when
I hit menu the behaviors a little bit
different instead of pulling up that
menu which you can still get to by
hitting menu again but instead of doing
that what it does is it pulls up your
launcher and it's divided into two parts
you see that up on the top it's kind of
gray it brings up your notification bar
status bar at the very top which is
optional on the home screen and then
it's got your apps down in the bottom
now the way this is divided is really
nice up in the top I've got my most
frequently or my most commonly used apps
the ones that I want to have ready
access to and I have manually placed
them up there and in the bottom is my
whole drawer worth of apps all bazillion
of them but on the top I can scroll to
the side either way and just wrap around
it shows me a little indicator here that
says you know this is what panel you're
on if I want to add a new icon up here
to to my quick launcher what I need to
do let's say I want to do bump so tap
and hold on that and you'll notice
everything else is grayed out and up on
the top now these little guys are
wiggling around so I'm gonna go ahead
and put this right here next to shop
savvy and there you go
I've dropped it on there it's right
there it's easy to access the launcher
here the app launcher the app tray is
just very very well thought-out it's
simple its elegant and I'm still back
with my information which really is the
most important part of the phone in my
opinion it's right there it's right on
screen it's at a glance this is the
natural evolution of Microsoft's today
screen from the Windows Mobile days so
really impressed with it I'd still like
to see a real life stream launcher app
that I could get into and use that that
functions like a true a true stream of
data rather than something like this but
I'm sure that's that's something one of
you guys hopefully if you're watching an
in development developer can
can bill for me in any event this is the
pro version of the app it is not free
I'm not going to tell you prices on this
it's not all that much because prices
have been fluctuating quite a bit there
is a free version of the app that has a
an ad down here at the bottom is the
last item which really takes up quite a
bit of real estate when you're talking
about information on the screen but it's
so radical I highly recommend that you
go out and grab that and try it and see
if you like it it's gonna take you at
least a couple days of using it
exclusively before you're gonna get a
taste for it and it's not something
that's going to be easy to get used to
because it is such a divergence from
from your traditional launcher screens
so go ahead and give it a try
I want to know and just a side note up
here I'll mention I just got a new email
and up at the top I've got an email with
a little email indicator right there
came through while we were talking and
of course I've got my phone sounds muted
so you didn't hear anything just a nice
subtle little reminder hey you've got
email and the indicator is also color
coded to the type of information yellow
for email green for calendar so very
cool anyway back to what I was saying
I'd like you to go out to the market I'd
like you to try it
search for slide screen all in word
download the demo install it try it tell
me what you think especially what you
think of the setup process it's rather
impressive it takes care of setting
everything up for you in one very easy
process that you can get back to again
if you decide to skip it by going in to
help configure the weather and basically
go through this whole wizard but let me
know in the comments what you think of
the app what improvements you'd like to
see in a future version and if you would
use something like this or this in
particular as your larger app on a
semi-permanent basis go ahead and leave
those in the comments if you like seeing
different ways to customize your Android
please give this video a thumbs up and

screen pro I'm Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
