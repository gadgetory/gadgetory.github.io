one of the things I really like showing
you about Android is how you can
customize it and one of the main ways to
do that is with alternate launchers or
home screens well today I've got a home
screen that reminds me of something I
saw way back in my Newton days called a
life string it's called slide screen
let's go take a look okay to start with
what is a live stream well a live stream
is a concept where in the information
that is most relevant to you is
displayed first and foremost in your
graphical user environment now the way
that I saw this was very very sketchy it
was just a concept really didn't even
function it was more just a demo than
anything but what was trying to convey
in the way that it worked was really
revolutionary and I haven't seen it ever
since so what am I talking about well
imagine if you will you have a cascading
card deck and on those cards one of them
is the is in the front you've got a
whole bunch behind them and some others
that aren't quite in the front yet and
if you put that on a timeline the one
that's in the phone is what you're
working on right now or what is most
relevant to you right now as you go back
through the deck you get stuff that
you've worked on in the past and as you
scroll forward through the deck you get
stuff that you haven't started working
on yet that's scheduled to be worked on
so okay that's all very abstract let's
do real world stuff so let's say I'm at
work and I'm writing a word document
well in that front card is or that front
window to borrow a term from Microsoft
and Apple is my work doc and I can fill
that up to the full screen just like you
can today but when I restore it back
down or minimize it back down it goes
into the front card and if I want to see
the excel sheet that I was working on
just a few minutes ago I can scroll back
to the previous card oh and before that
there was an email and before that there
was
powerpoint presentation and before that
there was a website and i can scroll
back and forth and back and forth as i
get new emails they come up into the
deck now why is that important why is
that revolutionary well right now we've
actually gone through a few iterations
of how we get to data how we work with
stuff not just on phones but on
computers so for example if I want to
work on a word document back in the
early windows days i had to find word
open it find my document and then open
it well that's made progress with file
associations and whatnot we're now
instead of first opening word and then
opening the document now I can actually
look for the document open it and it
knows that it's a word document so it
uses word or maybe it's a PDF or maybe
it's an Excel spreadsheet it will open
the app than it needs to to be able to
interact with that information so
instead of being programmed centric now
it's information-centric and that's
really the concept behind these
lifestreams now instead of being content
centric now its timeline centric and the
stuff that is most relevant to you is
closest to the middle of that deck and
the stuff that's not is further away
from the deck all right you with me so
far now like I said I have not seen that
concept applied in practice since way
back when I have my Newton message
pattern actually it was in the early
days of that it was a 130 not even my my
21 or 22 hundred but back to this this
app is the closest thing that I have
seen to actually realizing that concept
where you have kind of a deck of
information now what do I mean by that
those we look in here right in the
middle we have our day date and time we
have our wireless status in this case
you can see I'm connected to Wi-Fi I
have a relatively poor signal strength
and I even have my time of day over on
the other side of that I've got my
current weather conditions and yes it
looks like i'm shooting this in the
middle of the night because the sun
hasn't come up yet but it also shows me
my 10
richer and the the weather conditions so
all of my pertinent information right
there right in the middle and then as I
fan out from that I have personal
information at the top and I have more
peripheral e important information at
the bottom so I'm not really a true
cascade like I was telling about before
with a live stream but still very
interesting and very unique and very
useful so let's go up to the top here
first of all well before we do that
you'll notice we don't have any widgets
or rather we don't have the ability to
plug in any third party widgets rather
all we have is what comes with the app
which is kind of limiting but it's still
kind of nice because it's relatively
thoroughly thought out and has a lot of
the stuff that you'd want to add onto
the screen with widgets you know weather
forecasts big clocks Facebook stocks
Twitter you know all kinds of stuff okay
so let's go back up to the top up at the
top we have phone calls missed phone
calls voice messages and whatnot right
there and it'll show up with a little
indicator like on my calendar we've got
email next one down and I just read all
my email before shooting this video
calendar items says I've got three
upcoming events and it shows me them and
over on the other side you'll notice
that they're all color-coded so I can
see at a glance what kind of information
that is if I want to go into this
information simply tap on it and then
I'm presented with the default Android
of view so that's all very nice and very
very familiar so moving down to the
bottom we have information and this is
information not necessarily about me or
direct interactions with me but about
stuff that I'm interested in in this
case I've got some articles I've got
some Facebook I've got some stock quotes
let's see stock quotes and again they're
color-coded CF industries right now is
down 301 take a look at that and it says
hey this is a whole bunch of CF symbols
so which one do you mean well I mean see
if industries holdings inc and if you
take a look this is where i bought into
it i sold when i got about there and
it's since then tanked and been climbing
a little bit some wild activity but this
is just you know your normal google
finance app it does really nice it does
what it's supposed to
so not bad there but that information is
right there pulls it out of my portfolio
and it presents it to me on the screen
complete with you know not just the
price and you know whether it's up or
down it also has an iconic already on
the other side and then of course it's
got more information in this case it's
got a volume indicator to show you what
the trading volume has been and I really
really really like that it's subtle it's
simple but it shows you more information
but this isn't about stocks let's go on
and take a look over here we have a
Facebook post will tap on that this is
still an interface that's inside the app
rather than taking you to the facebook
interface which is nice it keeps you
there keeps that information local so
then if you want to act on that you can
go further but if you're just looking
informational e you can look at it right
there so very nicely done but I can't
see everything for example maybe some of
that stuff isn't important so I can grab
that middle bar and move it up and now I
just have my calendar stuff or rather I
have what I currently have alerts on up
at the top and if I need more room I can
scoot that down just like that and vice
versa if I want just my information now
I can come down in here and it provides
an information stream that's just
infinitely scrolling so very very cool
and you know like I showed you before
you can then dive right into those and
do all kinds of fun stuff now is there
much more you can do well not really
let's take a look we have three buttons
down at the bottom that we can get into
by hitting the Menu key we've got help
we've got phone settings and home
settings phone settings is what you'd
expect it's the standard Android phone
settings home settings on the other hand
is just preferences orientations whether
you or not you want the status bar
because you don't really need it because
you've got it all in that center bar and
then of course how you can set up your
weather your facebook stocks Calendar
Google Reader gmail Twitter all that
stuff so kind of neat there now you
might be thinking that's great Joe but
how do I launch any apps from this thing
well that's a very good question and I
will show you that
coming right up alright so I've been
using this as my launcher for the last
couple weeks then this morning actually
switched it back to launcher pro and I
forgot to set it back to slide screen so
I went ahead and did that and now you'll
notice when I hit menu the behaviors a
little bit different instead of pulling
up that menu which you can still get to
by hitting menu again but instead of
doing that what it does is it pulls up
your launcher and it's divided into two
parts you see that up on the top it's
kind of gray it brings up your
notification bar status bar at the very
top which is optional on the home screen
and then it's got your apps down the
bottom now the way this is divided is
really nice up in the top I've got my
most frequently or my most commonly used
apps the ones that i want to have ready
access to and i have manually placed
them up there and in the bottom is my
old drawer worth of apps all bazillion
of them but on the top i can scroll to
the side either way and just wrap around
it shows me a little indicator here that
says you know this is what panel you're
on if i want to add a new icon up here
to to my quick launcher what I need to
do let's say I want to do bump so tap
and hold on that and you'll notice
everything else is grayed out and up on
the top now these little guys are
wiggling around so I'm going to go ahead
and put this right here next to shop
savvy and there you go I've dropped it
on there it's right there it's easy to
access the launcher here the app
launcher the app tray is just very very
well thought out it's simple its elegant
and I'm still back with my information
which really is the most important part
of the phone in my opinion it's right
there it's right on screen it's at a
glance this is the natural evolution of
Microsoft's today screen from the
windows mobile days so really impressed
with it I'd still like to see a real
life stream launcher app that I could
get into and use that that functions
like a true a true stream of data rather
than something like this but i'm sure
that's that's something one of you guys
hopefully if you're watching it in
develop developer can not can built for
me in any event
is the pro version of the app it is not
free I'm not going to tell you prices on
this it's not all that much because
prices have been fluctuating quite a bit
there is a free version of the app that
has a an ad down here at the bottom is
the last item which really takes up
quite a bit of real estate when you're
talking about information on the screen
but it's so radical I highly recommend
that you go out and grab that and try it
and see if you like it it's going to
take you at least a couple days of using
it exclusively before you're going to
get a taste for it and it's not
something that's going to be easy to get
used to because it is such a divergence
from from your traditional launcher
screens so go ahead and give it a try I
want to know in just a side note up here
i'll mention i just got a new email and
up at the top i've got an email with a
little email indicator right there came
through while we were talking and of
course i've got my phone sounds muted so
you didn't hear anything just a nice
subtle little reminder hey you've got
email and the indicator is also
color-coded to the type of information
yellow for email green for calendar so
very cool anyway back to what I was
saying I'd like you to go out to the
market I'd like you to try it search for
slide screen all in word download the
demo install it try it tell me what you
think especially what you think of the
setup process is rather impressive it
takes care of setting everything up for
you in one very easy process that you
can get back to again if you decide to
skip it by going in to help configure
the weather and basically go through
this whole wizard let me know in the
comments what you think of the app what
improvements you'd like to see in a
future version and if you would use
something like this or this in
particular as your launcher app on a
semi permanent basis go ahead and leave
those in the comments if you like seeing
different ways to customize your Android
