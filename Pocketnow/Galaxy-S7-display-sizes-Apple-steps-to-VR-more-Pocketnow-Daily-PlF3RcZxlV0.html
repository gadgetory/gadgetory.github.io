specifications of the galaxy s7 Google's
internal revenue figures go public as
part of a lawsuit for Android an HTC
makes some very positive corporate
shuffles today I'm hi Mary vet and
believe it or not I started celebrating
pretty much three days ago when did you
start this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with HTC as
the company continues to prove that they
will take smartphones seriously they've
made some very important promotions
within the company just to mention one
Jason Mackenzie from the United States
now being promoted to EVP and the
company continues to commit to important
things like marshmallow on the one m9
stay tuned for that one but then when we
talk about deceased companies let's move
the spotlight over to nokia as the
company has just published its vision
for the future and even though it's not
making smartphones just he it we do see
a lot of things like networking iot home
solutions we do see the company's sixty
thousand dollar 360-degree camera and we
do see a smartphone here and there we're
not exactly sure when we will get some
of these stay tuned as we do expect for
the whole deal with microsoft to end by
the end of this year probably see
something in 2017 i also about apple for
those of you doubting that the company
would ever move to the are we heard the
company made some acquisitions that have
to do with that and now we hear that
they've hired duck bowman which is an
expert in VR professor from us pacific
university that did a lot for the
microsoft hololens apparently microsoft
actually allowed for this to happen so
we're not exactly sure we should expect
anything from VR going forward but if
anything we should learn more about it
later this year and by now we are
already done with so many leaks of the
galaxy s7 let's just get this phone
announced that mwc we are expecting that
to happen and we continue to hear more
conflicting rumors but this time for
more trust than supply chain sources
that claim 5.1 inches for the regular
galaxy s7 and 5.5 inches for the edge
variant again it's really hard to
predict the samsung is really going to
make
changes are just launched its on the
phones knowing Samson it'll most likely
be launched a ton of phones but stay
tuned and finally the very interesting
news today have to do with Google
because well you know that the company
is going on this ongoing legal battle
with Oracle and it seems that the
company was forced to provide numbers
for how much money it's made on Android
we've known that Google has historically
kept this a secret but apparently it's
made a 30 1 billion overall ever since
the inception of Android 22 billion of
which is profit if you think that's a
lot of money it's actually not i mean
the company made 18 billion in profit
just last quarter alone so we just know
that android barely scratches the
surface of how much money google makes
through android but hey it leads me to
the question of the day are you okay
with companies like Google and even
Apple hiding certain numbers or do you
feel that these companies should be
blunt and say this is how much money
we're making for every specific product
in my case I do feel that that should be
the case because hey that'll give us a
better scope of what companies are
actually doing or what the future will
be of the platform but it was a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get to those
