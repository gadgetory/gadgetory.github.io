it's oh no not uno yeah it afternoon
good evening to some of you this is our
editorial round table from the motorola
event that just happened in New York
City our own Michael Fisher was lucky
enough to be there and he already picked
up the phone that he wants for the
future apparently or at least that's
what you yeah that's a moral director
how are you I'm well I'm a are you
appearing to me only as a flesh colored
bag of pixels because we are all
struggling with our internet connection
today but we're trying aren't we we're
trying our best I now see for yourself
boy while you're at it our chief news
editor mr. Steven Schenk how are you sir
I am well I'm saturated with bandwidth
and I am happy to be on a solid
connection for this car I need your hate
you brag about it dungeon and our newest
addition to the pocket now team but
actually one of our oldest friends by
the way mr. Jules Warren how are you I'm
well I am looking at myself and I can't
get over the fact of who was the person
who got stuck in that you know who blew
up into a big blueberry ain't no Willy
Wonka shahrukh assault for Rick us all
yeah yeah that yeah I just put myself
about yeah I guess good news series IV
just that right now and your face just
turned purple like a baby it's magic I
don't you I don't do you need the
chicken effects Arizona that's that's
all I need well I just retweeted the
tweet that says we're gonna be live in
less than an hour so in like 60 minutes
guys a bunch of people or gacho leading
all right anyway gentlemen I believe
that everything's working I think my
internet connection is working let's
come to the news meow short those of you
that have just joined um the Q&amp;amp;A is
active sure was lucky enough to be at
the mall as your questions directly on
the QA and
Michael will try to respond to zero or
probably one of them will see how ya
time it's looking good here depends on
how much time we have but does Stephen
why don't you give through the news and
the store with that absolutely us or
going into this event we were expecting
at least new Moto X and a new Moto G but
the invitations Motorola laid out a few
weeks back sort of left the door open
for there to be a third foam does xgx on
there now we weren't sure exactly what
we were going to be getting there'd been
talked about day a moto export Moto X on
the wave oh I think but we really didn't
have a lot of despite there being a lot
of leaks leading up here we didn't
really have a lot of hard evidence so
we're a bit surprised to see along with
the new Moto G 2015 we got to moto x
models we got the Moto X style which is
going to be the flagship model probably
of spiritual successor gelasius Moto X
we also have this new device the Moto X
play and it's kind of a it's still very
much a premium foam but it fits this new
space between the Moto X and the Moto G
I'm gonna look style limit of G and
motorola's line up those three devices
were the meat of today's event we didn't
get a new Moto 360 SmartWatch we did see
a few accessories launched though we got
a pair of wireless headphones but really
it was the Moto X style Moto X play and
the Moto G 2015 hardware specs in all of
these were relatively solid we knew a
lot going in specially with moto G leaks
being as detailed as they had been the
Moto X style we have two sizes there's a
5.7 inch quad HD the Moto X play is a
slightly smaller model and getting this
mixed up already so many specs we've
been dealing with these past few days
here it's a 5.5 inch 1080p or five point
you yeah 5.5 inch full HD yeah and
coming in about a hundred dollars less
expensive than the style now I haven't
seen final pricing on these earlier
Michael do you know if that's arrived by
now yeah final pricing on the style is
definitely here or are you talking about
the play yeah the style and I mean so
listen oh gee definitely this the Moto G
is 179 99 stars that these are all
starting prices
moto I don't know about the play but the
style which is the one that most people
going to be concerned with is starting
at three 9999 which is crazy that's an
awesome price for a moto x to start it
as a hundred dollars less than the Moto
X 2014 started at and it has specs that
are really rather extreme for anything
at that price point Tony said on Twitter
actually that's is you is this the
flagship killer killer like I was hard
that you want that up but you know well
no it is like the one plus it's in the
sub four hundred dollar space yeah
exactly they're separated by only maybe
70 or emboss and I well yeah and it
depends on what what you know level
you're getting all the kind of psycho I
think 1 plus 2 vs Moto X 2015 or Moto X
style moto X pure edition is going to be
the comparison of the of the season if
not the year here I think now why am I
the only one excited about that moto x
play I mean even if you don't get a quad
HD display I mean everything else looks
dandy a I think it's cuz you're the only
one who lives in in this on this podcast
who lives in the country that might come
to its not have incumbent on us and they
just wouldn't talk about it at all they
sort of left a door open that we might
get something at a future date didn't
they Michael you know I tried to ask
about it I tried to dig a little bit and
they just would not talk about it at all
we're not saying some kind of carrier
exclusive and might arrive like a
different branding I don't know if it
might be one of these upcoming verizon
droid models might be a reincarnation of
the X play but that could be something
yeah it looks to be it looks to have a
really good chance of being a solid
endurance device because it's got a 3630
million power battery yeah and full HD
display not quad HD and it's got a
Snapdragon 615 and there I actually
don't know how power efficient that
processor is but I imagine it's got to
be oh well this is the 615 is very power
efficient people i've been using I'm has
been using something powered by the 615
he's been using the r7 and then i use ro
7i
the this one from alcatel the one the
one touch yep the one title three and I
also yep and I also have one in eight
lights too and that's been okay in terms
of power efficiency Roger that yeah so
that one seems to be the leading
contender for an endurance from i miss
our to step on you there i don't didn't
know if you were caught up with us yet
or not with your connection there it's
okay and i apologize about that but i'm
really curious to hear about the event
michael how did motorola play this event
for you yeah the event was cool it was
uh you know it's it's connor your
typical New York City thing they crowd
us all in its nice big rooms and chairs
in the big screen and stuff the live
streaming from London stuff was kind of
interesting I you know there would there
would be someone on stage with us and
then he or she would leave for a second
then bleed live stream from London and
then we'd live stream from Brazil and it
was all very cool in concepts with an
execution it was sort of a little bit
wonky but you never got them everybody
got the messages across and we learned
about the devices I do remember sitting
there and learning that there were going
to be three devices announced and being
like oh and this day is never going to
end for us I'm ready for it yeah and we
had been tipped to only expect two
devices so i was confused but then of
course I really was not coming to the
states boom there you go but yeah I was
confused for maybe an hour and 45
minutes about the fact that the style
and the pure edition seemed to be the
same phone and they are aren't they are
yes the style is it's the same moment
they call the stop for global markets in
the call it the pure edition of states
this is very much like a z4 z3 plus
situation yeah pretty much it means like
this is the same hardware's exactly the
same phone is just different branding
for different markets but as continue
this there was not already appear
edition phone there is a pure edition
Moto X Frank and here addition I own it
it's right here wherever no I pure
anymore yes while you read so I just um
I and then I we were all excited them
that I said availability wasn't gonna be
in September on the style and I knew
then that we were not walking away with
the review device so we could we got a
moto g though I have though I have the
new Moto G right here do you look do you
want to run down with us
or we jump ahead of you I just wanted to
ask Michael real quick about your
impressions of the size because this is
a gonna be the biggest Moto X to date I
screen size wise and Motorola claimed
they were doing are making a point to
have the phone Phil as much of the habit
have the display Phil as much of the
phone space as possible so it didn't
feel like a very large phone what were
your impressions having interacted with
it so I first of all we have to say it I
think I said this in the hands on like
it's big it's five point seven inches
they can denying that help but be big
like I mean this is so this is this is
the nexus 6 and it um it looks on screen
when I when I compare the two I'm like
you know just disconnected from it it
looks like a nexus 6 but it's not it is
not a it doesn't feel like the Nexus 6
in the hand they've done a really good
job of maximizing that screen to body
ratio at seventy six percent I think you
have edges out even the LG g4 which I
think was the category leader they're
loose in the mainstream for a minute so
it feels slimmer it feels smaller than
it should it's heavy as anything it's
almost a hundred 80 grams it's it's as
heavy as the galaxy note 2 which was a
big old tank of a father doorstop yeah
but they've got the ol the dimple in
place go ahead i'm s-sorry one question
because i remember in your hands on
video you mentioned why you works when
they explain to you why they made the
phone bigger yeah they did and i was i
asked i was like listen you guys started
with the Moto X then went to the Moto X
2 and you've got a little bit bigger and
screen says and we're kind of like maybe
you should stop but no you've gone to
the 57 and they said the same thing
everybody does a lot of people these
days use their phones as their primary
computing device a lot of people stream
video a lot of people be used it as the
primary browsing device and they we
wanted to give them wide canvas
experience and yeah the 5.7 inch screen
does that you know what I could live
with that dudes and it looks great it's
bright and whatever but it's also IPS
LCD they did away with the AMOLED on
this one and 10 turns in it and I mean
as I understood at the moto active
display you know that sits there and and
flashes at you
you know it shows you the time and your
notifications its battery efficient
because it's an OLED panel from
everything I understand I I don't know
how they're going how efficient it's
going to be on an LCD that has a uniform
back like no matter which pixels are
eliminated and I'm sure it's in the
pitch dark which I didn't get to test
it's not going to look as good in the
Wildcat green haze yeah and I mean
that's so that's disappointing I don't
know why this is so head you you've used
that combination before the snapdragon
808 with an IPS LCD on the LG g4 how was
your battery like that one then the g4
was good we know as I recall it was
something like this between four and
five hours it wasn't anything extreme
but it was is better than I'd
experienced on other devices before so
yeah it worked out alright and you're
right this is going to be powered by
Snapdragon 808 as well and that's I
think that's going to be plenty fun it's
like a pure Android build it's exactly
the same software as on the previous gen
Moto X there doesn't seem to be any
improvements or removals in terms of
features right so then again did there
need to be ya know their did though
their did because the Moto X is like a
lot of android phones it comes out of
the box and it's awesome all these
features that Motorola has built-in are
just kick ass and it worked great and
then like six months later you're like
well hello moto x and it's like Pete II
wouldn't and then it wakes up and like
okay what's the weather gonna be
tomorrow and then it takes 85 seconds to
go talk to Google bad so you know like
every android phone just rots away until
it's until you have to buy another one
and that sucks so I was hoping that they
were at least going to say like you
heard you we know it gets a little slow
we're going to speed up this Colin
response time but they didn't say
anything about them they just announced
all those features like there again now
another question that i have michael is
how are they going to do that microsd
support how are they gonna because you
can option that in with moto maker to my
standing yeah but where are they gonna
fix that sim card in I'm curious I don't
know and I wish that I had thought to
ask when I was on site it is the second
thing I wish I I wish I'd asked but all
I know is that
be able to get it either you'll either
have a micro SD card slot or you won't
and pick that in moto maker this
somebody in the chat was saying was a
coach out who was saying that the UH sim
card could double as a micro SD card
slot that right yeah we've seen that uh
well no way it's like a whole lot of
dual sim devices have that and yeah I
was doing an alluring oh yeah right ok
yeah so may it may very well be that I'm
not entirely sure but that would seem to
make the most sense to me so you
wouldn't have to do a whole nother skew
with I got into them yeah with a
different casing nitration yeah right
just you know just take a knife and then
just slice it into something one boot
punch it out that's all what's uh who's
having a party in the back down that
sounds like fun wherever 20l is all the
feedback I don't let stop me up on
another question Michael uh or you know
what Michael it could be the latency of
my connection could know all right yeah
another question that i have is i'm a
little confused with us carrier
availability is this pretty much they
pretty much just announced an unlocked
phone yeah so they are going to sell it
to the carriers like normal but they are
de-emphasizing that so heavily they're
going to really really push it through
motorola com bestbuy com and amazon.com
and it's like couched it in these
strange terms they were really clicking
this speed of software updates and all
that kind of seven things yeah if we
don't have a middle man we can be much
faster with with the software updates
the pure additions like yeah okay but
that's the way it's been with the Moto X
Pierre edition for like two generations
here so I don't know why the sudden why
there why they're actually doing this I
don't know if it's the same reason why
everyone else has and you know huawei
with their PA flame I mean they help me
out here not the same over my overall
the memory injures why wait he doesn't
want ways did not can't have a carrier
relationship couldn't get motor rollers
in the same boat Motorola has no trouble
with that so I don't know why they were
why they're doing it honest ZTE has no
trouble getting in
to all the budget here's an old man oh
this isn't a little budget oh yeah I
mean what I wouldn't eat it we are not
motorola in any in any sense so i don't
know why that I don't know what I don't
think Motorola has as much climbing we
saw it takes so long for them to get
moto maker on to the freaking carriers
and in the 2014 edition a carrier
dropped the moto maker option oh yeah
yeah which carrier was that sprint uh oh
well well who cares anyway we should
probably move back to the yeah yeah
could we um last question Michael last
question before we move to the Moto G
arm the your biggest quirk of the Moto X
the camera toll yeah so the camera not
only has gotten a resolution boost to 21
megapixels they've got an F 2 point 0
aperture on there no optical
stabilization but they went like crazy
I'm gonna see if I can find this friggin
quote because you know if you guys watch
the livestream you probably heard this
to this is these are the roundtable
notes sorry there's a motor g them out
of play um may motorland will just over
promise every heritage they did this the
first end motor like so this could be
best candy this clear pixel stuff you'd
have seen like it gets crazy and then up
it's worse camera it so uh this question
from zul i fell i will tie that into
this are you pleased they're using this
brand new sony IM x230 it is a stacked
sensor has face detection 1.1 over 24
sensor so it's better now you ruined my
flow so I'm pissed off I don't know I
don't know come on the middle of
building something in front kick my
house down listening what we can
guarantee that the cameras and our new
phones will now be best in class that's
of one quote the second one your photos
and videos are going to look even better
and I don't know where I wrote this down
but if somebody said oh yeah the camera
for you camera best we've ever built and
best in the world uh-huh we can
guarantee all these very
subjective promises bands like what like
I'm looking forward to trying it out i'm
not saying ass i could be it could very
well be but metal isn't always always
over promises of these events go ahead
Joe say given them raw details it looks
like from zul life he's given us I mean
yeah you know it looks looks pretty good
so far sunday IM x230 with a 12 window
too well we had your chance yeah yeah no
an obstacle in the stabilization is not
everything it's true I don't know I saw
people taking simple photos with the
President and I learned not to not to
get any useful info from those when we
did the one m9 stuff whose results were
way different than they were the retail
 product so we'll sit see in certain
respects people we're not getting the
film print othr couple months a lot can
happen in final software tweaking by
then absolutely yeah um yeah so crazy
stuff though go ahead yeah hi mom OOP
I'm sorry it's just I I can't wait to
see that camera result from you
particularly as a critic but now curious
about the Moto G how did it go with that
the Moto G seems to be like you know
like the old moto g except with a with a
lumiose Ramona back and same price point
except there is what is it saying what's
the water resistance thing that's
because ipx7 rated so it's not rated
against dust but not tested is probably
still going to be good against us
because it's waterproof up to what's the
seven meter one meter 10 minutes yeah
yeah yeahs important i should say i
should note ipx7 so the x is where the
dust proofing slaughter each other and X
doesn't mean that it's not rated for
dust oh it does it means it's not ready
for that yeah it's not and it failed
because they didn't test it exactly
right yeah yeah so it could very well be
just type um I noticed when powering on
the Moto G today that I got one of my
first notifications was check your back
cover so we're back to that sort of
thing like like we had on the galaxy s4
active in the galaxy s5 like you know
making sure that this back cover is
firmly and
purely in place to make sure that no
watermelon here because we've just got
like a direct line to the salmon
micro-st stocks with the cover toss some
meaty clicks right there yeah they and
you know John's right and we have to be
house I'm just noticing there's no free
gasket on this on the inside of this
thing so is this like a nano water
resistant coating inside if I were
thinking no I don't I they've got to be
preventing water intrusion by using this
back cover somehow I just died
tolerances yeah it's just there must be
super tight tolerances but between the
clip male and female ends and be that on
just hydrophobic coating yeah I want I
want to see a new video shot from the
hotel bathroom here Michael tries to
drown new motivating I did just I did
just realized that you have to anchor
you have to press it very very tightly
around the camera so I predict that a
couple phones will drown because this
doesn't even have a sticker there like
the galaxy s4 active did to remind you
of chris down but anyway oh yeah anyway
what I'm will ever forget about Moto G
is there anything else interesting about
mm-hmm well the Moto 360 what happened
there you hear anything oh nothing no I
lumineer ever anything of editing your
face there's nothing said nothing to be
said there it was gaining back room of
guys with long sleeves hiding a version
twos up to their functionary carry on
bros no no but is there anything I feel
like I'm missing something on the Moto G
um but i don't i guess not i mean i-i
just unboxed it i'm about to do the next
video on that so hmm there you go I'm
wanna wait for that yeah I want to hop
back over to the X for just a second
yeah about that horween leather and post
met Anton has up right now pretty cool
stuff talking about a horween company
and saffiano leather and are you looking
forward to the letter backing first of
all with the Saffiano leather I'm always
looking forward to leather backing
because the door wing leather on the
existing moto X's is so soft
feels so great but it's quite fragile um
it starts to show we're almost
immediately this saffiano leather is
apparently stamped in such a way that it
will resist wear and tear damage a lot
yeah so you see on the screen right here
that cross hatching which is a telltale
sign of Saffiano and even with just the
one direction you know hatches that that
is a key sign of that so horween
chicago-based Henry and one of the
oldest ones as he found that on of all
places Wikipedia hello welcome to the
free encyclopedia and yeah but the Moto
X is using saffiano leather which is
from Italy originally and originally
also a patent of product and then this
this is crazy stuff crosshatch print
yeah we already talked about that so I
mean the weather is one thing but then
you've got this additional option of
this silicone and when should I was
about to ask you about that silicone
option rippy old rubber yes that's
that's what we saw on the close up pics
on the leaks and we thought it might
have been the Droid but in fact it's one
of the Moto X variants and it feels good
it's quite Griffey as you might expect
from something like that it's like you
it's like a like animoto you know foot
mat or something like that around um but
what's nice is it somewhat difficult
reated 2000 good with color and huh
hopefully we get a review unit of those
be on after the buzz yeah hopefully you
can get a review energy about that
period no hopefully because the most
interesting part is that pattern of that
like silicon I wonder how that will
withstand the test of time oh yeah i'll
be really lost sorry this indeed yeah
and you're right the only only time will
tell but it certainly felt really good
and all think open then feels like a
great phone i sent the hands on it feels
like a like a pre three feels like they
finally got the got the finished
hardwood this is the moto x play with
the silicon back no no no the silicon
back is an option on the Moto X
style on the style all right yes I don't
know what options the play will have
it's like they they hopped onto that
talked about it for a bit then they have
talked and what they were not on site
either so interest on I've never seen
pictures of them with that Diamondback
so I'm guessing they're gonna have the
same sort of thing and you know what I
bet to play I don't know if somebody
said this in the chat earlier I bet the
play will just be the droid do you see
the images we saw weight of those back
panels and they're the ones that had the
the circular flash that we assume where
the droid turned out to be the play so
not be surprised of that said that
develops yeah I will not be surprising
so yeah how did it go out but with that
how did it go with those selfies on
expert particularly with that oh yeah
the front-facing flash I just it's so
nice because I heard about that and I
was like oh man they're gonna make
listen to a big gross front-facing flash
like on the desire I had a man really
prominent but no it's it's tiny barely
notice it's there until you set it off
and then you just your whole face just
gets melted off by the flu this is
lovely no it's great though it's when we
were using it on the desire I better go
that it was a really good idea actually
and I'm glad this it poured it to
another device particularly a motor to
rolla um 11 could 1qn a question asking
right now what would you recommend
particularly Michael you're the only one
that's the one plus two what we've
learned I'm the only one who is what
about the one close to you're the only
one to tell the Moto X the new ones so
you know you know the specs of the list
to what would you recommend oh man see I
haven't held the 1+2 but the eggs like
what it's looking like to me right now
is that moto is is bringing a lot of
heat with the new Moto X there that that
display is gorgeous for all as
unnecessary as I think that resolution
is yes it's very pretty it's a
wonderfully built phone it feels
incredible it doesn't have a fingerprint
scanner like the one plus two
it does have a processor that is
probably a bit more efficient thanks to
its memory it's better thermal control
we don't know how the cameras are going
to compare we don't know we don't know a
lot of things right now doesn't have NFC
hate has an episode of only two dozen
everything right other than that's been
the talk that's ridiculous that's a
really ruins the phone for me great oh
this moto X doesn't have wireless
charging either right no it does not but
it does cloud turbocharging faster
charging the samsung galaxy s6 and its
adaptive charger according to Motorola
so thank you and I don't know I know
that p 1 plus wonders where the 1+2 does
not have quick charge from what I
understand so there's that as well
alright if it were me which it will be
me I mean what am I going to spend my
money on I'm I'm gonna buy the Moto X
because we just like I've been buying
these for the past two years it's my
it's my thing I like so then so so with
these uh and viola where I think we're
already reaching the 30 minute and limit
that we had I know you have to go to
follow up with more coverage but I
really want to hear your final thoughts
like we are you being are you like I
want to have it or man it's the thing
that I do oh man I do want to have it I
do but I really wish they hadn't swapped
that AMOLED panel for an IPS screen but
that's just me we're not going to dwell
unless just matter or personal takes
this fun I really wish it had wireless
charging once again not a thing that
people are probably get frustrated about
looking at the rest of it ah I it's
stunning for the price that they're
asking for 399 to get a phone like that
even for 49 which is probably the price
point that I'll have to go to once i get
up leather bag the axon price point to
yeah yeah that so that's a good question
Jules right i mean one plus two or this
is one question this or axon is another
question and I I think this is for a lot
of people i think Motorola's gonna kind
of win the day here i think a flagship
killer killer might be an apt term for
this device if they manage to get to
market
at the early part of September and not
not use up all this sort of anticipation
not burn at all it's it's going to be
very impressive yes I'm excited for you
I just have to decide on a color that's
gonna be gonna you know I think motorola
lost its carrier capital and that's why
they're taking this group but you know
hey for 400 bucks what about me what
about you Jules of you if you have to
spend a dime right now and i found when
you but would I buy the X pure um that
what you're asking yeah well yeah it's
tough for her it is a great value
proposition for the package i'm getting
i'm just not sure if I would be able to
take advantage of what it provided to me
and you know if I can't then I I
shouldn't buy it I should find me else
moto voice but I I know I don't really
use it in one word it's just not my
style yeah if you know drives that I
trans really it's not as useful feature
if I do if I do if I don't if I'm not
alive I shouldn't be using phones this
is a this is a good point hi might wanna
you talk so screaming from no sense
again yeah we are we gonna answer any q
and A's before we get the out here
not so few in yeah look um come over
here we'll figure this out then all
right so uh I'm just gonna if no one
else wants to pick something up I'll
just make one right here no software
enhancement 3000 milliamp hour battery
and a 5.7 fought each time s can you
mute yourself yeah do you think the
battery life under I'm okay I'm
struggling with the connection as well
dude no no no can you mute yourself
because you're the only one who doesn't
have headphones and you're the echo
generator I just just learned oh my gosh
I gotcha yeah it's so what was it Jules
yeah will the battery life on the XP or
be just okay yeah I really think so I
mean Motorola has done this two
generations in a row now with it come
so this is going to be the best battery
ever and they even did it with a droid
turbo and like it's it's yeah I really
hope that it improves but I don't have
high hopes for the battery life on this
thing all right there we go uh dom is
here and one get to his question but i'm
trying to figure out which one who's has
something that we haven't talked about
yet ah that's are on point with their q
and A's by the retro craziest out of
them today yeah we're getting money it's
crazy I would almost want to say that we
should get out of here before we get a
blanched in I like pencil in 90 minutes
like like Karthik Gupta because I'm with
him it's I'm with Jaime any day I would
take 1080p battery life took quad HD and
low battery life like yeah no totally
having just spent some time at the 720p
device that lasted quite a while as a
result yeah yeah yeah Ronnie dari mana
motive x-play just recycled Moto X 2014
with a makeover your opinion mmm mmm the
big battery alone makes it a phone it
stands out I mean even if the rest of
that statement were true it's noteworthy
it just because of that change um but I
don't think even that it's just a a
rehash of last year these are I mean we
have a new size is it any size what what
with each i'm at the play yeah place at
5.5 he's like too young yeah um
design-wise it fits at least in with the
style of this year's models maybe it's
not a huge rehash but the you know the
Lumia bar I think it's a nice touch also
it may be speak I don't know that
speakers Steven but on the new Moto X
style we have stereo speakers and
answers that's true in the play is fine
okay not finally d and just in time for
what was it acts on to fool us with one
and then HTC of foolish with another and
then a single day I went hands-on the
two phones that had to my only fifty
percent of them worked for speaker back
well HTC's you know to their credit it's
only a you know sub two hundred dollar
phones now no doubt you're right here
right here it's justified for that but I
axons and have a hug no but I think
could be followed by everybody yeah I
think that's a trend that should be
followed by everybody i mean front
firing speakers i mean it makes all the
sense of the world I mean Julie I spend
anything that has been asking for that
for like five years I things indeed what
else uh I have nothing jewels that you
find I'm taking a look at how easy or
this is from so ham kale how easy are
not easy is it to use the new Moto X
with one hand I have friends complaining
the iphone 6 is too big do you really
think was smart of motor oil to go with
this new form fact I think they're all
being forced into it and it's it's so
strange the last I heard of this was
from another carrier or another OEM who
was putting out a mini phone I was like
why don't you guys put high-end specs
into this mini shell and sell it like
this and their response was that the
carriers don't want that because the
carriers think the customers don't want
that yeah but Motorola is sort of going
outside the normal carrier avenues this
time around and they're doing it anyways
and i would love to see this freaking
market research like who's that effect
you know they're just put your hand
print on here and inside your name and
then you know that is that is not how
they're doing it's got to be the people
who want their phone to be a tablet as
well who want their phone to be a
one-stop shop like computing solution
media center and Motorola I mean maybe
if Motorola were to make a tablet again
here we ever can work event go back to
this guy and like a 4.6 4.7 and and then
like you know offer a bundle deal or
something like that but I feel like
that's bad day just like the most people
are saying huh yeah this is big but then
I don't have to buy a tablet but then I
don't know i don't actually as we proved
on the plugin up with a podcast last
week i have no idea one real customers
want particularly in india well all we
know is that dxomark decided to rate the
camera thank you thomas vo so um do you
know yeah here if you're a geek about
you know Fred photography go ahead and
hook that up and see what a minute in
Miami but again it's not like it's not
final software do they just make the
hardware of the cam
that was gonna uh I think well you know
they would go with bout with their you
know usual tests like minimum I is a 0
for dark scene or are shutter speed that
it's crazy stuff I'm gonna do one more
accused oh go ahead I'm sorry does that
necessarily reflect to like high quality
photography on on a smartphone
particularly you know even if the
hardware air I mean present and then the
results are terrible yeah it's it's a
tough call we're about to get some cool
data from from reviewed in the next a
little bit about a bunch of smartphone
cameras that they tested rigorously and
I learned an awful lot about smartphone
camera testing the other day I visited
them so i will trigger talking about
going forward to them yeah it'll be fun
one thing i don't know if the motor joy
to that indeed did the margin you always
have the twist to twist to activate the
camera and the moto display stuff and
the like can I do the johto display
master control a yeah that works but
yeah the mo what of this play wasn't
available but i think the gestures oh
but can you talk to it it has that stuff
now I don't know and actually let's let
me see because it would be in the Moto
voice there in the Moto hub the Moto hub
hi Michael make moto yours that sounds
great I just automatically I notify you
at a glance okay all right now so it's
just got back yeah Taylor Martin has
just sent me a thing of pomade and
there's my truck so no it does not have
the voice activation because oh no
because it doesn't have the x8 mobile
computing system it has is it powered by
the wet Snapdragon 410 is it something
in us for 10 yeah yeah okay so thank you
for asking for x adobe did anything else
find it weird that you could choose your
random level on the Moto G yeah the
storage level it's 88 and one and then
16 and two yeah you know this was weird
a year or two ago I'm sort of getting
used to it at this point we've been
seeing so many carriers in the past I
guess even the few last few months start
doing this ZTE now these guys
yeah I would be interesting if we they
if we started seeing phones that didn't
tie this a storage capacity yeah it
would be interesting I wonder if there's
a hand in hand thing that happens on the
board Jose has got to go we're not yeah
we all have the p.m. we got it but you
know what would be continuing coverage
of this as always so uh yeah hi wait uh
just take us away I guess unless you can
sing Steven silent we were just missing
Stevens final impressions are you gay
bingo moto x no it's too damn big oh
good end of it right there I think even
one plus two might be too big so yeah
the work that you're your reaction to
that phone was exactly what I was
waiting for but anyways it's been a
pleasure to you know share this hang out
with you guys Michael I hope you had a
good time at the event and thanks got a
very tight to get to coming up yeah I
know you have a very tight schedule of
so uh everyone thank you very much for
joining in Michael everybody thank you
very much at the qas rd port but we we
do have a lot of coverage coming up
we'll definitely cover more of the
pocket net weekly coming soon sorry Mike
there you go that's exactly what I was
gonna say hi we will definitely come on
by the week then now in the end yeah
yeah and then I will try to skip through
everything that Steven wrote on the
Pocket not daily very soon but anyways
