of the iPhone 11 has surfaced and it
looks like Apple will stick to its
design we have a launch date and
estimated price tag for the galaxy s7 5g
in the United States and the Oppo Reno
teaser now shows us a new camera mode in
the works I'm Jaime Rivera and because
I've been living for the past three days
assuming that it's Thursday it's finally
time to celebrate again this is parking
out daily sponsored by brave the
official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for a Galaxy
smartphone currently the galaxy s nine
can be found for more than $200 off
meaning if you go for the 256 gigabyte
variant of the galaxy s 9 plus you're
pretty much gonna pay like 550 bucks
which is a significant drop in addition
to other perks like for example a data
SIM card and everything you can learn
more about everything in that
description now let's talk about the
Oppo Reno as we've got two teasers from
the company that are actually quite
awesome the first one being that the
display is going to have no bezels
whatsoever so that's gonna be fantastic
pretty much resembles the Oppo find X
that we praised a lot but then the
second is that apparently there is this
very interesting bright mode that
obviously mimics night mode but it's
being shown on video and it's also being
shown in photos everything looks
fantastic there's a lot of detail in the
photography but obviously we can't wait
to hear more that was how about Netflix
if you didn't know what the service is
going to get more expensive it was
pretty much announced a couple of weeks
ago now it's official that if you were
paying 8 bucks and are gonna pay 9 if
you were paying 11 bucks now you're
gonna pay 13 and if you were paying 14 I
go up to 16 the reason why is because
according to the company they want to
finance their you know unique content
for you because obviously your problem
right you're the one that's supposed to
be paying for that correct anyways I'm
not gonna bash Netflix their content is
great but yet you're gonna pay more now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy S 10
5g for those of you wondering when we're
getting this in the United States
Verizon was the first partner to
announce this phone we already heard a
launch date for Korea now it seems that
for the United States it's going to be
May 16th
but we're still fumbling on the price
tag according to what the rumor claims
it might be around twelve hundred and
thirty bucks
which is still close to the iPhone 10s
max if you asks me I mean yeah that's
going to be the price and you get a lot
of storage here
and finally the hottest issue today have
to do with the iPhone 11 as a we saw
some League renders that would assume
that we have this horrible camera hump
at the back then we saw some the leaked
cat images now we have a leak back plate
it pretty much confirms that this is the
probable design and remember this is
apparently of the iPhone 10 or 11 or
it's not necessarily of the iPhone 11 or
at least that's what's being thrown
around it's so hard to predict exactly
what we get but in today's question I
mean let us know what do you think do
you like the design of that horrible I
don't know camera design or not cuz I
don't think that Apple is going to make
a phone that ugly but the company has
disappointed me before in the past so
I'm gonna say that it's a 50/50 on my
case but we would love to know what you
think in the comments down below today's
