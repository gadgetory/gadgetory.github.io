shows a fresh take on Android the carry
on tablet and laptop Ben could get out
of hand for international pledge to the
United States and one post against
--'tis its camera performance as
top-notch for its next flagship I'm -
Rivera and as much as I wanted to
pre-record this video thank you Andy
Rubin let's do this again this is Fargo
Nell daily the official news today begin
with deals I can't sit here and tell you
that the league olie pro 3 is a great
phone it's good enough but the thing is
that phone is a lot more expensive than
250 bucks
so whatever it's available for 250 bucks
I'm going to be the guy that's going to
tell you yeah why not buy it it's
currently available at Best Buy for that
price
now how about LG in the past though GM
Qualcomm collaborated a lot for the G
phones to be the first to rock the
latest and greatest processors obviously
that one really bad for the G flex 2 so
the company has played it a little
slower lately that's the point where a
lot of people didn't really like that on
the Snapdragon 820 one with the g6
and we hear from trusted sources and
things are going to change apparently
both companies are working back together
to have the next G not the next flagship
with the next G meaning not the next V
and I hate these turns but anyways that
one's going to bring the Snapdragon 845
can't wait to see that now start about
oneplus as the company has just teased
the photo that asks us which is the one
provided by the oneplus five of which
one is not obviously this is a low-light
shot which was one of the things that we
can blame the most about the one plus 3t
we're glad to see that this whole
collaboration with the Esso mark is
going to bring better performance on the
one plus five we can now we can tell you
more as soon as we do learn more about
it now let's talk about the PSA and it's
laptop and tablet ban you might think
you know what it doesn't really apply to
me because it's only affecting 10
countries the international flights
going to the United States but we've got
some sources that claim that apparently
the TSA is considering applying this
laptop and tablet ban to all
international flights to the United
States meaning anything that's bigger
than a smartphone might have to be
checked in your bag and that's going to
be complicated for some of us to fly 15
hours and time
and finally the very hot news they have
to do with Andy Rubens announcement of
the essential phone and there are a
couple of very interesting tricks of
this tone that make it unique number one
it's made of titanium
and ceramic so apparently it can
withstand a drop a lot better than the
Lumina Man glass can't wait to test that
the second thing is that it's got all
the bells and whistles on dragon 835
four gigs of RAM 128 gigs of storage
third it's got this interesting display
that seems to be of MIL bezels at the
top but apparently is it's kind of
something that we really want to test
because there's an obvious bezel at the
bottom as well and even more interesting
it's got these pogo pins at the back
that enable modularity there's this
360-degree camera for an extra 50 bucks
if you buy it with the phone and how
much is the phone cost is probably the
most interesting part 700 bucks 700
bucks which is cheaper than pretty much
every other flagship than the LG G 6 and
will get you absolutely everything you
want from an Android phone leads me to
the question of the day what do you
think about it what do you think about
the essential phone because in my case I
can't wait to get it for review Andy let
me know leave us a comment down below we

subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one you also follow me
