Android iPhone everything in between I'm
your host Michael Fisher senior editor
at pocket now and I'm joined by our
managing editor and Tandy Naja good

editor-in-chief the man in charge
Brandon minimun good morning to you yo
yo yo what up different size then one
feel left out no it's good i we got to
bring some freshness here we just
listened to or at least I just listened
to jock jams to to fire up my morning
because um you as the adult listeners in
the crowd will know and the underage
listeners should not know but maybe do
you should not party really late after
having eaten nothing and that's what I
did last night so about 15 minutes ago I
was feeling absolutely what very low I
was feeling very very horrible about
life and then I listened to this awful
awful audio mix called jock jams and if
you were not a teenager in the late 90s
in America you probably don't know about
it just you youtube it and you'll enjoy
it it's great i want to kick off the
podcast with it but we have the writing
said we have some stuff to get through
here we've got a special announcement
i'm guessing we have at least one or two
new listeners to this particular episode
because it's the first time we've tied
in the podcast our weekly podcast which
we do every week called the pocket now
weekly in with a giveaway contest and
that is a giveaway for this sonos
wireless hi-fi system so at some point
listeners if you have not checked it out
on our website you should just search
for sonos s 0 n 0 s on pocketnow.com and
it's it's a sweet wireless audio system
I happened to listen to one at a winery
over the Thanksgiving holiday and its
really awesome it's constrained internet
and you know it's it's very good quality
sound you've got remote control and
stuff we're giving one of these systems
away so at some point you're into the
episode today you will hear a hint word
it is a single word hint and it is the
only hint you need and all you need to
do when you hear that hit word is to
email it to contest good is to continue
listening to the podcast who is gonna
make ya that's right your first step is
not to immediately tune out of the
podcast and your second step is not to
immediately go to the comments and tell
everyone where what the time code is at
the hint because I think we're going to
disable comments to prevent that cuz
there's always some tool out there but
unfortunately our listenership is not
comprised of tools mainly but there's
always somebody who wants to ruin all
the fun but go send the hint to contest
at pocketnow.com follow so nose and
pocket now on facebook and or Twitter
and that's all you need to do to enter
the giveaway it's a really cool giveaway
so what what bread right you're like I
can hear you laughing I don't know what
your laughing about but i like it i'm
smiling i was thinking of maybe we
should get some of the these gears for
us four eva and mwc just keep on rockin
in the hotel room it's a really really
good idea we men don't we do we gotta
make sure and keep the door open as well
go ahead just a yes some so nose is
really really good stuff there's one
there's one thing missing um I've got a
sonos or two and and it's very enjoyable
but the thing is you gotta plug in the
sonos to the wall obviously to power it
it would be so cool if there was a
portable sonus that worked like over
bluetooth or created somehow a Wi-Fi
mesh network so you could take you could
take your little sonos thing kind of
like what is that the jawbone jambox
right yeah it's like the size of the
jawbone jambox you take a cheeks with
you to the beach and you can control the
sonos from your smartphone and and it
would have to work differently because
right now sonos works over your router
there's like a wireless bridge and so
it's really downloading content from the
internet on its own so it would actually
have to do like internet pass through
through your phone if it's streaming
from say Spotify you know duh I really
hope they come out with a portable
product mazing I was gonna say I would
be very surprised to learn that they
were not at least thinking of doing that
I mean it sounds like a great idea to me
it's it's it's a cool system you know
you
check it out I didn't give it much
thought until like I say thanksgiving
holiday I'm at a vineyard and they're
playing this stuff and I'm like wow
that's really amazing sound and then two
days later Tony's like Michael we're
going to do a giveaway it's gonna be the
sonos thing like how awesome um it so
anyway so that's that that's that's all
you need to know so listeners if you
don't know why later on there's a hint
word coming on you you should have
listened to this portion yeah and this
is not that this is not the hint yet
exactly the the second thing we want to
kind of jump into this thought thread to
kick off the show and this is something
that Tony and I were talking about
yesterday we got news recently just to
kind of we're kicking the self with
Windows Phone by the way we got news
recently there's some rumors out that
this Samsung at Eve s they're kind of
blockbuster monstrosity of a windows
phone is uh is delayed and I think we're
pretty confident in this rumor there has
there's no update update tag on this
retracting it or anything like that but
it might not be arriving until next year
is the is the word I think for what yeah
until 2013 stock market yet for some
markets and Tony and I were talking
about the absurdity of this because the
deity vest was kind of if it wasn't the
first windows phone 8 device officially
announced it was one of the first right
it was the first it was the personal
every time I think about the OTS I just
closed my eyes and remember you and me
even in Berlin at the Samsung booth and
we knew the press release was out and we
were asking for deity best because we
didn't see it on display and it wasn't
on display but it was the first windows
phone 8 device to be announced yeah we
were playing with the smart PC and the
the other the windows 8 tablets and it's
like I wonder if they've got the achieve
s out and we kind of expected to get a
hands-on but yeah no dice and you know
it's interesting that it was the first
to be announced and it's going to be the
last of the windows phone 8 devices to
be released so I think uh what do we
think of the reasons for this I mean do
you think this is a tactical move do we
think that you know this is a mechanical
problem what's what's going on oh I I'll
put forth a theory I think that over the
last six months Samsung has been
hyper-focused on galaxy s3 note 2
as so much so that they've probably
allocated fewer engineers and and and
product managers to the windows phone at
T vests and so now they're they're
dragging their feet a little bit and I
think the carriers are pushing back and
saying hey you know we've already got
the 8x and the Lumia 920 and the 822 and
all of these other windows phone they're
already positioned that ready to go we
can't release and yet another windows
phone in December it would mess up our
marketing message you guys are too late
let's do it next year you think there's
there's reverse there's like pressure
from the carriers not to not to release
it in the midst of all this I would
think that they would want to push as
many devices as they possibly could for
the holidays yeah it's either the
carriers are pushing back and Samsung is
just ready now or Samsung's just not
ready what if you know I I was wondering
if maybe Samsung had some if there was
some animosity there because Microsoft
has really been showing a whole lot of I
mean you know HTC has got there halo
windows phone products Nokia's got there
really intense stuff and they're getting
a lot of kind of love from from
Microsoft in that region I just wonder
if you know I mean and then here's
Samsung with this device that I'm
looking at the leaked image right now
and it's like wow this is kind of like
what I mean it's kind of like a
squared-off galaxy s3 for windows phone
but I mean it's not terribly compelling
so I don't know it doesn't seem like
they have a lot invested in what's going
on with the the windows phone 8 platform
I don't know I mean maybe maybe they're
they're trying to make a decision on
whether windows phone is is worth their
time and they and they kind of I mean it
going with the theory that Samsung
something ready maybe they want to wait
and see here about some holiday sales
numbers on Windows phones and if it's if
it's if it's enough to get consumers
attention they'll jump in and maybe even
start working on another windows phone
or if not they'll just you know launched
this at Eve s and C and probably have at
mediocre sales what if what if they're
working on countering some of the some
of the special features from like Nokia
and some of the special stuff that HTC
is doing what if they're what if they
come out of the gate with this at Eva's
way late but they follow the mantra of
if we can't be first we're going to be
better like what if Samsung just it
takes a lot of their features from the
galaxy s3
and adapt some you know to to Windows
Phone 8 like remember when the galaxy s3
lot was announced and it was like here's
47 features you're not gonna use you
know 32 of them but the rest are really
really cool like I wonder if that's what
the thinking is here you're creating a
megaphone right yeah I just partially
happen to agree with Brandon and I agree
with him in regards of Samsung being to
blame I don't blame the carriers I just
think that I'm gonna put this out there
samsung doesn't care about Windows Phone
I think their experience with Windows
Phone 7 7.5 made them learn or even more
their experience with with Android made
them learn that the the real money is
where Android is for them so yeah I
don't think they do care about it and I
don't think they're ready they yeah that
that's a good point i mean they're
they're making a lot of money from their
stamp their their android devices and
their their number one and android right
now they need to stay number one and
it's not easy to do that whenever
there's a lot of money up for the taking
the competition gets better and better
like this HTC DNA we're going to talk
about later is is is awesome LG's got
some good stuff and Motorola well I
don't know that and so and so Samsung's
like we and we gotta keep this momentum
we gotta start you know we gotta get
this galaxy s4 out in the next three or
four months we you know this Windows
Phone thing is just it's a hedge against
Android we don't really need a hedge
right now because it's clear that
Android has a big future right yeah I'd
I guess we'll see I mean I'm very much
looking forward to seeing what what
Samsung bring to the table I'm gonna be
very disappointed if it's a situation
like the focus what was that the focus s
that was like the galaxy s2 for windows
phone yeah when was it means not a bad
product i'm not saying that it was just
like that but but just think about it
for a second I mean windows phone has a
two-point three percent market share do
they care to be at the third or a second
OEM in a three percent market share or
do they care to be the first ones in a
seventy two percent market share sure
and I did see I find that argument more
compelling for somebody like like LG
right who doesn't have a lot of that
they're they're a big company but
they're not doing terribly well and they
want to focus their efforts they really
want to hone their efforts on one
particular platform didn't do well there
and I think we're seeing them do that
with with the optimus G on Android but
you know LG is not doing anything on
Windows Phone and but for samsung with
all of these resources that Samsung has
a samsung is just so massive and and has
so much you know spare capacity i think
you know i feel like they can say they
can be kind of like Microsoft they're
like yeah you know we'll lose money on
this to try and to try and play the long
game here well I think it's a matter of
will willing to do that because as you
said it's the galaxy s3 the chassis is
there the screen is the same the casing
is almost the same the only thing which
is different than this phone and I'm
looking at the specs is probably the
chipset which is a Qualcomm instead of
the maxi nose processor so that
shouldn't be a problem for a company
like Samsung i think it's it's more of a
matter of i don't want to do that I mean
why should I do that I don't it
yeah I guess we'll see um we're gonna uh
I do want to jump into two windows phone
8 like first first I I understand that
our editor in chief has something to say
well I've got a thought third to you do
yes this is a surprise folks this wasn't
in the London in the rundown all right
go go go I hope it's not role-playing I
love it I hope it's not role-playing job
uh so you guys might have noticed that
in the google play store after you
download an app there's a button now
that says keep shopping have you noticed
oh yeah it's awesome why's it awesome
well because because i've been
downloading apps non-stop on my lumia
920 recently and I've been just so tired
of getting kicked back into the OS from
the store and having to jump back into
the store yeah yeah but wait so they
keep shopping button go ahead continue
to make your point the Android the Play
Store never kicked you out so a turret
didn't so they just made it they made a
subtle change but I think it's actually
a bigger change than that um I'm trying
to hash out this thought it's rather
complex I think that that keep shopping
button along with several other things
is a a new push from google it's very
subtle to get p
to buy more stuff in android because the
vast majority of android users I'm like
iOS users don't buy things they don't
buy apps they look for free apps first
most normal humans do and they really
don't you know they're not spending you
know five twenty thirty dollars on
content so so you look at the nexus set
then the nexus 10 which come pre-loaded
with these big widgets that have like
books and movies and TV shows and and
then you look at the new slogan for the
next family of devices which is the
playground is open right and then you've
got this button that says keep shopping
and that word shopping when I when I
download free apps I'm not shopping but
when I shop i'm paying for stuff so i
think they're kind of subtly putting a
message in android users head that yeah
this google play store now is so much
more than four REE apps it's a place
where you can buy stuff and in fact you
should buy stuff so that developers can
make more money so that we can fix this
problem of not so good android tablet
apps because if a developer wants to
make a tablet app they make it for the
ipad and they make more money because
iOS users are so used to buying things
you know right and not to mention users
on other platforms like like windows
from there's a lot more paid apps on
windows phone there were a lot more
expensive apps on webos when it was
around yeah that's that's an interesting
point i was just trying to download an
app a couple apps while you were
speaking on the Play Store and I
actually couldn't get the keep shopping
button to pop up but maybe that's
because I was doing it on the note 2 or
maybe you don't have the latest version
of google play store right that's
probably what it was yeah because i
haven't used this thing in a couple
weeks yeah we know that's that's it
that's fascinating on a kind of a broad
level and i wonder i often find myself
wondering this about Google's business
model right it's like their their whole
thing is like get their content in front
of more eyeballs so that adds can be
served so that there's a bigger you know
they get more ad revenue but it's
interesting to see them like you know
you find other ways or appear to try to
find other ways of generating you know
income and maybe it's a it's a move to
keep the developers happier you know
we've here heard from them time and time
again like we got it we got to court
these developers because we need apps
particularly for the tablet
right right yeah it's a it's a it's a
subtle move towards towards that so
that's uh that's my quick little thought
I think I think that's that that that
button changes a little more significant
than just over there you know you're
tweaking the UI they're taking the UI
yeah yeah I agree speaking of updates
and jumping back into two windows phone
because it's our news leader for the day
because there's so much windows from I'd
love that there's so much windows phone
news is I feel like we spent so long not
talking about it and that was just this
massive dump of information there's an
OTA update coming in December to fix
Windows Phone 8 reboot problems or that
is the the rumor and Tony you wrote this
story and I've experienced a random
reboot on my lumia 920 the other day
really yeah and because I know I I
covered as I think it was one or two
weeks ago and it was specific to a
carrier in Germany and it was related to
the radio acting as a 4g / LTE radio or
a gsm radio and when I poked around in
the States some of the users so that
there weren't a problem in the US so you
did have some problem I did indeed yeah
and apparently so this is your story
says that these are reports of not only
Lumia 920's but also Windows Phone 8 x's
from that is juice yes interesting so
it's probably something in the in the in
the firmware you know some somewhere
deep down there it is it is very good
that Microsoft is working on this i but
i have a problem we always see that
phones are a little bit late to the
market and even if they are not
specifically late to the market the
period between announcing the phone and
shelf availability or let me even go
further back between the prototype and
the availability is dedicated to feel
testing to bug fixing it I'm sure they
can miss a bug or two but with random
reboots on several OEMs on several
models it's just something Microsoft
shouldn't have missed you know I and I
feel like all of the carrot this this
happens to all of them right I mean I I
feel like even even the Apple has some
their fair share of issues with with the
iphone surely that's right we talked
about the we've talked about that before
and
it is always annoying and it's kind of
every single company has it has this
habit now because it's the new reality
or the not so new reality it's been the
reality for a while of releasing
products that aren't ready yet and
saying we'll fix with an update
especially with Microsoft who is always
late to the market right yeah yeah and
it's it's been interesting kind of
getting to know Windows Phone over the
course of the past couple weeks and just
like getting into that kind of mindset
and I've felt at times that Windows
Phone 8 is a little undercooked and this
is an example of it at the core level
I'll look forward to getting that update
but it's not the only update on the
agenda because the there's this rumored
additional like a major Windows Phone 8
Update you know not that this is huge
news of its existence because of course
updates are always coming but I like
that they that the rumor is that it's
called Apollo plus which is the node 0
of Windows 8 exactly report a mango
windows 8 and the you know this comes
from a Twitter leakster of football for
PDA who's given good information in the
past and it's it there's no details
about what the update might contain its
supposed to drop I think early next year
and I think the big thing that
everyone's waiting on is Notification
Center right like I mean that's that's
the big giant thing that Windows Phone 8
is lacking for free geeks for the people
who follow the mobile space it's like we
could really use a notification center
and I wrote a story to the opposite
effect a couple weeks ago but now having
used Windows Phone 8 for for a couple
weeks I'm like yeah I don't I no longer
have that opinion and and as as you
point out Michael they're sort of you
can kind of configure your Start screen
to be your own little mini Notification
Center if you do it right absolutely
right and that's why these new small
tiles on the home screen are very very
useful and you know me I'm so sick of
talking about resizable home tiles I'm
Windows Phone 8 but its its true like
you me make a bunch of tiny little tiles
you put them into a little corner your
home screen boom there's your little
notification center the problem is with
apps like Twitter like the Twitter app
that does not give you notification or
it gives you toast notifications but if
the tile doesn't support notifications
in its small form so it's like well crap
you know I can't if I miss a toast
notification I should go in
the Twitter app to see it and then you
ask well why do you use the Twitter app
Michael you should use the People Hub
well I do but I have multiple Twitter
accounts and the people of doesn't set
horan multiple Twitter accounts which is
is it isn't like a like a power user
Twitter a client for windows phone that
it has like a really advanced or really
comprehensive live tile yeah I think row
we are rally or whatever rrow I is the
one I used last time around I just
haven't had time I wonder if carbon
there was a nap there's a twitter app
for webos called carbon and it was
beautiful and then they poured its
windows phone and it was all so
beautiful I'm gonna download that right
after i get off the podcast I'm actually
taking note on that well guys with the
shared quarter with windows 8 I wouldn't
be surprised to see I don't know
tweetdeck or seized make or other huge
Twitter applications for windows phone I
well I would agree normally but isn't
twitter itself kind of really not you
know kind of trying to get third party
twitter apps off the grid actually tweet
back i think is owned now by it by
twitter OSI yeah she's right yeah i was
about to say that i bet at mwc in
barcelona at the end of februari we'll
see Steve Ballmer on stage getting
excited about 500 features plus and a
below plus I just hope the following
think will not happen I just wrote a
beast today the Samsung I don't know
exactly let me just look it up real
quick it should be on the front page it
was the samsung focus to on AT&amp;amp;T getting
its windows film tango updates today so
come on guys I just hope this will not
ever happen in the future regardless if
it's a carrier phone an unlocked phone
microsoft needs to amp their their game
needs to have updates right now I mean
if any update is announced for may
deliver it in May yeah they need to be
timely and they also need to be
significant to the user what Microsoft
likes to do is come out and say we've
got these 500 new features 498 of which
are under the hood things you'll never
notice but 22 of which are slightly you
know people want like that that's why
that's why it's so fun and get a
software update cuz it like changes
sites almost like you have a new product
yes and and so we need more of these
features that are actually like you
WI things that actually make your
everyday experience better yes and
actually I was thinking about the
upgrade process to Windows Phone 8 and
it's so it's got to be so frustrating to
have worked on this thing because I
think the analogy that somebody
Microsoft used if Fred my apologies I
forget who said it you know what we did
when changing from seven to eight was
was like changing the changing the
engine on a on a race car in the middle
of the race without slowing down you
know and fire the pilot at the same time
yeah but it's it's like and that's so
true and it's such a huge accomplishment
but as a result what happens is they've
delivered an experience with Windows
Phone 8 very much like Windows Phone 7
that is a massive awesome accomplishment
but it is also not very impressive to
the end user who's expecting you know
from this full point upgrade this end
user that you're expecting like oh wow
would have they done to the UI Oh
resizable live tiles yeah you know and
of course there's more to it I'm
overstating the case a little bit but
I've just imagine it how frustrating it
must be to be one of the people who
worked on this and then to hear you know
like if people complaining that there's
not a lot different but anyway it's it
that's one of these things that Windows
Phone is one of these frustrations that
that Michael phone users yeah yeah do
you hear your Lumia 920 near you yeah
you have your do you have your segway
smashing hat on again yes yes I do I've
got it right in my hand what can I do
for you I'll make this relate and chip
Joey do you guess what she said Jolie
about to go ahead go ahead I I'm just
curious what you have on your Start
screen no i don't to hear everything
just you know can can you summarize the
top you know yeah the first screen there
yeah totally actually if you look at my
my story from yesterday five frustration
or five solutions to Windows Phone
frustrations listeners you can see a lot
of screen grabs of my lumia 920 yeah
I've got the people on me tiles are big
so that I can see them you know rotating
and doing fun stuff I've got a ton of
tiny tiles off to the right for my
notification center for phone and text
and email and other email and so forth
and then I've got Evernote and weather
and a couple calendars that's what's
living at the top and then as you go
further down it just becomes this
big array of stuff why do you have blank
spots near OneNote now that is a great
question because the like the impulse
rightist is to say I want to fill every
single square inch of usable space on
this screen with stuff that is useful to
me but you know what happens we need to
do that like it's really ugly I think
mmm I heightened it I think when you
pack the screen full of stuff and
there's no there's no negative space it
is just this massive and remember half
these live tiles are animating so it
just becomes this massive sci-fi panel
out of the future but normally I would
be into your Lumia is missing a tooth
man i think the missing teeth are are a
lot of fun but brandon you you would
arrange your your home screen
differently I hate wasted space I'd have
to fill every last pixel with usable of
stuff foot of help between two towels
yeah you're right put titles on top of
tile hey you know Apollo plus they might
do overlap overlapping times are they
gonna do card stacks for tiles um ya
know about they do some cubes I mean you
can he can maybe touch the tile and it
would rotate when it would spin hey we
could have HTC Sense from like 2063 up
the cube now I think you know I think
one of my favorite things about windows
phone is its beautiful design is the
modern UI and i think that the modern UI
looks really looks a lot better just
just personal taste when you leave a
couple of couple tiles unused or if you
use the official weather channel app
which you know times out from time to
time and then you have a blank space
there anyway so that is god I hate
Weather Channel apps it doesn't matter
what platform it is they're always
they're beautiful but they're bloated
and they bog down well anyway let's not
talk about the android weather channel
app is atrocious it is so bad yeah the
iOS weather channel app is actually
pretty good they and then the ipad
whether China up is pretty good but
everything else I gravy just it's like
the bits the biggest weather
organization I think and they just they
need to hire more app developers guys
can I go off topic for a second what
we're already there so please off topic
from the autopsy I just keep on thinking
about this
ever since weather widgets or something
weather-related appeared on phones why
would anyone use a weather widget a
weather app I mean just look at the
window and it's it's the current state
of the weather the current temperature
and it's the city or living in I look
out the window and I see what I wanted
to see well you can buy them to travel
somewhere I look it up over the web
right right well I mean it's for the
forecast to but but it's also
temperature right when I'm inside like
I'm ins right now I'm inside a four by
six padded booth that's inside another
room with no windows i am absolutely cut
off from nature and if i want to know if
I want to go get some more coffee which
I will do in about an hour you know it's
like I want to know how cold it's gonna
be out there so I like knowing the
current conditions Tony I agree with you
I I have windows in my life and I can I
can look outside and you know you know
the time of year you know it's probably
cold or warm I think that one of the
reasons people like having these uh
these weather widgets is because a lot
of companies have made them beautiful
especially HTC like the full screen
weather animations yeah I don't care if
you you know if you spend all day
outside it's just really pretty uh and
and there's you know there's something
about like clouds and sunshine on your
digital device that's kind of satisfying
personally I don't have them because
like you Tony I just look out the window
but I can see the draw they're beautiful
they can be beautiful they're rid of
what i really liked on the HTC hd2 sense
always had some animations full screen
animations when it was snowing outside
it snowed on top of your icons yeah i
was the remember that was awesome yeah i
was really sir and then the windshield
wiper would come down yes you still do
that on i'm pretty sure the latest
android on the lid on sun since four
plus i think so i'm gonna actually test
it i've got the DNA here while you guys
are talking because there's an option to
show full screen whether animation and
I'm like I don't want to use cpu cycles
for that crap but the case of a for the
case of this this demo I'm a scientist
thought that what it is for science is
the first science I always thought that
was really cool i mean you know for as
much crap as we give HTC for like the
bloat of sense and all that and for as
tacky as it is i'd really like that
windshield wiper animation
when listeners if you're not familiar
like there would be if it was rainy
outside the forecast Holdren was rainy
would give you little spots on your on
your flesh like splashes right like
you're driving along and you were
getting drizzle on your screen and then
every so often a windshield wiper would
come down from the top and like no I
mean it's tacky but I really liked it a
lot well Brandon is looking that up on
the on the DNA I want to stick with with
Windows Phone until we jump into Android
and the so anyway point is that there's
a lot of adaptation that is required to
go to windows phone from another
platform and you know i I've been
surprised in the past couple days just
how much I've liked the Lumia 920
because I think last week did you guys
ask me like so how do you actually like
it and I'm like yeah you know and I'm
still really annoyed that there's no
frickin Spotify app but you know besides
missing apps and finding other apps
really lackluster from from major title
you know coders I I'm really enjoying
the experience now because I you know if
I've gotten over the culture shock i've
gotten over the transition i miss a lot
from android still but and one would
argue that you do not need Spotify since
you have xbox music and I totally agree
to that but since you have spotify as a
cross-platform solution you expect it to
be there on Windows Phone 8 that's the
thing right now I'm not saying this is
totally just me beefing right this isn't
no i agree with you i see your point
yeah and but but it's it's specific to
me because of course we work in this
field and we're changing phones all the
time and the only way i can keep my
music with me all the time is via
Spotify the only are not the only way
but the easiest way right so blah blah
blah I'm just looking forward to some of
these some more titles coming over but
i'm also very pleased that um that
windows phone feels like home again but
it takes a while you know i think people
i think in some kind in some cases it
takes longer than a 14-day exchange
period to get used to a new platform and
that's you gotta put yourself in every
scenario you travel a little bit you go
concert you go out to do you know it's
so many different life scenarios it
takes more than often two weeks to
experience that exactly and particularly
with the use of the camera i had the
opportunity to take a great shot i wrote
a piece yesterday called three features
than the Lumia 920's camera needs right
now
and I in it I posted this shot from the
ferry boat that is of this beautiful
sunset of another ferry crossing in
front of the sunset it's it's an amazing
photo not because I'm full of talent but
because the Lumia 920's camera really is
beautiful but both combined uh-huh well
thank you but it's you know it's
disappointing in that it doesn't have
some basic stuff that other cameras have
like HDR like burst shot and and stuff
and that's kind of what I was
complaining about yesterday and I'm
looking forward to that update and you
can go on forever about how it's not
really a pure view and I've been
disappointed with it in in situations
where there's too much light because it
tends to overexpose but the quick
question Michael yeah you be satisfied
if the Lumia 920 sported the exact same
imaging capabilities of the 808 PureView
if that happened I would I would never
carry another phone I don't even with
the hump Oh especially with the hump I
don't care about the hump I think the
808 PureView handling yours your 808
PureView Joe leave I don't do that what
was your handling your 808 PureView was
really very surprising because I did not
expect to like that phone and I did like
it a lot and the hump makes it users if
you listen errs if you haven't used it
it's it's a very thick phone it's a very
beefy device feels like a bar of soap in
the hand but God so beautiful with that
polycarbonate in the eye no lectures it
creates another I was hoping for some
semblance of that picture quality on the
Lumia 920 and it's not there but I think
with a little bit of software tweaks it
can get closer to that it's just that um
you know with all this optical
stabilization my primary beef has been
if you use the shutter button to take a
shot you know how that creates a
momentary tremble in the camera this
kind of happens with all count all
phones which we have with shutter
buttons well it does that on the 922 and
I'm like why are you doing that if you
have this like unique one-of-a-kind
optical image stabilization why am i
still getting the shutter but here's a
question job related to this many many
many phones and many cameras applied
these types of effects or
countermeasures when you press the
shutter button halfway down and focus
did you try it like that oh I always
have press to focus first yeah and still
and still
yeah yeah and you know it's just like I
say it's not unique to the 920 every
every camera phone does this when you
have to use the button but anyway you
know I think I'm trying to use this as
kind of a jump in to talk about very
briefly how nokia has lost i'm gonna try
and pronounce it properly Damien dinning
is that correct he was the guy behind
behind PureView or I guess he was the
one who was that he was the company's
lead program manager of imaging
experience he's the brains behind period
which and Enys he's leaving and I think
the question is tenure at nokia is up at
the end of november was the word from
stevens story a couple days ago he's
member the company for nine years and
misty as Steven puts that there's
definitely a bit of uncertainty in the
air as a direct result of his
forthcoming absence I am this this
concerns me a little bit because one of
the big things that nokia has going for
it is is it's you know differentiating
factor is its camera expertise you know
and I don't think that they're gonna
lose that overnight I mean certainly
people leave companies all the time and
it's fine but it just gives me a little
bit of pause you know because I feel
like pure view is going to be a crucial
part of their efforts going forward and
I hope that they I hope that he's not
leaving because of some nefarious you
know reason I don't know well yeah I
totally respect Damien because of all
the reasons we know about and I don't
want to minimize his his knowledge
impact or anything else but i think
nokia has what is necessary to continue
on on this road on which on this path in
fact if I met Mei on which they started
off with damien or without him I mean
they know exactly where they want to be
they have actually the spear of you
which is in the 808 from what I've
understood is a project which has been
in development for like three or four
years before it got to the market so i
think they are covered for the next
couple of years i hope so um I I want to
jump to our final Windows Phone or
Windows story because I know Brandon
over there is just it's got to be like
taking notes at this point about how he
wants to dive into this DN
a discussion do you have notes and I was
taking them yeah camera handy I camo and
just oh and oh and speaking of yeah we
are our you know perennial reminder no
we're not going to do a video podcast
anytime soon sorry oh because guys uh I
just I podcast naked eye and I know yeah
weird but I feel more free that way I
can express in the pocket now no pants
our no pants I think in the next level
though all right I'm a Microsoft has
announced that they are gonna support
the surface RT until from how long
except in Nebraska Nebraska they're
gonna support the surface RT officially
until april eleventh 2017 Pete so people
are at the store and they're like listen
dude I'm only gonna buy this thing if
I'm gonna have support until 2017 right
but if you tell me it's gonna have
support I will buy it I don't you know
I'm like I'm fascinated by this right
because we're not even talking about the
surface pro we're not even talking about
their like the thing that is a closer
analog to up to a pc that might have you
know usability beyond can you imagine
using this product in four years yes but
i think we are reading more into this
than then it's necessary and i think
this is a common thing with with people
when they read this story yeah it's just
like let me make a an analog example
with windows XP I mean there were and I
think they're know there were updates to
windows XP up until a certain point but
support for windows XP doesn't mean that
you will get Windows Vista so supporting
the surface RT until 2017 will mean that
if there are problems along the way
Microsoft will fix them but this doesn't
mean that the surface RT will run
Windows 9rt know and I think I think
you're absolutely right and of course
we've seen how Microsoft feels about
supporting older products I mean you
know with everyone who's about to get
windows phone 7.8 on their Lumia 900
understands you know what what the deal
is with that but it's like I just can't
imagine using an eye a first-generation
iPad in 2014
because that's that's the analog here
right I mean that's four years after its
launch can you imagine using a
first-generation iPad now with its
current software load I mean my mother
uses it and she's like why are the apps
just closing and I'm like well it's
because it's it's it's crappily
supported on the newest software so I
don't you know I don't know it scares me
to think that that a product like that
any product in this field is going to be
officially supported I'm making air
quotes for four years yeah they'll
probably release some internet explorer
bug fixes security patches and stuff
like that probably firmer updates for
performance improvements battery life
and blue improvements probably service
backs to the office but that's as far as
it can go and this is my prediction yeah
and I feel like I'm my tone is crappy
because I'm not I don't mean to say this
is a bad thing I'm just saying it's it's
it's rather unusual all right maybe it's
not even unusual it's just strange it
just hits the ear strange because the
surface RT to me doesn't seem to be a
product that that will have an endurance
I don't see a lot of people having a
surface RT in four years beginning with
and Michael you're you're getting the
surface RT did you are you getting it
today or tomorrow I am Not sure it is
coming to me Brandon and I traitor
devices he got the DNA and I'm getting
the surface RT so I'm looking forward to
receiving it I think it'll probably be
tomorrow if you sent it to the way I
think you did okay and when you get it
you'll notice that the Microsoft logo is
almost entirely scratched off on the
back that's not because I was very
frustrated with it it's because there's
a defect oh well why don't we exchange
it we should I mean it should be covered
it's wrong yes this problem popped up
with anybody else or is this a defect in
our unit I don't know if there's a
microsoft store around here maybe i'll
take it in and see if they can do
something this one around me i covered
the buffers ones opening a true for now
i am very very curious and maybe this
time next week you talk about your
impressions and i'm curious leapster
different of mine I just weren't very
favorable yes I yes and Anna speaking of
Brandon minima not being favorable on
things and I don't I don't mean to say
that that is an unjustified position
then actually you were very fair with
the nexus 4 let's jump into Android
and because brandon has earned
approximately six million talking
credits as a result of being pretty
silent for about 10 minutes i'm gonna
say would you like to talk about the
nexus 4 first or we should like to talk
about the DNA first so i feel like
you're amped on one of them uh well i
don't think there's much to talk about
the nexus for the reviews let last time
I gave 10 reasons why I really am
disappointed with the nexus 4 I mean
it's a good phone and I in the final
review is up on pocket now you can go
and read all the impressions lots of
comparison videos nah man and i give it
a seven out of ten and a lot of people
are upset with it and and some people
were saying you know you know oh the
build quality you know how can you say
it's bad and then and I reply Oh have
you held it and they're like no I proved
it along I'm like hold it into the
comeback and and and tell me what you
think about the build quality on the on
the the nexus 4 cuz it's not as it's
it's it's not super great yeah you know
and it does look beautiful on film I
watched your review video this morning
and that you do have a couple shots
there where you managed to catch the
light right with the back and all those
that that stippled interesting blue
sci-fi kind of paint job under the
gorilla glass back there it's oh so cool
I I had a fit the other day I almost
ordered like I almost just had a
pre-order explosion on Google I was like
I did I almost went on google.com /
nexus and just ordered my own Nexus 10
and Nexus 4 because I was i think is
that was part of my transition of
Windows Phone 8 I was having a an
allergic reaction and it was like hell
yeah I was having withdrawal symptoms
from stock Android like get me back get
me back to what I would I know and love
and give me a wireless charging orb but
speaking of the pre-order experience so
the first round of pre-orders fix that
first pre-order experience was terrible
was abysmal where people would have a
shopping cart and then items would
disappear and then it would say no we
have them and then yes we do and then
some people got the orders through and
some people got the late and then
finally google said alright alright
we're going to make it available again
and this was a few days ago and so now
the button from notify me changed to add
to cart and
and like normal human beings they
changed it to say okay you can order it
now but it's not gonna ship for two to
three weeks or something but then people
were still having problems they'd added
to the car it would say this product is
not available so they screwed up a
second time I can I don't I cannot
believe it yeah Stephen shank has an
interesting story about an alternative
viewpoint about the whole Nexus
pre-order fiasco and actual ease got a
couple in there you should read it's a
pretty pretty cool piece and
well-thought-out piece from Stephens
like could some of this have been
tactical could some of it I mean some of
it was clearly is clearly going wrong
but is it is it exactly the way we're
seeing it and I can't encapsulate all of
his his story but you should go read it
listeners not you guys I assume you guys
have read it but go on it so the nexus 4
review is up I watched it this morning
and then there was also a comparison as
you mentioned the nexus 4 versus the
Troy DNA which I started watching and
then we had to podcast so I didn't
finish that video sorry darlin no let's
let's quit I think I think the most
interesting want to watch is the Galaxy
Nexus versus the nexus 4 because yeah
expect the expectation is that you know
with the s4 pro stock Android in the
latest and greatest that the nexus 4
would be significantly faster then then
the Galaxy Nexus and while it is faster
and while it probably is the fastest
android device out there it's not faster
by that much it opens apps about point
five seconds faster and as we know
faster is faster uh and and it boots up
faster it's it's about on par in terms
of web browsing speed which is just
silly because it's got such a powerful
processor the nexus 4 if it had the
stock android browser there's no doubt
in my mind that it would it would blow
away the Galaxy Nexus but that chrome
thing man I I just can't get over that
and that Chrome browser I'm in mind
already here I mean Brandon obviously
doesn't necessarily like the nexus for
Michaels indifferent towards it and I I
think I'm the only one who likes the
nexus 4 maybe that's because I have a
sweet spot for for LG I've always had
and I've always was the one giving them
chances when everybody broke them off
because of that build quality bad
support and so on and so forth
I'm just pretty pretty pretty upset that
it's not yet available in my region and
not even close to our region and this is
something which which Google needs to
address real quick i'm not saying open a
google play store for Romania I'm saying
find some partners deal with e Taylor's
put the phones out in shops because I'm
sure seventy two percent market share
for android is good but I'm pretty also
sure that they wouldn't mind at least a
couple of percentages in addition yeah
it'll happen I think they're having
production issues which is why you know
the the whole pre-order thing happened
in the first place and by the way I
don't dislike the nexus for Tony I just
I'm disappointed with it and I think
people's expectations expected more up
to check I I expected more exactly hmm
the hint word for the sonos giveaway is
frequency well you have you've had the
DNA now for a couple days how does it
compare I mean how do you and we know
how we can watch the video to see how it
compares obviously but what's feel like
you will have more favorable things to
say about the DNA and I think I think
that's gonna be display centric tell me
if I'm wrong on either of those yeah you
know I I kind of want to do a slow clap
for HTC here for the lot for the last
two years I've been pretty disappointed
with eight what HTC has brought to the
table but this is truly different and i
should say i've been using it over AT&amp;amp;T
actually for the last i got it on on
monday and it's what is it today what's
Wednesday I've been using it for about
48 hours and it works fine over 80 which
is really funny yeah it's all you have
to do is add an APN setting to make it
work over hspa+ and it's just it's just
fine and dandy over AT&amp;amp;T um awesome go
ahead I'm sorry I'm just blown away I
mean that's yeah it's really funny um
HTC did some really crazy awesome things
and it's really this one of the stories
where it's it's a sum of its of its
parts the hardware is beautiful its its
salt it's like that is you pick it up
and you're like this is an HTC this is
what they do they make good hardware
they did some amazing details on the
sides in the top and
it feels good in the hand and as you
like to point out Michael it's not a
phablet it's a phone and it feels like a
tall phone you know I'm totally totally
and and then you turn it on and you see
sense and you roll your eyes for a
second and then you notice that there's
the screen there's something different
up sweets it's it's more crisp and clear
and it's not like a knock your socks off
thing in fact i was talking to Tony
about this and I compared it to going if
you have a win a tense yeah one to ten
scale going from wvga devices of like
two years ago to 720p was going from
like a three to a 6 like it was a pretty
dramatic upgrade yeah going from 720p to
1080p is from is like going from a six
to a 7.5 if that makes sense yeah I'd
say like a six to eight but but yeah I
think you're right it's not as dramatic
it's not as notable and increase but it
all depends on your expectations if you
come to the device like i did with like
this this attitude of like 1080p screens
on a smartphone what are you trying to
pull on us industry you know and then
you look at it and it you actually lay
eyes on it is actually beautiful it is
notice noticeably better it well then
your whole thing is like well this phone
has changed my life you know for a
minute right and so and so so i was i
was looking for some ways that the 1080p
would change the experience but before I
get to that so so I turn it on I'm like
this the screens pretty darn good and
then I see HTC Sense and i moan a little
bit inside because the last time I had
an extended had an extended experience
with sense was with the One X and the
one x+ and both of those devices with
that silly crappy slow Tegra 3 cpu is
laggy and it makes it makes the
perception of sense even worse because
you're like opening one of those folders
that sense has which don't look like
stock Android they're kind of more
rounded edges and they have like a
visual style and it's choppy and you're
like this sense thing it's it sucks but
on the on the droid DNA with the s4 pro
and the two gigs of ram sense is very
responsive as you point out in your
review Michael and I totally agree and
interestingly you're talking about a
comparison with the nexus 4 and the the
DNA they both have very similar hardware
they the s4 pro they have two gigs of
ram but in true
if you boot up both from from a dead
from a cold state yeah from a cold state
and then you run a certain amount of
apps then you check the amount of
available ram with them running the
exact same apps in the background and I
did this test on the video on the on the
Nexus 4 you're using only twenty-five
percent of your RAM which is one point
five gigabytes usable on the DNA you're
using fifty percent twice as much sense
is using twice as much RAM as a device
with no interface so sense is still
heavy sense is still bloated but that's
besides the point that the DNA can
handle I think the blood of interface
yeah and that's the question right like
I mean if it does not noticeable to the
end user does it really matter I don't I
don't think it does but I think just for
illustrative purposes it's interesting
it is very interesting yes no I agree I
agree I think it's an interesting piece
of investigative work you did go ahead
so so I set up the phone i had my
contacts i had my email and i use it and
i and and you know it's it's a it's a
darn good experience it's all all
through and through and in fact when
this this device as the DLX or whatever
is released on ATT which I know it will
be it'll be different a little bit sure
but the 1080p HTC thing with the s4 pro
two gigabytes rim and it's got LTE on on
my home carrier 8018 TI might use it as
my daily driver I mean it's just such a
it's just it's a good phone and so then
there's this question of the 1080p
screen and it the DNA undoubtedly has a
really really good screen but where it
shines is in three places that I found
number one web browsing because you can
if you have Superman vision a really
good vision you can read tiny almost one
point size text from the complete zoomed
out view and those of you with like a
galaxy s3 you'll say well I can do that
too and you're right you can do that but
I actually did this experiment I took
the galaxy s3 and the droid DNA and
loaded pocket now and tried to read the
text from the zoomed out view and on the
DNA it was just very precise the text
you could read it on the galaxy s3 it
was a little bit more of a struggle so
so there's so there's that you can read
really small text if
you have to hit the eyesight number two
interestingly and maybe you notice this
Michael when you open the camera app and
you've got the viewfinder thing going
and you're kind of moving the camera
around your environment the screen is so
sharp and clear that for a second you
almost think that you're looking through
a piece of glass you know what I mean
yes I do know what you mean absolutely
and and part of that is an antonio you
haven't seen this so I'm sorry that that
you you can't have seen this yet but
when it when it's next to a device with
a different kind of display like like
the AMOLED panels on the galaxy note 2
or the galaxy s3 the color the authentic
color reproduction is amazing on the slc
d3 panel of the DNA and I think that
lens that that lends something to that
camera experience you're talking about
Brad's looks like you're holding this
yeah because the code reproduction is
amazing I I didn't I didn't think of
that so yeah yeah when you're using
galaxy s3 and you're using the view
finder thing in the camera app you're
like oh wow this this blue statue looks
like fluorescent blue it's kind of fun
right but it's not real life but on the
on the slc d3 it's just so much more
true to life yeah so so that's a second
thing that's a really cool effect if you
can go to a verizon store listeners
check that out just like hold the camera
up to something it's kind of fun the
third thing that i noticed about the
1080p screen being different is that
just looking at photos kind of like on
the ipad 3 and 4 we're like the native
view is almost the full resolution photo
it's it's a similar kind of thing on the
droid DNA and like the clarity you get
without zooming in is just remarkable
its beauty its beautiful mm-hmm um the
my buddy of mine lost his droid bionic
in a cab the other day and he's just
hacked that thing to pieces and as he's
always just going crazy on custom roms
and I'll you know he's he loved that
thing cuz it was a powerhouse that he
could tweak but he lost it so he's
asking me what what he's would he should
buy and you know of course we who reads
pocket now all the time and he's like
how about that I'm torn between that DNA
and the razr maxx buddy and I'm like
well you know what do you need and you
know this is a guy and I am going
somewhere with this this is a guy who's
doesn't use a lot of storage who doesn't
need a lot of storage and who isn't
frequently far away from a power outlet
and you know likes likes good build
quality and
as long as the bootloader is unlockable
he's okay so and they've done that for
the day night so I'm like wow you are
the perfect customer to consider the
droid DNA because those are the
shortcomings right storage and battery
life right and they're kind of for me
unless you really hate sense they're the
only shortcomings because it's such an
amazing piece of technology I love love
that phone and and when you when you get
when you unlock the bootloader and I
can't do it on this tester unit because
I've got to set a bit send it back I
can't wait to load like cyanogenmod 10
on this puppy and go crazy with like the
lightest version of Android possible on
this crazy awesome screen it's gonna be
it's gonna be the hot stuff that's just
to conclude some thoughts about the DNA
I'm trying to think of downsides and the
main downside is that the screen is so
tall and you point this out in your
review Michael reaching for the power
button is a two-hand affair getting this
unless you're that you're willing to
like shimmy it down a little bit um that
said you typing with one hand is
actually possible it's not that wide
like a note to where you you know you're
really strict although the note 2 has a
keyboard that can kind of go to the side
right umm so so one-handed usability
isn't ideal here if you've got small
chance you might not like the DNA but
like that this I I I am really happy
with what HTC is doing here and I think
you know this is gonna be there thing
for the next I think three four five
months is 1080p s4 pro two gigabytes of
RAM it's gonna come out in a variety of
form factors I'm just I a slow slow clap
all around and im so that's it
completely agree yeah you know I'm glad
that you got some time with it before we
had to send it back and I'm actually
thanks to a public thanks to our friends
at verizon HTC and everyone who support
them for forgiving it to us for a little
bit longer so we could do that but it's
not going to be the only one on the the
only 1080p panel on the market for long
obviously we're seeing a very very
pronounced trend that that 1080p is
going to be the new standard for
flagship displays and since you have a
soft spot in your heart for them Tony
would you like to to talk a little bit
about the rumored LG optimus g2 I think
I think we'll probably see this not at
CES but a 10 double
see and you'd better bring a droid DNA
yeah DNA with you so that we can make
some comparisons yeah i'm not sure what
to expect exactly from LG and that in
terms of where they're headed the
optimus G was a point where where HTC
has shifted something within their
design within their bill tuality and
everything LJ you mean LG optimus G with
with you I said I'm sorry so LG shifted
with the optimus G if they keep on going
with the same trend and deliver a phone
which which would make us speak highly
of it just like we do with the droid DNA
I think they have a chance of getting
back in the market but if the optimus G
will be the only thing which will be
buzz-worthy on the g2 orgy whatever G
1080p which will come out next year will
not deliver I think that that's gonna be
a chance blown you know and I think
you're right and I but I have some
strange faith in LG right now for some
reason cuz I the optimus G really
rattled my whole sense of how that
company performs and how it does things
and like it's like wow you you guys sent
me an optimist g and I thought well
alright i'll review it and we'll see how
it goes and then it really blew me away
and i think that's that's really
heartening to to you know see and i
think if they will bring the heat with
did with the g2 and it's supposed to
step up to a better processor they this
for prime yes for the crime tell me
about that please it's they just hit my
desk it's a branded so did you drenna
just flip the table it's the s4 prime i
think is the notch above the s4 pro
right Tony on this yeah it's two
gigahertz processor probably yeah yeah
oh my gosh this has got to enter our
vocabulary now yeah I bet the galaxy s4
will have something like that in an
axial form but just getting back a
little bit to LG I think similarly to
Samsung LG has everything they need to
have in order to deliver I mean LG's
screen technology is excellent they are
suppliers for Apple em and we know that
Apple is very picky when it comes to
screens they have excellent divisions
which are working on batteries and the
optimus G is an example for that so they
if they manage to collaborate all of
their divisions to work together just
like click with the optimus G on this
new phone I think we'll have three big
players next year and it will not be a
samsung let's save dominated market
there will be Samsung HTC and LG
fighting for that spot yeah I should
have I should follow up and say that the
s4 prime is actually for devices like
televisions they it doesn't have a modem
maybe it's a different prime or
something it's just rumors at the moment
the key takeaway here I think is that
they cannot out a product on the market
next March with the same Snapdragon s4
bro like we see today so there's gotta
be something after the s4 bro well if
it's the prime or the optimist or other
transformer it should be summer close to
2 gigahertz because that's where we're
headed at well this this might be apples
to oranges but you know they did we did
see that the earlier this is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 not the pro we saw that
that chip make the rounds for quite a
long time I feel like I mean that was
you know there were devices being
announced for that with that powered by
that chip firm well I bro that is true
but right don't forget the the new XE
notes inside the galaxy s4 will step up
the game again Wilson they will just
need to catch up to play catch up again
its just oh deja vu all the way we had
the galaxy s2 with the Tegra then we had
the galaxy s3 with the Tegra 3 and yes
for bro then there's gonna be two galaxy
s4 and there's gonna be a response from
Qualcomm and NVIDIA i love that we're
talking about the galaxy s3 already with
a guy feel for ya that one yeah it's
going well it's not too far when was the
the three announce third of me i was in
london third or second favor yeah yeah
right so so that means by februari we
should have picture all specifications
and so forth
um but yeah I don't know you know I'm so
it's so difficult for me to get excited
about about new Samsung hardware but you
know and that's funny because I'm I
guess I'm the one who always gets
accused in the comments of being the
Samsung fanboy on the team but suit
because I'm like buried and Samsung
hardware over here but it's like I still
I've never fallen in love with the
galaxy s3's build I love a lot of things
it does but I whatever what we'll see
what the four brings I hope they don't I
hope they don't do fake metal you know
fake metallic plastic no cuz that
wouldn't play well with bendable screens
yeah the bendable string thing well
speaking of will close out Android with
with one more samsung bit it's samsung
is is is is not just doing bendable
screens they're doing weirdo form
factors well I'm feeling 20 years old
again I love this thing Samsung has
revealed a dual screen quad-core android
flip phone now these are not you know
this is not unique I mean there are some
Android flip phones out there and of
course usually there for China or four
markets who stare Japan or markets are
really like flip phone still in a jam
yeah in Asia yeah and this one is is one
of them it is the schw 2013 which just
rolls right off the tongue and it keeps
the basic design of the w 999 Stephen
shank says so it's basically listeners
it's a flip phone that runs android and
when it's closed i love this design when
it's closed it has a big old screen on
the outside and then under the screen of
the home buttons like when it's closed
it looks like a small android candy bar
phone then you open it up and as a
screen of exactly the same size on the
inside and then it's kind of numeric
keypad which you know I I would love to
just send a couple texts on an Android
device with the numeric I will trade my
ass wait for this one what really
actually I don't love this form factor
me too i really miss flip phones we've
actually written a piece i wrote a piece
for pocket out called i really miss flip
phone um we grew up on this we did I
mean this is maybe the fusion style trip
you know before I finished reading the
story i was like i'm buying one and then
i got to the bottom of the story whoa no
we have yet to confirm the
2013's price it's expected to be
somewhere around the three thousand
dollar mark oh yeah get out of my face I
mean like and then the stance nah this
is very this is going to be carried by
by a very special set of folks who have
a lot of disposable income go ahead
Brendan hey having a fun fact mmm-hmm
fun fact / pro tip the so you just
talked about this t nine pad Michael did
you know that on all HTC Sense devices
you can toggle between a regular
full-size qwerty a t9 pad and a shirt
tight blackberry style keyboard yes I
did not know about the short type one
but yes I knew you could toggle it to a
numeric one that's thanks to sense right
right yeah and who would use that I mean
just tapping the the two key to get a
see three times I'll tell you no no it's
got t nine so you don't actually have
yeah but I don't use that because I'm
testing in three languages every day
right what most most other people those
people speak one language and like it's
for example you take like a teen and you
ever see a teenager or even one of us
from your younger on a numeric keypad we
get texts all day you know no thumb
cramps really absolutely so so you get
you get one of those guys you know to go
to a smartphone you're like hey here's
your thumb thingy back and I'll yes no
what would also like practically it's a
very good thing for one-handed use oh
yeah one hero typing on a full qwerty is
just the biggest pain in the butt in
history but one handed typing on t nine
is like out whatever you know I'm used
to this yeah I when I used to judge
phones back in the flip phone days I'm
like how awesome physical key feedback
on the keypad and because that was huge
like if you were texting a lot you
needed a keypad that was gonna give you
solid feedback my favorite one was the
870 from Motorola which was on nextel
which no none of you used so never mind
just to wrap up some quick iOS stuff I
feel like iOS has been we haven't been
intentionally neglecting it on the
podcast just there hasn't been a lot of
news there's a lot of news about
component apple chief fighting
Samsung about components and Samsung's
not gonna give them batteries anymore
and it's like I can't nothing nothing
would interest me that again on that
exact note today there's another rumor I
see another because there were like 375
in the past few weeks of Apple again
allegedly ditching Samsung as their main
primary chip provider so that's just
another rumor to go into the ark
category and into the drawer yeah which
which should surprise precisely no one I
mean these companies are in direct
competition and and you know if you you
can't compete effectively with somebody
or you can try but you can't really
compete effectively with somebody who is
in the consumer market who is giving you
parts for your competing product like me
you can do it it's complicated its wits
whatever I don't know I don't run a
corporation so what the hell do I know
but the point is iOS is once again
number one in the United States
following I believe Tony a giant black
friday push right no actually this thing
this survey was a 12-week survey and it
is up until October 28 so it doesn't
even have to anything to do with
November really yeah and i'm waiting for
numbers after black friday but it's this
is just normal Apple and Samsung are
exchanging first spots depending on who
releases the phone and when when the
galaxy s3 has been released and he was
carriers everybody went the android
galaxy s freeway and Apple's iPhone just
fell now with the apple iphone 5
everybody's buying the iphone 5 and i
expect these two if you look at those
two lines in the graph they're
continuously intersecting and they will
intersect again next year when the
galaxy s4 will come and it will go on
like that the interesting thing is that
it's not only about the galaxy s free
but it's Android so we're talking about
one phone by one manufacturer against
all other phones running android and
this is something which is worth
mentioning what what's interesting is is
that i'm looking at the graph right now
and the rim line is of course you know
barreling into the basement but it has a
very definite decline at the exact same
time the iOS line sky
rockets well that's six percent it's a
six percent turned from blackberry to
the iphone 5 and thirteen percent from
from android to iphone 5 interesting
early on and the windows phone has a
little little bit better that worries me
yeah that really worries very concerning
yeah we'll have to see how there's all
these things go go in the future it's
interesting like I think that that's the
most compelling thing and it's a shame
because I think this is one of those
things that were if we did have a video
podcast we could throw this up or if we
had more time to cut it together we
could throw this up on the thing cuz you
should check this out normally I'm not a
stats man but you want to look at this
story called Apple's iOS once again
number one in the u.s. from from Tony
from November 27th because if you just
look at this graph it's if you're a
visual person that's a really cool
indicator of the health of these of all
these platforms and when you actually
look at Windows Phone down there like
its mustard color down there between the
0 and the 10 it's really interesting
compared to these big to the to the
green and red iOS and Android fighting
up top but there's also something i
would like to just touch it bagus iOS
related and it's not on the schedule
it's about Apple and after the entire
executive changes with which were at I
think the end of last month we are now
hearing some new reports that senior
vice president Eddy Cue has fired
Richard Williamson exactly because of
the iOS 6 maps fiasco so the fiasco is
is going on is continuing the in
continuously going and increasing it
just started off at the top of the
mountain and it just became becoming
something huge by the time it reaches
the bottom I think when Tim Cook said
that they are committed to working
nonstop until they fix the maps and
deliver on the experience I think this
is part of it I mean either people who
don't see eye to eye with the direction
or with the experience or with anything
all right either you do it this way and
we fix it or you're fired and they just
keep on firing executives regardless of
how high they are their ranking within
the company right this is simply a nurse
and of course we're in the situation I
think we mentioned
last time where Apple's between a rock
and a hard place there I OS maps is
going to be released and if they don't
approve it they're going to get really
bad press and if they do accept it or
let it into the store there's going to
be huge migration away from Apple maps
and so though either way they kind of
lose right with the whole maps think so
right yeah I don't know yeah and and
Tony thank you for bring that i didn't
put in the rundown because i figured
that if if we were gonna have to talk
about apple and maps again I was gonna
like blow my head off but no it will
keep on talking about it until they fix
it it no it's no you're absolutely right
and it's it's it's a shame I'm
interested to see how Nokia here now
that mapping software keeps keeps doing
I'm I think at this point I'm just
counting down the days until google gets
a kid some maps app in the store because
I think it I think it will be in there
that'll be fun to use if that does
become the case we are going to have not
to over promise here but I think we are
going to have another story on in our
lost at home series right Tony are we
gonna get somebody else out there with
using using apple maps to compare
against the other platforms hopefully
yes yeah I have no idea what you're
talking about it yes make it HAP awesome
hey gentlemen I I had a hard stop at
eleven-forty-five so I have to bounce
off the good guys keep going and oh
sounds good man well we will we will
miss you in your absence we will try and
keep the snarky remarks to a minimum but
you can you can listen to the podcast
anytime after and let's say two hours
from now sounds good anyway our hit man
we will like it we'll see you later
Brandon right ciao so Michael just
answer your question we were talking
about nakia here and how well it was
doing I wrote a piece that 24 hours
before a 24 hours be after it's gotten
released it was on the fifth spot well
right now I cannot find it in the top
five it's no longer in the top five no
so I'm looking at the exact same link i
used up free iPhone apps and I just keep
looking at the list right now and i
cannot find not here here anywhere wow
wow i just keep on scrolling yeah we'll
see how it
we'll see how that pans out the there's
going to be more more iphone users to
take it because this is our does our
final iOS story before we get to the
mail call because we are going to do
mail we've teases of cool listener mail
today and that's that's fun but very
briefly AT&amp;amp;T in the United States is one
of these carriers that offers refurbs
these refurbished phones which are not
not brand new they've been factory
refreshed and then they're repackaged
and resold for for a for a discount and
this was a story this was your story
Tony from yeah November 23rd they're
offering the iphone 5 as a refurb for
9999 on a contract for the 16 gig
version of what is what is that a
savings I was that a hundred dollars off
that is indeed and it's not even that
it's the fact that whenever you go and
try to purchase an apple iphone 5 off of
apples online store or anywhere else you
will need to wait still for two weeks
and with the refurbs the waiting time is
lower so yeah and the price of course
the iPhone 5 is the last generation
iphone you can get the latest generation
iphone for a great price and if i
understood well there's also warranty so
you're all set i I think you're I think
you're right yeah which is crazy now I
want to talk about this in detail on a
future show because the whole refurb
question is endlessly fascinating to me
we never sold it when i was at sprint
back in ages ago we never sold refurbs
in the in the official retail stores but
you know we could get them for we used
them for service and repair replacements
and you know I I hate to say it but the
failure rate on those in my experience
was was higher like it was supposed you
know in the whole party line is that you
know no it's a want to take refurbs so
you just reassure them it's like no this
is a it's better than brand new it's
been sent back to the factory it's been
real it has is this kind of like retail
salesman BS but but it never turned out
that way I saw more people come back
with defective refurbs than I did with
defective brand new hardware that is
interesting yeah it also has probably
something to do with the psychology of
the consumer because some say I will
probably not use a phone which was
it's basically a second hand even if
they so sold it like a new phone but
there are those people just like like me
for instance I would prefer a
refurbished phone if of course the outer
aspect would be exceptional I know that
this was used this has been fixed and is
covered by the same warranty as a brand
new phone so I'm gonna buy it for
probably fifty percent less sure and you
get our money savings in it and if it's
not you know if it's gonna be a device
that you're gonna like beat around and
like if it's going to be a kind of a toy
a hobby device yeah I'm with you if I'm
buying a daily driver and this is why I
think unboxing videos are a thing this
is why you know packaging video Rebecca
Ching review videos or a thing because
it's special it's a special experience
to take your new device out of the box
for the first time in to peel off that
screen protector which I love doing on
videos you know but you know I it is
it's very very it's very special to do
that with something that is presumably
going to be with you for you know a year
or two if you're if you have exceptional
endurance yeah you know so anyway but
that's if you're into iPhone refurbs get
your butt over to AT&amp;amp;T if you're an
American shall we shall we do the mail
call Tony yes please awesome well we
have two pieces of listener mail today
both from listeners who have written in
before thank you again thanks to all who
wrote him this is from the whim in the
Netherlands who says it used to be that
Blackberry it was the platform of choice
for corporate and governmental use
because the secure messaging and IT
management tooling now with the demise
of the glory of blackberry people could
move to Windows Phone 8 he suggests it
offers exchange push mail and some IT
management tooling as well as corporate
marketplace how does this match to the
other platforms our Android and iOS
equal matches or maybe even better for
corporate use regards and thanks for all
the good work the wim wim thank you for
the message ah we've we've heard some
rumors over here in the states about
Android being used kind of thinking the
government agencies thinking about or
actually implementing Android devices on
a massive scale which is weird because I
think the problem the problem with
Android has always been presented as a
security
right because Cassandra is really is is
the most open OS of it's not an open OS
I'd like it proclaims itself to be but
you know whatever so Android is not huge
at least in America for corporate use
and but iOS certainly is and I think the
Tony talked to talk about this because
this corporate stuff I'm not very good
at first level I would like to hit make
just a correction i'm just looking at a
november 27 press release which happened
to be just yesterday and it goes like
this Apple's iPhone and smartphones
running Google's Android will outgun
research in motion's blackberry for the
first time in twenty twelve in the
enterprise device market according to
IDC so they are still there they are
still number one second thing of note is
that of course both Android and iOS
support luckily exchange and all the
tools necessary for a phone to be used
as a corporate phone within an
enterprise the question is and this is a
great question with research emotions
all the black barbie es and all other
platforms we were used to having an IT
department who would manage all devices
within that network now since blackberry
is falling and Microsoft is not really
gaining momentum blackberry made a smart
move they implemented and they released
rims mobile fusion will this mobile
fusion thing a lot is basically these IT
departments to continue to manage
enterprise phones and rims mobile fusion
only works with Apple's iOS and Google's
Android so windows phone is not even on
the list aah and that's what brutal for
them because Windows Phone wanted to
steal market share from from rest it was
their whole thing I'm not an analyst by
any means but I know that there are two
types of corporate phones usually those
films which are handed out to two
workers from the company and there are
those phones which which they're called
bring them in or something like that
they are normal users
let's say I have a phone I work for a
company and bring in my phone to the
company and that becomes a company phone
so Windows Phone can become a company
phone I'm not sure if they will because
exactly this because of the tools which
allow those IT departments to manage
phones within the company right yeah you
know I think that damn unless unless
Windows Phone finds a way to do as
you're suggesting and to kind of you
know come at it from the bottom like
that I I see Android and iOS kind of
extending their dominance of their
consumer space into the enterprise space
which is which is strange because if you
come to think of it microsoft owns
exchange so the exchange is the go-to
resource for enterprises it has shared
contacts collaboration tools emails and
everything and since it's a Microsoft
product you would expect microsoft
windows phones to be the go-to resource
as far as hardware is concerned and of
course Microsoft power tablets right but
sadly sadly Microsoft would there to
point something market share and trying
to figure a board meeting where the IT
department comes up to to the board
members and suggests platforms for for
future use within the company and I'm
trying to think about the points he
would make in favor of Windows Phone
yeah i know i can't i can't envision it
you know i will have to see how it
actually plays out and this is so far
afield from my area of expertise because
like the last time I actually used
exchange i think was speaking of my time
it's brent was back then again this is
like 2007 when i left surrender 2008 and
since then in the intervening four years
I mean we might use I don't know if we
use exchange for anything if anybody on
our team uses exchange but I do Brandon
uses so we have exchanged on the team
yeah i dont i I've been in Google Apps
for 44 years I've been in you know my
personal gmail anyway we're getting well
don't forget that also offerings from
google especially gmail and offerings
the free offerings from microsoft the
hotmail which is now outlook.com have a
certain exchange to them I mean they
support push notifications they act sim
larly and you can set them up as an
exchange account sure but it doesn't
have all the collaboration tools the
shearing tools which which exchange has
exactly or yeah we have one more piece
of from ryan field from California Ryan
hello again hey guys huge fan of the
show thank you I have a quick question
and a comment directed at Anton Antonio
popular am I the popular one yes Tony
I'm actually that the comment for you is
very long so I'm gonna leave that I'm
just gonna let you read that yeah and
actually Ryan says if you don't read
this on the air at least let them see it
it's about the samsung add push for the
galaxy s3 ooh but it so my question that
here's an instron question is should i
buy a nexus 10 i'm currently using an HP
TouchPad hopping back and forth between
cm9 and webos way to go right android
works at a media hooker level while
webos is about as useful as Michaels
webos toaster fantasy don't you see
solve the toaster toaster is sacred dude
as long as it was gonna say damn so I'm
really curious washer just like the
webos to refrigerator so I'm really
curious about the nexus 10 and with
Christmas right around the corner now is
as good a time as any to shop Ryan
that's a very good point and if you're
looking for a 10 inch device it sounds
like Ryan as you know is firmly decided
on this kind of 10 inch thing I have my
recommendation than a Tony I think you
can give yours my thing is this if you
need a 10 inch tablet and it sounds a
little Brian like you like you want to
stick with Android we don't have our
full review of the nexus 10 up yet Joe
Levi is well have it probably by the
time this podcast goes light right it
should be up very soon so you'll want to
look at that everyone will want to look
at that because Joe Levi makes very
soothing videos that are awesome but the
thing is I would buy it if I were you
Ryan given your situation I only had a
very brief hands-on time with it but the
enduring my unboxing it felt great in
the hand but more importantly it is a
Nexus device which means not only that
you know it's it's going to run much
better than well it might run much
better than your cm9 built on a touchpad
just because it's more modern hardware
and it's running officially supported
google stuff
but it is also probably going to be a
target for eventual porting of open
webOS as a nexus product so Ryan even
though it's not very useful right now
you know if you're able to run in the
future if you're able to run open webOS
on it it can only improve the it can
only add to the value of the device
whereas if you were to go for another 10
inch android tablet like something from
you know a galaxy tab or a zoom it was
ever that's what I was supposed to say I
keep on thinking since I heard this
question about an alternative android
tablet to the google nexus 10 and the
note 10.1 is as far as it goes i mean i
know their suits acer everybody toshiba
out there but i just don't have a feel
for them and probably the google nexus
10 because it's a google device and it's
made by samsung is the best combo you
can get agreed yeah and it's you know
and there's something to being part of
the the Nexus family and not having it
doesn't have it the nexus 10 doesn't
have a carrier radio radio and it does
it no yeah so there's not that's not
gonna come in and mess you up you know
it isn't get better from your nexus 4
exactly or you can tether from anything
you know whatever i don't know what
device you're carrying ryan there but
you can probably tell from it if you
want you know so yeah absolutely i would
i would give the nexus 10 a big thumbs
up there like I say watch the review
first but it sounds like it's the right
choice for somebody like you and that's
the thing just to reiterate for everyone
who follows us on Twitter and for the
guys who kind of everyday send me things
like should I buy this or this you know
this is such a complicated scenario it
is it all depends on your use case it
depends on how you use advice what kind
of person you are what you need from it
you know um 140 characters of Twitter
it's just not enough to make those
recommendations so I'm sorry it's not
it's not that we're ignoring you it's
just that we can't make the
recommendation we're too busy so um do
you Tony do you um have any other
thoughts on the Nexus 10 or anything
anything we've spoken about before we
wrap curious to read the nexus 10
reviews I'm waiting to see the black
friday and cyber monday sales numbers
just to see how the market share shifted
if it shifted how many million units did
this one OEM without naming one cell and
how many millions did the other one me
too yeah i'm looking forward to seeing
that debtor did you did you end up
getting anything on on black friday and
you know my experience here in this part
of the world was bad so let's stay with
that remain with that and no I did not
get anything this black friday because
there was no internet in Romania on
Black Friday everybody was trying to get
something ah that's rough what about
cyber monday does that exist over there

strangely I always thought about black
friday as being a day when you will get
deals going to the shop physically and
cyber monday being a day where you would
get deals online yeah well it turns out
that not even here not only here in
Romania but still in the u.s. to these
two things kind of mixed up and you can
get deals online on black friday too
