get to play with it today
Juan Carlos bag nail here for Pocket now
and let's let's see how Apple's a Ark it
can enhance your reality brought to you
by D brand I'm sure most of you are
aware but for those of you who might be
catching up on this new tech we have two
versions of reality enhancing that are
currently competing there's obviously
been a lot of buzz about virtual reality
which blocks out the world around you
fully immersing you in gaming and video
content by contrast to VR which blocks
the world around you AR augmented
reality tries to interact with the world
around you often acting is an overlay
for data and services and we've been
playing with augmented reality for a
while now from the original Google
goggle app to real-time foreign language
translation and for a number of games
like ingress or Pokemon go which aim to
enhance those interactions around you
recently we've been watching companies
take their game up a notch including
specialty hardware to improve that world
tracking capability Google Apple and
Microsoft all working on competing
platforms vying to be the champions the
future of AR while there are pros and
cons to each company's approach we think
Apple might have just taken a
significant lead in assuring in a
consumer AR revolution the new dual
camera iPhones the iPhone 8 and the
upcoming iPhone 10 already include
sophisticated world tracking
technologies depth information cameras
and the ability to scan your environment
in the past we have had a number of
criticisms for Apple and how they might
adopt new technologies it's pretty
common that they're usually late to the
game whenever something new arrives
especially for how they might polish it
up to incorporate it into one of their
mainstream products from a pure
technology standpoint that's the
situation we find ourselves in with
augmented reality Google has already
been working with partners for their
project tango system but where we have
to give Apple some credit is
incorporating AR into a mainstream
product see Google's tango has only made
it to two phones so far the comically
enormous Lenovo fab 2 pro and a phone in
the Asus zenfone line neither of which
really feel like mains
companies assuring in this new
technology and even for those companies
these are often not the mainstream
products from those companies Apple
didn't pawn off a are into an iPhone AR
or an iPhone 8 special edition or some
other tangents to the iPhone line it's
baked directly into the mainstream
iPhone 8 plus if you were a developer
working on some kind of augmented
reality application which platform would
you be more willing to support more than
just the functionality side of the
equation Apple solution here is
stunningly elegant and at the same time
addressing those form considerations the
function is better I took both of these
devices out to a park just to kind of
play around my office is a little
cramped so some of these AR applications
need just a bit more space I didn't
realize it when I was driving out there
but a park is actually a difficult place
a difficult arena to test out augmented
reality I just have this big sea of
green grass aren't a lot of landmarks
for either of these devices to latch on
to well I saw some skipping and shifting
on both phones the iPhone was
significantly more consistent at
locating objects in space and locking
them down to that particular location of
this wide open Green Park as I mentioned
at the top of this video augmented
reality is the future virtual reality
has incredible potential for multimedia
consumption for education and for those
singular experiences where you need to
leave this space around you but
augmented reality has the potential to
impact nearly every other app or service
that we might interact with on our
phones playing a silly running game
where I'm giving checkmarks that I have
to hit and then turn and then run to the
next checkpoint really gives you a sense
of what we could do with walking or
driving directions once AR can overlay a
map on the road in front of us sure I
can shop in an IKEA catalog by placing
desks and chairs in my actual living
room to see what they're going to look
like or use an app to measure my living
room so I can fit it with the perfect
couch for that space but as Microsoft is
shown us maybe the future of television
isn't in owning a TV maybe when I want
to watch Netflix I can just dock it to a
wall and have it live there I don't
actually have to run cables or have a
panel that
powered when I have devices that can
control or augment my reality personally
I've seen a number of headlines apples
AR not ready for primetime and I think
that's a little unfair we do have
something of a chicken and an egg
problem we've got the hardware and now
we're waiting for developers to catch up
and deliver compelling services for
consumers to latch on to but this is not
a technology unto itself
nor is it a technology specifically for
one line of phones we're entering the
post smartphone world where these have
become more commodities and less status
symbols the next transition will be
peeling certain services off of this
glowing rectangle metaphor a major
component of that is Apple's support for
developers as they get this amazing
testbed of people utilizing their phones
and maybe only in one-off situations all
of that data is gonna roll into the next
generation of products which can utilize
those services once we peel this off of
the phone and put it into a pair of
smart glasses or a heads-up display in a
car that's when we'll see the true
potential of a are realized but that
shouldn't mean that we don't get to play
with it today and while you're out there
augmenting your reality running around
with the phones to do that running game
app was actually pretty scary holding a
slippery wet bar of soap all glass phone
worse than that while I was crouching
for one of the shots on the lenovo this
phone slid right out of my pocket and I
managed to ding up the top edge of my
beautiful iPhone 8 plus what totally
would have helped is some kind of extra
grip or traction on the phone and that's
where deep brand comes into play is
they've got a huge collection of skins
in a wide variety of colors and textures
to help you customize your premium
gadget investments head on over to Dee
brand comm or hit the link in the
description below to start customizing
your gadgets so I want to leave this
video off with a quick question what is
the one service or industry that you
would most want to see rocked by
augmented reality drop me a comment down
below I'll be curious to see what kind
of apps you guys are thinking of for the
future of real-world data interactions
as always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full iPhone 8 coverage we're gonna
have some more stuff on a our soon
especially as I want to see other
companies responses to what Apple is
doing see if we can get some more
developers in the space and see if we
get some more traction on cool new
services for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos
bag now some gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
