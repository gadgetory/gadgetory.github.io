September 7th more rumors of a
cloud-based cheaper iPhone to coming and
iOS 5 beta 5 gets released all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm hi Madeline and welcome to the
pocket now I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's talk this week off
with a cool alright so mark September
7th on your calendar everyone because
this might be your lucky day rumors from
a credible Japanese source have it that
Apple will be holding their typical ipod
music events on September 7th to be
releasing their device probably on the
same day or shortly after could it be an
iPhone 5 or an iPhone for us but
probably could it be both rumors have it
that it could probably be both now it
could also be in following other rumors
that we've heard that Apple could be
holding the events in Argus someday
within this month and then releasing the
device some time with in September or
probably September 7th or it could be
that they will be holding their events
on sep tember 7th for releasing a device
in October following some rumors now
we'll keep you posted see what the news
bring along now speaking of iphone
release rubra something's been around
about a cheaper I cloud-based iPhone in
the mix which is why I tell you that
there could probably be an iphone 5 and
an iphone 4s being released at the same
time could this be a different device or
could it probably be an iphone 4 in
design but with different internals
probably less storage true yeah but we
don't really buy it and the reason why
is because itunes match wasn't really
itunes in the cloud it's the totally
different animal to bringing streaming
services to the iphone and obviously
there aren't unlimited data plans out
there so definitely customers would have
trouble keeping up with trimming their
music and being able to pay the bill so
if Apple were able to actually release
iTunes Match in a different way they'll
probably bring the iTunes replay that
we've been ruling on the past I review
and definitely work with carriers to
bring an unlimited data plan than yes
rumors could hope water but again let's
wait for September 7 see what comes up
okay so iOS 5 beta 5 was recently
released the developers and
no it was still over the air was kind of
weird that you have to delete all the
content on your phone to be able to
access the upgrade and then restore your
phone to iCloud or iTunes whatever you
chose but it brought some minor fixes
nothing really major but was really
interesting and cool was that users were
finally able to migrate mobile me to
iCloud just like you'll be able to do so
once iOS 5 gets released now if you were
mad because Apple canceled mobile me
after you paid 99 bucks for it it's
interesting to see that you'll be
migrating to iCloud and actually getting
20 extra gigabytes of storage aside from
the 35 free gigabytes that are also
included so 25 gigs for nothing is
actually interesting though we're not
sure if you're going to continue getting
it as of later only for a year as a
consolation prize but aside from that
Apple will be releasing according to
some rumors iOS 5 beta 6 as of Argus 17
for 16 or 18 it could be not really sure
but Apple seems to also be offering the
new ones speech the text functionality
on some beta but it was an iOS 5 beta 5
so we're not really sure if we're going
to get it as of beta 6 or probably beta
7 they're probably iOS 5 beta something
on the iphone 5 only time will tell an
interesting note this week has it that
will be playing super mario brothers on
our iphones ipads and ipod touches very
soon because bloomberg was recently
reporting that investors of nintendo are
pressuring the company to build ipad and
iphone apps because the nintendo 3ds
flopped it didn't really make it so it
doesn't seem that nintendo will consider
this because they'd really have to
reinvent themselves and not really sure
if that's going to be a smart move but
we're not going to complain about it if
it does work and if they do pay
attention to their investors let's hope
they bring super mario kart for
everybody ASAP hey i'm waiting for it
okay so on to some quick news you've
been seeing stark doing the seesaw
lately going up and down and well Apple
was recently crowned the most valuable
company up in the world after beating
Exxon and marketing cap and what's
interesting about this is remember that
the iphone is Apple's current major
source of income it's actually what they
sell the most so it's just to give you
an idea of how many iPhones are sold
every year and aside from that the
gizmodo cruise cheering up right now
because a judge
to drop the charges of them paying for
the iphone 4 prototype when they release
that are pretty much unvieled it but
interesting enough gizmodo now that
you're not going to be sued anymore just
probably pay a little bit of damages how
about if you send all your editors to
bars right now and don't come back until
you bring the iphone 5 prototype we're
counting on you because no judge is
going to end up doing anything to you
now now on a weird note just a week ago
Apple bought the domain Apple p khou.com
which was interesting but recently
they've just filed a new pen to bring
pico projectors to the iphone and the
ipad and you wonder why i mean pico
projectors have been in smartphones for
a couple of years already and they've
all sucked they haven't really made it
and we really don't know what apple's
planning to do what these plans could it
be that they're probably considering you
projecting things because the Apple TV
you didn't really do a good job in
bringing airplay not really sure and
remember that the iphone is not really
the best in having a replaceable battery
so not really sure how apple plants to
handle the amount of power that's
required for a pico projector but again
these are just patent filings it could
just be that Apple's playing around with
having the pans just so that nobody else
does it so
okay so that doesn't for the cool let's
continue on with the not-so-cool
Facebook recently launched an
application that works on your iPhone
and Android that brings you messaging a
separate messaging inbox that looked
exactly like what they had in their
facebook application only separate and
it includes your text messages and other
goodies but you'd wonder first of all
why did they keep the old you why of
facebook messaging I mean we've been
used to threaded messaging for the past
half decade so doesn't really make any
sense it currently doesn't really look
good aside from that it's interesting to
see that the applications bigs within
your contacts and shares your contacts
with facebook and Mark Zuckerberg I mean
what's the whole point of digging in for
my contacts if you're not even giving me
the option to share them or not this is
actually what gets people mad and you
know just to give you an idea you're not
really obligated to use the service
there's really no value as of now for me
particularly so my advice to you is stay
away from it until Facebook gets their
act up okay so if you got your access to
iOS 5 beta through ebay buy some seller
you might want to contact that seller
and have them update your current device
to a newer beta because as it stands
first of all apples working on blocking
those accounts that are only there to
sell access to the betas and not really
offering applications which would at the
same time block your device by the way
you'd have to restore and aside from
that Apple is also recently ending the
beta 1 and beta 2 so it will block your
device anyways you need to update your
beta 2 beta 5 or at least beta 4 because
those betas are expired so hurry up get
this working before you end up having
problems you probably are not close to a
computer to get it done that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high never you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
