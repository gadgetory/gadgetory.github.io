pocketnow.com and today we're gonna
unbox the LG revolution from verizon a
new LTE phone so sit back relax and
enjoy the show the verizon LG revolution
comes in a pretty nondescript black box
as you can see here it's embossed on the
sides it's black it's not all there is
to it let's go ahead and open her up
underneath we find the actual phone it's
a 4.3 inch device we'll come back to
that in just a second also in the box is
Adam notice for the battery the SIM card
which is already installed from verizon
for us and then underneath here is the
documentation mastering your device the
micro USB cable and the charging adapter
so really not too much to speak of as
far as extra accessories in the LG
revolution box we'll come back in just a
moment we'll look at the actual device
with its candy bar form factor the LG
revolution from verizon is a quite a
hefty device it's it's very heavy in the
hands it feels very solid it's it's even
heavier than my epic 4g on the front
here we've got the front facing camera
it's got by as we mentioned a 4.3 inch
TFT screen is what they're telling us
800 x 480 is the resolution now at the
bottom is are the very visible compared
to the galaxy s from sprint the option
buttons in a menu and home and back and
search as expected let's go ahead and
peel the plastic off here up at the top
of the device we've got the power button
and the headphone jack the power button
is covered up by a little piece of
plastic as well let's quit take that off
on the bottom of the device is just your
microphone port and then the back opener
on the back is your camera and your
Flash it is a 5 megapixel camera and
then you've got your speakerphone and
then your rear facing microphone which
is actually kind of great for devices
like this that our dues doing a 720p
video which is this is supposedly
capable of let's go and open up the back
here that lids on their very tight
underneath the battery cover is the 1500
milliamp our LG battery the micro SD
card and the SIM card but as you can see
here I can't actually pop this card out
with the battery in place pull this out
or get access to the microSD card and it
is a 16 gig micro SD card and then here
is the Verizon 4G LTE sim flash camera
this is the actual speaker hole here and
as you can see on the case here it just
lines up for just one little section
versus looking on the back to be really
wide speakerphone hole so it's just one
section here that's actually open on the
side we've got our volume rocker up and
down an hdmi port micronized micro HDMI
out and on this side we've got our USB
micro USB pardon me porch as well lots
of little plastic bits still need to
peel off let's go ahead and boot it up
now the processor in this device is a
one megahertz are 1000 mega is one
gigahertz Snapdragon single core
processor it's supposed to be running
Android 22 it's supposed to be having a
supposed to have a 3d a hard graphics
hardware accelerator not a 3d device as
we are starting to know 3d is it does
have bluetooth Wi-Fi all the usual HDMI
out is is an important item tethering is
enabled on this phone but I imagine it's
still part of the verizon plan as part
of that let's go ahead and slide to
unlock and as you can see we're starting
to prepare the internal memory and here
we are slides back and forth without too
much of an issue even though it's
loading some of these things up and kind
of locked up right there loading this
video view up we've got the lovely being
search bar up here I don't have any
comments about that yet we'll come back
to that later and then we've got this
standard launcher it's broken up into
looks like different categories here
we've got communication and media etc
etc compared to the epic side by side
you can actually see that the LG
revolution is actually longer and stack
them on top of each other you can see
that we've got a little bit of a gap
along the sides but not very much on top
of each other the they're actually
almost the same with the out the epic is
just a little bit bigger as would you
expect from a keyboard based phone
that wraps up our unboxing of the LG
revolution from verizon and if you have
any questions or comments please leave
them below and we'll try to get
addressed them in the future hardware
software reviews thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
