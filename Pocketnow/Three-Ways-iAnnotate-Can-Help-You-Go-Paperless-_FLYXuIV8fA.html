wanted to get a little more out of your
mobile devices I'm Taylor Martin with
pocket now and here are three ways you
can do that with Ino tape a lot of
people say iPads and the other tablets
are primarily geared towards
entertainment but I've always disagreed
I've always been the type to try to do
more with mobile devices to get more out
of them to create content and get actual
work done for mobile one app that's
extremely helpful in that sense is i
annotate from branch fire here are three
ways i annotate will help you go
paperless and get more out of your
mobile device I explained in a prior
video that I haven't owned a scanner or
printer in ages so every time someone
sends me a document to sign them into
turn I can't help but want to pull my
hair out
fortunately you can open a PDF or other
document type into iAnnotate add a
signature and return it if you need to
sign a lot of documents you can make the
process simpler by creating a stamp with
your signature and just dropping and
aligning it as needed of course you
could also use this same feature to
capture signatures from other people in
person from your mobile device
all without ever needing a single piece
of paper I also come across a lot of
important documents Bill's tax documents
or product manuals that I need to store
in a safe place using i annotate on the
iPad you can import such files directly
into the application for instance if you
need to fill out a w-9 for your employer
simply go to IRS gov either from Safari
or from the integrator browser in Ino
tape click the link for the w9 form and
open in Ino Tate to fill out the form
tap the typewriter button and enter the
corresponding info if you then need to
send the document somewhere that can be
done straight from within the app as
well being an annotation application
gives i annotate some flexibility you
don't have to just annotate PDFs you
could create a blank PDF to take
handwritten notes on which you could
also add comments images and audio clips
too if you're a teacher you could use
the highlighting tools to mark incorrect
answers or points of interest in digital
assignments and add stamps for grading i
annotate comes with integration for
Dropbox Google Drive Microsoft onedrive
WebDAV and box you can sync your
annotated documents with any of these
services or open them in a number of
other apps
like Evernote Chrome Genius can plus etc
have you used i annotate to make paper
jealous if so tell us how in the
