approach to Google Play a fiying your
existing HTC one but sometimes there's
just no substitute for unboxing the real
article I'm Michael Fisher you know what
I'm getting at this is PocketNow this is
the Google Play edition of the HTC One
let's unbox it ok folks so here's the
box you can see it's the same size and
shape as a regular HTC One box that you
would get from your carrier except we're
seeing the the Google branding and
obviously some different software
pictured on the front on the back flip
it around we're gonna take a look get a
little close shot of the specs that are
calling out here thoughtfully they've
not included the version number on
Android so that they can they don't have
to change the packaging every time they
ship the device with a new version of
Android this particular device comes to
us from HTC so we thank them for that
otherwise we're seeing very very
familiar specs called out here on the
back let's flip it on over and get to
opening the device up there's no seal on
this device so when we lift up on the
cover it should just come right off and
that feels like that's what it's doing
and boom not quite front and center but
front and side mounted the HTC One here
you can see obviously no carrier
branding on this wrap just
HTC One device feels very very similar
in the hand as you might expect gonna
put this aside for a second and see
what's included these earbuds don't have
beats branding on them but they are
finished in the beats colors of red and
black some little protectors here on the
side too to preserve the gloss now some
people like to see these out of the
package so just so you can see this is a
little rubbery insert as you might see
on samsung gear buds we got a call out
for left and right those things that
thing is sticky there and a little
button on the on the throat switch there
so put that aside and it looks like all
we've got left are a is a micro USB and
power adapter some warranty information
there but also some HTC stickers if you
want to go ahead and put those under
your car or maybe your soundbooth window
or
wherever and this is just some
information on inserting the Micro SIM
card warranty statement there and the
sim removal tool otherwise we've got an
empty box with the exception of the
extra earbud gels so let's pop this
aside get that out of the way and come
back to the phone here's the device
itself back front and center feeling
very familiar in the hand as we said
before we'll see we're going to take
this envelope off of here put that aside
gently so we can put it back in there
and no screen protector besides that so
here we are
HTC One Sprint edition on the Left HTC
One Google Play edition on the right as
you can see we're looking pretty
identical here which shouldn't be a
surprise to anyone at all of course the
real story here is in the software and
to have a look at that we're gonna see
if we can power this device on we'll
press and hold on the power standby and
see what kind of splash screen we get
there's the Google branding right there
and as this powers up we'll take the
opportunity to tell you that next week
we'll have some editorial and video
content on this device maybe not a
straight comparison between the two
that's nice but certainly certainly some
some coverage that we will do our best
to keep original for you as we always do
and there's our welcome screen prompting
us to choose our primary interface
language finished in the Android holo
the stock Android holo design language
not at all the HTC Sense skin on the HTC
one so very very quick and dirty
unboxing of the HTC One Google Play
edition which we will be talking about
quite a bit folks we're gonna have a lot
more on the Google Play edition HTC one
next week in pocket now so stay tuned
for that and make sure to subscribe here
on YouTube and follow us on social media

you want to find out how to make your
own HTC One a Google Play device or get
it as close as possible to that status
