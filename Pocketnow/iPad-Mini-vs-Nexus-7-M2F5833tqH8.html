pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to compare the Nexus 7 with the iPad
Mini let's get to it now both of these
tablets are competing in the 7 inch or
7.9 inch in the case of the iPad Mini
tablet space because people are really
liking these smaller tablet form factors
they fit into a pocket they fit into a
purse they fit into spaces that other
bigger 10-inch tablets cannot and most
of all they are lightweight and they
feel good when you're using it with one
hand so let's compare both of these
tablets first in terms of in hand feel
so let's start off with the iPad now
because the iPad Mini is significantly
wider than the Nexus 7 it can barely and
in most cases it cannot fit into a
jacket pocket or into a pants pocket
whereas the Nexus 7 can because it's a
little bit more narrow and and and it
seems to me this is the maximum width of
somebody's pocket and the iPad Mini has
exceeded that so that's a consideration
for you keep in mind that the thinner
width of the Nexus 7 makes it more
pocket-friendly although imposes people
aren't going to put their tablet into a
pocket in terms of construction let's
talk about the Nexus 7 first we've got a
piece of glass on the front and we've
got this dimpled plastic on the back
some people complain about the plastic
but the truth is the plastic makes it
feel durable and while it's
significantly thicker than the iPad Mini
it feels so good in the hand because
you're wrapping your hands around this
soft touch plastic I just feels like it
was made to be held with one hand also
if you've got smallish hands or medium
sized hands like me you can easily wrap
your hand all the way around the Nexus 7
wears on the iPad Mini it's still
possible to do that but it's a bigger
stretch now the iPad Mini is made from
much higher quality materials it feels
ten times more high-quality than the
Nexus 7 but there are some downsides
that we'll talk in a talk about in a
minute we've got glass and metal and
that's it there's no plastic on here
obviously this is the black version it's
got a nice beveled edge here really good
attention to detail the back is a
fingerprint magnet
as on the Nexus 7 no fingerprints here
so if you like to keep your device clean
you're gonna like the Nexus 7 but if you
like higher quality materials and you
notice it right when you pick it up the
iPad Mini is the winner in terms of
quality of materials and in terms of
enhanced feel again you can hold it with
one hand quite easily but if you try to
span your hand all the way across it
just feels a little bit cumbersome now
in terms of weight the Nexus 7 is 340
grams and the iPad Mini is lighter at
308 grams to be honest you really can't
tell the difference both of these
devices just feel so good in the hand
I've spent hours trying to figure out
which one I prefer and to be honest they
both have awesome one-hand usability now
one thing that the iPad Mini does to
help with one hand
usability that the Nexus 7 does not is
finger rejection so let's demonstrate
that and this is actually now apparently
common to all iOS 6 devices including
the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4s and so forth
so for example if we unlock the screen
here if you rest your hand your your
thumb on the screen like so you can
still use it it ignores that thumb press
on the Nexus 7 no such no such feature
exists so if I rest my thumb it it
recognizes it as a tap-in hold and it
does not allow you to do that
that said the bezel on the Nexus 7 is
stickers so it's easier to hold along
the bezel whereas on the iPad Mini you
get a thinner bezel and that's why they
added the finger rejection because you
really unless you have a child-size
thumb or you're a child yourself you're
not going to be able to hold it by this
super thin bezel now in terms of
specifications the Nexus 7 definitely
looks better on paper it's got a Tegra 3
quad core chip with a gigabyte of RAM
and it's the same Tiger 3 that powers
the HTC One X and many other phones out
there like the Asus Transformer Prime
it's not known to be the best performer
out there but it is quad core so it does
some cool stuff with gaming now the iPad
Mini has the a5 dual-core chip that is
found in the iPad 2
it's got 512 megabytes of RAM which
Apple doesn't want you to think about
because they say that the system takes
advantage of
those 512 megabytes of RAM just fine and
as we're going to see in some speed
tests the iPad Mini is no slouch now
let's talk about the displays on both of
these tablets the iPad Mini has a 7.9
inch 1024 by 768 screen that's the same
resolution as the iPad 2 making for a
PPI of 162 whereas the Nexus 7 has a
1280 by 800 resolution screen the size
is 7 inches making for a dpi of 215 so a
pretty big jump in dpi on the Nexus 7
that said both of these tablets are well
below the 300 PPI threshold to the point
where you can't see pixels and you can
see pixels but obviously they're smaller
on the Nexus 7 allow me to demonstrate
so we'll turn on both of these devices
and it's really interesting seeing them
side-by-side you do get a lot more
screen space on the iPad Mini but at the
expense of size it's wider it's not as
pocket-friendly and so forth so let's
take the chrome icon for example if a
chrome icon on both I'm going to bring
this in as close as possible and
hopefully it focuses and if you look
really closely you can see pixels but
it's a little bit difficult if we bring
out the iPad Mini and you look at the
same icon it's a bit more grainy it's
significantly more grainy yes but most
people don't hold their tablets this
close to their face and if you're using
in any normal distance the iPad screen
iPad Mini screen doesn't look really
pixelated if you hold it up close yeah
it's going to look pixelated it's not
like a Retina display but in terms of
comparing these to the the Nexus 7
obviously has a higher pixel density
display just something to keep in mind
now another thing to mention because the
iPad Mini has a resolution of 1024 by
768 it cannot play back true 720p video
the resolution is just not high enough
the resolution would have to be at least
1280 by 720 the Nexus 7 can play true
720p video in fact let's pull up the
same video on both tablets and see how
they compare okay here we are on YouTube
I was going to use the YouTube app but
of course the iPad Mini does not have a
youtube app there's a YouTube app for
iPhone but it would blow up the pixels
it really doesn't make sense so we're
going straight to youtube.com here
on both and interestingly we're getting
three columns here on the iPad Mini and
two columns on the Nexus 7 so let's move
around on the screen and pick a video
we'll just take the first one up here
assuming that it's an HD and let's make
sure we change it to 720p all right and
let's play them back this is going to
get loud but hopefully you'll be able to
tell if there's a difference in quality
they're both doing at the highest
quality possible-- so here here on the
iPad Mini you can't go fullscreen this
is this is my screen mode on YouTube
whereas on the Nexus 7 it's a bigger
picture but you have the navigation
buttons on the bottom now I'm glad that
it's froze at the same scene here
because this leads me to my next point
about the screen which is color
saturation the color saturation on the
iPad Mini is far superior to that of the
Nexus 7 in fact one of when we review
the Nexus 7 we said one of the problems
with the screen was that it was just so
low in color saturation and so let's do
a little bit of a demo so we're gonna go
into Google Images here and we're gonna
pull up the same image on both let's
type beach
and just by looking at these thumbnails
and by the way we're on automatic screen
brightness here on both of these so you
can see that the iPad screen is much
brighter now just looking at these
thumbnails you can see the difference in
color saturation it's pretty dramatic
here in in this view swiping around
that's a different picture the water is
just so much more blue on the iPad Mini
compared to the Nexus 7 that's one of
the trade-offs you have to make with the
Nexus 7 it's a cheaper tablet less
expensive which we're going to talk
about later in this video but the color
saturation is pretty terrible so if you
want the best quality screen in terms of
color saturation and contrast the iPad
Mini definitely wins but the Nexus 7's
display is a little bit crisper thanks
to that higher ppi okay now let's talk
about software and we're going to talk
about software in terms of performance
and speed because you already know the
difference between iOS and Android if
you want to be able to control your
experience as much as much as possible
Android is there for you if you want
things to just work and you want the
best app selection for tablets iOS is
there for you so let's talk about web
browsing performance chrome is the
default browser built into the Nexus 7
here it's a great performer and and
obviously we have Safari here on the
iPad Mini so actually I'm going to start
at the home screens I've got some
internet shortcuts here to allow me to
do a test more quickly so let's go to
pocket now see which gets there first
one two three go broke over the same
Wi-Fi connection here
and the Nexus 7 finished first all right
let's move around on the page well maybe
because an advertisement so let's move
around on the page both have very smooth
scrolling let's see which clears up text
more quickly and again you can see the
difference in color saturation it's just
more richer here that's a word more rich
on the iPad Mini so let's zoom in and
release and let's see which faster on
the iPad Mini clears up alright so we've
got an embedded YouTube video wait for
that to finish loading watching that
little circle spinning around okay and
we've got the pocket now Daley here very
good show you should definitely check
that out what's supposed to press play
at the same time see which of these
embedded players can bring up the video
more quickly want to go looks like looks
like the Nexus 7 no matter
and we turn the volume down here on the
Nexus 7 let's stop the video from
playing okay it stopped and let's go to
another screen we're going to go back
here okay we're back on the home page
and let's go over here to the Microsoft
Surface RT review there are a ton of
images and several videos in this post
so it should take a good amount of time
to load on both we're off to a fast
start on the iPad Mini pulling in the
page a little bit faster or watching a
little spinny wheel iPad Mini finished
first and the the Nexus 7 is a little
bit slower here let's flick down the
page as fast as possible see if we get
any checker boards or white spaces okay
I've got a little bit there not too bad
let's do likewise on the Nexus 7 which
actually still spinning we're just gonna
stop it there flick it down on the page
keeping up pretty well kind of the same
kind of thing with the iPad Mini at
first when you go through the content
there's a little bit of white space
there's a little bit of choppiness here
but after everything gets into RAM it
becomes quite smooth
now again let's do the pinch test here
and release let's do that again a little
bit faster on the iPad Mini
so iPad Mini has better web browsing
performance than the Nexus 7 just
through this test let's do one more
Internet test we're going to load up the
verge calm another image intense website
one two three go a little slower on the
launch on the Nexus 7
and Nexus 7 is actually okay the iPad
Mini stopped the Nexus 7 stopped and
then started again and then stopped that
was a title it's called a tie let's go
into this review here actually let's do
a little test of the text one more time
clears up much faster on the iPad Mini
there and let's go to the Nexus for
review and see which gets our first
again another website or web page with a
lot of images and content that was a tie
now the next thing we're going to talk
about is voice control we've got Siri
here and we've got Google now here both
of which are very capable in terms of
voice recognition but let's see how they
they compete we'll test it on various
different things what's the weather
going to be on Tuesday ok that was
exactly the same that came in at the
exact same time let's give it a tougher
one how much wood could a woodchuck
chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood I
just had to do that series getting smart
okay stop saying that let's see okay
stop next he'll toes Barack Obama
Google now a little bit faster here and
both of these display beautiful results
voice recognition has gotten a lot
better much much better we get these
beautiful results we get a card here
with brock obama's height and in this
case we get a little output from Wolfram
Alpha that just makes it really nice to
just consume some information there so
in terms of voice performance and voice
recognition they are on par ok so let's
conclude this with purchasing and
availability the Nexus 7 is one of the
best values out there at $199 you get 16
gigabytes of storage there are no
cellular data options the iPad Mini is
more expensive it starts at $329 for 16
gigabytes there is an LTE option on
three carriers now but it's much more
expensive why is it much more expensive
well Apple likes to think their hardware
is more premium and you can't argue that
it is and whether it fits in your hand
better than the Nexus 7 is really very
subjective the Nexus 7 is thicker it's
it is narrower it feels better in the
hand if you've got smaller hands but you
just can't beat the amazing build
quality of the iPad Mini now another
consideration here and I another reason
why I think Apple prices the iPad Mini
so high is app selection the app
selection for tablets and iOS is second
to none there are hundreds of thousands
of really high quality tablet apps there
still isn't a proper tablet Twitter app
for Android which is unfortunate so if
you want the best app selection that's
the premium that you're going to pay for
the iPad Mini but the Nexus 7 is a
fantastic value at $199 or $249 if you
want the 32 gigabyte model so these are
two very very good tablets it just
matters on sort of the kind of ecosystem
you want to buy into the options that
you want to have in terms of apps the
options you want to have in terms of
customizability both of these tablets
will make you very happy they're
extremely capable and they're both
highly recommended if you liked this
video please give us a thumbs up and
more importantly let us know what you
think about how these two tablets
compare that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
