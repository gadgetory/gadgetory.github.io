and take a look at the software tour of
the t-mobile g1 okay so first thing that
turned it on and we have a screen lock
screen that says press menu or on long
to place an emergency call or many to
unlock there we go and I have my
security pattern turned on this is an
option and we have to draw a pattern
here to unlock and there you go now if
you look at the screen here you can see
it's pretty easy to get my pattern by
the marks on screen there so it's really
not secure at all very easy to guess
might as well just not even use that
so here's our home screen and we have a
clock some icons people like this you
can go to other sides of the home screen
and more icons or widgets to there
there's a google search oops that happen
and you can tap it hold on it and it's
going to bounce a little bit and you can
move these things around you can grab a
bear and that's going to go to trash
turns red so you see regular icons on
desktop up here is a clock battery level
student strengths basic status by things
just like windows mobile at the top you
also get email notifications text
message notifications application
install notifications up here at the
little icons and in order to see them
you have to track down like that and
then you see a list unfortunately you
don't see calendar appointments until
after they've already happened so
there's no way of knowing what your next
appointment is here down here we have a
little gray button with an arrow that's
basically our Start menu which gives us
applications and you can scroll through
them there's a scrollbar indicator over
here and install a few extras
first I'm going to shoot keyboard mode
it's going to slide open and we have a
trackball can change selection of icons
the menu button brings up add wallpaper
search notifications and settings
connects those and I can scroll to this
little button over there the app
programs menu press that and it will
open now cool thing is I can all right
okay if I move the cursor in there I
could search for applications by typing
the first letters of them so I can get
to the calendar pretty easily
if I don't have anything selected and I
start typing something it goes to the
phone dialer and brings up that content
just like windows mobile and blackberry
so that's really easy waited to call
somebody
and there we go it's calling
so that's pretty nice
now so the home screen looks really nice
but once we go into one of these
applications it turns into just black
background white text shades of grey
orange highlight very large buttons for
your fingers but pretty boring design
there's gmail looks different white
background with black text a little
inconsistent calendar even more
different
text messaging
black background white text
white background black text
changes well that's it for now would be
part 1 of the t-mobile g1 software turn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
