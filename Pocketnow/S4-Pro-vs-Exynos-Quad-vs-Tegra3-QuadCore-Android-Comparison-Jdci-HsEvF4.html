pocketnow.com and we've got three
quad-core fast phones here we've got the
lg optimus G here the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core CPU we've
got the HTC One X with an Nvidia tegra3
quad-core chip and of course we have the
international Samsung Galaxy s3 with a
quad core Exynos in this video we're
going to see which of these devices is
faster in terms of benchmark speeds
opening the camera app browsing the web
and more so let's get to it okay the
first thing we're going to do is the
boot up test to see which of these
devices will start up the fastest and
it's not easy to start three devices at
the same time so we're gonna have to use
two hands here but I press these at the
same time and get my index finger out
for this one one two three they're all
being pressed they're all being pressed
and that was good enough coming on they
were all pressed at the exact same time
I promise you that let's see which is
ready first one X ready first with that
fastboot up and followed by the Galaxy
s3 and the last we have the Optimus G a
little bit slower than the others okay
so the first thing we're gonna do here
is launch the camera app let's try to
get this at the same time one two three
wow that was very difficult to tell I
think HTC the One X was a little bit
faster let's do it one more time just to
see it's really tough to tell it just
happened so fast on these quad-core
phones let's try it again
that was a tie definitely a tie they all
opened extremely fast so let's run some
benchmarks we're going to go over to
quadrant and run quadrant on all three
of these devices we've got these pop ups
here so we're to click run full
benchmark and hey we'll even see which
gets done faster
getting very good frames on all of these
about 60 frames per second and finishing
up here
all right and the results are in at
least for the Optimus G and for the 1x
and now for Galaxy s3 let's see the
score we get drumroll please all right
Wow
so the Optimus G smash the other devices
they're all very fast but 7200 on the
optimus G is quite impressive and second
place the 1x 5200 in the last place is
the Galaxy s3 with the Exynos processor
of course if we ran these again we get
slightly different results but we're not
going to run this a million times
let's just go to another test here this
time we are going to go to smart bench
2012 so let's open up smart bench 2012
here on all these devices and we're not
gonna do them at the same time so let
them run
okay and the results are in for the
Optimus G will hit the display index
scores they are also in for the 1x and
they'll be in for the Galaxy s3 in just
a moment let's see what we got here on
the Optimus G 5200 for productivity
index 3200 for games over here on the
One X we get 4,100 for productivity and
2600 for games and so we get on the
galaxy s3 here 4800 on productivity and
1500 with games so faster than the 1x
and productivity slower in games the
Optimus G came out ahead once again here
in this test this s4 pro is looking to
be quite the beast here at least in the
benchmarks and we'll do some real-world
tests in a minute here let's hit one
more benchmark before we go to the
real-world test of browsing the web
we're going to use an N to 2
okay the results are in and it actually
looks like the 1x1
we can kind of break it down here we can
see CPU 73-42
70 to 90 and 70 10 the weakest score on
CPU on the Optimus G in terms of Io
we've got let's see we've got by one
point the Optimus G wins GPU looks like
the Optimus G wins and for RAM the
winner is again the Optimus G but oddly
losing points their fourth CPU so there
that's another opinion of just another
benchmark so take that for what it's
worth let's go back to the home screen
and let's do some web browser speed
tests here okay so here we are in the
web browser we're in trying to get a
pocket now on all these devices at the
same time interesting to see if I can
actually pull that off
all right but the address is entered in
let's give this a go and see if we can
get them to go at the same time here so
we're gonna go need another hand here
right now perfect at the same time the
winner is the Optimus G followed by the
galaxy s3 followed by the One X we'll
move down to the page and we'll go to
the desktop version and see if we can
hit them at the same time and a little
late there on the optimus G because that
little bottom bar came up let's see yeah
let's see how they look on the page and
we'll wait for them to finish loading
and we'll move down the page
all right and the 1x is done although
these weren't at the same time let's
move down the page see how things look
see if we have any checker boards all
these devices have no checker boards or
whitespace let's bring up this image
here and we're going to click on that at
the same time and see which gets there
first okay all at the same time
and the 1x1 the optimist she crashed and
the galaxy has Theory came in I guess
that would be second place then right so
let's see which brings up this video
first if we get a play button there
there it is
it's another good test of GPU capability
how fast this video will appear let's
try it out okay
it was the galaxy s3 followed by what it
was the 1x but is actually the Optimus G
let's go back to the previous page you
know let's go to a different website
this time we're gonna go to Engadget
which is a very long webpage with a ton
of images and they're off going to the
mobile site galaxy s3 followed by the 1x
followed by the Optimus G here which
likes to slide around on the table here
let's go to where is the desktop site
here it is down here the small little
link let's try to get it at the same
time perfect
these are all very very fast devices I
mean it's pulling in the webpage very
quickly all of them when X first
followed by looks like the Galaxy s3 and
the Optimus G are about tie right now
anyhow let's move around on the page on
the 1x very smooth Optimus G came in
second it's it looks like very smooth
and very smooth
finally let's just see how long it takes
for text to clear up on this story and
release faster on the galaxy s3 and
we'll do the same test but with a
different story here and the Optimus G
up here and release faster with the
Optimus G and let's compare the Galaxy
s3 and the Optimus G here zoom in and
release a little bit faster on the
Optimus G so all these devices are very
very fast it's very clear that the
optimus g wins in most of the benchmarks
and I can just say from using all of
these devices as my daily driver that
the Optimus G feels faster than than
either of these devices of course a lot
of it comes down software if you're
running Ice Cream Sandwich or if you're
running jellybean if you're running
TouchWiz or sense or well whatever LG
calls their interface but at the end of
the day we're really impressed with what
the s4 pro is bringing to the table the
Exynos is is kind of a 2012 processor
but the Tegra 3 is sort of the last gen
tagra 3 processor and the One x+ is
coming out soon will do the same test to
see if the Tegra 3 has gotten faster in
it's faster iteration coming out in just
a few weeks and we'll keep an eye on the
quad-core CPU Wars Android phones are
getting faster and faster and it's
awesome if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
