pocket now face off again for dual core
world domination the Motorola Droid X 2
versus the Samsung Galaxy s2
alright let's kick off today's face-off
between the Motorola Droid X 2 and
Galaxy S 2
we're gonna run down some specs first
and will boot up and check for available
ram on both on our quadrant standard
smart bench and Linpack protests then
we'll run our unofficial speed test to
our gaming comparison I wrap this up
with our browser comparison so let's
kick this off Motorola Droid x2 weighs
in at 155 grams definitely the heavier
of the two offers a 4.3 inch qHD
capacitive touch display with a
resolution of 540 by 960 there is no
front-facing camera for video calls
below the display our four physical keys
main menu key home key back key as well
as search key on the galaxy s2 weighs in
at 116 grams again a 4.3 inch capacitive
touch display this one being Super
AMOLED plus resolution of 480 by 800 got
a 2 megapixel front-facing camera in the
upper left hand corner and below the
display you have to touch sensitive keys
main menu key back key as well as the
home which key which is a physical key
on the back both offer eight megapixel
cameras droid x2 autofocus dual LED
flash geo-tagging as well as image
stabilization video capture is 720p on
the galaxy s2 features our autofocus LED
flash geo-tagging touch focused face and
smile detection as well as image
stabilization video capture is 1080p at
30 frames per second the battery on the
Droid x2 1540 milliamp hour battery
rated at 7 hours of talktime on the
galaxy s2 it's a 1650 milliamp hour
battery where they did 8 hours and 40
minutes of talk time memory on our two
combatants droid x2 comes with 8
gigabytes of internal storage 512
megabytes of RAM galaxy s2 comes in two
versions either 16 and 32 gigabytes of
internal
storage both come with one gigabyte of
RAM processor on the Droid X true - is
invidious one gigahertz Tegra 2
dual-core processor on the galaxy s2
it's Samsung's Exynos 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor operating system on
the Motorola Droid X - Android 2.2 Froyo
on the galaxy s2 its Android 2.3
Gingerbread
alright let's boot up today's contenders
and see what we've got in the way of
available RAM on both and we got the
Droid X going let's get the galaxy s
fired up galaxy s2 excuse me there we go
guessing the galaxy s2 is gonna be the
first to boot up there comes the Droid X
2 as well yes - on the settings
applications running services then when
we got six hundred and twenty eight
megabytes 596 so we'll let that settle
down and on the Droid X - going to
Settings applications running services
give that a second to settle down
got 186 hidden in 192 now I believe
available under 92 megabytes of RAM
available in the Droid X 2 on the galaxy
s2 we've got six hundred and forty
megabytes of free memory so as far as
memory availability after boot the
galaxy s2 is our big time winner here
with six hundred and forty megabytes
available all right first up we're gonna
round the quadrant Center benchmark test
on both got a good clean start alright
let's check our results looks like a
2679 on the Droid X 2 and 3182 on the
samsung galaxy s2 so whatever the
quadrant standard benchmark test would
be the galaxy s2 alright and next we'll
run our smart bench test on both get a
good clean start alright so take a look
at our results I think we're gonna have
two indexes productivity index and games
index and our winners are the on
productivity index it's the Galaxy s2 at
3801 versus 28:22 as far as the games
index our droid x2 is gonna be our
winner at 2474 versus 2148 on the galaxy
s2 hey last but not least will run our
Linpack Pro for Android and our winner
is going to be the galaxy s2 with
megaflops 46.78 two at a time over 1.79
seconds versus the Droid X 2 mega flaps
thirty six point nine eight at a time of
two point two seven seconds all right
let's run our unofficial speed test i've
got advanced task killer on both let's
kill all the selected tasks or
applications and we'll start out with
calendar i couldn't tell that looked
like it might have been the droid x 2
that seemed to me to be the galaxy s 2 I
couldn't tell an Ellen either maybe the
galaxy s 2 there so quick as hard to
tell gmail that was definitely the
Galaxy S 2 contacts
well that looked like a dead heat again
hard to tell messaging I think that was
the Galaxy s2 but again very difficult
to tell let's try camera
now it's definitely the galaxy s2 it's
right third party
and again I would have to say that was
Galaxy s2 so overall I think the Galaxy
s2 is showing us that it is a bit
quicker overall loading applications
than the Droid X 2 as its should be
based on the tests and the fact that
it's running a larger dual-core
processor and also has a lot more
available ram alright we're gonna try
our gaming compare so I'm going to run
raging thunder 2 on both I'll try to
kick them off at the same time so take a
look at loads load speeds and then I'll
run a lap on each of the handsets and
we'll take the let's go with the Droid
x2 first you're going to doing this to a
camera so
all right
all right there's a quick look at the
gaming comparison on both the Droid X 2
and galaxy s2 running raging thunder -
alright let's wrap up today's PocketNow
face-off for dual core world domination
between the Motorola Droid X - Samsung
Galaxy s2 with our browser comparison
kind of both running off the same Wi-Fi
network I've clear the cache in history
on both the displays are both set to
default or automatic brightness they're
both running Adobe Flash 10.3 and I have
flash fully enabled on both and I've
cleared the cache in history on both as
well so I think I just covered
everything let's head over to engage it
on both and we're off up to write X -
got a little bit of a head start there
see if it makes any difference winner it
looks still looks like it's gonna be the
galaxy s2 troit x2 is right there galaxy
s2 is finished
very smooth droid x2 also very fit
finished and also pretty friggin smooth
that quite is smooth but pretty close
definitely the best contender we've had
to date for the Galaxy s2 in the browser
comparison so far as far as how smooth
and fluid the response is on the browser
and then double tap to zoom in and out
what I want to do on a double double tap
to zoom in let's pinch to zoom double
tap again get to rewrap you can see how
just how quick it handles that double
tap to zoom all the way out any
rendering issues none whatsoever
very nicely done by the Droid X - whoops
troit x2 galaxy s2 it's just just like
buttah nothing to it
double tap to zoom in and out however
the one thing you don't get is the pinch
to zoom double tap rewrap doesn't happen
there's a look at Engadget and again our
galaxy s2 is a little bit smoother but
not by a heck of a lot all right let's
head over to pocket now you find it on
both there it is my phone reviews going
on here and we're off look a little bit
of head start to the Droid x2 Galaxy s2
is coming on it look like they're about
neck-and-neck galaxy s2 is out in front
and now we've got to load all of the
flash and we'll see you can cut through
that quickest looks like the galaxy s2
is going to make it galaxy s2 is done
and again smooth as silk no problems
whatsoever double tap to zoom in no
issues whatsoever still waiting on the
Droid X 2 to finish loading pocket now
it's got a lot of the flash and it's
loaded there we go and you can see with
the amount of flash it's not here it's
not near as fluid as it was on Engadget
double tap to zoom in you can definitely
see it's laboring bitches doom still
works but it's certainly not as
responsive as it was let's head over to
the actual story itself
I thinking it looks like we're
neck-and-neck again we're coming down to
who can load the flash the quickest to
as the processing power and it's the
galaxy s2 double tap to zoom in and
still waiting on the Droid X to to
continue to finish lay the flash there
we go so we've got both of them loaded
double tap to zoom in but you can see
the galaxy s2 is handling the pocket now
site much better than the Droid X 2 so
anyway there's a look at our face-off
between these two and again I would have
to say our Samsung Galaxy S 2 is our
reigning and continuing to be champion
in our dual-core world domination
faceoff for Pocket now anyway this has
been Craig I hope that's been helpful
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
