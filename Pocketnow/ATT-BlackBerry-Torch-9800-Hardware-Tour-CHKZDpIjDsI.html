pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to go ahead and continue our
coverage at the blackberry torch 9800
smartphone from AT&amp;amp;T this research in
motion smartphone features a large
capacitive touchscreen on the front
which is similar to the blackberry storm
and storm2 on verizon wireless however
the torch employs a sliding mechanism
which reviews a full qwerty keyboard
which places it in the class of
smartphones similar to the blackberry
bold and the blackberry tour in the
first video Adam went ahead and did an
unboxing of the blackberry torch in this
video we're going to go ahead and take a
look at the hardware features closely
and compare the device to other popular
smartphones that utilizes the sliding
qrd form factor in the third video Adam
will go ahead and return so if you stay
tuned with us you're going to go ahead
and see the blackberry 6 operating
system in action along with some of the
apps and programs that are pre-loaded on
the blackberry torch let's go ahead and
take a look at the features the device
features a 3.2 inch capacitive
touchscreen which unlike the short press
touch screen on the blackberry storm and
storm2 you don't actually have to push
in to click on the screen all you have
to do is similar to the iphone and
android screens tap on the button or
feature that you want and it will launch
that application widget without having
to manually click in on this screen like
on a track pad on the back book the
torch supports multi-touch gestures such
as pinch and zoom double tap to zoom in
and zoom out along with kinetic
scrolling at the top of the device you
do have the earpiece speaker for phone
calls and also an LED notification like
to alert you of any messages or emails
or appointments that you have coming up
that require your attention the device
also has a light sensor to adjust the
screens brightness depending on the
ambient lighting level around you along
with a proximity sensor so that you can
make phone calls and the screen will
automatically turn off so you don't
accidentally hit on any of these screen
buttons while you're holding the phone
up to your face so the screen will
automatically dim when you hold hold up
the phone to your cheek
also on the blackberry torch on the
bottom you do have four buttons which
are grouped together in pairs the first
pair here is the cost end and the
blackberry menu button the blackberry
menu is contact sensitive which means
that it will change options and features
depending on what screen you're on and
which application you have launched so
these menu items will change dynamically
along with the apps that you're in the
second pair of buttons is the back
button and the call center or they call
end button which will also toggle to
turn the device off if you're in the
middle of the flight and need to turn
off your electronic devices and
equipment in the center here you have a
five-way optical trackpad which you can
scroll up and down left and right and
you can push in to select the blackberry
torch features a slim form factor which
is not much thicker or bigger than the
blackberry bold ND blackberry tour that
precedes this device the device here is
similar in thickness and also in width
compared to the blackberry tour that I
have here on sprint's now network the
keyboard on the blackberry torch
utilizes a contiguous key layout with a
raised and also beveled keys to assist
and typing which is similar to those
found on the blackberry tour and on the
blackberry bold like the tour which has
a red keys for the numbers this one is
all white keys and this keyboard is
backlit as well unlike the tour and the
traditional bold keyboard where the keys
are a little bit more raised so when you
push in on the key or pass in on the key
there's a little bit more travel to the
key these keys are a little bit more
flat on because of the sliding form
factor so they don't travel in as far
the key the keyboard is very comfortable
to type on and depending on your
personal preference whether you prefer
the softer more quiet keyboard of the
blackberry tour or
the slightly louder and more clicky
keyboard of the blackberry torch 9800 is
a matter of personal taste and
preference on the left hand side of the
device here you do have a clean form
factor except for a micro USB charging
port the front of the device has this
chrome border that wraps around to the
bottom and also wraps around to the
backside which is reminiscent of the
design found on the blackberry bold 9700
found on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile in the USA
the device also has on the back and on
the lower half of the slides this soft
touch rubberized feel to the device so
it is Matt and won't attract as much
fingerprint as the screen or even the
glossy chrome strip that wraps around
the device the bottom of the device has
a lot of chrome here and shows the AT&amp;amp;T
logo on the right hand side of the
device unlike the blackberry tour which
offers metallic buttons these buttons
are sort of encased in their own
membrane and our rubberized and has a
map feel to them they are for the
volumes up and down control as well as a
right convenience key like the tour and
the bold the torch does not have a left
side convenience key to quickly program
and map to launch your favorite
application or function the right
convenience key is preset to launch the
camera button it is a dual press key
which means that you can press and once
to focus and press and harder to capture
the image on the camera this key can be
remapped to any app or function that you
want on the top of the device you do
have two buttons one is for the screen
lock which if you press on any button
the screen will turn on but I won't be
activated so you don't inadvertently
dial or send someone a message that you
didn't mean to there's also a button
here on the right-hand side for the mute
button to meet your voice on to have a
private conversation with a nearby party
when you're in the middle of a phone
call if you need to at the top of the
device towards the back here you do have
in little
slit here which reviews the loudspeaker
to playback movies or to have speaker
phone calls if you want to have private
calls or listen to music and private
there is a three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack here at the top right
edge of the device on the backhand side
you do have a five megapixel camera with
autofocus and LED flash and the
blackberry logo on the ribbed rubberized
blackberry back battery cover to remove
the back battery cover all you have to
do is press in and slide the battery
cover down to reveal a 1270 milliamp
hour battery you do need to remove the
battery to access access the sim cards
tray here the device comes with four
gigabytes of built-in memory but you can
augment that with a micro sdhc memory
card so 80 and Research In Motion gives
you a four gigabyte card here but you
can add cards up to 32 gigabytes I to
access the memory card all you have to
do is slide it out you don't need to
remove the battery to access the SIM
card or the memory card which is a nice
feature the device also has Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS and an accelerometer to
automatically rotate the screen between
portrait and landscape mode here you can
see that we're connected to a Wi-Fi
network and the Wi-Fi reception bar is
shown here the device also supports
quad-band gsm edge as well as quad band
3g it does support HSDPA and HSUPA for
high speed download and upload speeds on
a TNT's network when you don't have the
keyboard or the screen slit up in the
sliding form factor you do have
on-screen keyboards in portrait and
landscape mode which is a nice feature
so you can utilize the device much like
the blackberry storm and use it as a
touchscreen only device if you like the
new non sure pass touch screen
and don't need access for the physical
keyboard here with these screen slider
out with the device lid out the device
is comfortable to hold it doesn't feel
top heavy as it may look with the screen
open so the device feels really balanced
and the screen sliding mechanism is very
solid without any creaks and it does
lock into place both in upward position
and downward position compared to the
blackberry tour here the devices are
roughly about the same size and roughly
about the same weight although this the
tour does feel a little bit lighter than
the torch compared to other popular
sliders on the market such as the palm
pre which runs webOS the blackberry
torch is a little bit taller and a
little bit wider than the palm pre which
is slightly more narrow the keyboards
are a little bit different as well the
palm pre does offer individual key or
island style chiclet keys however these
keys feel a little bit more membrane II
compared to the more rigid and harder
keys on the blackberry torch which
offers a contiguous key layout the keys
or or also a little bit more narrow and
scrunched in on the blackberry or on the
palm pre but not by that much compared
to the Microsoft Windows Phone the Kin
one on verizon wireless the torch is
quite a bit longer but a little bit more
narrow than the Kim one when the Kin one
slides open into place it's about the
same size as the blackberry torch in
height when the torch is closed when its
open the Kim one reviews are more
comfortable and spacious keyboard layout
arrangement with keys that are
individual island style keys and does
offer a nice tactile feel although the
keyboard on the blackberry torch is
quite nice as well if you prefer the
island style or the contiguous key again
that's a matter of personal preference
and taste
the blackberry torch offers the best of
both world you have the large capacitive
touchscreen in half vga resolution on
the front of the device along with the
comfortable traditional blackberry
keyboard so you do get the best of both
world Wi-Fi bluetooth gps accelerometer
proximity sensor light sensor and an LED
notification light or some of the main
features on the device the device also
supports Wi-Fi networks be g and n so
you do have faster Wi-Fi support as well
in a long to mobile broadband access
here I'm Chung win stay tuned in the
next video and Adam will go ahead and
run through some of the features of the
blackberry 6 operating system along with
some of the web browser and some of the
apps that are pre-loaded on the
blackberry torch thanks for watching my
