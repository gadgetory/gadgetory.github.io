and we know that but we're still going
to do it for three reasons one we're
fully committed to covering BlackBerry
10 remember we drove all the way to
Toronto for the z10 unveiling - we loved
physical QWERTY keyboards even though
they are becoming a rarity and three
it's the perfect time in the US because
right now three of the four of the
nation's largest carriers are finally
offering this device so now if my
talking let's get to it
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
in the bag is the blackberry q10 let's
get to unwrapping it we've gone ahead
and left the device in the UPS shipping
bag because part of the fun is of course
breaking into that and seeing what kind
of box we've got inside so let's see if
we can manhandle our way in here and Oh
a smaller box than we expected and here
we are now I've just sent pocket now is
blackberry z10 - hi Mei Rivera so I
cannot do a side-by-side comparison at
this very moment but that's okay because
this is just an unboxing let's see if we
can get into the bubble wrap here boom
there is the box with q10 called out in
this kind of nice purplish-pinkish color
thing blackberry blackberry along the
side looks like we're taped shut there
some bar code stuff and just some
copyright information in English doesn't
look like a whole lot of specs on the
back I'll go ahead and pop the tape here
and see if we can get inside to my
trained unboxing eye it looks like this
box may have been opened before
shouldn't be a surprise but that's
alright so then pop this off whoa I
think and I hesitate to say this but in
the Boston offices of pocket now we may
have we may never have had a QWERTY
keyboard a portrait QWERTY keyboard
unboxing Wow definitely no battery in
this device so let's go ahead and put
this aside for a second we'll come back
to it get our finger in here as I say
much smaller packaging than the
BlackBerry z10 that we the demo unit we
were given in Toronto at that launch
which had many things in it so maybe
we're not
maybe we're not going to expect so much
here so this is a Blackberry wall
charger so BlackBerry's is safety and
product information safety and product
information in another language a little
Start Guide here ah ships in the box
with headphones very very nice touch
that we don't see much anymore USB cable
micro USB obviously and the battery
itself coming in for a tight shot just
to show you the capacity and it looks
like it is 2100 milliamp hours nothing
further in the box so let's go ahead and
put all this stuff aside and get back to
the device before we take the battery
door off it looks like we've got a
protector on the back as well as the
scream checked on the front so let's
peel these suckers off always nice to
see an untouched back here slightly soft
slightly tacky to the touch a very very
unique test your texture on the on the
back of the blackberry q10 casing and
we'll bring the mic in for a special
screen protector removal treatment here
silence please now that's a beautiful
thing battery door slides off thusly
pretty easy doesn't take too much effort
to do that
batteries popping in here and everything
we're seeing actually so far what this
device seems to indicate that this has
not been powered on before so that is a
that is a good sign despite the fact
that we're late to the game looks like a
brand new device for us which is just
wonderful to see power button is on top
here we'll go ahead and give it a first
boot to wrap up our unboxing video press
and hold and see if there's any juice in
this battery yes there is there's that
power standby light just a quick rundown
of the specs on this device we are
looking at a 3.1 inch diagonal touch
display at 720 by 720 resolution that
gives us a pixel density of 330 PPI very
nice touch the BlackBerry not sure if it
reads on video but instead of being blue
on the z10 it is purple on the q10 for
the boot logo kind of cool there is an 8
megapixel rear facing camera the device
comes with with 4G LTE capability
enabled there's a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
inside obviously as we were told by the
by the advertisements within and the
camera is capable of 1080p and obviously
we are running the BlackBerry 10
operating system it is wonderful to hold
a device like this that is it's a little
wider to accommodate that keyboard but
it feels wonderful with that almost
tacky soft touch back and I believe this
is is obviously a Kevlar pattern I
believe is also Kevlar and I know that
these are stainless steel bands holding
the keys in place just a wonderfully
slick looking device prompting us to
input our primary language which we will
do off-camera and we're going to have a
whole lot on this device in the days
ahead
stay tuned to pocket now thanks for
