and hardware on today's event they get
new rumors on what to expect for the
galaxy s6 an apple begins enforcing new
app policies for developers I met iveta
and we could have made this a Microsoft
only event but we won't we're nice like
that this is parking out daily yes today
is official news day mainly Microsoft
based but we're going to leave that for
less for obvious reasons let's begin
today with Apple specifically on iOS
applications we know the company made a
big move to 64-bit processors with the
iphone 5s and asif everywhere eee first
developers are going to be forced to
submit applications based on 64-bit
architecture whether they like it or not
but this is mainly for new applications
going forward not sure how that's going
to affect old applications once the
64-bit move becomes full with every iOS
device but I'll see what Apple does in
days weeks and months to come the only
rumor is that we're interesting today I
have to do with the galaxy s6 mainly
because first of all we hear that the
probable aventa on mwc will be on March
second for the reveal of the galaxy s6
great but even more interesting if
you're wondering what new features come
with this phone actually what new
features are going to be taken away as
reports claimed that the galaxy s6 will
number one not be waterproof in any of
its variant even at the edge variant and
we don't know why probably because they
plan to launch an active barians in the
future we'll keep you posted as we learn
more okay fine let's talk about
Microsoft than everything that gone now
is that it's event today we're going to
divide it in three segments let's begin
with the launch of windows 10 for mobile
should we say the announcement we don't
have a technical preview yet it will be
available until februari as we talked
about yesterday but the coolest thing
here really is that it's free it'll be
free for Windows 7 users Windows 8.1
users for the first year and obviously
when those phone users now interesting
we won't be able to give you a showcase
of what's coming because a first of all
Microsoft was very scarce on everything
that comes to Windows 10
they showcase very little they focused
more on office for mobile which does
bring dramatic improvements but no we
don't hear about any hardware yet
probably that will happen until mwc I
really one of the bigger pushes at this
event had to do with Cortana on the PC
mainly because it's not just going to be
the same Cortana we have on mobile it'll
actually get smarter bring context
information from websites and actually
provide you with useful information like
for example if you look for a website of
a restaurant it will give you directions
to it and its cuisine in addition to
dietary information but another major
push had to do with the Xbox and how the
Xbox will now allow you to play a
console game that's on your console at
your TV somewhere on your computer so
your kids can be playing xbox games on
the console while you play games on your
computer on a separate display really
cool new features coming to Xbox gaming
but we don't know what the limitations
will be on hardware etc etc we'll keep
you posted as we learn more from this
probably the built conference happening
in April and finally for the last hot
news of the day because everything today
was hot let's talk about two new
Microsoft hardware products starting
with the new surface hub this is pretty
much the end of the whole surface
concept that was born with that big
table years ago the idea here is that
you have an 84 inch 4k TV that is
actually touch base stylus based voice
based and everything based you can use
it for conferencing you can use it as a
whiteboard that brings a new one note
feature you can integrate applications
to it and manipulate applications from
the hub that are right now sitting on
your phone which is extremely cool even
though this is really more of an
enterprise tool it looks like something
that'll cost anything close to ten
thousand dollars or more but even cooler
is the whole hollow lens concept
microsoft showed us their project b
which is really this a hollow lens
artifact which allows you to manipulate
things in the air you can actually touch
things in the air you can create
projects and then print them through 3d
a lot of really cool features are coming
to this hollow lens though
we don't know price points we don't know
usage scenarios mainly because this
looked like something that the NASA will
benefit from and that's something that
consumers could probably use initially
obviously that will depend on price
points what Microsoft mentioned will be
affordable in addition to again use case
scenarios and so many other things this
is not google glasses so much better but
it leads me to the question of the day
what was the hottest microsoft feature
for you announced today honestly in my
case it could range from the whole xbox
integration with the pc to the fact that
windows 10 for mobile will allow you to
actually use a Microsoft documents the
way they're intended to but leave us a
comment down below what is your case
