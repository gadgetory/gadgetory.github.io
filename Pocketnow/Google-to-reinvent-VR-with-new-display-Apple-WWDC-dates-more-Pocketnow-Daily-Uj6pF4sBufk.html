today have to do with that's an electric
saw Google and LG go heavy on VR with
their new high-resolution OLED VR
display Apple may be trying to fix the
home pod scenario with a more affordable
solution the oneplus 6 just went global
with pre-orders as of today I'm Jaime
Rivera and all jokes aside it is so hot
that the shiny forhead syndrome is
courtesy of the sweat this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
the 1 plus 6 you've seen our review
you've seen over impressions I did read
the comments I mean a lot of people are
like yeah I mean this phone can't be too
good but it actually is it's one of
those products that I recommend you give
a try currently pre-orders of just gone
global
same price tag four hundred twenty nine
bucks and you'll have it in 15 days I
feel that it is definitely a device that
should be on your shortlist
now for those of you that are wondering
just how important our entry-level
smartphones for companies let me put
this two in perspective nokia has just
that launched their x6 smartphone it's a
hundred and ninety dollar phone and it
sold out in ten seconds but because if
you start doing the math all the 700,000
units etc and everything that was sold
the company pretty much made a hundred
and forty million dollars with that
phone alone in ten seconds ten seconds
that is how important this market is for
Nokia at Nokia is really killing it we
can't wait to see if this product
expands is this was pretty much just in
China other official news have to do
with apple and WWDC as a the company has
just sent out invitations for an event
to happen on June 4th there are a ton of
things that were expecting obviously I
was 12 and whatever changes that's gonna
bring we don't feel that it's gonna make
that merge between Mac OS and iOS but we
could be wrong and that we're also
expecting hardware it could be an iPhone
as a 20-18 so stay tuned for that that
was will the spotlight over to the Apple
home pod current statistics tell us that
the company is probably going to be able
to sell three million units all year so
prospective wise that's how much Google
and Amazon are selling every quarter
with Amazon even selling more than that
so apparently the company wants to
change strategy which also could happen
at WWDC apparently we're gonna get a
Beach branded speaker that has similar
capabilities to the home pod and sells
for a lot less such an irony beats
selling less but yeah we'll see and
finally the most interesting nuisance
they have to do with Google and LG both
companies have teamed up to create this
new OLED display that's designed for VR
and they are specifically and the reason
why this screen is so important is
because of its pixel density 1443 PPI
that is pretty much double with 4k does
on you know currently the Sony Xperia Z
premium we're talking an insane amount
of pixels up to the point where there is
really no aspect ratio resolution yet
they're just calling it an 18 megapixel
display it if you want to learn more
about the specifics you can learn more
in the description most important and
today's question let us know do you
think that investing in a realistic
display like something like this would
help the RNA are take off in my case I
feel that it's not just the display I
feel that the experience of putting it
on is what's most important just firing
things up
currently I find it cumbersome to snap a
phone on a gear VR or to you know all
the process that you have to go through
to set up the HTC vive so if Google
would figure out a smarter way to go
through that process I think that would
help leave us a comment down below I
can't wait for us to see a little more
ready player one friends again if you
