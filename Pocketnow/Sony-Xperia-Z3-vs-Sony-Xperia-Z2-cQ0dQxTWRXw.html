reviewed the Sony Xperia z2 and yet here
we are four and a half months later
reviewing its successor the Xperia z3
while there's absolutely no doubt about
the fact that the z3 is an update to the
z2 well an incremental one and an
improvement over its predecessor
should you be disappointed that your
current z2 flagship is no longer the
Sony flagship should you go out and sell
your z2 in order to grab the new kid on
the block we'll try to answer that and
more right now I'm Anthony Nadia this is
PocketNow
and you're watching the Xperia z3 versus
Xperia z2 comparison video sony
committed to releasing a flagship every
six months and so far it has delivered
on its promise the z1 landed in
September of 2013 followed by the z2 at
the 2014 MWC in February and more
recently the z3 at the 2014 Eva and
September and so far every new model was
an improvement over the previous one
sony is staying true to its design
language to its roots the Z flagship has
changed very little over time and this
is also valid for the z3 those who
expect major changes should look
elsewhere hard as they might be the spot
there are some minor tweaks though but
nothing groundbreaking the overall
construction is still a glass sandwich
and aluminum frame for the body we still
have those relatively large bezels on
the top or bottom which you can either
ignore or dislike there's no way in
lacking them though or it's very hard to
find reasons to do so however similar as
they might be the z3 looks like Sony has
put the z2 on a diet the z3 is 0.8
millimeters shorter 1.3 millimeters
narrower and almost a millimeter thinner
at just 7.3 it is also 11 grams lighter
but these reduce dimensions they'll make
it feel unsubstantial not at all
the aluminum frame on the side is curved
making the phone feel much better in
hand than the z2 which had its rough
edges and corners aesthetically sony has
made other tweaks as well we still have
the top and bottom
mounted front firing speakers which are
more powerful and deliver higher quality
audio than before but their design has
been slightly changed the LED
notification has also been moved from
behind the ear piece on the z2 to the
top-left corner on this e3 the button
placement is the same as it was before
with the volume rockers and the classic
camera shutter button on the right edge
however the slots have been moved around
a little bit with the sim and microSD
card tray both residing on the right
side this time instead of one on the
left and one on the right on the z2 and
while talking about building aesthetics
the z3 has managed to also improve its
ingress protection ratings over the z2
while previously we had ip55 and ip57
65 and ip68 what does this all mean well
sony explains it well quote the phone is
thus tight and protected against low
pressure Jets of water from all
practicable directions and compliance
with IP 65 and/or can be kept under 1/2
meters of fresh water for up 30 minutes
and compliance with IP 68 this of course
if all ports are covered and flaps are
secured the hardware has also improved
while we still have a 5.2 inch full HD
screen the bezels on the sides have been
reduced to about 2 millimeters each the
panel is now brighter sony claims it is
quote the world's brightest display of
leading premium smartphones of course
with some disclaimers and while still a
triluminos unit the ex reality engine
has been tweaked in order to offer
better overall contrast and viewing
performance all of these really make the
z3 a better solution when viewing in
direct sunlight where the Xperia z2 was
really not excelling under the glass the
processor powering the z3 is a quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chip clocked in
2.5 gigahertz which is somewhat faster
on paper than the 2.3 gigahertz chip
inside the z2 memory options have been
kept the same meaning 3 gigabytes of RAM
up to 16 gigs of internal storage and up
to 128 gigs of expandable memory via
SDXC microSD card
the camera duo is still the same pair of
twenty point seven and two point two
megapixel shooters but the main camera
on the back has received some notable
enhancements over the z2
while the megapixel count has been kept
the same the lens is accompanying the
Exmor RS sensor are now 25 millimeter
wide angle Sony G lens and while talking
about the sensor low-light sensitivity
has been improved with the camera being
able of going as high as 12,800 when
selecting ISO sensitivity 4k video
recording is also supported in case you
are wondering audio output has been
improved both for the front firing
speakers as well as via headphones the
volume is still a little bit on the
lower end with headphones like on the z2
and we'd appreciate the availability of
just one or two notches but the z3 no
longer comes with the noise-canceling
headset the z2 was bundled with instead
you get a pair of Sony MH 750 headphones
which sound just as good if not better
with some software tweaks enabled but
sadly won't kill environmental noise
beyond the construction of the standard
in ear canal headphone software wise
those of you familiar with Sony's
offerings will feel right at home with
the z3 just like they did with the z2
the company's own custom user interface
is running on top of android 4.4.4 and
it's a newer version of the UI with
larger icons opposed to the smaller
icons and Sony's UI running on top of
4.4.2 on the z2 other than that and a
couple of tweaked widgets everything is
similar
including the app tray which slides your
panels to the right then reveals a
special menu when scrolled all the way
to the left the camera application is
also the same with some special modes
being added as well as the ability for a
user to download additional shooting
modes and apps steady shot Sony's own
digital image stabilization now gets
three setting toggles for off standard
and intelligent active instead of just
an on/off toggle switch before on the z2
manual mode has some hidden changes as
well with the ability to only go up to
ISO 3200 manually and the addition of a
face metering mode if the faster
processor wouldn't be
typically called out on a spec sheet we
wouldn't even notice there's no
difference between the Z 3 and the Z 2
when performing day-to-day tasks we can
discern the difference while playing
games either both generations are
powered by the MSM 89 74 pro chip which
is the snapdragon 801 the only
difference is that the z3 is barred by
the AC bryant and the z2 by the a/b
version that and two hundred megahertz
and the z3 favor while it is too early
to tell battery performance on the z3
yet we are curious to see whether it
will be worse than on the z2 for
starters it is 100 million powers
smaller than the 32 hundred million
power battery and inside this e3 couple
that with the brighter screen and the
faster processor and the z3 has every
chance of performing worse on paper that
is except if the AC version of the chip
we mentioned before doesn't make a
difference with improved power
efficiency we'll have to wait for our
full review to judge battery life cool
quality though is identical with clear
sound you will still have to disable
microphone noise cancellation on the z3
just like on the z2 should the people
you talk to inform you that you sound
terrible but the switch is an easy fix
speaker film is louder with more oomph
and richer sound than the z3 and the
camera delivers similar results on the
regular shooting conditions it's the low
light performance that makes a
difference and we're sure that it is
thanks to the new lens paired with that
insane ISO rating that the z3
outperforms the z2 not by a large margin
though and not in the sensitivity itself
or the capability of amplifying even the
slightest light source but by the level
of detail found in low-light images even
under regular circumstances images
captured with the z3 appeared to be
sharper though the color balance we
found to be sometimes a little bit off
when viewing images individually and
away from the scene or subject you are
shooting they look good but they seem to
not stay true to reality something which
only the author of the images can tell
and something were sure Sony can easily
fix with a software badge well time to
draw a conclusion and the
would be easier if we look at the z3 by
itself and not compared to its
predecessor question is if you already
have a z2 should you upgrade to the z3
if you are diehard Sony fan and you have
to have the latest than by all means in
any other case while the z3 is
definitely step up from the z2 you might
want to wait for the z4 chances are that
improvements on the z3 won't impress you
that much coming from the z2 you'll be
giving up on a brighter screen yeah a
camera that has been somewhat improved
not that the previous iteration was a
slouch a slightly faster processor which
will bring you unnoticeable speed
increase and about a millimeter of
thickness the z2 remains a flagship
phone that can stand on its own while
the z3 builds on that slightly improving
it in certain aspects bottom line you
cannot go wrong with neither of the two
folks stay tuned to pocket now as we'll
have lots more on the sony xperia z3
including comparisons with other
flagships devices from the competition
and our full review coming next week
