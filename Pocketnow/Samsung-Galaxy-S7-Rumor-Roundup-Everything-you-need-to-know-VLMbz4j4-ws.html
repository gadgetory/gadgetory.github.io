at all trade shows the Samsung Galaxy s7
is definitely one of the most
anticipated one and samsung has a tall
order here as the company needs to prove
itself once again that it can definitely
be the best seller smartphones with this
particular phone and just as we prepared
a little rumor round of a few days ago
we thought we'd do the same on video
today I'm hiding that even I was pocket
now here with a rumor roundup of the
Samsung Galaxy s7 we were not expecting
many changes for the Galaxy s7 and that
will be the case mostly for the regular
variant it seems that it'll support the
same 5.1 inch display in addition to the
fact that from the front the phone will
most likely look the same but then from
the back it seems that it'll be pouring
the same back that we saw with the
galaxy note5 with curves which is great
for ergonomics but then in the case of
the edge variant apparently the boat is
getting taller 5.5 inches in addition to
curves at the back so we wonder exactly
how that phone will feel for one-handed
usability even if that's considered
possible then again this doesn't really
launched in the phablet territory if
you've ever held a galaxy s6 edge+ you
know that bill doesn't really feel that
big in the head because of the edges so
this could be a very interesting design
change that we are really looking
forward to testing then when it comes to
hardware specifications we aren't
expecting major changes but the usual
boost for gigs of RAM in addition two
options for 32 and 64 gigs of storage
and there's more to talk about there but
we'll leave it for a future segment
probably the coolest change here is the
processor options a custom-made
Snapdragon 820 processor that was built
in collaboration with Samsung and
Qualcomm is probably an option in
addition to the Exynos 88-90 and it
seems that users might get the option to
choose but then other rumors mention
that it will be for US carriers when it
comes to the Snapdragon and then the X
and O's will be for the rest of the
world stay tuned on that rumor as well
and then when it comes to software
apparently the usual pet peeve continues
TouchWiz will make it again on top of a
new version of Android six dot 0 dot one
we're not expecting many changes here
and it makes sense i mean TouchWiz was
rather good with the galaxy s6 and what
the theme store it just wouldn't make
sense for the company to make major
changes but then again we would love to
see
again a more skilled packed version of
TouchWiz we are hearing something that
has to do with 360 for this unpacked
event as well we're not really sure if
it's a 360 camera mode we're not really
sure if it's I don't know it has
something to do with 360 others are I
don't know assuming that it has to do
with a gear VR 360 so stay tuned we
can't wait to unveil this one now let's
focus on the improvements that are
rumored for the galaxy s7 starting with
battery life we hated that on the
galaxies of 2015 and apparently the
company is bringing a 3000 milliamp hour
battery on the basic galaxy s7 and then
the edge variance will get a 3600
milliamp hour battery that is a major
boost and hopefully but the performance
changes on the new Exynos processor and
the snapdragon that would mean a lot
other complaints had to do with the lack
of expandability and we hear that you
will be getting the expandability
options through an expanded sim tray
which is also great news other
improvements we here have to do with the
camera in a very odd way we hear that
the mega pixels are actually scaling
down to 12 megapixels but apparently
you're getting F 1.7 aperture which
could mean a lot and in addition to that
it seems that we are getting some sort
of a pressure-sensitive display though
those rumors got the bunked early it
could be that we're not but apparently
these changes also include an always-on
display and for the pioneer of ammo LED
panels it makes all the sense in the
world for samsung to finally bring this
mode here but finally let's end the
rumor roundup with our tallest
prediction which would be that there is
one more thing that we don't know about
companies have done an amazing job at
keeping their phones a secret even
though we do see a lot of hardware leaks
Samsung has a big challenge this year
there are great bones coming to the
market a lot of competition and Samsung
wants to regain its limelight the
biggest question that I leave for you on
the table in the comments down below is
what do you think that major change will
be what do you think Samsung will bring
to the Galaxy s7 that would make it a
complete success because in my case I do
believe that it will be that the company
will think twice about the price tag I
believe that samsung will probably play
a little lower with these new galaxies
in a way to just make it so competitive
people will not look away but hey leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know what your opinion is that's it for
