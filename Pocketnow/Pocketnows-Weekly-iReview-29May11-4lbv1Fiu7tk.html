notifications widgets and more iCloud
ascent to be an online mirror of your
iTunes account and it's still uncertain
if WWDC will bring another iphone or not
all this and more coming up right now
hello everybody I'm Jaime metal iveta
and welcome to the pocket nail I review
the show we go through all this week
school and the not-so-cool is hard the
world of Apple's iOS devices let's talk
this week off with the cool WWDC seems
to be a mixed bag this year rumors have
it that iOS 5 will be true to the number
change and become an evolutionary OS now
what are we expecting well rumors have
it that we will have a revamp in the
notification system Apple will finally
cash in on the higher of that webOS guru
that brought the very famous webOS
notification systems to iOS in a very
fancy manner though not know what to
expect and aside from that well drumroll
we are hopefully getting a new
evolutionary OS interface that's not the
current iconic way of interacting with
the device it seems that we will get
widgets though we are not sure what to
expect yet though anything is better
than the current system where we just
get apps apps and apps now you'll be
asking why is this a mixed bag well stay
tuned for the not-so-cool section and
we'll talk about it now I cloud is
rumored to be released in WWDC and
Bloomberg brings a lot of better rumors
than what we had before it seems that I
crowd will be a mirror and online mirror
of what you have on your iTunes account
so this means that apple will pretty
much copy absolutely everything you have
on your library whether legal purchased
or not and you will have it on the cloud
now what's interesting here and much
better than what we thought in the past
was the fact that if Apple ever the text
that you have a SARM that is not the
same quality as what they offer it seems
that I cloud will replace it for the
much better quality song now rumors are
that it won't be free that it will be
bundled to the whole mobileme ninety
nine dollars a year service though
anything could happen now what's really
cool here is that well not everybody's
gotten their mp3's legally so it seems
that record labels are going to be
using that ninety nine dollar money
spectrum to pretty much cash in on
whatever they haven't made in the market
and it seems that's what Apple's been
using to get record labels to sign so
let's wait for next couple of weeks see
what happens on to other cool news
applets just reached the very cool
milestone of 500,000 applications being
sold on their iOS App Store this for the
ipod touch the iPhone and the iPad now
what's interesting is to see how Apple's
been able to do this and only a couple
of years when they were pretty much an
underdog no applications being sold like
what three four years ago and we already
had windows mobile and pommel as being
very robust and they're offering in the
market though not even tablets were
there and you know ipod touches were
non-existent either but well it's really
cool to see how a very good and well
thought-out distribution sender can be
such a success story in comparison to
every other market out there that hasn't
really been a successful really cool
talking about the samsung vs apple
lawsuit and yes i know this is not cool
but we're getting close to not so cool
section anyways it's interesting to see
how Apple was able to get Sammy to give
them prototypes of their galaxy tab 10.1
and the Galaxy S line which are pretty
much identical to Apple products because
they want to build their case to talk
about more lawsuits and you know every
anyways but the cool thing is that it
seems that Sammy just fired back and
said hey Apple you know what we gave you
prototypes now we want prototypes of
your next iphone 5 and ipad 3 because we
want to build a case against you two
rumors have it that Apple is working on
bringing the same curved glass design
that we see on the nexus s coming to the
next generation iphone not sure what to
make of that but it seems that Samsung's
making a case on that now why is this
cool well because this could probably
pressure Apple to bring the next
generation iphone to be released on WWDC
though anything could happen lords
continue on with more grey nudes that
are neither cool nor not so cool it
seems that Apple's iPhone PR has been
calling on to UK journalists and even
journalists and Australia to be part of
WWDC
now the question is why are iphone PR
working with journalists if Apple's not
going to be releasing supposedly an
iphone 5 on WWDC or an iphone 4s rumours
are that iOS 5 will be so groundbreaking
that it's going to be news and
journalists are supposed to be there now
rumors have it that we could get a
next-generation iphone not really sure
what to make of it though we are
expecting fractal to surprises not
really sure we'll see Steve Jobs coming
on stage or if whomever comes on stage
will have that well there's one more
thing but anything can happen let us are
for the cool it's continuing on with the
not so cool these are not really good
news for iphone 3gs owners as rumors
have it that the next generation OS will
not work on the iphone 3gs not really
sure what to make of it this is only an
educated guess we're not sure if it's
not going to work completely it's not
going to be upgradeable or if simply
you're only going to get part of the
update now out of the iphone 3g
experience with iOS four things were not
really that good i mean the hardware was
not really good at pushing the OS and
while we currently have the issue with
the iphone 3gs that it's not getting
every severy update that the iOS 4.3 is
offering to the iphone 4 so not really
sure if it's going to be even smart to
upgrade now it's really sad to see that
a lot of people currently still have a
year to start their new contract sort of
pretty much missing out on a lot of
stuff but that's Apple sadly and well
google released their google wallet
services to the world this week kind of
cool if you own a Nexus S on sprint all
you have to do is tap your phone on a
device on certain retail stores like
Macy's for example and you'll get built
that's pretty much it what's not so cool
is that it seems that Apple is not even
considering supporting that for the next
generation iphone and it's not even
considering supporting it on the future
device that will probably come next year
because NFC's not really that big yet
not really sure what to expect on Apple
but hey you know if it's not going to be
released now it's going to definitely be
pulled back later and Apple is going to
be pretty much left behind when things
are changing
and yeah I'd love to leave my wallet at
home sometimes it's pretty bulky that's
it for today show thank you very much
for watching I'm high middle you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
