what like to show you today is what I
think is really the ideal Android app
now I'm not talking about content I'm
talking about execution and delivery
the app is IMDB to the Internet Movie
Database you're probably familiar with
their website I'm really not happy with
their website it's got a lot of
information all over the place it's not
elegant it's not simple it just has a
ton of information well they took all
that information they made it available
to their Android app and they really
pulled it off and it's fabulous let's go
take a look ok so this is the IMDB app
for Android this is what I really like
first and foremost it's clean there's
nothing here that doesn't need to be
here very easily you can choose between
movies TV and people that's like your
actors and actresses directors and
whatnot I haven't found a place for key
or dolly grips yet but I'm still hoping
they'll add that in over here you've got
the most viewed titles on IMDB so you're
aggregating by frequency of viewership
so chances are if you're looking for
something it's going to be something
other people have also looked for and
it's just right there you can also look
up movie show times what's coming soon
box office results a bunch of other
stuff now here's an interesting thing
that I'd like to show you first and
foremost you've got three navigation
techniques on this page now I know this
isn't really a UI type of website I mean
we review apps and phones and stuff but
let me show you how they did this right
first of all you've got different tabs
where you can go between the different
sections that's great next you've got
this that you can scroll side-to-side so
that's another way to get through it and
it's very intuitive and lastly you've
got this down on the bottom where you
can scroll up and down and you can see
how doing this would make use of
basically any kind of screen resolution
not widescreen narrow screen even square
screen so they did a really good job
there all right so let's see where this
really shines let's go in and look at
whay Story 3 I haven't seen it yet so
please no spoilers in the comments ok
from here we can see what it is rated G
an hour 43 minutes we can see that this
is the movie we're talking about it's
not that one from 1984 which could be
the case not to mention anyone's like
Tron I don't like how this goes away
from the side to side swipe that we just
got used to but I can see why you tap on
that and it brings up all of these
images you can't do that really well in
a side-scroller like that so I don't
like it but it works next you've got
show times based on your geolocation
it's going to show you show times for
today at various different movie
theaters let's say I want to do this
it's right down the street for me I can
see right there show times for all of
the shows that are playing there let's
go back next what I want to do is show
you the trailer so right here we tap on
watch trailer it's going to switch into
landscape mode and then we're gonna
watch the trailer now I'm not gonna make
you sit through the whole thing but just
to show you how seamless this is right
there we were looking at information
about the movie we got movie showtimes
and now we can see the trailer to see if
it's something that we really want to
see so really cool and last but not
least I want to show you this down here
we've got the synopsis and then we've
got the cast let's go into Tom Hanks
kind of like that guy and this is where
the people tab comes into play this
shows you a bit more about him where he
was born how old he is what his full
name is what movies he starred in and a
little biography very very concise very
in-depth and it's really easy for you to
drill down and get the information that
you want to see now this is something I
would like to see every single Android
app take advantage of you should be able
to show a lot of information but
organized very well very succinctly on
your screens and navigate very quickly
between those screens we're over a Wi-Fi
n connection here so things went pretty
well
but
still over 3G the speeds are just fine
and it really shows off what Android and
a good UI team can do so any of you
developers out there
look at this I'm also going to review
one other app in the coming days that I
really think shows off good UI and the
power of Android but this is what you
should be aiming for now of course
that's just one man's opinion so all
your viewers out there now's your chance
go down to the comments below tell me if
I'm right tell me if I'm wrong give me
some some other ideas of apps you'd like
me to review that are really good or you
know what let's get the really really
bad ones in here too it's our operating
system it's our environment it's up to
us to tell the developers what we like
and what we don't and we could use this
as a forum to be able to do that so go
ahead and leave me comments down in the
comment area visit pocketnow.com for the
article associated with this video if
you thought the video was worthwhile
give it a thumbs up and as always
subscribe to our channel so you can see
the coming videos and the apps that I'm
gonna review next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
