pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look at the software on the HTC
Flyer from t-mobile so sit back relax
and enjoy the show one of the most
commented upon items of the HTC Flyer is
this home lock screen ring that you have
when you turn the device on and you drag
the ring up into the center of the
screen that's how you unlock it but more
importantly is that it gives you the
ability to drag icons down into the ring
in order to be able to launch apps so if
I want to launch calendar I would drag
it down here and release and it would
launch the calendar app for me and when
you have appointments come up then you
can drag the dismiss or the snooze icon
to that ring as well if you turn it to
portrait view then you get the same
effect except the ring is you know in
the at the bottom of the screen still
except you've got the bigger view go
ahead and unlock here so this is the HTC
sense for the HTC Flyer and you can see
with the weather effects there which is
pretty typical for HTC products down
here across the bottom we've got our
launcher bar here with our app launcher
the notes feature reader watch and then
the personalized button down here and
these can be customized as desired if
you scroll across then it swipes through
the multiple pages and you can see the
white icon down here scrolling as well
and if you give it a good spin that it
spins really fast it rotates around if
you pinch into the screen then you can
pick the home screen that you want to
navigate to now the HTC Flyer is running
Gingerbread and they've got able to kind
of a custom layout as you can see here
oops let's try that again so 2 dot 3 dot
4 and it's running 1 dot 0 of HT sense
for tablet now there is talk that this
device might actually receive honeycomb
but since I extreme sandwich just came
out it's more likely that it's going to
receive ice cream sandwich before it
receives honeycomb
and on google+ one of the HTC employees
did mention that the HTC Flyer would be
on the list for that then again we'll
see how that actually pans out when it
comes out so starting down here with the
notes functionality this is a kind of a
custom version of the Evernote
application and if you're using the pin
tool which I've got here if you tap you
can actually use the pin functionality
to actually make notes on the screen now
because this is running Gingerbread and
not honeycomb or ice cream sandwich this
pen stylus which will cover a little
more in the harbor view doesn't actually
work with the rest of the the buttons
and the tools if I go up here to attach
it doesn't actually work I flip it over
and use the metal and here I can get it
to do other functionality like tap up
here under the title and actually be
able to work on it that way but
otherwise this just works in the modes
such as the note or the screen capture
mode which one or rather the kind of the
scribble mode which we'll cover in a
second has to do with this this button
here as far as the pin app is concerned
you can tap on the option you tap on the
actual pin here and you can change the
options such as color and and erase and
these that allows you to choose a
different pin style so I've got an erase
or a highlighter a kind of a purple
marker of sorts of being a change of
color but it's currently a purple marker
a nib pin a brush the standard pin and
then hensel really I haven't I haven't
found that these a dual really great job
of allowing you to write clearly the
edges are really grainy and and jittery
it for taking a quick note it's fine but
for actually factory actual art it's not
a very good configuration now in
honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich the pin
functionality is supposed to work across
more apps hopefully we'll be able to see
the fun pin functionality work in apps
such as sketchbook but for right now the
default pin
Shin ality is not all that fantastic if
we go back here to this the main screen
and I tap the pin button which will
cover more in the hardware review as
well I can go into a scribble mode which
takes a capture of the screen as you see
it and then you can doodle on the screen
or erase by holding down the white
button and then save that capture as
something else so you could do the same
thing with a PDF document you could
create your own JPEGs of grid paper and
that sort of thing take quick notes with
if you wanted to you know screen capture
and there's a couple of apps that allow
that sort of functionality available in
the market but not by default and as you
can see here I'm tapping on the discard
button but it doesn't actually do
anything if I flip it over it will but
that's no different than me tapping it
with my fingers the reader app is akin
to the like a kindle app or the
ibookstore in Apple products it is a
very straightforward reading application
with a page turn animation effect and it
flips back and forth very easily you can
change things like fonts and brightness
and screen res screen settings like the
night view and that sort of thing so it
actually works pretty well it's kind of
HTC's own little reader application you
also have the ability to go in and watch
videos if you pay for them it's a little
bit like Amazon's movie store or the
Apple movie store it's just another way
for HTC to kind of get some additional
funds out of you after you buy a product
but really this screen does a pretty
good job of displaying video format and
we got netflix going on here and it
works just fine I actually haven't used
purchase any videos or I wasn't able to
find any videos that were available for
free at first glance we go over here new
releases we can see we've got things
like Rango and if I tap on this then it
gives a buy price of 1499 but there
doesn't there's not a rental price
listed here
for a just an easy view rather than
spending the money for a full version
another app that a lot of people have a
tendency to use right away is these the
snap booth app which gives you the
ability to take pictures of your face
using the front-facing camera or other
devices kind of like apples photo booth
as well that's a lot of one item that a
lot of people as soon as I hand on this
device that they have tends to just jump
right into when you go into personalized
then you have the ability to set the
scene which changes some of the buttons
and the layouts the skin the wallpaper
lock screen add widgets back and forth
default the sound sets set alarms that
sort of thing the market is actually
still the older market version even
though it's running Gingerbread some of
the other functionality here that's kind
of interesting is the dock mode which
gives you the ability to if you have a
the actual dock for this device and it
can launch this mode automatically where
you can go and turn on the brightness
level you can barely see the clock up
here but at night that would be very
visible still there's a car dock if you
have the carb accessory that gives you
the ability to have like destinations
and footprints the history of where
you've gone marking locations that's
sort of information I one item of note
here is the press reader which gives you
kind of a being able to read newspapers
I've got the Los Angeles Times from a
couple of days ago loaded here and you
can see you can scroll through the
newspaper and it's got the articles and
then if you tap on the the headline that
it takes you into this text mode you can
actually read the article without some
of the pictures it what I thought was
really funny about this is it actually
has all of the advertisements if we tap
and hold the home button then we get the
recent apps as you would expect there is
a task manager that allows you to
control what apps are running and
actually kill all the applications if
you so desire to kind of free
up some memory there is this connected
media piece here which is kind of a DLNA
connected device setup they can stream
media but it's not exactly like the
windows media center connected devices
configuration you have to do some little
setup to little magic on your own end to
make that work in the status bar menu
here as you can see here in landscape
format we've got a split view here and
we can see the most recent apps we can
clear the the notification area and then
we've got some quick settings over here
which allows to toggle on Wi-Fi on and
off to talk about the mobile network on
and off and actually go into the the
full settings very quickly if you switch
into landscape mode then down here at
the bottom that turns into two different
tabs for that functionality overall the
OS is very snappy it feels very quick
I've had very few crashes although I
have had some coming out of an
application it'll reload sense is where
the crash generally occurs coming
specifically out of google reader is
where i find it happens the most I'm not
exactly sure why Netflix was able to
load on here with no problem I was also
able to get skype working with video and
with audio that wraps up our closer look
at the software on the HTC Flyer from
t-mobile if you have any questions or
comments about the software
functionality on this device leaving
below and we'll try to cover them thanks
for watching
