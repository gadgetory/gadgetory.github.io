removable backs to do more than just
cover the phone the google nexus 9
influence is rumoured in part of the HTC
One m9 and t-mobile is about to broaden
its LTE bands on a couple of existing
phones I'm hi medley vera and i hope you
all are staying safe in this crazy storm
it's pouring rain outside this is pocket
out daily let's begin today with the
official news twitter is bringing an
update to its ios and android services
and you are getting a bevy of new
features including native video
recording and you get up to 30 seconds
of video meaning it's even better than
its own vine and even more interesting
is the fact that you now get group
messaging for different twitter users
and direct messaging as well gets a
little bit of a revamp really cool new
updates that should be coming to your
phone very soon in other official news
even though the Susan watch has been in
the market for very little the company's
chairman was recently on record stating
the new features that are coming to the
Zen watch too and there were not talks
about design or talks about changes in
UI or anything particularly since this
is Android wear what he did make a big
deal of that was the battery life of
this new SmartWatch he didn't mention
any design or size changes but he did
mention that they are focusing on a
one-week battery power which is amazing
compared to the rest of Android wear
which is extremely terrible let's see if
we get something very soon i'll talk
about t-mobile the company has made an
official that in part of its way to
actually bring you better LTE support it
will be subscribing or starting to use
the 700 megahertz LTE band which is band
12 it's really good news this is
particularly the band that Verizon uses
and they have really good service and
all the vices that are compatible with
band 12 will be updated to support it so
if you've got the vices like the Galaxy
Note 4 Galaxy Note edge or any other
device that brings support for this band
I believe also the iphone 6 iphone 6
plus bring support for this band on
tebow well you should be fine so stay
tuned for that now let's switch on over
to rumors we've been hearing that HTC is
apparently using decoys for the one m9
leaks that we've seen recently so we
shouldn't believe them apparently the
new design
just for the 19 look more like what we
have on the Google Nexus 9 meaning the
speakers will be part of the glass and
not so big as we currently see what the
one I mates but the design changes that
apparently the HTC logo is moving to the
bottom and not being as obtrusive as it
is currently is on the HTC One m8 all
these are great changes and we should
expect to learn more about this product
that mwc 2015 so stay tuned is uh yeah
even though we do like the design of the
one of mates yeah this would be cool
design changes for the one of nine and
finally for the very interesting rumors
of the day we've got one that's really
hard to believe reports claim that one
of the ways that Sam's in plans to make
its Galaxy s6 something really cool is
to completely reinvent the back cover
meaning that currently and replace back
covers on the galaxy s5 and that's great
but apparently they plan to make these
new back covers useful meaning they want
to implement eeing like what we have on
the yotaphone and apparently they also
want to bring us another back cover that
would give you health information from
esco which is really cool and there are
other options in the licks of the
description that you should read about
again it's really hard to believe but
would definitely be a cool idea that
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think about this feature do you
think that this would really
differentiate Samsung it it's a whole
plan to revamp the galaxy lineup in my
case I do believe so as long as it works
hopefully it's not gonna be like its
current fingerprint scanner but leave us
a comment down below what do you think
