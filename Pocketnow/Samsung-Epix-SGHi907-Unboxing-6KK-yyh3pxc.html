pocketnow.com and today we're going to
unbox a phone that i know a lot of
people have been waiting for it's the
samsung epix on the AT&amp;amp;T network it's a
very similar phone to the palm treo pro
so a lot of people were waiting for this
to come out to make the decision on
which one to buy so let's get started
with the unboxing Wi-Fi GPS email camera
see what else we have around the box
nothing terribly interesting some
specifications alright looks like we
have a quick start guide some software
the unboxing is very similar to that of
the blackjack two if you have that
device I'll put the epics to the side
for now see what else we get inside the
box looks like we have a audio converter
for the Samsung proprietary Jack this
doesn't use mini USB or micro USB
unfortunately we've got here a sinking
cable a wall charger again using that
proprietary jack and finally the massive
1800 milliamp hour battery this thing is
huge and hopefully this means that the
epics has fantastic battery life well at
least that's what my expectation is
alright so let's take a look at the de
bus
you know it's it feels just like a
blackjack two in fact here is the
blackjack two they have very similar
keyboards in fact they're they're
probably identical and the thickness is
about the same the epics is a little bit
thicker and just all around it feels
like a blackjack two but of course it
has the touch screen and a larger screen
of that and it also has this optical
mouse cursor here kind of like the
samsung omnia it's the same same kind of
deal here so let's take off the screen
protector if i can find that ok here it
is it's a really slick device I like the
finish on it it's kind of like a gray
metallic finish it's kind of hard to
tell in the video but it's really nice
it's really unique it is it does feel
thicken in the hand for some reason even
though it's not that thick I don't know
why that is we'll have to we'll have to
look into that some more but let's
compare it to some other devices right
so here we have the palm treo pro and
again I know a lot of people are
comparing these two devices it's
actually a little little bit thinner
than the palm treo pro you really can't
tell here but it's one millimeter
thinner and it's also taller and wider
the screen size is exactly the same it
also has the same screen resolution of
course the the epics has a much more
generous keyboard than does the palm
treo pro and i think a lot of people
will really appreciate that next to the
old motorola q 9h which has a great
keyboard we see that the the keyboard is
still pretty big on the epics although
it's not as large it as it is on the q
9h and just because i know a lot of
people have this device or up seeing
that here's the 18t tilt of course the
epics is significantly thinner than the
AT&amp;amp;T tilt so all in all I think the
epics is going to be a good device I
like the flush touch screen I'm excited
to use this optical cursor to see if it
works like it does on the omnia because
that was a big help in one-handed
usability we've got a lot more content
coming up we're going to compare this
head-to-head with the palm treo pro
we're going to cover hardware we're
going to cover software and everything
so that if you're considering buying
this device you'll have a pretty good
idea of whether it's for you by the end
