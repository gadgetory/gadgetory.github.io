makes us wonder if it's really
reinventing home music we get a couple
of new iPads all focused on productivity
and along with these new iPads we have a
bevy of new software
I'm hi meri behna and that whole pot is
actually more expensive than your
standard 50-inch TV you just watched an
apple event this is PocketNow daily
yes disclaimer the show is going to be
everything about WWDC because it was the
hottest news today starting with the
fact that even though we don't talk
about Mac's here the new iMac pros and
the new iMac revenge that we just got to
bear kind of significant for two main
particular reasons number one is the
fact that we saw the HTC vive make a big
splash because these Macs are going to
be steam compatible steam capable and we
are going to get this whole VR
experience the second doesn't really
have to do with the Mac and mostly has
to do with the fact that you can pretty
much turn your iPhone or iPad into this
augmented reality capturing product very
soon with all the updates that are
coming there is a our kit and obviously
this just means that augmented reality
is also going to make a big splash for
iOS and Mac OS on the future now let's
talk about the Apple watch watch OS 4 is
kind of significant because it fixes a
lot of things that I don't like about
the Apple watch starting with the fact
that we've got new watch faces I'm not
even going to focus on the ones from Toy
Story that's fine I care about the one
that's focused on Siri because it's
going to adapt it to everything that you
do during the day and it's got machine
learning to adapt to whatever your day
is going to look like the second is the
fact that there are some major changes
to Fitness starting with the fact that
now you can start a workout add more
workouts and the whole user interface
was revamped I love everything that I
saw with this can not wait to give it a
try let's talk about iOS 11 mainly
because well the iPhones got some
improvements like for example support
for h.265 video a new control center a
new way to handle notifications etc etc
those weren't really important the one
that was major was for the iPad as the
iPad finally gets some glory treatment
first of all there is a new dock there
is a new way to multitask
the new control center actually allows
for different panes meaning you can have
multi tasking panes that are open
specifically there are drag-and-drop
options there is a new file system that
I can't wait to give a try all this
focused and making the iPad more of a
productivity tool no it doesn't run OS
10 or mac OS e yet but it doesn't really
matter Apple wants to make this about
iOS and it's finally great to see that
the iPad gets in glory we'll see when we
test it and why is this new version of
Iowa so important mainly because one
thing we did see today are new iPads a
new twelve point nine inch model a new
ten point five inch model meaning that
nine point seven inch iPad pro that I
love so much just became obsolete that
display resolution is now only available
for the regular iPad now these new iPad
pro models bring faster processors they
bring a couple of new features that are
mainly focused on just making the iPad
better but making it a better I pad
pretty much like for example effect
there's a high refresh rate on the
display the fact that this will allow
the Apple pencil to interact with the
iPad better because again this is and
I've had Pro and again you have to
remember these are just iPads but then
again we can't wait to see how iOS 11
will be better on these newer iPad
models over time and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with Apple's home pod the reason why is
because if I have to sit here and tell
you that this is going to reinvent music
at home I don't know if it will mainly
you have to remember this doesn't really
compete against the Amazon echo or
Google home it's really trying to
compete against Sonos and providing this
whole immersive music experience at home
it's supposed to reinvent music at home
is what Phil Schiller said and I can't
really say like the design of the
speaker mainly because it looks like a
trash can that's going to get dirty over
time because of the mesh you have to be
dusting it off all the time at least in
my opinion but yet this is also a siri
speaker you can control honk it whether
you could give it commands etc etc it's
pretty much everything that was rumored
but again the focus is more on music you
buy a couple of these you could set them
up and that's all great the big problem
is once you start talking
price tag this thing is a crazy 349
dollars at a time when you can ask
questions to your phone and that's going
to be your Siri functionality and when
you can buy a regular speaker for a
hundred bucks and get something that's
close to it probably not an audio
quality that's something we will have to
review but it leads me to the question
of the day are you willing to pay three
hundred and forty nine dollars for the
speaker in my case no honestly no
probably if it was designed better
probably if I try to improve that but
anyways leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
