very serious but not necessarily now
okay seems to return to its roots and
awesome photography with its next
smartphones and prepare for a bolter
Huawei made 10 coming soon
I'm Hana Rivera para todos mis hermanos
que hablamos en español de invitados en
nuestra lado página en nuestra do
mangle nasi Abajo EC estamos trabajando
para el diario oh right this is
out daily the official news today begin
with event information for those of you
that are waiting for the next generation
moto Z's or Moto X or whatever it is the
motorola plans to announce that your
calendars for July 25th the company
isn't really telling us much about what
to expect but what we do know is that
these should be the next generation flak
ships we cannot wait to see what we get
a lot of interesting news come from HTC
if the company has already posted
information on its quarter results this
is the first time in a long time that
the company has grown this much 8% in
this particular quarter 52% sequential
that is crazy this signifies that the U
11 has definitely meant a ton of
positivity for the company and its a
great smartphone it's definitely one of
the devices that we recommend the most
this year now let's talk about the
next-generation flagship from Huawei
which we expect to be the main 10 we
hear that the company is partnering with
Japan displayed for those new 2x1
displays in 1080p to Japan display was
teasing recently so apparently we are
still getting LCDs on this next
generation may 10 but we're going to get
a taller display so let's see exactly
how that will perform over time and
speaking of interesting partnerships
nokia was very famous in the past for
the photo quality of its Lumias Lumia
950 continues to be one of my favorite
smartphone cameras ever apparently the
company along with HM DN device
partnered again for the next generation
of photography according to the press
release they are going to make something
completely new we cannot wait to hear
what it is because if any of you
remember at whatever time the Lumia 920
was announced years ago that was the
shift in smartphone photography
right there with that smartphone and
then we have the 1020 and ever so often
I mean Nokia signifies a ton of
importance when it comes to smartphone
photography we cannot wait to see what
we get and finally the very interesting
news they continued to be the iPhone 8
mainly because we've got trusted sources
that claim good and bad news the good
news is that Apple plans to make a
significant shift in OLED apparently
we're getting three new iPhones we've
heard those rumors for weeks apparently
these will bring OLED displays all of
them but not this year according to the
source it seems that only the most
important iPhone is getting the OLED
display the others will remain with IPS
LCD s and if you want to get full o LEDs
across the board you're going to have to
wait until next year this makes all the
sense in the world most likely this hot
new iPhone NEX or iPhone 8 will be the
hot new device and the next year it will
be pulled down to be the premium
mid-range here we should call and then
that next generation iPhone will be the
top dog and obviously this means that
all these devices logically will bring
an OLED display we follow Apple's sort
of launch plans so anyways it leads you
to the question today I mean do you
think that Apple can actually play the
ball of ignoring the importance of OLED
in this day and age because after using
devices like the Galaxy S it's really
hard for me to move back to IPS LCD s
and that's just the way I feel but leave
us a comment down below we look to know

goes if you want to get the news earlier
