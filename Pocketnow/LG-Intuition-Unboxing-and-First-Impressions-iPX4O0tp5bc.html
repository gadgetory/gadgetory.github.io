now calm Samsung invented the phablet
category with the Galaxy Note the Galaxy
Note was laughed at in the beginning
people didn't think that the world would
want such a large phone / mini tablet
but the sales numbers have told the
truth and people really like this form
factor and so far no OEMs except for LG
have come up with a phablet on their own
no Motorola phablet no HTC phablet but
LG has come out with the Optimus view
it's actually been out for a while in
Europe but it's finally hitting the US
as the LG intuition and Verizon Wireless
like the idea of competing with AT&amp;amp;T on
the note and Samsa and t-mobile on the
note I should say by coming out with
their own version of a phablet this is a
totally different phablet experience
though it's got a four by three aspect
ratio a different processor it's got
LG's software totally different and in
this video we're gonna unbox the LG
intuition and talk about some first
impressions let's get to it
and I've just been really eager to see
this device firsthand I haven't yet so
let's talk about specs while we're
unboxing it it's got a Snapdragon s4
dual-core processor you're running it
for 1.5 gigahertz the same chip that you
find in the US version of the galaxy s3
and many other phones it's got a
gigabyte of RAM it's got a four by three
aspect ratio display instead of the
sixteen by nine ish of the note 2 and
the note 1 kind of has a weird in
between sixteen by nine and four by
three and it's on Verizon so it's got 4G
LTE let's take a look at what we have in
the box whoa this thing is huge
oh my goodness this thing looks like a
large square oh my goodness next to the
Galaxy Note makes the Galaxy Note look
very much rectangular this thing is
monstrous
is this really a phone this is a joke no
I'm just kidding this is actually
extremely big but it's actually very
thin which is kind of nice so we're
gonna take a look at that give some
first impressions let's see what LG does
because parently there are some cool
some cool accessories in here like NFC
tags that's always fun
start here and there should be a stylus
in here this is not the s-pen this is
called well it's got some really strange
name but I want to take this out and
compare this pen to the pen that you get
on the Galaxy Note I'm wondering if the
slides into the device it's got a
rubberized tip which is totally
different than what you get with the
Galaxy Note you get a plastic tip on the
Galaxy Note and of course the note 2 has
a thicker thicker tip and a thicker body
here so kind of the nicer look to the LG
pen it's got a nice little chrome accent
down here so we'll look at that later
we've got chargers in there let's get
this stuff out of the way let's take off
these plastic covers there are a lot of
them okay I just removed the looks like
a micro sd
this thing is so big I don't I don't
know if this is going to fit into a
pocket well maybe it should it's not to
be honest it's not that much wider than
the note we're gonna compare them in a
sec but you know out of the box this
thing is just a tank so let's see
compared to the note yeah it is a good
three to four millimeters wider than the
note it's definitely thinner than the
note which is which is nice it's got to
be but we've got a 1024 by 768
resolution screen so it should be super
clear super crisp let's boot this on for
the first time we've got even more
plastic all around what is this oh
that's really nice a nice action on that
USB door I don't really see that
nowadays we're gonna press and hold the
power button here and turn this on and
nothing has happened maybe that's not
even the power button let's look around
the device oh maybe the power buttons
over here that would make sense
okay so Turk just vibrated it's got a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack here
microphone plastic galore and here we've
got oh this is interesting the button on
the right is the three dots from an Ice
Cream Sandwich to kind of show that it's
the Menu button we've got multitask home
and back okay we've got 4G LTE let's get
a little bit closer here and see what
we've got
I don't see a silo for the stylus which
would be super annoying having to carry
around the stylus although I have a
feeling that LG didn't integrate the
s-pen as well as Samsung has so anyway
next this is running Ice Cream Sandwich
by the way activate your phone alright
we will put a sim card in here and get
back to you in a second and we're back
and activated and I got a little bit of
time to look extra hard for the stylus
silo for this guy and there is no stylus
silo I can't believe it
you're really supposed to carry this
around what this is basically is a
capacitive stylus in fact if we take out
the notes I bet it works just fine on
there no oh yes it does see let's go
back to the home screen
let's see it it does kind of work but
kind of doesn't work that's kind of
strange okay so let's get through here
by the way I got really close to the
screen on the lg intuition here it's a
great screen again 1024 by 768
resolution kind of crazy if you think
about it that's the same resolution as
the iPad 2 and a lot of monitors out
there to be honest or to skip this so
great screen extremely wide form factor
I mean hopefully this has a way to
easily type with two hands with a split
keyboard because you know the note it
the note one was was tough enough with
sort of one-handed usability it was
actually impossible although they
allowed you to put the keyboard over to
the side this guy okay I had to struggle
there not to drop it I doubt that it's
going to be possible to use this with
one hand I really do it's just it's just
so incredibly wide now LG says that the
advantages of such a wide wide screen
this way is that it's great for reading
books it's great for web blah blah blah
maybe maybe not what you're in what
you're going to see if you watch YouTube
video of course is a huge amount of
black bars ok backup assistant plus we
don't care about that no please please
no do not do this ok what better I don't
I'm just gonna uncheck everything all
right let's get back let's get to the
home screens so that we can experiment a
little bit and check out web web
browsing performance if you want to see
how the s4 works it in this particular
device because it works great in the
galaxy s3 and a lot of other devices out
there that have the have the Snapdragon
s4 chip in there ok so not now done it's
set up finally here we are almost
overlap two icons to create a folder yes
I know that okay so here we are this is
the LG interface here and it's
definitely nice and smooth we've got of
course the pinch out feature and wow
look how many icons you get on the
bottom it's one of the cool parts about
having such a a widescreen I suppose is
that you can fit so many icons on the
screen probably more surface area
definitely more surface area than you
get on the note let's look closely up at
the screen to play
you can see it's very crisp very clear I
can tell you that has very nice colors
on this display and let's go into the
web browser we're not going to go over
Wi-Fi right now are to keep it over 4G
LTE although it's asking do not use
Wi-Fi remind me later
just your guide okay pull up the toolbar
to see the button okay we'll get to that
later
I just want to give you a first
impression here really quick so let's go
to pocket now calm I'm using the stylus
but I don't really need to know why I
look at this keyboard holy moly it's
wide it is wide and uncomfortable I feel
like I'm typing on a nexus 7 I've got to
say it's so it's a big keyboard alright
so here we go loading pocketnow.com
let's move around on the page once it's
loaded see if we get any checker boards
or any blank spots no pretty good
definitely not the jelly bean smoothness
that we've come to expect recently let's
zoom in see how long it takes to clear
up a lot of white space there so we're
learning another page right now gonna
move around on the page we've got this
little gray bar on the bottom which I'm
curious about which is kind of a way
that LG has hidden away some device
functions kind of a cool idea actually
to keep it out of sight and out of mind
web browsing on this guy seems kind of
cool actually
because you get so much of the page and
this is a really nice screen again it's
definitely not as fast as some of the
other web browsers we've seen but this
is a very interesting experience let's
go back to the home screen and see some
of the included apps hopefully Verizon
hasn't added too much bloatware so we're
gonna go into the app drawer here little
stutter in the animation if you just saw
that there I really like how they did
the apps right here it's very clean very
very light looks just like the stock Ice
Cream Sandwich launcher which is always
great to see I've got a column for
downloaded column for widgets constantly
having to think which is interesting in
terms of apps we've got audible we've
got guided tour
Verizon apps Verizon hotspot that's
important to have my mobile pryzen setup
wizard smart there's a lot of LG and
verizon stuff on this so anyway first
impressions of the LG and tuition is
that it is huge and that might
good thing that might not be a good
thing I'm actually gonna use this as my
daily driver for a period of time to
really get a feel for how this device is
in day to day use I hope it fits into my
pocket it'll fit into my pocket I
checked and we're gonna really compare
this to the Galaxy Note and see if LG
has made a phablet competitor as good as
the note if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and let us know what
you think about LG's attempt at a
phablet and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
