now calm Samsung invented the phablet
category with a galaxy note the galaxy
note was laughed at in the beginning
people didn't think that the world would
want such a large phone / mini tablet
but the sales numbers have told the
truth and people really like this form
factor and so far no OEM is except for
LG have come up with a phablet on their
own no Motorola phablet no HTC fabric
but LG has come out with the Optimus
view it's actually been out for a while
in Europe but it's finally hitting the
US as the LG intuition and Verizon
Wireless like the idea of competing with
AT&amp;amp;T on the note and sams and t-mobile
on the note I should say by coming out
with their own version of a phablet this
is a totally different phablet
experience though it's got a 4 by 3
aspect ratio a different processor it's
got LG software totally different and in
this video we're to unbox the LG
intuition and talk about some first
impressions let's get to it
and I've just been really eager to see
this device firsthand I haven't yet so
let's talk about specs while we're
unboxing it it's got a Snapdragon s4
dual-core processor you're running it's
1.5 gigahertz the same chip that you
find in the US version of the galaxy s3
and many other phones it's got a
gigabyte of RAM it's got a 4 by 3 aspect
ratio display instead of the sixteen by
nine ish of the note 2 and the note one
kind of has a weird in between sixteen
by nine and four by three and it's on
verizon so it's got 4g LTE let's take a
look at what we have in the box whoa
this thing is huge oh my goodness this
thing looks like a large square oh my
goodness next to the galaxy note makes
the galaxy note look very much
rectangular this thing is monstrous is
this really a phone this is a joke no
I'm just kidding this is actually
extremely big but it's actually very
thin which is kind of nice so we're
going to take a look at that get some
first impressions let's see what LG does
because apparently there are some quote
some quote accessories in here like NFC
tags that's always fun start here and
there should be a stylist in here this
is not the S Pen this is called well
it's got some really strange name but I
want to take this out and compare this
pen to the pen that you get on the
galaxy note i'm wondering at the slides
into the device it's got a rubberized
tip which is totally different than what
you get with a galaxy note you get a
plastic tip on the galaxy note and of
course the note 2 has a thicker thicker
tip and a thicker body here so kind of
the nicer look to the LG pen it's got a
nice little chrome accent down here so
we'll look at that later we've got
chargers in there let's get this stuff
out of the way let's take off these
plastic covers there are a lot of them
ok I just remove the looks like a micro
SD door who this thing is so big I don't
I don't know if this is going to fit
into a pocket well maybe it should it's
not doing us it's not that much
wider than the note we're going to
compare them in a sec but you know out
of the box this thing is just a tank so
let's see compared to the note yeah it
is a good three to four millimeters
wider than the note it's definitely
thinner than the note which is which is
nice it's got to be but we've got a 1024
x 768 resolution screen so it should be
super clear super crisp let's boot this
on for the first time we've got even
more plastic all around what is this ohh
thats really nice a nice action on that
USB door don't really see that nowadays
we're gonna press and hold the power
button here and turn this on and nothing
has happened maybe that's not even the
power button let's look around the
device oh maybe power ones over here
that would make sense duh ok so Turk
just vibrated it's got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack here microphone plastic
galore and here we've got oh this is
interesting the button on the right is
the three dots from ice cream sandwich
to kind of show that it's the menu
button we've got multitask home and back
okay we've got 4g LTE let's get a little
bit closer here and see what we've got I
don't see a silo for the stylus which
would be super annoying having to carry
around the stylus although I have a
feeling that LG didn't integrate the
s-pen as well as Samsung hands so anyway
Next this is running Ice Cream Sandwich
by the way activate your phone alright
we will put a sim card in here and get
back to you in a sec and we're back and
activated and I got a little bit of time
to look extra hard for the stylus silo
for this guy and there is no stylus silo
I can't believe it you're really
supposed to carry this around what this
is basically is a capacitive stylus in
fact if we take out the notes I bet it
works just fine on there no oh yes it
does see let's go back to the home
screen let's see it it does kind of work
but kind of doesn't work that's kind of
okay so let's get through here by the
way I got really close to the screen on
the LG intuition here it's a great
screen again 1024 x 768 resolution kind
of crazy if you think about it that's
the same resolution as the ipad 2 and a
lot of monitors out there to be honest
or to skip this so great screen
extremely wide form factor I mean
hopefully this has a way to easily type
with two hands with a split keyboard
because you know the note the note one
was was tough enough with sort of
one-handed usability it was actually
impossible although they allowed you to
put the keyboard over to the side this
guy okay I had to struggle there not to
drop it I doubt that it's going to be
possible to use this with one hand i
really do it's just it's just so
incredibly wide now LG says that the
advantages of such a wide wide screen
this way is that it's great for reading
books it's great for web blah blah blah
maybe maybe not what you're in what
you're going to see if you watch youtube
video of course is a huge amount of
black bars okay backup system plus we
don't care about that no please please
no do not do this okay what better is
your idol I'm just going to uncheck
everything all right let's get back
let's get to the home screen so that we
can experiment a little bit and check
out web web browsing performance if you
want to see how the s4 works it in this
particular device because it works great
in the galaxy s3 and a lot of other
devices out there that have the have the
Snapdragon s4 ship in there okay so not
now done with setup finally here we are
almost overlapped two icons to create a
folder yes I know that okay so here we
are this is the LG interface here and
it's definitely nice and smooth we've
got of course the pinch out feature and
wow look how many icons yet on the
bottom it's one of the cool parts about
having such a a wide screen I suppose is
that you can fit so many icons on the
screen probably more surface area
definitely more surface area than you
get on the note let's look closely up at
the screen to play icon you can see it's
very crisp very clear I can tell you
that has very nice colors on this
display and let's go into the web
browser we're not going to go over Wi-Fi
right now our to keep it over 4g LTE
although it's asking do not use Wi-Fi
remind me later chest your guide okay
pull up the toolbar to see the button
okay we'll get to that later just want
to give you a first impression here
really quick so let's go to pocket now
calm i'm using the stylus but i don't
really need to yeah why i look at this
keyboard holy moly it's wide it is wide
and uncomfortable i feel like i'm typing
on a nexus 7 I've got to say it's it's a
big keyboard alright so here we go
loading pocketnow.com let's move around
on the page once it's loaded see if we
get any checkerboards or any blank spots
no pretty good definitely not the jelly
bean smoothness that we've come to
expect recently let's zoom in see how
long it takes to clear up a lot of white
space there so we're learning another
page right now and move around on the
page we've got this little grey bar on
the bottom which I'm curious about which
is kind of a way that LG has hidden away
some device functions kind of a cool
idea actually to keep it out of sight
and out of mind web browsing on this guy
seems kind of cool actually because you
get so much of the page and this is a
really nice screen again it's definitely
not as fast as some of the other web
browsers we've seen this is a very
interesting experience let's go back to
the home screen and see some of the
included apps hopefully verizon hasn't
added too much bloatware so we're gonna
go into the app drawer here little
stutter in the animation if you just saw
that there i really like how they did
the apt right here it's very clean very
very light looks just like the stock Ice
Cream Sandwich launcher which is always
great to see got a column for downloaded
column for widgets constantly having to
think which is interesting in terms of
apps we've got audible we've got guided
tour verizon apps verizon hotspot that's
important to have my mobile verizon
setup wizard smart there's a lot of LG
and Verizon stuff on this so anyway
first impressions of the LG intuition is
that it is huge that might be a good
thing that might not be a good thing I'm
actually going to use this my daily
driver for a period of time to really
get a feel for how this the
is in day-to-day use I hope it fits into
my pocket it will fit into my pocket I
checked and we're going to really
compare this to the galaxy note and see
if LG has made a phablet competitor as
good as the note if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and let us
know what you think about LG's attempt
at a phablet and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
