lack of an official intro but we have a
Lumia 1020 review to finish and an
episode of the PocketNow weekly to
record but before the weekend starts we
needed to get our hands on this device
this is the HTC 8x t4 sprint one of the
first windows phones on Sprint in a long
time the I believe the first Windows
Phone 8 device on Sprint and certainly
the first Windows Phone 8 device with
boomsound from HTC s let's have a look
at the specs on the outside of the box
there 8 megapixel camera 1.4 Giga
dual-core processor and of course LTE
this packaging 100% recyclable and
definitely feels like it
unlike a tnt's boxes which are just kind
of unremarkable the sprint box is
remarkable because it feels like a TV
dinner box or something but it is under
percent recyclable and good for Sprint
for going green so let's go ahead and
pop the flap on the Box open just want
to get right to the device here not just
because we're low on time Wow but
because we are actually pretty
interested in seeing this phone it's
always nice when a carrier has neglected
a platform for a while and then comes
back to it in this case of course
windows won't pull out of the package
Wow a little bit heavier than I would
expect coming out of the package we'll
put it aside for just one second look at
that color that's pretty cool let's see
what's in the box here power adapter the
same earbuds if you missed these on our
unboxing for a for the Google edition
HTC One or I think even the sprinter
Edition HTC One these earbuds were
included with some extra gels here they
are not beats branded but they are red
and black and put those inside there's a
USB cable power adapter nothing special
there getting started guide to
everything encased in this kind of very
very soft plastic it feels I don't know
it feels weird and more HTC stickers for
our collection to put on the back of our
zip cars and tell everyone that we love
HTC if you do if you do feel that way or
you do not have used them at all let's
take this out of its packaging once we
understand the location privacy can
turns sprint wants us to understand and
Wow Wow
indeed so this is a soft touch back here
with a nice dual tone color arrangement
they're both both zones feel the same
way this is soft touch pan at each side
there's that eight megapixel camera with
LED flash the beats audio call out HTC
branding their side buttons are plastic
just like on the the standard 8x dual
stage camera key they're also plastic up
top you've got your if we can stay in
focus your power standby and your
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack nothing on that side and microUSB
look at that it looks you know it
appears fatter on camera than it
actually is
I'm sure the dimensions don't differ
significantly from the standard 8 X we
turn it around and there is the Front's
I love this dual tone thing going on it
looks like it looks almost as though a
and HTC 8s and an 8 X got together and
formed an offspring in a good way and
boom sound unlike on the traditional HTC
One with its with its grils symmetrical
grilles top and bottom we have a larger
earpiece segment and a smaller one down
below be very interesting to see if
there's any performance difference as a
result of that phone and you know soft
touch paint just does a great job of
making a phone feel really nice so yeah
I know it's not anything new it's been
around for you know six or seven years
at this point we've been painting the
backsides of phones of this soft touch
stuff to make it easier to grip but this
definitely feels quite nice a bit of a
far cry from the Lumia 1020 here which
is just that matte polycarbonate which
also feels great but it's just smooth
and slippery and this isn't this doesn't
feel like it's going to leave your your
palm at all there's that big ol HTC
clock widget and otherwise the typical
Windows Start screen so folks thank you
for watching our very quick unboxing and
very cursory hardware tour of the HTC 8x
t4 sprint we are going to be taking a
close look at this device in the coming
days so stay tuned to pocket now and
we'll talk to you soon
