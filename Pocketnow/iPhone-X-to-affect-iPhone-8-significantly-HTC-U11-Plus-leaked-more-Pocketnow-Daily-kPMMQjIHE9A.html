production by a very significant margin
according to analysts lead renders of
the HTC u 11 plus and may look like the
U 11 but just from a distance and BIC
speed 2.0 means major changes to the
approach of Samsung's digital assistant
I'm Jaime meadow Iveta and the reason
why I'm here for those of you asking is
because it's my best friend's wedding so
I won't be able to wear t-shirts for
that this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals the
essential phone continues to be one of
those products that I love to use but
the camera is still a work in progress
that actually got really really good
with the update that arrived yesterday
anyways those of you in the market it
currently dropped a hundred dollars on
Best Buy and what I recommend the phone
I actually would everything about this
phone is really good and again if you
installed the pixel apk it actually
takes some really good photos it clearly
is a software issue another interesting
deal has to do with the Samsung gear
sport which just launched in pre-orders
if you remember one of the major selling
points of this watch is the fact that it
integrates really well with Spotify you
can download Spotify songs to it and
well the deal is that if you get the
pre-order for the swatch you will get
six months of spotify premium that is a
good deal on its own that's pretty much
60 I think it's like 16 bucks that
you're getting here so what I jump on
that watch I I definitely would I
actually really do like it
and speaking of Samsung let's move the
spotlight over to big speed 2.0 as well
we see some major changes in bixby it is
now becoming pretty much a platform the
whole idea is that whatever has been
done to the phone which has been
actually very good I highly recommend
you give it a try is now going to be
ported to other things like televisions
like refrigerators and the Android
powered toaster Samsung would ever build
that the whole idea here is that Bixby
will work with pretty much everything
that Samsung builds I think that's a
very smart move particularly with the
way Bixby works again if you haven't
given it a try trust me it is worth it
now let's talk about the HTC u 11 plus
we've got some leaked renders on video
of what to expect from this
and well it looks like a u11 because of
its glass back but everything else is
different the internals we expect them
to be the same but then apparently this
phone is becoming tall we noticed that
the back has the fingerprint scanner and
obviously this allows the taller aspect
ratio
the only problem or I guess the only
thing that's not going away are the
bezels it seems that there is a large
top and bottom bezel even though the
bezels on the side are slimmer whatever
the case may be
I can't wait to confirm what we are
getting here we should be learning more
about it soon and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
analysts and predictions of the iPhone
10 and iPhone AIDS
according to trusted sources it seems
that Apple is already preparing to draw
production of the iPhone 8 by as much as
50% why because the iPhone 10 is coming
and Apple has pretty much noticed that
people care more about the iPhone 10
than the iPhone 8 and it makes you
wonder it clearly seems that Apple just
launched the iPhone 8 as a consolation
prize or as I mentioned in my review as
a plan-b hey look if you want an iPhone
now you got it here it's got almost the
same specs but the newer iPhone the
change in design while we having
problems building it so why don't you
get this consolation price for now until
we get the 10 it seems that way and so
it leads me to the question today I mean
do you think it was a good idea for
Apple to launch this iPhone 8 or do you
think it would have been smarter for
Apple to focus all of its resources on
just one iPhone 10 and even if we'd have
to wait for it until November would you
have rather waited until November for
your iPhone or are you okay with the
iPhone 8 because in my case I think the
iPhone 8 wasn't a good idea I think it's
a great phone don't get me wrong if you
forget about the forgettable hardware up
the phone reforms you really pretty much
better than any iPhone that I've ever
used
but then again why not just wait for the
10 leave us a comment down below I would
