as sales continue to rise Samsung is
already noticing a slump in device
orders for its new galaxies it seems
these people are already complaining
about some Moto X speaker issues I'm hi
meri behna and is it just me or is blue
clearly my favorite color this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Qualcomm as the company
has just announced its Snapdragon 820
617 and 430 processors in addition to
Qualcomm three-point Oh quick charge and
well obviously Snapdragon 820 is the big
news particularly because in addition to
its speed it also supports LTE cat 12
which pretty much won't be able to test
yet but addition to that quick charge
three point 0 will give you eighty
percent of battery life from zero in
around 35 minutes which is close to 0
pose book rapid charging and that's
great but hey we'll just have to wait
for a phone that supports it and for
those of you that are already enjoying
the Moto X your addition let's just hope
you're not having trouble with the
speaker we've already got a significant
amount of users complaining about the
top speaker generating some rattling
noises for reasons that they don't
understand obviously these have to do
with sound effects it could be a
software bug it could be hardware just
stay tuned as we see with Motorola plans
to do about that and then there's that
we were all expecting are now happening
I mean what is an iphone without scar
City problems and we wonder if this is
just partially marketing but anyways it
seems that Apple is already struggling
with the iphone success plus
particularly because its supplier is
having a hard time producing enough back
lights for its displays the wonder of
Apple can't really prepare for these
things but anyways seems the pre-orders
are going crazy so far that could be the
problem it could just be that Apple's
playing around and speaking of supply
news it seems that Samsung is already
struggling with its Galaxy smartphones
but not because it can't meet the man
currently the company is already
lowering the amount of supply needs for
its Galaxy smartphones because well it
could be that the iphone is doing some
damage or it could just be that the
company is lowering certain product
lines because obviously the note 5 the
galaxy s6 edge+ are already out there
whatever the case may be we should learn
more in the company's quarter results
coming soon
and finally for the very interesting
rumors of the day some trusted sources
are claiming that Samsung is already
gearing up for foldable device to be
announced early next year now bear in
mind by foldable we're not necessarily
talking about a device that could just
been like the LG G flex or the horrible
galaxy round we're talking about a phone
that you can actually fold like fully
closed like a clamshell which would be
great wouldn't be amazing for clamshell
smartphones to come back it's really
hard to believe though but the
specification seemed quite decent looks
of this report full details but it does
lead me to the question of the day if
Samsung were to pull a foldable device
that will turn like into an old
clamshell like the v3 from Motorola you
know the razor would you want to buy a
smartphone like this in my case hey if
it's foldable and you don't lose
functionality in the display I would
love a phone like that but it was a
comment down below what do you think
friends as always you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video was filmed mushy follow us on
pocketnow.com it's a sharp change
channel as well you can follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore be better on
Instagram at high Meadow be better
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hi Mary better

see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
