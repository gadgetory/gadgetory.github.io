Samsung's tablets have long been
synonymous with Android but here at CES
2016 the company is changing that up
with one of the slimmest sleekest
Windows devices we've ever touched
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is a first look at the Samsung Tab
pro s brought to you by D brand Samsung
has been impressing us on the hardware
side since 2014's Galaxy alpha but the
Tab pro s still deserves a special
call-out for its beauty the magnesium
alloy chassis is 6.3 millimeters thick
and masses just 693 grams the back cover
made of a matte material that picks up
fingerprints really easily but still
looks sharp in both black and white
it's the thickness or the lack of it
that we really can't get past it not
only has Samsung squeezed a 5200
milliamp hour battery in here but it's
also packed in 4 gigs of RAM and 128 or
256 gigs solid-state drive the display
is a 2160 by 1440 Super AMOLED at 12
inches and it's absolutely gorgeous in
person and the Tab pro s breaks with a
maddening tradition of charging extra
for an accessory that should be included
the keyboard comes in the same box key
size and travel are plenty fine the
connection to the tablet is via Hardware
terminals and once you get the hang of
it's tricky magnetic flap you can
position the tablet at either a desk
friendly 63Â° for something much more
laid-back four-lap typing and it only
gets better when you boot into the
software this isn't an Android tablet
but instead of full power Microsoft PC
running the desktop version of Windows
10 that's powered by an Intel Core m3
processor rather than something a bit
more beefy so while we'll have to spend
some time out in the real world to
determine what kind of a workload this
device can deal with I will say that the
floor models here in Vegas were very
responsive with almost no Samsung
customizations aside from some display
tailoring options buried in the settings
the company seems confident it can make
the tablet stand out through Hardware
alone and from the industrial design to
the optional Bluetooth stylus to the
future proofing features like USB type-c
if that confidence seems well placed for
a Windows user who doesn't need quite as
much power
service pro but still wants a
great-looking convertible the tabpro s
might be just the thing when it launches
in the second half of the year assuming
the price is right and the processor
holds up of course we said much the same
of the companies at Eve offerings in
years past
so only real-world testing will
determine whether the performance lives
up to the promise we'll have the answer
later on this year till then there's a
whole lot more to cover at CES 2016 in
Las Vegas subscribe here on YouTube and

time this has been michael fisher with
high auto Houston behind the camera
