using the Oppo find 7 or find 7a it's
stuck on a version of color OS that runs
on Android 4.3 jelly bean yeah I know
that's terrible
but the company has decided to give
users a very elegant alternative to get
android 5.1 lollipop I'm Jaime to be
better with pocket now here with a quick
look at project spectrum from oboe color
OS is well color OS some people hate it
some people like it
elbow did a good job at listening to
customers with the latest version that's
running on the Oppo r7 plus and I'll
even admit that that's one of my
favorite Android skins to date the only
problem is if you have a legacy Oppo
phone you still don't have it instead
Oppo decided to play a smarter move with
its project spectrum and I'm not sure
what you're really getting here is stock
Android experience but with the added
features that Oppo pioneered in most
cases at the moment it only works on the
Oppo find 7 and fine 7a and to get it to
work you really only need to follow the
link in the description with the
instructions and download the ROM to
your device the ROM is in beta true but
given the fact that Oppo is actually
promoting it I wouldn't worry too much
once you've downloaded the wrong use
oboes file explorer to place the rom on
the SD card and then simply turn off the
phone after that you press the power and
volume down button until the Oppo branch
shows up and then you let them go and
wait for the company's recovery engine
to load some of these are a touch base
like in the case of mind but in other
cases they aren't so you'll have to use
the volume keys select your language
erase the phone's cache and then simply
select the wrong you have to install
the whole process of installation takes
around eight to nine minutes and then
you're given the prompt to reboot the
phone and then after that it'll take
another two to three minutes for the
phone to boot so make sure you bring
some coffee once that's done you're
greeted with a familiar face android
5.1.1 lollipop yes you can restore your
phone from another Android device using
NFC and tap and go because this is one
of the few OPA phones left with NFC
and after that's done you get an ear
stock Android experience with all the
sense of the word with some exceptions
though that I'll mention later first let
me give you a few pointers to make sure
that your experience is pleasant and you
avoid some of the mistakes that we made
number one make sure you activate
unified storage and settings so that you
won't have to install everything again
because the phone actually partitions
them so yeah if you don't do it like we
did we all have to follow this process
again but only to install your apps as
the ROM is here state don't worry about
that point then if you want things like
double tap to wake in the circle gesture
to launch the camera you'll actually
have to go to the accessibility settings
to enable these open was nice enough to
include the r7 plus camera app which is
one of my favorites I even praised it
for the fact that you don't only get a
bevy of options but also some very nifty
manual controls the multitasking menu is
buried within the double tap on the home
button as well so no you won't be able
to turn off the display with this like
you can on other OPA phones last but not
least even though the launcher looks a
lot like the Google now launcher it
actually isn't this is one of the
differences so make sure you install the
Google now launcher from the Google Play
Store to get the full stock Android
experience
overall I'm gonna admit it this brought
some new life to the Oppo find 7 the
experience is smooth and even though I
still have to play along with it I
haven't found any bugs over the last day
or two that I've been using it my advice
to you is to follow the instructions and
give it a try I'm sure you won't be
disappointed the more videos like these
make sure you follow us on social media
and Scripture YouTube channel as well
you can follow me on Twitter I'm under
squattery better on Instagram at high
memory data please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
hanging that event thank you very much
for watching we'll see you on the next
