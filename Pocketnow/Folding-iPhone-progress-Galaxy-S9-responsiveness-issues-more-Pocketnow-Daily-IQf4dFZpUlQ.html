foldable iPhone in the works believe it
or not
while we wants to start putting
fingerprint scanners on the display as
of this year and Apple is launching
their budget-friendly iPad but we'll
have to wait for the MacBook until later
I'm Jaime Rivera and it's gonna be kind
of hard to get to the daily next week
I'll be in China you know I always try
to figure this out but in case I don't
there will be some awesome coverage from
that this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals
those new other options that are
available on eBay continue getting good
I mean if you're in the market for the
HTC u 11 it's currently available for
345 bucks
that's pretty much half off the price is
it worth it for that money are you
kidding me of course
go for it now let's talk about Apple for
those of you asking yourself what will
happen on that March 27th event
apparently source is closer to Bloomberg
claimed that it's not going to be about
new MacBooks apparently we're getting
iPads at least one iPad that's gonna
cost somewhere around 259 bucks and
there's apparently also going to be
education related software as this event
that's mostly focused on education it's
kind of weird that Apple continues to
want to bet over the concept that iPads
are better for education where
Chromebooks are just completely owning
the market but hey it's Apple now let's
talk about Samsung if you have just
received your galaxy as an arrest 9 plus
and you have responsiveness issues on
your display apparently you're not alone
it seems that it's something that even
Samsung has admitted to the point where
the company is looking into the matter
and they're urgently trying to fix it
but the only option you have right now
is to try to reset the phone I can't
tell you that I have issues with either
of the two units that I have but I will
definitely keep you posted as soon as we
learn more about this now let's talk
about Huawei we are expecting the
company's new P 20 and P 20 pro
happening next Tuesday but apparently
the company is working hard on new
technology for the Mait 11 and since the
teaser is mostly photography in the case
of the P 20 apparently the Mait 11 is
going to be about news
analogies like for example an on display
fingerprint scanner apparently Huawei is
working so hard on this the company
plans to get a to list this year whether
that's gonna happen or not it's hard to
tell it's just interesting how we're
moving away from the concept of not just
and now we're talking about on display
fingerprint scanners and finally the
most interesting news is they have to do
either with a foldable iPhone or with
the feature of the iPad Mini so bear
with me we've got some sources that are
claiming that Apple is working really
hard on this foldable display either
iPhone or iPad to be launched in 2020
the whole concept apparently is to bring
that versatility where you have a
smartphone you need it and for that to
turn into a tablet when you need it it
makes all the sense in the world if you
look at the way iOS is designed
particularly for tablets it's kind of
with that purpose where you can flip it
and get a user interface and then you
could just go horizontal and get another
one
apparently that is going to be the case
and that's all great but it leads me to
the question today I mean doing this
design is not new we've seen it with the
axon and we've seen it with the Kyocera
echo these concepts haven't taken off do
you feel that Cupertino would be the
company to figure it out 1 &amp;amp; 2 what
exactly would that thing need to do for
you to be willing to buy it because in
my case it would have to be thin really
thin leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
