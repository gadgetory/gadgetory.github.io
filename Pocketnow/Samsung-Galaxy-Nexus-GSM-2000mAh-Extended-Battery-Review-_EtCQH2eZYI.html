there's one thing that we can never get
enough of in our smartphones it's
battery life so let's go ahead and take
a look at the extended battery the
official one from Samsung for the gsm
version of galaxy nexus all right so
what we've got here is to gsm galaxy
neck size or nexuses or there's two of
them all right one of them has the
extended battery on it a little bit of
dust there one of them doesn't can you
tell which one at first glance it's kind
of hard to tell until you really start
looking over at the side so if you look
at it this way you can tell one is just
a little bit thicker than the other or
can you it's kind of difficult to tell
so let's go ahead and see what I'm
talking about even that angle you really
can't tell alright so let's look at the
backs here and see if you can tell now
this way it's kind of obvious over here
this has a little chin and then it's
really flat this has no chin it's just a
nice smooth transition all the way up to
the top so let's see what we did here
this battery upgrade kit really is an
official one from Samsung so you can
trust in it it's got the NFC antenna
built into the battery and it comes with
a new backplate this is the original
backplate you can see the little chin
there that exists right there and
doesn't exist there this is the nice
thin battery 1750 milliamp hour that
comes with the phone originally so let's
go ahead and take this off and see what
I'm talking about snaps off just the
same there's the back plate looks very
nice it still has a nice grippy texture
to it looks good on the inside comparing
that to the other one it looks pretty
much the same except there's a little
bit of a rounded edge here on the sides
where this is entirely flat and if
first you don't have that chin there
anymore on the inside you can see that
battery sticks up a little bit how much
is a little let's take a look at the
inside of this one so that battery is
flat and actually a little bit recessed
whereas that one sticks up noticeably it
doesn't stick up any higher than the
back part of the curve back here which
is why we can simply by adding this back
plate take care of that extra bulk now
that means that there is a bit of extra
space up around here that isn't taken up
by well this is just empty space
underneath this they've kind of filled
that in a little bit with this little
plastic piece here but overall you know
not bad in fact after I try this out for
this back goes on just like the other
does make sure you snap it in all the
way around same as this one you push it
in and work your way up to get it all
nice and snap together now it fits
really well in hand I really miss the
chin i didn't think i would but that
gives you something to grip something to
hang on to wear this is just kind of
flat and for the first day or so it was
kind of i missed it but after that not
so much this feels nice it fits good in
fact it doesn't have that weird kind of
bulge there at the bottom that some
people complained about so really kind
of neat disadvantage up here there's a
little bit of give where the back panel
doesn't really seat well against the LED
light for the the camera but really not
noticeable okay so that's what it looks
like and how it feels overall how does
it work well compared to the the battery
this is 2,000 milliamp hours versus 1750
milliamp hours over there again 17 50ml
am power in that battery how does it
perform well just as well as you'd
expect it to it's only about ten percent
bigger actually a little bit closer to
fourteen but it doesn't give you much
more battery life if you're really
struggling to get through the day am
the good investment go ahead and pick up
one of these it will get you probably
another hour maybe an hour and a half of
the same type of use that you put on it
through a normal day now if you can get
through the day just fine or if you're
really close to a power outlet where you
can charge that up and top it off either
on your way to work or from work or
while you're sitting at your desk you
don't need that extended battery at all
if however you spend a lot of time away
from your desk or you're taking mass
transit where you don't have the ability
to get to a charger absolutely that
extra ten fifteen percent you're going
to get out of that battery it's really
going to come in handy so would i buy
the battery myself actually yes i would
but not for me because i'm at a desk all
day long i'd buy this in fact as soon as
this video is over I'm going to
transplant that battery from my phone
into my wife's phone because she doesn't
plug in it stays in her pocket all day
long so for her it's absolutely
wonderful it's perfect for me I can plug
in I can afford that for you you're
going to have to decide that and of
course let us know when an extra
fourteen fifteen percent of battery life
come in handy for you and how much money
would you pay for that let us know down
in the comments if you want to find out
where you can pick up your own extended
battery again this is an official one
from Samsung it does have the NFC
antenna built into it there is no
gimmickry going on here to get extra
juice inside that battery it is actually
all there but if you want to find out
how to get your own head on over to
pocketnow.com and we will have a link
there for you in the article for pocket
