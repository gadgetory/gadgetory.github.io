out what kind of motion technology is
going on at comic-con in New York check
it out first up Thursday night Finn come
through party celebrating then launched
their new free-to-play mobile
role-playing game called hello hero this
will soon be available on iOS Android
and facebook with cross-platform
multiplayer capabilities hundreds of
hero characters multiple gameplay modes
great 3d graphics and even community
boss battles on the show floor we found
plenty of fun mobile tablet stuff as
well at the Wacom booth I really wanted
to try out the new Bluetooth pen that
they made for iPads it gathers its own
pressure sensitivity data within the pen
and then communicates that to certain
drawing apps via bluetooth it's a huge
departure from welcomes normal
electromagnetic digitizer built into the
screen of their high-end syntek products
really it's kind of a hack built for the
iPad and unfortunately it didn't even
work at comic-con on the other hand
behind that Blackham was also showing
their new syntech companion Windows 8
tablet which worked beautifully the
cintiq companion they had there was
running a core i7 processor with windows
8 and a full adobe creative cloud
software suite it also had eight gigs of
RAM for all those high-end programs this
tablet is similar to the surface pro and
that it has pressure sensitive
electromagnetic digitizer from welcome
built in the screen becomes version is
much more accurate supports twice as
many pressure levels and even supports
stylus tilt sensitivity stylist tilts
input is important for applications like
Corel Painter which can simulate natural
media such as directional airbrushes the
tablet is quite a bit larger than others
but that's a good thing because it gives
you a good area to work with we've also
got customizable shortcut keys on the
side you can program those four things
like controlling brush size or accessing
modifier keys of course you can plug in
larger monitor as well and the tablet
comes with a detachable plastic stand in
a nice soft case with pockets withstand
the stylus box the tablet and a wireless
Bluetooth keyboard
overall this Wacom Cintiq companion
really looks like the mobile tablet for
any kind of digital artists especially
comic book artists another game being
shown off at comic-con was Pig fish this
is a new game for iOS and Android which
seems to have very simple one touch
controls we basically make a pig fish
swim through sewers to collect power-ups
there was a verizon booth at comic-con
as well their most popular product there
was the Sphero the sphere was a
remote-control ball that changes colors
and rolls around but you control it from
a tablet app I thought this would be
interesting to see but the Android app
just would not work while I was there
there were also a few motion comic apps
at Comicon one was essentially a comic
book converted into something like a
movie where the still images move around
the screen with occasional animation as
well as voiceover for dialogue another
called comiXology doesn't have the audio
but works with a wider range of comic
books for most simply animates to the
next frame or scene but some comics were
reprogrammed so that speech bubbles
appear as layers in the order that you
should read them Intel had a huge booth
filled with intel-powered tablets and
PCs for people to play games on many
were touchscreen tablets running Windows
8 with a few android-powered tablets as
well we also found a new social
networking app called rabble which
allows you to post videos and audio
messages but people can also comment
with video and audio replies overall
tablets certainly seem to be the
direction for mobile technology these
days even in the comic book scene sure
to give this video thumbs up and thanks
for watching
