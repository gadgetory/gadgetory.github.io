through party celebrating then launch
their new free-to-play mobile
role-playing game called hello hero this
will soon be available on iOS Android
and Facebook with cross-platform
multiplayer capabilities hundreds of
hero characters multiple gameplay modes
great 3d graphics and even community
boss battles on the show of floor we
found plenty of fun mobile tablet stuff
as well at the Wacom booth I really
wanted to try out the new Bluetooth pen
that they made for iPads and gathers its
own pressure sensitivity data within the
pen and then communicates that to
certain drawing apps via Bluetooth it's
a huge departure from Wacom normal
electromagnetic digitizer built into the
screen of their high-end syntek products
really it's kind of a hack built for the
iPad and unfortunately it didn't even
work at Comic Con on the other hand
behind that blacken was also showing
their new Cintiq companion Windows 8
tablet which worked beautifully the
Cintiq companion they had there was
running a Core i7 processor with Windows
8 and a full Adobe Creative Cloud
software suite it also had 8 gigs of RAM
for all those high-end programs this
tablet is similar to the surface pro and
that it has pressure-sensitive
electromagnetic digitizer from Wacom
built in the screen the Wacom spurgeon
is much more accurate supports twice as
many pressure levels and even supports
stylus tilt sensitivity stylus tilts
input is important for applications like
Corel Painter which can simulate natural
media such as directional air brushes
the tablet is quite a bit larger than
others but that's a good thing because
it would be a good area to work with
you've also got customizable shortcut
keys on the side you can program those
for things like controlling brush size
or accessing modifier keys of course you
can plug-in larger monitor as well and
the tablet comes with a detachable
plastic stand in a nice soft case with
pockets withstand the stylus box the
tablet and a wireless bluetooth keyboard
overall this Wacom Cintiq companion
really looks like the mobile tablet for
any kind of digital artists especially
comic book artists another game being
shown off at Comic Con was pigfish this
is a new game for iOS and Android which
seems to have very simple OneTouch
controls we basically make a pig fish
swim through sewers and to collect
power-ups there was a Verizon booth at
comic-con as well their most popular
product there was the Spiro the sphere
was a remote-controlled ball that
changes colors and rolls around but you
control it from a tablet app I thought
this would be interesting to see but the
Android app just would not work while I
was there there were also a few motion
comic apps at comic-con one was
essentially a comic-book converted into
something like a movie where the still
images move around the screen with
occasional animation as well as
voiceover for dialogue another called
comixology doesn't have the audio but
works with a wider range of comic books
for most it simply animates to the next
frame or scene but some comics were
reprogrammed so that speech bubbles
appear as layers in the order that you
should read them Intel had a huge booth
filled with Intel powered tablets and
PCs for people to play games on many
were touchscreen tablets running Windows
8 with a few Android powered tablets as
well we also found a new social
networking app called Bravo
which allows you to post videos and
audio messages but people can also
comment with a video an audio replies
overall tablet certainly seemed to be
the direction for mobile technology
these days even in the comic book scene
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
