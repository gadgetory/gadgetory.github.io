wearables are the next big thing pebble
is great and the Galaxy gear is a
SmartWatch that does well quite a bit
more unfortunately it only works on
select Samsung devices I'm Joe Levi for
PocketNow and this is how to get your
Galaxy gear to work with your Nexus 5
this is my Nexus 5 it's rooted but yours
shouldn't have to be now this hack came
out a little while ago and you might be
asking why are we only covering it now
well the reason being there was an
update to one of the files bringing it
up to version 1.6 we're hoping that will
help us with some of the problems that
we had when we tried to do it before so
hat tip to Michael Fisher for trying it
out this new version just came out
yesterday let's give it a shot so the
first thing you're gonna need to do is
download some files I've already got
those downloaded and we'll have links to
those and exactly what you're going to
need in the article over at PocketNow so
make sure you head over there to get the
stuff that you need next you're gonna
need a file explorer i've got root
explorer you can use pretty much
anything you want it does need the
ability to extract a zip files or apks
to zip so keep that in mind let's go
ahead and open this up now this is all
in my downloads folder and the first
thing that we're gonna do is come in
here and install one of these apps so
this file gr gear manager stub is the
first file that you're gonna want to
install simply tap on that choose
install of course you've got to be able
to install from unknown or untrusted
sources which you can do quickly and
easily through your your settings up in
their apps installed that parts done
this is where it gets a little bit
tricky the next file that we're going to
do is this gear manager and this is
version 1.6 point a whole bunch of other
numbers after it 1.3 blah blah blah
we can't just install it at least not
yet what we've got to do is extract that
the way we're going to do that is simply
to long press on this and we are going
to rename it and we're not going to do
anything particularly fancy we're just
going to take the
a PK and I'm not even going to take that
off I'm just going to add a dot zip say
okay and you can see now it's changed it
into a zip file and a BK is just a
specially organized zip file so this
isn't doing anything weird it's just
changing the handler from the Installer
to something that will help you strike
it files let's go ahead and open that up
and you can see we've got a whole bunch
of other files in here from here open
the assets folder and we want to open
the preinstalled apks notice none of
these are pre-installed because well we
haven't pre-installed them yet we want
to install all of those except for music
and weather and there are a bunch of
them so I'm gonna go ahead and do this
and you don't have to watch me do it you
know how to install an apk just install
them all and then we can go on to the
next step we've got ahead and extract of
this and then of course installed the
APK is the two that don't install our
music and whether they'll throw an error
so if you want to just install
everything just know that you're going
to get problems installing those and
that's just fine the next step is to
come back in here rename this back from
a zip to an APK I'm just gonna slide
over and do that delete done okay and
now we're right back there it's an apk
now we're going to install this since
those assets have already been
pre-installed next we want to connect
our galaxy gear to the gear manager
you'll want to make sure that you have
your Galaxy gear turned on it's got this
a nice little video that it plays
showing you just how to do it
make sure that's turned on or it's not
gonna work if you want to pair it
manually you can do that as well we're
gonna go ahead and check and say pair
and we're making a little bit more
progress through the manual setup than
we did through the automatic NFC setup
and use your license agreement sure
we'll say yes and next that I scroll to
the bottom apparently well we've got to
acknowledge and read carefully and
acknowledge and now we can next there we
our Galaxy gear is set up at this point
it's going to show us what we can do so
this is now all just the regular gear
stuff that you would expect to be be
able to be used with your brand new
Galaxy gear but again working on the
Nexus 5 next in gear manager we want to
go down to settings and in settings we
want to allow unknown sources so we can
install apps that aren't Samsung
approved onto our gear now the reason
for that if we come back over here we
want to install etienne manager the
latest version is 1.2.3 go ahead and tap
on that and we'll go ahead and scroll
down and say install now this is a
notification manager it's not all that
pretty but you are gonna be able to get
the notifications over to your gear that
you otherwise wouldn't be able to do so
once you're inside etienne manager
simply select what things that you want
to be able to get notifications for so
that's how to get your Galaxy gear
working with your Nexus 5 now this works
okay on the Nexus 5 but there hasn't
been much success with any other devices
out there if you have another Android
powered device and you want to give it a
try you're definitely welcome to do so
the instructions and the links to the
files that you need are going to be in
the article over at pocketnow.com and of
course we want to know your success your
challenges and even your failure in the
comments down below let us know if it
worked for you or not if you liked what
you saw here go ahead and throw the
video a thumbs up and of course if you
haven't subscribed yet you'll want to
make sure that you do so it's the best
way that you can keep up to date with
everything that's happening in the
mobile arena if you want to follow us on
