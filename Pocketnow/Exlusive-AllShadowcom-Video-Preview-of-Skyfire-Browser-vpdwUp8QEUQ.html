calm and I'm pleased to bring you this
video preview of the skyfire beta
recently I was allowed to have a look at
it so here it is running on the tmobile
shadow if you want to find out more
about that go to all shadow calm what
I'm going to do is show you how this
works over Wi-Fi and over the normal
edge connection that we all get
everywhere anyways here is the start
page for Sky fire and it's pretty useful
along the top you have their search bar
followed by three tabs for your featured
web pages bookmarks in history under
featured there's five more tabs for news
sports social shop and video now I know
everybody's real interested in how does
this work with video and what not but
we'll get to that so first we're going
to take a look at a couple web pages and
see how they look on skype fire as you
can see there's like this mouse like
pointer if you've ever used opera mini
it's similar to that when you're not
over a link actually it'll you could
still use it to navigate around in the
bottom right there's a menu key and go
there you can mute audio now some of you
might find that interesting well that's
for when you're on a web page with audio
basically not just video now you can go
and enter a web address or go back to
the start page visit your bookmarks
actions or egg exit now all I have in
under bookmarks is all shadow com we'll
get to that in a minute interactions you
have forward refresh view history zoom
smart fit drag controls settings helping
about so under settings let's take a
look at that we can clear cookies or
clear history I'm sure as time goes by
there's going to be some more settings
for us to choose from all right so we're
going to go to all shadow calm see what
we can have there it is now remember
this is over Wi-Fi
now I have a pretty decent cable
connection here at home so what you're
seeing is actually the web page being
rendered now as you can see you can move
around the web page looks pretty much
how it does on the computer okay so if
you want to see how this works you could
just click where you want to see and
you'll get a zoom demented image and
then it will improve and you can even go
to the all shadowkhan store from your
mobile if you want to do that through
this browser or there is actually we
have a mobile store as well but as you
can see most of it it all shows up
exactly how it does in a normal browser
pretty interesting so let's go back to
the start page take a look a couple
other pages so we'll go to yahoo news
and check that out hey pretty fast now
when you zoom down or when you slide
down if you get that checkered screen
it's just because that part of the page
hasn't loaded yet it's usually pretty
decent so far that I played with it
where it loads those you can zoom in on
the news looks like Clinton Obama are
going to face off in three contests and
you can easily press back to zoom back
out or you could press the one or the
three keys now on the shadow it works a
little little funky right now but
they're going to take care of that as
time goes by these keys are supposed to
meant to zoom in so you can see how the
zoom box changes so if you want to
change how you actually view the page or
what part of the page you want to see
it'll do that and let's see what happens
here so as you can see use that part of
the page so let's change how much of
this we want to actually look at zoom
back out great alright so I'm pushing
the back space key on my key pad so I
can move back and forth on that if you
were wondering all right so let's go
back to our start page
now the moment that you've all been
waiting for we're going to look at a
video site and just take a look at a
video here's YouTube showing exactly the
way it shows up how they plan it on the
desktop browser now you can click play
after you zoom in as you can see it kind
of doesn't really fit into the screen
too well and that's what the whole
zooming in and out is for you could zoom
out until you get a good fit there now
these are the nice football ads that
we've all seen let's take a look at
those see how they play so as you can
see that works pretty well now if you
want to stop the controls are pretty
much the same as they are on the full
screen but to get rid of that annoying
little talking stayin there a lot of the
more frequently used websites are
already listed on the the bookmarks here
now when you click into the search box
up top you'll get a box down below where
you can type in things so we're going to
try and see what happens here I got to
turn off my numeric we're going to try
and see what happens when we search for
something well known like all shadow
calm all right so that's what we want
press ok and we'll paste it in to the
search box up above we're going to hit
search and different search results come
back we got google results and Yahoo
that images see what shows up there no
results from yahoo see what videos we
have google videos there's our videos
see some maps good look for no map found
for all shadow calm that's because we're
everywhere
here we go we're going to look at how it
works over edge we're just going to go
to yahoo news i'm going to go through
everything so we've already done that
and this is just how it's going to work
over edge again we have the loading bar
below this is over edge we're not
connected via Wi-Fi so let's take a look
see if we can find a video so let's go
to the videos youtube I change my zoom
here all right okay change the zoom
hopefully that words popping up there
will change shortly so and here we go
let's see how this plays and it
shouldn't play as well as Wi-Fi that
just makes sense now as you could tell
that there's kind of its kind of jumping
away with the video but the audio is
still there so if you absolutely have to
hear what something here a video that's
good over edge but through Wi-Fi it's
preferable over Wi-Fi so go back to our
start page and that's all for now and
until I see you next time on Mike Benton
as always for all shadow com
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
