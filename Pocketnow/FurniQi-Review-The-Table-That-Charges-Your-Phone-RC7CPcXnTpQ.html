today I'm reviewing a table you better
believe it because it's not just any
table it's a table that charges your
smartphone this is PocketNow blackberry
Windows Phone Android wear Samsung Droid
these are just a few of the brand names
that have embraced wireless charging and
like it or not it's a thing and you
should like it because it's awesome yeah
if you want to be pedantic about it
there are still wires involved at some
point and yeah it's not as fast as a
cable can sometimes be but the
convenience of dropping your phone on a
pad rather than fiddling with a
connector is something that has to be
experienced to be fully appreciated and
now a company called phone salesman has
made that even easier by building a
wireless charger right into a table this
is furniture and even discounting all of
its wireless wizardry it's a pretty cool
table it's about a foot and a half high
and it's got a 15 inch diameter top
that's spacious enough for a lot of
stuff it's made of lightweight bamboo
with a style meant to fit in just about
anywhere if phones Hillsman says it
takes about two minutes to put together
while the reality might be more like
five minutes if we're still talking
about four screws and an allen wrench
which comes included there's really
nothing to it the wireless charging
magic comes from the embedded wood puck
charger which rests in a small recess on
the tables underside a subtle laser-cut
ring and the bamboo top side provides a
visual cue for where to drop your phone
and once you do a short beep sounds to
let you know you've found the sweet spot
any device with Qi support will take a
charge but we've tested it with more
than 10 devices over the past month and
all of them took power from the
furniture without a problem so it's
simple elegant convenient and oh yes
spill resistant as well so where does it
come up short
well the USB cord is finished in beige
to better blend in with the bamboo but
it probably could have been integrated
more cleanly than the included clips
allow also it doesn't come with a wall
adapter so you've got to use your own
phone salesman says this was a
deliberate decision meant to reduce
waste
speaking of adapters if your phone isn't
Qi compatible
you'll need to pick up an adapter to
enable it and while the furniture is a
little pricey even if you get in at the
early panda level on IndieGoGo you're
looking at a hundred and nineteen
dollars for a single charger table and
179 for the version with two power pucks
built in the company promises that those
early pandas will get their furniture in
time for Christmas though and the more
widely publicized competition from Ikea
is priced in the same neighborhood phone
salesman sent us a bonus to your package
called the Home Collection which
includes two products the wood puck and
chief stone plus alongside the furniture
these work as advertised the wood puck
is basically the same chargers in the
table just independent and much cheaper
while the chief stone plus is a fully
self-contained external battery with
wireless charging on both sides so that
means you can use it to charge your
phone anywhere at any time or even
charge one phone wirelessly and another
one on a cable and when it's 4,000 the
Lamb power pack is dead you can drop it
on the furniture or any Qi charger to
refill it combined with a soft touch
paint job that makes it super
comfortable to hold and really pleasing
to behold it's tough to find much wrong
with the Qi stone plus the wireless
charging landscape is no stranger to
innovative designs but phone salesman
has really taken it up a notch here in
terms of the overall aesthetic they may
not be the cheapest products out there
but for those who want to class up their
charging or those in search of a gift
for the wireless charging aficionado in
their life the phone salesman Home
Collection definitely deserves a look
for more wireless charging reviews check
out our other videos here on YouTube and
stay tuned to pocketnow.com
for some more coverage of Qi goodies
coming in the next week or so till next
time this has been michael fisher

watching we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
