mobile browser data android for not 43
already spotted on some google play
edition phones in samsung tease is a new
form factor for its Galaxy Note lineup
I'm hi meri beta and there's a reason
why we were read whenever our team
doesn't win a soccer game look that up
this is pocket now daily let's begin
today with what's official as google has
just launched their camera application
for everybody that runs an android phone
just like they did with its keyboard so
if you're currently complaining about
the software on your smartphone camera
this is a great solution michael fisher
has a full video on everything you can
expect though sadly camera performance
on nexus devices hasn't been the best
and apparently most of it has to do with
software but anyways look to the
description follow the whole procedure
get it and tell us what you think and
speaking of underwhelming cameras the
HTC One m8 has dual cameras and the
company promised an SDK that they now
launched it's now available for
developers and they can do some
interesting things with the cameras
though this will all depend on how many
m8 sell in the markets and exactly how
limited that is we don't know exactly
what you could do with 4 megapixels
these days but anyways the legs are the
scripture full details on everything
let's see what they do now let's talk
about Google is apparently the company
is readying its Android 4.3 update we
talked about this yesterday and now it's
being leaked on the Sony Xperia Z ultra
which is actually called just the Z
ultra now Google Play edition for some
reason they're ditching the xperia name
i'm sure exactly why but yeah it's being
tested apparently it's just a bug fix we
don't know exactly when we're getting it
but hopefully it happens soon and some
people are complaining about you know
the way KitKat works on some cases and
some people can play that they don't
have it like me now software update that
we weren't expecting as iOS 7 dot one
dot one and it's being leaked now in the
apple campus in mobile browser data so
apparently Apple is already testing and
it should be out soon we don't know
exactly what is being fixed with this
and we are expecting I was eight to
happen in June so apparently this is
going to happen in the middle and
hopefully it fixes some things in car
play like the fact that we don't have a
card compatible with it and finally for
the very hot news of the day Samsung
executives are now T
seeing that they will bring a new form
factor with the Galaxy Note 4 the
question is exactly what form factor
could they bring I mean the phablet is
already a new form factor and we don't
have any details exactly we're expecting
this phone to launch a tifa in
august/september and you know that means
you to the question of the day what do
you think would be this new form factors
they would bring because in my
particular case a probably a rounded
galaxy note 4 could be the case we
didn't see this with the galaxy s5 which
we were expecting the galaxy round was a
joke so leave us a comment down below
what do you think will happen and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is filming she follow us on
parking our comment subscribe to youtube
channel as well you can also follow me
on twitter highly underscored iveta
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hi Mary better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
