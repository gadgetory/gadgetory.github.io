eight might include some LG parts apples
airports go live and can you believe
that there were long lines at stores and
TCL teases the next blackberry to arrive
at CES 2017 I'm hi Mary vetta the dark
keeps barking and raise your hands for
those of you that are still hungover
from the weekend this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals I know a lot of your big fans of
third-party Android launchers I am not
that much it depends on the OEM really
but for those of you that enjoy nova
launcher which i know is probably one of
the most popular well it's currently
just 99 cents at the google play store
that's pretty much a lot of money down
from five bucks so I would move on that
even if you don't eat it other official
news have to do with product launches as
a Apple has made their air pods official
in stores I'm not exactly sure if the
company actually ended up selling out or
not but what I do know is that there
were long lines at Apple stores trying
to buy these things and I'm trying to
figure this out we actually chose not to
review and mainly because we feel that
they're just not functional enough but
hey if you want us to review these
products leave us a comment down below
um sure if they fall off I will laugh
during the video I will tell you that
other officials news have to do with
blackberry or better said TCL which is
the parent company that's dealing with
blackberry hardware for those of you
wondering exactly when we're getting the
next product believe it or not the
company has just teased that we should
expect something at CES 2017 I will be
there covering it live and I cannot wait
I do love to see a hardware in alcatel I
do love with the company's doing with
blackberry I can't wait to give it a try
now speaking of product announcements
those of you expecting the galaxy s
eight at CES forget it mwc trusted
sources claim forget it apparently we're
getting an event in New York City to
announce the s8 one thing that we will
be getting in january is the post-mortem
for what happened to the note 7 so yeah
delayed essayed would makes a lot of
sense we hear the samsung plants a lot
of innovation here but we can't wait to
hear what happened with the note 7 as
well and finally the very interesting
news today have to do again with the
galaxy s 8 and what to expect with this
phone we've heard a ton of
from a edge-to-edge glass full design
that's great we've been wondering where
the fingerprint scanner is going to be
and well we hear from a source that
apparently the reason why we're not
getting a fingerprint scanner at the
front or at least not in the glass
because it's going to be in the back and
well that could be the favorite
placement for many companies I know that
Google made a big deal out of it and we
do know that Google has been mingling
with Samsung over the future of Galaxy
smartphones so it could be that they're
being forced to put it at the back we're
not sure but another thing that we are
hearing is that apparently there will be
an LG battery on this phone LG has been
very famous for its battery technology
its tier design ever since the LG g2 it
makes a lot of sense in the world for
samsung to want to share responsibility
with the s8 I feel that that's a great
idea but it leads me to the question of
the day let's move back to the thing
about the fingerprint scanner galaxy
phones are the most popular ones but do
you think that Sampson should move to
the back or do you think that the
company should remain with its current
design in my case I feel that a
background in fingerprint scanner would
be great but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
