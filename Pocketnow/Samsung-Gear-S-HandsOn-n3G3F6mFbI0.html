chance to get some first-hand experience
with Samsung's newest Gear watch I'm
sailor Marc the pocket now and here is
the Samsung gear s curved displays are
Samsung's big gambit this year gimmick
or not it's definitely turning heads
though we're not sold on the Note edge
and it's alleged utility but there is a
curved display that we're quite fond of
on a device where a curved display just
makes sense the gear s Samsung's new
Tizen watch right off the bat this watch
is a heavy hitter not necessarily for
its internals though inside it specs are
fairly basic for a 2014 wearable it has
a 1 gigahertz dual-core cpu 512
megabytes of RAM 4 gigabytes of storage
in a 300 million power battery it comes
with Bluetooth 4.1 Wi-Fi 802 a levan BGN
an accelerometer gyroscope compass heart
rate monitor ambient light sensor and a
barometer the catch here is 3G
connectivity and that this watch can
stand on its own if you so choose for
initial setup preparing you must have a
compatible galaxy smartphone but after
that you can leave your phone and still
get functionality out of the gear s it
also has a rather large 2 inch 360 by
480 pixel Super AMOLED display it
contours to the wrist allowing for more
screen real estate without dramatically
increasing the footprint but make no
mistake the gear s is a big watch it's
made really well though and the clasp is
extremely solid it also comes with a
swath of band options including
Swarovski crystal bands the software
comes with some tweaks as well for
example you can reply to messages
straight from the watch with an
on-screen keyboard you can also receive
calls from your wrist forwarded from
your phone it has here navigation for
use with the built-in GPS and SL
features for fitness tracking it's one
of the most feature packed connected
smartwatches of the year for sure but
we're not certain many will be sold on
such a large watch with limited
compatibility especially with so many
interesting Android wear watches hitting
around the same time you can expect it
sometime in October for a yet to be
determined price thanks for watching
everyone stay tuned to PocketNow for
more straight from the floor here at
Aoife in Berlin I'm Taylor Martin you
can find me on twitter at casper tech
and i see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
