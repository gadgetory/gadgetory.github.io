devices dropping into our collective
laps here at pocket now and while we
wrap up full reviews we wanted to check
in with the huawei mate 9 we didn't do
our traditional unboxing and first
impressions video but I still had some
thoughts on what this device offers as I
hope it's a continuing trend with other
manufacturers now I'm normally not the
biggest fan of large phones but what
Huawei is done here is impressive the
overall footprint nearly identical to
the LG v20 it's not too far off from a
pixel which has a significantly smaller
screen the 1080p display is mostly fine
for daily activity it's a bigger phone
so you're less likely to be holding it
closer to your face but as someone who
likes to keep text as small as possible
it just doesn't carry the same clarity
when I do move it closer also this pixel
pitch means it won't be the best option
for folks looking to play with some
virtual reality using an LCD means it
probably won't be daydream compatible
regardless that daydream compatibility
is kind of a shame because the Kiran
processor inside this thing is an
absolute screener
now this chipset gives up about 10% in
graphics benchmarks but on CPU dependent
tasks it usually bests what Qualcomm has
to offer we've already released our real
audio review for the mate and we're
working on the real camera review but
this shooter has proven a touch trickier
to use over the Huawei p9 like it seems
to have had more involvement in the
production of the system and it's an
ambitious set up but the intense number
of modes and options means it's taking
us longer to go through every
permutation of photo and video capture
there is some interesting technical
manipulation onboard like the hybrid
zoom where the phone uses a combo of
both sensors and over scans the image
the final output remains a 12 megapixel
image instead of being cropped down
smaller but then in other modes we might
not have access to certain features and
that takes some memorization to note
which settings you can control in which
modes our first week impressions are
overwhelmingly positive but this might
not be the best camera for casual full
auto shooter
the battery life has been terrific no
surprises there that when you put in a
bigger battery you get a longer-lasting
phone what is shocking figuratively
speaking it's always fast charging will
have real numbers for you in our full
review but this might be the only phone
available to truly give one plus his -
charging a run for its money
emu i5 is definitely a step in the right
direction getting us closer to a more
traditional Android experience the
ability to easily return the app drawer
but there are still some really annoying
design elements like the notification
shade we don't get icons at the top of
the screen we just get this little
number in a ticker with no way to really
know what notifications you have until
we pull the shade down we're really
hoping that's something which can be
adjusted in a future update lastly I
wanted to circle back to the packaging
smartphones are becoming a commodity
even at the high-end manufacturers
looking to improve the out-of-the-box
experience we've been very happy to see
a return to the complete phone
experience it's kind of silly but it's
nice to know that once you've spent
seven hundred euro on a phone you'll get
not only a charger and a cable but also
some headphones a pre-installed screen
guard and a plastic back cover after
reviewing the pixel we're hoping more
manufacturers follow always lead in
accessorizing a phone out of the box we
like seeing the basics covered for this
premium price point we've got more comin
soon folks the real camera review and a
showdown between the dual shooter on the
mate 9 how it stacks up against the
iPhone 7 plus so stay tuned it's going
to be brutal it's gonna be fun thanks so
