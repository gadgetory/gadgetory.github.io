the back of its new flagship smartphone
and we're here at CES 2016 to take a
look from Las Vegas it's michael fisher
with pocket now and this is a quick
hands-on with the Huawei mate 8 the mate
8 doesn't exactly represent a big leap
and industrial design but considering
how impressive the mate family's
Hardware has been thus far that's hardly
a problem the casing is bead blasted
aluminum with chamfered edges the
formalist square camera lens and
fingerprint scanner replaced with
rounded ones the camera is the 16
megapixel Sony IMX 298 backed up by OIS
a custom isp for faster focus and
processing and flanked on the front side
by an 8 megapixel selfie shooter which
you can trigger using the fingerprint
scanner as a shutter release fingerprint
recognition is very fast and quite
accurate in our show floor testing and
the six inch IPS display is colorful
though it's blacks could use some work
the phone is powered by a very large
4,000 milliamp hour battery and it feels
every inch the powerhouse with a
substantial 185 gram mass phablet is
kind of a meaningless word these days
but if you're going to call anything a
phablet this is it the software is
traditionally where Huawei has stumbled
over the years and the good news here is
that it's been thinned out some
animations are brief graphics are flat
and fairly restrained and the
combination of Android marshmallow and
emui 4.0 on the new Kirin 950 chipset
actually runs quite smoothly not
everyone will like the home screen
design whose rounded icons and spotlight
like search shortcuts still feel
derivative of iOS but this isn't a skin
that'll make you run screaming either
where while way really goes over the top
is in these obscure gestures that
knocking on the screen knuckle dragging
to take screenshots the double knock to
capture video the two knuckle tap to
crop video there's nothing wrong with
adding new interface touches but none of
these gestures are intuitive in the
slightest there's a substantial learning
curve fortunately Huawei distributed
review devices to most folks in
attendance so we'll be going deeper with
the may date in the days ahead in
particular we're looking forward to
testing the steerable microphones in
speakerphone mode scenario detection and
the
camera and the various shortcuts that
can be assigned to the fingerprint
sensor m88 isn't scheduled to hit us
shores at all but even at 600 or 700
euro unlocked depending on storage
there's plenty here to pique the
interest of the importer enthusiasts so
stay tuned for our full review coming
soon at pocket now till next time this
has been michael fisher with high auto
Houston behind the camera stay tuned for
much more from CES 2016 both here on
YouTube and at pocketnow.com thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
