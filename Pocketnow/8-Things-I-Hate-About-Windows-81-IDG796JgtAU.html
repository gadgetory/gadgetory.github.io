system from Microsoft that's designed to
appease and improve upon some of the
criticisms that last year's windows 8
was met with there are many changes in
Windows 8.1 some of them you'll love and
some of them you might hate this is adam
lane for clocking out and in this video
i'm going to talk about the 8 things i
hate about windows 8.1 but be sure to
also check out the 8 things I love about
Windows 8.1 number one having to choose
which window pane to launch apps into
with Windows 8 it was very predictable
that when you tapped a new app on the
Start screen it would open in the larger
window pane area right away now with the
windows 8.1 a thumbnail I kind of your
app appears on the border of a
windowpane edge and then tilts back and
forth that's supposed to indicate to you
they have to choose where it should load
and you touch the side that you wanted
to go to optionally you can push the
icon to the top to load it fullscreen
number two the Photos app this has been
completely changed from the windows 8
version and mostly it's worse no longer
does it show photo albums from Facebook
or Flickr accounts nor does it allow you
to browse photo libraries found on any
of your other pcs associated with your
Microsoft ID basically you can only look
at your local and SkyDrive photos now
what's worse is that all the thumbnails
crop the actual images so that you can't
see the important parts everything is
cropped to a horizontal rectangle around
the center of the image that means for
portrait photos all you can see is the
person's chest you can't see their
facial expression because it's cropped
number three the messaging app is gone
windows 8 came with an app called
messaging which was a great place to
manage all of your instant messaging
threads between Facebook and live
messenger chats it looked like it could
even be expanded to sports skype and
google chat actually if you go to
outlook.com the web based messaging pain
there does support live mr. google chat
facebook chat and skype all at the same
time it's really pretty nice too bad
that's not on Windows 8.1 number for the
calendar app doesn't work with exchange
2003 anymore Microsoft seems to have
problems supporting its own products as
well as its
editor's sometimes in Windows 8.1 the
calendar app will download data from an
exchange 2003 account but it can't edit
it or add to it luckily I've worked with
the developers and a fix for this should
be coming any day now number 5 the
People app no longer shows who's online
since the instant messaging integration
was dropped there's no central location
to see all of your friends that are
online and available to chat instead you
need separate apps and keep track of
them separately so big step backwards
number 6 if you're in desktop mode and
you want to send a file from the file
explorer via email normally you could
right click the file and choose send to
mail recipient that should open a new
mail message with these selective files
attached it doesn't work with Windows
8.1 email program though you get an
error message instead number 7 the
calendar app doesn't open ical files and
doesn't integrate with facebook events I
often use and am invited to events on
facebook with Windows Phone these
invites show up write it in my calendar
and I can respond to them there it's
very nicely integrated on one is 8.1
there's no such luck in order to get
them to my exchange calendar I have to
export the events from the Facebook
webpage as ical files but they did not
open in the native calendar app so I
need to have outlook installed in order
to handle such a seemingly basic
function number II tasks in exchange
accounts don't sink there's actually no
interface included with Windows 8.1 for
managing tasks as part of your exchange
count you'll have to install the full
version of Outlook to get that yes that
means the iPad includes better support
for exchange server accounts than
Windows 8.1 does thanks for watching and
don't forget to also watch the 8 things
I love about Windows 8.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
