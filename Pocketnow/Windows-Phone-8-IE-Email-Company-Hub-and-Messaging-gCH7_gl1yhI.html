packing.com I'm going to show you
something new about Windows Phone 8
let's check it out alright in this video
we're gonna take a look at Internet
Explorer email the company hub and
messenger on Windows Phone 8 so right
now I'm in Internet Explorer 10 and
we're running an html5 test and we're
getting what around 60 frames per second
on the fish animation I can go back and
we can try another one and you can see
how smooth this is so let's look at some
of the new options we have customization
options your settings we can do
obviously mobile version a desktop
version as the priority and we can
choose what the button next to the
address bar is going to do so you can
choose tabs stop refresh or favorites so
I'm gonna choose tabs and there you see
my tabs button and it shows a number of
tabs that are open so I really like that
being able to quickly switch to a
different tab and you can see scrolling
sometimes goes blank a little bit let's
try that maybe wasn't finished loading
there we go
see we good a little bit of performance
issues but consuming very very quick
now say you're looking at this page and
then you get home and you want to kind
of review it on a larger screen I'm
gonna hit the menu I'm gonna hit share
page and now I have Xbox so from there I
can just send this webpage to the Xbox
you know connected to a large screen and
there we go you can also do NFC
transfers of course there's email
messaging and social networks and you
get the usual sharing page now let's
look at some emails here's my email live
tile here you can see a preview of one
of the new messages and from here we see
it conforms to the theme now I can
choose not to do that if I want I can
use a light background and when I read
them it oddly goes back to a white
background anyway and multiple languages
work just fine but here's a cool new
feature if I'm in the body of an email I
have a speech button how are you doing
what's new how are you doing with sniff
what's new
voice-recognition not always perfect but
there you go it's there next up let's
look at a sample company hub now
Microsoft sent this to us as a reviewers
to try out and as well as so that they
could send us some pre-release apps
without having to publish them in the
marketplace so that's a pretty cool way
to share company apps that you really
don't want to be public and here is a
fake company hub that Microsoft made for
us and there's our app listing that can
just tap to install whichever ones I
want see most of them are installed
already it's just a sample of you know
what kind of company hub somebody might
want to put together there's some news
there's some alerts none of that is real
but you can see how it works so that's a
pretty neat feature a lot of businesses
are probably gonna like that and lastly
let's look at the messaging there's a
couple little updates we still have the
Facebook and Windows Live Messenger chat
fully integrated and we can also now
attach some new things so here's our
attachments I can do picture and video
just like tango but now I can do my
location so that's going to add an app
and when people get it they'll get a
link to a little web page with the
location is showing you can also attach
contacts now if you want to send
somebody contact information so there
you have a quick look at Internet
Explorer the email program a company hub
sample and the new messenger on Windows
Phone 8 be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
