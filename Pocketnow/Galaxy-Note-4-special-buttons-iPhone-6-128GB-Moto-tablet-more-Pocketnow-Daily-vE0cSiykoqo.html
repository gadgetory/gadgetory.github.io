might include a smart camera button new
leaks of the iphone 6 talk about storage
options and made as a point and Motorola
seems ready to flood your stores with
smartphones and tablets I'm hi Natalie
that and raise your hands how many of
you actually ended up getting a stick
yesterday this is parking out daily
let's begin today with what's official
and sort of underwhelming any of you
remember the barnes and noble nook the
design was cool but it ended up dying
and so did its successors and as it
turns out the company ended up
partnering with samsung in order to
bring us the samsung galaxy tab or nook
which is actually a samsung galaxy tab
for seven point no only focused on the
nook and you get the options for the
books and a couple of things here and
there the price tag is actually not that
bad leaks to the scripture for full
details and watch michael fisher full
coverage of this even though it as an
old tablet another interesting news
today there was a recent comparison
between the HTC One m8 for Windows and
the HTC One m8 for Android and my god
battery comparisons are amazing if you
think that Windows Phone needs a lot of
horsepower you're wrong I mean the
battery life on the One m8 for Windows
last 21 hours of active use compared to
12 hours on the Android barend and trust
me I use the one I made for Android and
I know that battery could be better but
man it is incredible to get 21 hours
that's how power efficient when those
phone is and it's great to see and we're
talking about the same battery same
hardware same everything now let's rball
motorola and we're talking about
Lenovo's motorola you know that company
that builds a lot of smartphones in
china but we rarely see in the united
states except for computers turns out
that the company strategy might be to
flood us with smartphones and tablets or
whatever that the company is working
with as many as three different tablets
and eight different smartphone variants
from motorola tour launch sometime
within the end of the year in early next
year we don't have any specific details
but there are some names but the list is
so big that it's obviously hard to
memorize so link to the description read
the full articles from steven with all
the details up next we've got some
interesting rumors of the galaxy note 4
aside from the fact that the company is
working on this
metal chassis that will apparently look
a lot like what we see on the Galaxy
alpha it seems that this metallic
chassis will have something very
interesting on its side it's not really
a camera button there's this really
interesting sight touch functionality
where there's apparently either a
capacitive button or a sensor or
something that will allow the phone to
detect you want to take a photo and it
will work as a shutter button it's hard
to understand how this will work
obviously until we get the phone but
it's great to see that will finally get
something from the galaxy lineup that's
something we've not seen anywhere else
this is actually a very cool idea let's
see how it works obviously we will be
covering everything at Eva 2014 where
this phone will be launched and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
let's talk about the iphone 6 and 2
different rumors number one the iphone 6
in its 5.5 inch Varian we've got the
rear shell in a leaked photo and the
reason why this is interesting is
because the only rear shells that we've
seen ur of the 4.7 inch model so it's
great that we finally see that yet they
are identical but even more interesting
there are some leaks from geek bar that
mentioned the storage options and it's
actually conflicting as we've got a 16
gig variance which is extremely
disappointing and then there are no 32
gig variants mentioned apparently just
the 64 gigs and 128 gigs and even though
we don't have any pricing we know there
are some manufacturers being mentioned
sandesh toshiba other manufacturers for
this but that leads me to the question
of the day what is the minimum amount of
storage that you can survive with if you
would not have expandable storage on
your phone because in my case my god I
don't know how people do with 8 or 16
gigs I can't do it even 64 gigs becomes
a challenge for me but leave us a
comment down below and don't forget the
first link in the description with our
black phone giveaway which is still
active friends es you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video is so mushy follow us on
talking out comment subscribe to a tube
channel as well you'll also follow me on
Twitter hi my underscore any better
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hi Marilee
better thank you very much for watching
we'll see it's money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
