pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to talk about the celio red fly
vs. netbook question that we've been
trying to answer throughout the recent
most videos that we've posted on the
pocketnow.com video channel for those of
you that don't know the see Leo red fly
was released a few years ago a sort of a
windows mobile terminal so the idea is
that you could plug in any windows
mobile device or or most of them at
least whether it's touchscreen or non
touch screen and you suddenly get a
large screen with your device a keyboard
that's much bigger than the one that you
get on your device if it has a keyboard
and you get a full mouse pointer you
also get the capability to charge your
device while it is plugged into the to
the red fly or you could connect via
bluetooth if you want to have a wireless
connection now the problem with the red
fly has always been cost when it came
out a few years ago it was five or six
hundred dollars and people who had just
paid five or six hundred dollars for a
windows mobile smartphone thought why
would i pay that amount again for a
mobile companion when I could just buy
you know a laptop for seven or eight
hundred dollars it just it just didn't
make sense the value proposition wasn't
there in most situations and so silly
you knows this and they've lowered the
price many times to the point where
right now the higher end model is 250
this is the CA 10 or the c7 with a
smaller screen and some lower
capabilities is 200 but then Along Came
netbooks and the whole equation kind of
changed because for the same price 200
or 250 dollars you can get a full
fledged windows XP machine that will run
the full version of microsoft office it
could run a lot of major programs do a
web applications with ease and the red
fly is just going off of your phone
which really doesn't have all of these
capabilities it has some of the
capabilities that a full-fledged netbook
does so then the question becomes if
you're looking for a mobile companion
should you go netbook or should you go
red fly well here is here's what I think
in some situations the red flag makes a
lot of sense for example the the
business world let's say you run an
organization
100 employees you've recently deployed
windows mobile devices to everyone in
your organization so that they can stay
connected with email be productive that
sort of thing and you're thinking about
issuing everybody some sort of mobile
laptop netbook read flood because you
want them to be able to be even more
productive on the road well think about
it if you buy everybody a netbook you
have to buy a copy of microsoft office
for all of those computers which raises
the price significantly in addition you
have to pay for other software that you
may need to run on the netbook if you
get everyone a red fly people are just
going to use the software that comes on
their phone so if it's a windows mobile
device you have Office Mobile you have
opera mobile for web browsing or skyfire
for flash-based for web browsing with
flash and also the cost of ownership on
the whole for the corporation is lower
because you don't have to have a
separate IT guy to manage the laptops or
the netbooks which take more upkeep
whereas with a red fly the only IT that
you need to do is with the phone because
it's connecting with the mobile device
but for the consumer for me and you
people that aren't necessarily in a big
corporate environment or own a huge
company does the red fly make sense not
at the current price point it does not
make sense and and see Leo is working
really hard to hit the magical price
point of ninety-nine dollars if you had
a red fly for ninety-nine dollars I
think it would then make sense to have
it hey you could have it in your glove
compartment you could have it in your
bag in your school bag if it's at if
it's at such a low cost um it really
really makes sense so that's pretty much
it for the netbook versus red flag
question hopefully we were able to
provide some insight into this issue for
you if you're considering getting a red
fly or getting a netbook be sure to
