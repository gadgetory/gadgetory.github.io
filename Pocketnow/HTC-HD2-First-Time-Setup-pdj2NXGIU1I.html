pocketnow.com and this is the first time
setup with the HTC hd2 I've yet to turn
it on for the very first time and to
start we have to remove the back battery
cover which is kind of difficult and
remove the piece of plastic that's
covering the battery so the idea here is
that you sort of lift up on the left
side it there it goes you feel like
you're gonna break it by the way this is
absolutely 100% metal it's it's real
brush metal not fake stuff and it looks
gorgeous so let's take out this little
piece of plastic and the battery is
about twelve hundred and fifty million
powers or so kind of small but we're
assuming the hd2 is really good battery
management so we're gonna put in the SIM
card there it goes put the battery in
and the battery cover back on right now
I have it plugged in so that it begins
charging immediately and see how this
goes snap it good
wow wow this screen is just so massive
even I'm already impressed and nothing's
happened yet
so let's see what happens when we go
through the first time setup process
quietly brilliant and there there is an
LED indicator light at the top there
which is good so you know if you have no
emails without actually having to turn
on your device so its first time setup I
just put in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM card and I'm
gonna click Next I just tap very lightly
to see how sensitive the screen was
looks like I have to tap a little bit
harder we're gonna compare screen
sensitivity to the iPhone coming up in
in future video so it's setting up for
AT&amp;amp;T in the United States learn how to
quickly and accurately enter text and
Moe so let's see what happens tap here
to start typing okay so here is the
walkthrough we actually film this
walkthrough on an earlier ROM on an HD
or a Touch pro2 but we're gonna do it
again so it's just you get a little bit
of haptic feedback I have a feeling this
keyboard is going to be extremely easy
to use thanks to the very very large
width and height you have to work with
okay
next autocorrection a press and hold the
a key okay and we're gonna drag okay Oh
wants me to do something else
try that again and drag over to here
screen feels very nice tap the keyboard
icon to close would you like to play the
tutorial no I think I got it networks
detected don't want to connect right now
I don't want them to collect information
about where I am I'm going to agree to
that and I'm gonna do all of this later
so I'm gonna skip this and you can set
up social networks so you can link up
your YouTube or Twitter or Facebook I'll
do that stuff later as well let's just
see what happens next you can go to a
website to find out more finish and
let's see what happens after this Wow
we're dumped right into touchflo 3d I'm
gonna give you the first impression of
the capacitive scream and mess around
with it for a little bit okay it's it's
very sensitive it's it's very sensitive
it's definitely more sensitive than any
other HTC device that runs Windows
Mobile like the touch pro2 I'm taught
tapping very lightly right now it's
being very responsive and it's very
interesting to use a Windows mobile
device which has been on resistive
screens for the last 10 years it's a
very interesting experience but it seems
like it's working very well just want to
jump into an application real quick that
I am so used to in using let's go to
Office Mobile we're in mobile let's see
how fast this launches Wow that was
extremely fast thanks to the Snapdragon
processor I'm gonna try to type real
quick okay I'm doing something wrong
here let me try that again
Wow I'd say this keyboard may be easier
to use than the keyboard on the iPhone
we're have a lot more tests on keyboard
entry and a lot more covering the new
interface of HTC Sense coming up in
future reviews just wanted to show you
what the first time setup is like on ht2
we'll be back soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
