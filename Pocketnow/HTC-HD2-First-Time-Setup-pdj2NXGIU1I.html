pocket now calm and this is the first
time set up with the HTC hd2 I've yet to
turn it on for the very first time and
to start we have to remove the back
battery cover which is kind of difficult
and remove the piece of plastic that's
covering the battery so the idea here is
that you sort of lift up on the left
side it there it goes you feel like
you're going to break it by the way this
is absolutely one hundred percent metal
it's it's real brush metal not fake
stuff and it looks gorgeous so let's
take out this little piece of plastic
and the battery is about twelve hundred
and fifty million powers or so kind of
small but we're assuming the hd2 is
really good battery management so we're
gonna put in the sim card there it goes
put the battery in and the battery cover
back on right now I have it plugged in
so that begins charging immediately and
see how this goes snap it good wow wow
this screen is just so massive even I'm
already impressed and nothing's happened
yet so let's see what happens when we go
through the first time setup process
quietly brilliant and there there is an
LED indicator light at the top there
which is good so you know if you have no
emails without actually having to turn
on your device so its first time set up
I just put in my AT&amp;amp;T sim card and I'm
going to click Next I just tapped very
lightly to see how sensitive the screen
was looks like i have to tap a little
bit harder we're going to compare screen
sensitivity to the iphone coming up in a
future video so it's setting up for 18
in the united states learn how to
quickly and accurately enter text and
low so let's see what happens tap here
to start typing okay so here is the
walkthrough we actually film this
walkthrough on an earlier rahman an HD
or a touch pro 2 but we're going to do
it again so it's just you get a little
bit of haptic feedback I have a feeling
this keyboard is going to be extremely
easy to use thanks to the very very
large width and height you have to work
with okay
next auto correction a press and hold
the a key okay and we're going to drag
okay Oh wants me to do something else
try that again drag over to here screen
feels very nice tap the keyboard icon to
close would you like to play the
tutorial no I think I got it networks
detected don't want to connect right now
I don't want them to collect information
about where I am I'm going to agree to
that and I'm going to do all of this
later so I'm going to skip this and you
can set up social networks so you can
link up your YouTube or Twitter or
Facebook I'll do that stuff later as
well let's just see what happens next
you can go to a website to find out more
finish and let's see what happens after
this wow we're dumped right into
touchflo 3d I'm going to give you the
first impression of the capacitive
screen and mess around with it for a
little bit okay it's it's very sensitive
it's very sensitive it's definitely more
sensitive than any other HTC device that
runs windows mobile like the touch pro 2
i'm taught tapping very lightly right
now it's being very responsive and it's
very interesting to use a windows mobile
device which has been on resistive
screens for the last 10 years so it's a
very interesting experience but it seems
like it's working very well just want to
jump into an application real quick that
I am so used to in using let's go to
office mobile word mobile let's see how
fast this launches wow that was
extremely fast thanks to the Snapdragon
processor I'm going to try to type real
quick okay I'm doing something wrong
here let me try that again Wow I'd say
this keyboard may be easier to use than
the keyboard on the iphone we're have a
lot more tests on keyboard entry and a
lot more covering the new interface of
HTC Sense coming up in future reviews
just wanted to show you what the first
time setup is like on the hd2 will be
back soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
