border so we go to edit we can change
some of the settings on here so let's
change some colors we'll just go down
here and we can add a filter so let's
choose this filter and if they want I
came to flip it horizontally or
vertically a rotator or not and I can
share it over anyone to be social and
photo networks path is a free
application of ill and app store it
allows you to share your entire life
through this ontological order so here I
can go down and I can view all the stuff
that I've added into my path account so
I cannot scroll up here and I can share
other things so belongs to share
something in terms of music colleges or

suggestions that I can add so let me
just click on here I can add that I can
say how is the music to get pretty good

linkie quest is a paid for game avail in
the App Store so what you want to do is
to use your little monkey here and you
want to pull back his bow and shoot one
of these arrows and have up to eight on
this particular level so let me shoot
here and we want to try to destroy all
these monkeys while collecting some of
the bananas so I was able to get two
bananas on that one let's try shooting
here and if I was able to get two more
bananas there or one banana I guess it
was and let me just try okay so I wasn't
able to get all the scorpions to die on
this particular level so I can always
try again system status is a white and
paid for application go to app store
lunch to view practically everything you
would need to know about your iOS device
so here it shows my battery status and I
can view my work time will show me how
long the device has been on and how much
time I have left to work with so I can
just go back to be my disk image and as
you can see we can see the CPU usage
will change and go to memory we can go
view our processors we knew all
the tasks that are running we can also
view details about this particular
device so right now I'm using the iPhone
4 crater balls it's a free game villain
App Store so the options the games just
shoot various balls into this basket
which moves up and down and the way that
you get more points is you have to get
them into the basket and if you miss as
you can see I got I missed that I only
have a couple of shots left before I
lose this level and literally just lost
then when these bombs come up you want
to avoid those like not touching the
clears one of the bombs as you can see
so we want to avoid that we don't want
to touch the screen and sometimes we'll
even get little balls with halos over
their head that give us more points and
more free shots so this has been another
