competitive and once prices start
climbing up to that premium tier we
demand a lot from our investments one
area which is often overlooked in tech
reviews is audio quality so let's do
something about that Huawei's p10 has
been accused of being somewhat iterative
quit over the p9 we see some great
improvements to processing power and
camera quality did audio get a similar
makeover well starting with speaker
quality this is a solid if uninspiring
performer it's loud enough for
notifications and alerts it's high
enough quality to watch a little video
do a little gaming but dull enough that
music is just okay
anymore we're pretty much at the limits
of what we should expect from a single
mono bottom firing speaker with the p10
falling just behind the LGG 6 to our
ears the headphone game is the real test
while we still have headphone jacks to
analyze plugging in and testing quality
the p10 doesn't show us much improvement
over earlier Huawei phones from mate 9
to p10 we see marginal improvements
scientifically close enough to be within
the margin of error for some of our
tests this is adequate to good
performance and against phones like the
recently released LG g6 which our North
American review unit does not have a
specialty quad deck we can see the p10
is posting mid-pack numbers with a
weaker and so where does that leave us
with the audio on the huawei p10 it's I
not great not terrible this phone
struggles to properly power nicer
headphones but most folks using included
earbuds will be decently served for
casual sound tracking watching some
videos or handling phone calls but
moving to Bluetooth might not be the
high-quality fix as we can't find any
documentation that this phone supports
aptX above that though it's an area we
sincerely hope to see while we improve
and soon at a price tear just below what
we expect from premium leaders like
Apple and Samsung the p10 struggles to
compete against the current crop of
nicer mid-range errs we get screaming
fast performance from this chipset but
our ears could benefit from a little
more pampering as always thanks so much
